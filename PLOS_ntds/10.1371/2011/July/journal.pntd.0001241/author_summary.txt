The global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis recommends 5 or more annual rounds of mass anti-filarial drug administration in order to reduce the reservoir of microfilaria to a level that will not sustain continuing transmission of infection by mosquitoes. We examined the incidence of acute filariasis morbidity defined by self-reported episodes of acute painful swelling of the extremities or scrotum in residents of communities in Papua New Guinea who participated in a 5-year mass drug administration trial. Acute morbidity events primarily affected the legs and arms, lasted less than 3 weeks, increased transiently following the first annual mass drug administration, and decreased progressively after repeated annual treatments. Risk factors for acute morbidity included pre-treatment microfilaremia and filarial antigenemia, pre-existing lymphatic pathology of the legs documented by physical examination, age older than 45 years and residence in communities where pre-treatment transmission intensity was relatively high. Results of our study indicate that mass administration of anti-filarial drugs has immediate clinical benefit to endemic communities in addition to future transmission cessation.
