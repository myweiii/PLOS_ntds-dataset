Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). Treatment relies on antimicrobial drugs, however many S. Typhi are multi-drug resistant (MDR), severely compromising treatment options. MDR typhoid is associated with multiple drug resistance genes, which can be transferred between S. Typhi and other bacteria via self-transmissible plasmids. We used sequence analysis to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these plasmids, and used high-resolution SNP typing to trace the subtypes (termed haplotypes) of both the S. Typhi bacteria and their MDR plasmids isolated from more than 450 typhoid patients since 1958. Among isolates collected before 1995, a variety of plasmid haplotypes and S. Typhi haplotypes were detected, indicating that MDR typhoid was caused by a diverse range of S. Typhi and MDR plasmids. In contrast, 98% of MDR S. Typhi samples isolated from 1995 were of the same S. Typhi haplotype and plasmid haplotype, indicating that the recent increase in rates of MDR typhoid is due to the global spread of a dominant S. Typhi-plasmid combination. We demonstrate this particular plasmid type contains a transposon encoding two transporter genes, enabling its S. Typhi host to grow in the presence of high salt concentrations.
