The authors want to specially acknowledge our energetic field workers, Joyce Bongo, Phyllis Mutemi and Nancy Halloway, for their dedication and meticulous anthropometric measurements and exercise test recording. We also thank the many DVBND laboratory technicians who provided parasitology results. We warmly thank the many children of Nganja, Milalani, Vuga, and Jego who willingly participated in the study. This work is dedicated to the memory of the late Dr. Michael C. Latham (1928â€“2011), a pioneer in the study of NTD-related nutritional diseases.
