Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, is a poverty-related disease threatening 350 million people throughout the world. Drugs currently available to treat this disease are toxic to the patient and drug-resistant parasites are emerging. New therapeutics are therefore needed. Fortunately, interest in confronting the treatment challenges has grown and new technology has led to an increase in high-throughput screens conducted against Leishmania. In order to gain insight into the most efficient screening strategy, we compared two methods, one targeting the easily cultured insect-infective promastigote stage of the parasite, and the other, targeting the clinically relevant but more difficult to culture intracellular amastigote stage. We show that while a screen against promastigotes is amenable to automation, it fails to recognize all active compounds. These compounds revealed only by an intracellular assay might act on host cell pathways important for parasite development. Targeting such pathways is an emerging strategy in drug discovery against infectious diseases.
