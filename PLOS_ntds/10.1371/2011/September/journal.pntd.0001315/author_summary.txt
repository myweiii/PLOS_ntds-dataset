Oropouche (ORO) virus is one of the few human pathogens in the Orthobunyavirus genus in the family Bunyaviridae. Phylogenetic analyses of ORO-like strains isolated from febrile patients in Iquitos, Peru, identified a novel ORO reassortant virus, which we named Iquitos (IQT) virus based on the location of the isolation of the virus. This novel pathogen was first isolated during 1999 from a 13-year-old boy who had an illness that included symptoms of fever, headache, eye pain, body pain, arthralgias, diarrhea, and chills. Subsequently, the virus was identified as the cause of outbreaks of “Oropouche fever” during 2005 and 2006 in Iquitos. Limited serological studies indicate that prior infection with ORO virus does not seem to protect against disease caused with the IQT virus infection. In summary, we identified a new Orthobunyavirus human pathogen in the Amazon region of Peru; these results highlight the need for strengthening surveillance activities and investigating the emergence of new pathogens in tropical regions of South America.
