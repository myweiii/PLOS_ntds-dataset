Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease that causes a large burden of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania that are transmitted by sandflies, leishmaniasis causes a wide spectrum of human disease. The severe end of the spectrum, visceral leishmaniasis, causes an annual mortality of approximately 50,000, largely in India and Sudan. Available therapies for leishmaniasis are problematic due to emerging drug resistance, toxicity and/or the need for lengthy courses of treatment. There is thus an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to this neglected tropical disease. To address this problem, the authors examined whether a commercially available drug developed for cancer therapy (Ontak), reported to have immunological activity of relevance to the immunobiology of Leishmania infection, exhibited efficacy in mouse models of leishmaniasis. The study found therapeutic efficacy for the drug alone in these models, as well as additive therapeutic efficacy in combination with standard antimicrobial therapy. Rational reinvestigation of the efficacy of already approved drugs in experimental models of neglected tropical diseases has promise in providing needed new candidates to the drug discovery pipeline.
