Dengue is an acute viral disease that affects tens of millions of people annually in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In some cases, this infection happens to be severe and even life threatening. Severe cases have been associated with higher levels of virus in the blood. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the occurrence of these cases notably by involving the patient's history of previous DEN virus infection(s). Little is known about the relationships between the evolution over time of virus levels in the blood, the clinical outcome and the previous infection(s) historyâ€”a better understanding of these features could help in anti-viral drug development. To analyze these relationships, we studied well characterized patients who participated in a clinical trial. The majority of these patients were infected by DENV-1 serotype and had higher levels of virus than those infected by DENV-2 and sometimes DENV-3 serotypes. We also found that patients with more severe symptoms had higher levels of virus in the first days of their illness. We found as well that the virus was cleared faster and earlier from the blood of patients previously infected. These findings are of major importance for further anti-viral drug testing.
