There is an urgent need for alternative diagnostic methods for scrub typhus, but evaluation of these is hampered because the current serological gold standard (IFA) is imperfect. In a study from Thailand, 3 of 20 (15%) patients with fever had a positive Orientia tsutsugamushi PCR result despite negative serology. These findings could reflect potential benefits of the PCR assay in detecting rickettsaemia before antibody responses set in and/or a diagnostic advantage in endemic areas with high background levels of antibody in the population. Serology is complicated by the heterogeneity of strains present in Southeast Asia, but high resource costs and training make realtime PCR assays impractical for many areas where scrub typhus is endemic. This is where the new LAMP methodology has potential: it is inexpensive, simple to perform and requires only a waterbath or simple heating block instead of a thermocycler. In the context of a prospective fever study in a scrub typhus-endemic area in Thailand, the results support the validity of LAMP methodology for the diagnosis of scrub typhus, highlight the difficulties in comparing antibody- with DNA-based methods and also contribute towards understanding the dynamics of bacteraemia in this under recognised and under studied disease.
