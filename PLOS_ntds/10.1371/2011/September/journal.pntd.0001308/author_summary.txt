Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by infection with either Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T.b.rhodesiense and is fatal if untreated. In the late stages of the disease the parasites enter the brain, producing severe neurological symptoms. The arsenical drug melarsoprol is the only treatment available for rhodesiense disease once it has reached the brain. Melarsoprol is very poorly soluble in water which severely limits its oral bioavailability. Currently melarsoprol is solubilised in propylene glycol which restricts its administration to the intravenous route and treatment schedules are protracted and extremely painful. Further, this formulation of melarsoprol is toxic and kills 5% of all treated patients through the induction of a severe post-treatment reactive encephalopathy. In this study we show that combining melarsoprol with cyclodextrin molecules increases the oral bioavailability of the drug. In a murine model of late stage HAT oral treatment regimens employing melarsoprol cyclodextrin inclusion complexes rapidly cleared parasites from the brain, restored blood-brain barrier function and reduced the severity of the neuropathological response induced by the infection. If complexed melarsoprol is equally efficacious in patients with HAT this would not only have significant positive socio-economic impact but also constitute a major therapeutic advance in the field.
