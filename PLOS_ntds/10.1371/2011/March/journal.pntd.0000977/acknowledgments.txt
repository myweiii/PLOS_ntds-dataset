We are grateful to the people who agreed to be study subjects in this study, attending every month, despite the inconvenience of extensive testing and repeated blood sampling. The staff at the TLM hospitals in Naini and Faizabad have been invaluable. We wish to thank the staff of the LEPRA offices in Hyderabad and Colchester and the TLM offices in Delhi and London for their administrative support. ManLAM and disaccharide conjugate of PGL was kindly provided by Prof. Patrick Brennan, Colorado State University (NIH, NIAID Contract NO1-AI-75320 and NO1-AI25469). We are especially indebted to the INFIR Steering Group, and to Dr V. Ramanathan, Dr U. Sengupta, Dr Shubhada Pandya, Professor W. Cairns Smith and Professor Warwick Britton, who have supported us with technical advice and encouragement.
