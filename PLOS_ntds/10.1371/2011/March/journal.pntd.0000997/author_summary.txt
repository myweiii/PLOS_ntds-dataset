Yunnan province is located in southwest China. Plague is still a huge threat to the health of local people in Yunnan where plague epidemics had the most serious impacts than other provinces in China. The risk of plague outbreak is driven by rodent and flea populations. Our research team is conducting a study to identify predictors for abundance of host and floor fleas in households of villages with endemic commensal rodent plague in Yunnan province. The results of this study will contribute to control host and floor flea populations, and therefore to prevent and control plague outbreaks in these areas.
