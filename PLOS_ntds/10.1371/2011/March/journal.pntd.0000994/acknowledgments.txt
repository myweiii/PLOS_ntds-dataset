We are grateful to the populations and the health committees who agreed to participate in the study and to use and distribute the ITMs. We thank the field research team for the many hours they spent with the communities and for conducting entomological and coverage surveys. We are indebted to the state vector control programme for including the distribution of the ITMs in their routine work and for sharing the data from the municipal level.
