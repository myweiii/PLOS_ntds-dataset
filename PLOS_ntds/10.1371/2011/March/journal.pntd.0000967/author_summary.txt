Dengue is estimated to affect 50 million people each year and can occur as explosive outbreaks that overwhelm health systems. Despite significant advances the available knowledge is not sufficient to predict the outcome of individual infections or the occurrence of epidemics. Studies from low dengue transmission settings are lacking but offer the potential to better understand the contribution of age, primary versus secondary infection and serotype because there are likely to be more adult and primary infection patients and fewer serotypes circulating compared to high transmission settings. This is the first reported study of clinical dengue in Ha Noi, the largest urban area of Northern Viet Nam. Records kept by the Preventive Medicine Center indicate that <2500 clinical dengue cases attended government health care facilities in Ha Noi each year from 1999 until 2007. Patients in Ha Noi were older than in high transmission settings, the contribution of primary infection to overt and severe illness was greater and associations between serotype, plasma viral RNA concentration and overt and severe illness were distinct. The dengue situation in Ha Noi provides an opportunity to further examine the roles of serotype and prior immunity in dengue severity and epidemic emergence.
