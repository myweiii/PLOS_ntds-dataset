Hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm are collectively known as soil-transmitted helminths. These worms are prevalent in most of the developing countries along with another parasitic infection called schistosomiasis. The tests commonly used to detect infection with these worms are less than 100% accurate. This leads to misclassification of infection status since these tests cannot always correctly indentify infection. We conducted an epidemiological study where such a test, the Kato-Katz technique, was used. In our study we tried to show how misclassification error can influence the association between soil-transmitted helminth infection and schistosomiasis in humans. We used a statistical technique to calculate epidemiological measures of association after correcting for the inaccuracy of the test. Our results show that there is a major difference between epidemiological measures of association before and after the correction of the inaccuracy of the test. After correction of the inaccuracy of the test, soil-transmitted helminth infection was found to be associated with increased risk of acquiring schistosomiasis. This has major public health implications since effective control of one worm can lead to reduction in the occurrence of another and help to reduce the overall burden of worm infection in affected regions.
