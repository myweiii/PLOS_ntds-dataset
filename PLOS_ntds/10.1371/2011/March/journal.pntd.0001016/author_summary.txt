Emerging information technologies, such as data management system software packages, can help disease control programs to better manage and analyze their data, and thus make it easier to carry out continuous surveillance, monitor interventions and evaluate control program performance. This will lead to better informed decisions and actions. We have developed a multi-disease data management system platform with current capacity for dengue and malaria that supports data entry, storage and query. It also allows for production of maps and both standardized and customized reports. The system includes only software components that can be distributed without the user having to pay licensing costs. It was designed so that the user can adapt many aspects of the system to suit local conditions (for example roles and permissions, user interfaces and display labels and which functionality is included under a given disease) without having to involve software developers. In conclusion, we have developed a system capable of aiding disease control programs in their task to reduce the burden of dengue and malaria, including the implementation of integrated vector management programs. The next steps include operational implementations and evaluations of the current system with capacity for dengue and malaria, and the inclusion in the system platform of other important vector-borne diseases.
