Repeated episodes of C. trachomatis infection lead to active
                    trachoma clinically characterised by an often intense inflammatory response to
                    chlamydial antigens with later scarring and distortion of the eyelid leading to
                    blindness. However, the clinical signs of trachoma do not correlate well with
                    laboratory tests to detect the presence of Chlamydia. The WHO simplified
                    clinical grading scheme currently used for assessment of trachoma has a poor
                    correlation with C. trachomatis genomic test findings, even
                    though the detection of bacterial genome is strongly correlated with the
                    prevalence and severity of active trachoma. A detailed assessment of the
                    clinical signs using a finer grading system was studied in a population-based
                    survey in five Australian Aboriginal communities. Much clinical activity and
                    infection was found in those with clinical signs below the threshold used in the
                    current WHO grading scheme. Future studies of the distribution of infection and
                    pathogenesis should use finer grading methods than the current WHO scheme. The
                    prevalence of trachoma in these communities confirms that trachoma remains of
                    public health importance and sustained interventions to control trachoma are
                    warranted.
