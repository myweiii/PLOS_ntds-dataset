Dengue is a potentially lethal infection that impacts millions of humans
                    annually. This disease is caused by viruses transmitted by infected female
                        Aedes aegypti mosquitoes during blood feeding. No
                    commercial vaccine or treatment is available for dengue infection. One way to
                    break the disease transmission cycle is to develop new tools to reduce dengue
                    vector populations. Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) produced in the reproductive
                    glands of male mosquitoes and transferred to females in the ejaculate during
                    mating could be the target of such a tool. In related insects, Sfps modulate
                    female reproduction and feeding patterns. Here we report 145 proteins that are
                    transferred to females in the Ae. aegypti ejaculate. The
                    proteins, which include Sfps and sperm proteins, fall into biochemical classes
                    that suggest important potential roles in mated females. Of particular interest
                    are proteins that could play roles in fertility and hormonal activity (including
                    pathways involved in egg development and utilization of the blood meal). Our
                    results lay important groundwork for new control strategies by identifying
                    candidate proteins that may alter the reproductive biology or blood-feeding
                    patterns of female Ae. aegypti and ultimately reduce the global
                    burden of dengue.
