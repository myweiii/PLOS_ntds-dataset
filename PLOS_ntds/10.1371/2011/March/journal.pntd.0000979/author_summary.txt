The costs of conducting population-based prevalence surveys for neglected tropical diseases such as trachoma are often cited as a reason that program managers do not conduct baseline or impact assessments when guidelines suggest they are warranted. The authors conducted a review of actual costs incurred during the implementation of 165 district level surveys in 8 national trachoma control programs to identify the median and mean costs per district and per cluster. In addition, the costs of the principal activities that are the most expensive were measured. The data show that field work is the most expensive activity for a prevalence survey, with personnel (per diems, allowances and accommodation) and transport costs driving the total cost of the survey. These findings can be used by program managers to budget for population-based prevalence surveys that are recommended for baseline and evaluation surveys, and periodic uptake surveys for neglected tropical diseases such as trachoma.
