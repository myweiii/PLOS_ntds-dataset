Soil-transmitted helminths (roundworms, whipworms and hookworms) infect millions
                    of children in (sub)tropical countries, resulting in malnutrition, growth
                    stunting, intellectual retardation and cognitive deficits. Currently, there is a
                    need to closely monitor anthelmintic drug efficacy and to develop standard
                    operating procedures, as highlighted in a World Health Organization–World
                    Bank meeting on “Monitoring of Drug Efficacy in Large Scale Treatment
                    Programs for Human Helminthiasis” in Washington DC at the end of 2007.
                    Therefore, we have evaluated the efficacy of a commonly used treatment against
                    these parasitic infections in school children in Africa, Asia and South-America
                    using a standardized protocol. In addition, different statistical approaches to
                    analyzing the data were evaluated in order to develop standardized procedures
                    for data analysis. The results demonstrate that the applied treatment was highly
                    efficacious against round- and hookworms, but not against whipworms. However,
                    there was large variation in efficacy across the different trials which warrants
                    further attention. This study also provides new insights into the statistical
                    analysis of efficacy data, which should be considered in future monitoring and
                    evaluation studies of large scale anthelmintic treatment programs. Finally, our
                    findings emphasize the need to update the World Health Organization recommended
                    efficacy threshold for the treatment of STH.
