Chagas is a devastating disease affecting about 100 million people in Latin America. The drugs available for treatment against the causative agent, the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, have associated toxicity and are not completely effective against the chronic form of the disease, which is the most common presentation in the clinic. There is a great need for new drugs against this disease. Novel technologies in drug development are now being applied for the search of new compounds against Chagas. Taking advantage of a high throughput screening performed recently to identify compounds active against T. cruzi replication in host cells in vitro, we have selected 23 compounds, which have been re-tested to selected active ones. We have also adapted a transgenic T. cruzi expressing luciferase, which allows for direct visualization when mice are infected. These parasites have been used to establish a model for acute Chagas disease useful for drug testing in mice. Using this method, we have tested the activity of the selected compounds and found two compounds with strong anti-T. cruzi activity in mice.
