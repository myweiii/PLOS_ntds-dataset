The mitochondrion and its related organelles are ubiquitous in all extant eukaryotic cells. The mitochondria are believed to have originated from the endosymbiosis of α-proteobacteria in an ancestral eukaryote, and show diverse structures, contents, and functions. Evolution and diversification of mitochondrion-related organelles remains one of the central themes in biology. Entamoeba histolytica, which causes intestinal and extraintestinal amebiasis in humans, possesses a highly divergent form of mitochondrion-related organelles, named “mitosomes.” Previously, we demonstrated that sulfate activation is the major function of mitosomes in E. histolytica. As the sulfate activation pathway was discovered only in the cytoplasm and plastids in other eukaryotic organisms, its compartmentalization to mitosomes is unprecedented. In this study, we showed that this pathway is important for sulfolipid synthesis and cell proliferation in E. histolytica. Together, we infer that E. histolytica mitosomes are not just rudimentary or residual mitochondria, but important for proliferation of E. histolytica. Thus, E. histolytica represents a useful model to understand evolutionary constraints of mitochondrion-related organelles in eukaryotes.
