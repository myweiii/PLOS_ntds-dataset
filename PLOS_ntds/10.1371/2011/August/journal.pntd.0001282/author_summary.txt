Dengue is a potentially serious common viral infection with no specific treatment. Plasma leakage from small blood vessels is the major severe problem, but we do not understand how this occurs. Techniques using controlled infusions of carbohydrate solutions, combined with careful measurement of the rate that the different-sized molecules clear from the circulation, have been successfully used to investigate leakage in other situations. We performed carbohydrate clearance studies in 15 Vietnamese adult males with dengue and plasma leakage, comparing results obtained during the acute illness with recovery values, and results from a group of healthy volunteers. However, we found no differences between any of the clearance profiles measured. One possible explanation may be that the carbohydrate molecules interact with blood vessels, temporarily restoring their normal barrier function. Although this means that the technique is unsuitable for investigating leakage in dengue patients, the implications for management of patients with severe leakage resulting in shock are potentially important. Patients with profound shock are usually managed with intermittent large boluses of carbohydrate or similar solutions, sometimes causing severe side-effects; however if continuous low-dose infusions actually stabilized the permeability barrier, this might reduce the need for repeated boluses, thereby minimizing these adverse effects.
