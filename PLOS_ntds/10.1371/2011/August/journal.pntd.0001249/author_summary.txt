Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness is a fatal disease (if untreated) spread by bloodsucking tsetse flies. Trypanosome parasites first enter the blood and lymph and eventually invade the brain. In rural clinical settings, diagnosis still relies on the detection of these microbes in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by microscopy. LAMP, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA, is a technique that can specifically detect very small amounts of DNA from an organism. It is similar to PCR, the polymerase chain reaction, another DNA amplification technique widely used for diagnosis of infectious diseases. LAMP's advantages are that the reaction works at one temperature, whereas PCR needs a thermocycler, and LAMP is not affected by blood components that inhibit PCR. We show that by simply adding detergent during sample preparation, the analytical sensitivity of LAMP targeting many gene copies is greatly improved, presumably because DNA is released from the pathogen cells and dispersed through the sample. To demonstrate proof of principle, we used pathogenic trypanosomes in different human body fluids (CSF or blood), but this simple modification should be applicable for diagnosis of other microbial infections where cells are sensitive to detergent lysis.
