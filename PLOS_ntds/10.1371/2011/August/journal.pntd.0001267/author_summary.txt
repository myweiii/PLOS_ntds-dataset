Globally, dengue fever has become the most common clinically significant mosquito-transmitted viral illness. Dengue viruses exist as four serotypes, and increasingly several serotypes co-circulate in the same region. Infection with one serotype increases the risk of severe illness following infection with a second serotype. Therefore, any dengue virus vaccine needs to protect against all four serotypes. We and others are working to develop a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine that contains four monovalent vaccine viruses. Since two or more doses of such a vaccine are thought to be necessary for induction of long-lasting protective immunity, a feasible dose interval needs to be determined. Here, boosting with a second dose of a monovalent dengue type 1 (DENV-1) vaccine at four months or six months was compared in flavivirus-na√Øve healthy adult subjects with regard to safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity. We found that both doses of the vaccine were safe and well tolerated. While the first dose infected 92% of recipients, the second dose was neither infectious nor immunogenic, irrespective of the dose interval. These findings indicate that in most subjects, a single dose of this monovalent vaccine confers sterilizing humoral immunity against a second dose for at least six months.
