Chagas disease, produced by the blood parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is considered a public health problem in Central and South America. Non sterile immunity can be achieved after acute infection. Parasite persistence can induce tissue damage in nearly 20% to 30% of chronically infected individuals. Indeed, chagasic cardiomyopathy is one of the consequences of the chronic infection. Antigen persistence and dysfunctional cellular immune response have been implicated in T. cruzi pathogenesis. Here, a higher frequency of circulating CD4+/CD8+ double positive T cells in chronic chagasic patients is reported as compared with non infected donors, including those with a non-chagasic cardiomyopathy. This cell subset also expressed more activation markers and stored more intracellular perforin. We have previously reported that CD8+ T cells from T. cruzi infected donors recognized the HLA-A*0201 restricted K1-peptide derived from the KMP-11 protein. Here, double positive T cells displayed higher percentages of recognition for the K1 peptide than single CD8+ T cells. These cells produce little IFN-Î³, but display degranulation activity that was increased in the symptomatic group. Finally, double positive T cells can be localized in the heart tissue from a chronic chagasic donor.
