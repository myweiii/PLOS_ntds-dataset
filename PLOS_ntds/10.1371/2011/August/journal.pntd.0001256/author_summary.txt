Schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease, caused by agents of the genus Schistosoma afflicts more than 200 million people worldwide. Schistosomes could serve as an interesting model to explore gene regulation due to its evolutional position, complex life cycle and sexual dimorphism. We previously indicated that sncRNA profile in the parasite S. japonicum was developmentally regulated in hepatic and adult stages. In this study, we systematically investigated mircoRNA (miRNA) and endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) profile in this parasite in more detailed developmental stages (cercariae, lung-stage schistosomula, separated adult worms, and liver tissue-trapped eggs) using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. We observed that the ratio of miRNAs to endo-siRNAs was dynamically changed throughout different developmental stages of the parasite. MiRNAs were expressed dominantly in cercariae, while endo-siRNAs accumulated in adult female worms and hepatic eggs. We demonstrated that miRNAs were mostly derived from intergenic regions whereas siRNAs were mostly derived from transposable elements. We also annotated miRNAs and siRNAs with stage- and gender- biased expression. Our findings would facilitate to understand the gene regulation mechanism of this parasite and discover novel targets for anti-parasite drugs.
