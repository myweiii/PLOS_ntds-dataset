    "Background": "Infections with Strongyloides stercoralis and other helminths represent important, yet often neglected issues in developing countries. Indeed, strongyloidiasis can be fatal, but only a few studies provide information regarding its health relevance in Africa. Moreover, clinical data on symptomatology and typical recognition patterns mainly originate from Western travel clinics.",
    "Methodology": "A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was carried out in a rural part of south-central C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Stool samples from 292 randomly selected individuals were examined for intestinal helminths, using a suite of diagnostic techniques (i.e., Kato-Katz, Baermann funnel, and Koga agar plate). Participants were interviewed with a pre-tested questionnaire and clinically examined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to relate perceived morbidity and clinical findings to helminth infection status.",
    "Principal Findings": "The prevalence of hookworm and S. stercoralis was 51.0% and 12.7%, respectively. Both infections were strongly associated with each other (adjusted odds ratio, 6.73; P<0.001) and higher prevalences were observed with age. S. stercoralis-infected individuals expressed self-reported morbidity considerably more often than those with hookworm infection. Clinical examination identified high prevalences of various pathologies and detected tendencies to worse health conditions in helminth-infected subjects.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The use of multiple diagnostic tools showed that S. stercoralis and hookworm are co-endemic in rural C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and that each infection causes clinical symptoms and sequelae. Our findings are important for (re-)estimating the burden of helminth infections, and highlight the need for integrating epidemiological surveys, rigorous diagnostic approaches, and clinical assessments in the developing world."
