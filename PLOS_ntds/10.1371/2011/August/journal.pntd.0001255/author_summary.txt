Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health problem, especially in rural areas of tropical and sub-tropical countries. Little is known about the long term effects, and even less about the possible psychological effects, of snakebites and envenoming. We investigated the possible psychological impact of snakebite in 88 persons who had been envenomed 1 to 4 years ago in a rural agricultural area in Sri Lanka by using accepted measurements of psychological disability and group discussions among victims. 88 persons from the same areas who had not been bitten by a snake, but were of similar age, sex and occupation were also assessed in a similar manner. Compared to those who had not been bitten, snakebite victims had significantly more symptoms suggesting psychological disability, depression and post-traumatic stress. More than a fourth of those bitten claimed that the snakebite caused a negative change in their employment, and 10% had stopped working altogether. 17% claimed to have residual physical disability which they attributed to the bite, although no disability could be detected when they were examined. These findings indicate that snakebite results in ongoing psychological disability even 1 to 4 years after the episode, a complication that has not been previously reported.
