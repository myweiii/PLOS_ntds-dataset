In areas where parasitic worm infections have been successfully reduced as a result of deworming campaigns, the level of infections and drug efficacy must be carefully monitored. For this purpose, diagnostic methods with a high sensitivity are needed. We compared the accuracy of the widely used Kato-Katz method with the more recently developed FLOTAC technique for the diagnosis of parasitic worms. Our study was done with children on Zanzibar island, Tanzania, within the frame of an anthelmintic drug efficacy study. We collected stool samples from 343 children in two primary schools before and after treatment and examined the stool samples with both methods. FLOTAC showed a higher sensitivity than Kato-Katz for the diagnosis of roundworm and whipworm, but a lower sensitivity for hookworm diagnosis. The cure rates determined by FLOTAC were lower for roundworm and whipworm when compared with Kato-Katz. The opposite was found for hookworm. Egg reduction rates were generally lower when the FLOTAC technique was used. Our results suggest that the FLOTAC method, after additional optimization, can become a viable alternative to the Kato-Katz method for anthelmintic drug efficacy studies and for monitoring and evaluation of deworming programs.
