    "Introduction": "Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is a flagellate\n                protozoan that causes Chagas disease (CD). It is traditionally linked to rural areas\n                of continental Latin America, where it is transmitted by a variety of bug vectors.\n                In recent decades, the epidemiological pattern of this disease has undergone\n                considerable changes [1]. In the endemic countries of Latin America, the regional\n                Chagas programs are working to interrupt vector-borne and transfusional\n                transmission, to control congenital Chagas disease and to support initiatives aimed\n                at improving diagnosis, management and surveillance of the disease [2]. In non-endemic\n                countries that receive immigrants from Latin America or send tourists to endemic\n                areas, CD is an emerging disease and has become a public health problem because it\n                can be transmitted by non-vectorial mechanisms [3], [4].\nSpain is a major European host country for people from Latin America. According to\n                the Spanish National Institute of Statistics, in 2009 more than 1.8 million\n                immigrants from Latin America were registered, accounting for 3.85% of the\n                total population [5]. In recent years several studies of CD in non-endemic\n                countries [6]–[9] have focused in particular on non-vectorial transmission\n                mechanisms such as pregnancy and childbirth [10], [11], blood transfusion [12], [13] and organ\n                transplantation [14],\n                    [15].\n                However, when reviewing the literature we found little information on imported CD in\n                non-endemic countries at the primary care level [16], which is ideal for\n                screening the general population [17].\nThe clinical manifestations of chronic T. cruzi infection include\n                the latent form (the indeterminate chronic form), which occurs in 60% of\n                cases [18], the\n                cardiac form [19],\n                the digestive or cardiodigestive form, and sudden death [20]. Therefore, many diagnoses of CD\n                are based on epidemiological suspicion rather than clinical signs and symptoms.\nThe objectives of the present study were (1) to assess the prevalence of\n                    Trypanosoma cruzi infection in the adult Latin American\n                population treated at a health center in Barcelona, Spain; (2) to analyze the\n                clinical phase of the disease; and (3) to determine whether screening for imported\n                CD in primary care should be recommended.",
    "Methods": "Study design and scope\nWe performed an observational, cross-sectional prevalence study at the health\n                    center of the Clot district, Barcelona. This center serves a population of 25442\n                    people, with a total foreign population of 13.5% and a Latin American\n                    population of 6.3% (according to the 2008 census of the Barcelona City\n                    Council) [21].\n                    The staffs participating in the study were 14 general practitioners, 13 nurses,\n                    1 gynecologist and 1 midwife.\n\n\nEthical conduct\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Jordi Gol\n                    Institute for Research in Primary Care of the Institut Català de\n                        la Salut (Catalan Health Institute).\nWritten informed consent was requested from all participants. When participants\n                    were children, their parents/guardians provided informed consent.\n\n\nPatients\nDuring the period October 2007 to October 2009, all patients from continental\n                    Latin America under 14 years of age who presented at the health center for any\n                    health reason were invited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed\n                    consent, we collected clinical and epidemiological data.\nWe ascertained the reasons why the patients visited their doctor/nurse by\n                    reviewing the electronic patient charts. On a patient's first visit to a\n                    primary care centre the Preventive Activities and Health Promotion Program\n                    (PAPPS) is initiated [22], and at the Clot health center this program included\n                    CD screening of all persons originating from continental Latin America.\n\n\nSerological techniques\nSerological screening was performed with an immunochromatographic test (ICT) that\n                    uses recombinant antigens of T. cruzi (TcD, TcE, PEP-2 and\n                    SAPA) on whole blood collected by finger prick.\nIf the screening was positive, a venous blood sample was collected to confirm the\n                    diagnosis at the Parasitology Laboratory of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University\n                    of Barcelona. We used 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods: a\n                    conventional, in-house ELISA (cELISA) with whole T. cruzi\n                    epimastigote antigens [23] and a commercial kit with the recombinant antigens\n                    TcD, TcE, PEP-2 and TcLo1.2 (rELISA).\nIn accordance with international criteria established by the World Health\n                    Organization, sera that were reactive in two serological methods were considered\n                    positive [24].\n                    Positive results were confirmed by a third ELISA using T cruzi\n                    lysate (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) (oELISA). In a subsample of 101 patients we\n                    performed the ELISA serologies (cELISA and rELISA) regardless of the result of\n                    the ICT, in order to test the usefulness of this test in screening for CD in\n                    primary care [25].\n\n\nManagement of patients\nAll patients infected with T. cruzi were referred to the\n                    Tropical Medicine Unit of Hospital Clínic de Barcelona and clinically\n                    evaluated by a complete review of the epidemiologic history and consistent\n                    symptoms/signs, a general physical examination and an electrocardiogram. If the\n                    electrocardiogram was pathologic, it was assessed with an echocardiogram or\n                    24-hour Holter according to the disease detected. If symptoms consistent with\n                    gastrointestinal involvement were detected [26], an esophageal, gastric and\n                    duodenal transit assessment or a barium enema was performed. Benznidazole (5\n                    mg/kg/day for 60 days) was offered to all patients aged 18–50 years\n                    without advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy and no other contraindication for start\n                    benznidazole (pregnancy, severe renal or hepatic insufficiency [27]. None of them\n                    refused to start it.\n\n\nStatistical calculations\nThe sample size was calculated for an alpha level of 0.05 and a precision of\n                    ±0.05% in a bilateral comparison, assuming maximum uncertainty\n                    (50% prevalence); for a population of 1516 subjects [28] a random sample of 758 was\n                    necessary.\nThe programs SPSS version 17.0 and Epidat version 3.1 were used for the\n                    statistical analysis. The χ2 test was used to compare hypotheses of\n                    independence between two categorical variables and the Student\n                        t test for continuous variables. The confidence interval\n                    for all hypothesis comparisons was 95% and the tests were 2-tailed.",
    "Results": "A total of 766 persons from continental Latin America were included in the study. The\n                epidemiological data are presented in Table 1 and the countries of origin in Table 2.\nOf the 766 patients analyzed, 27 were reactive to the ICT and 20 of these were\n                reactive in cELISA, rELISA and oELISA. Also, 2 patients of the 101 tested by ICT,\n                cELISA, and rELISa regardless of the result of the first were reactive in cELISA and\n                rELISA. Both were also positive in oELISA, so they were considered positive.\nA total of 22 patients were diagnosed with CD, corresponding to a prevalence of\n                2.87% (95% CI, 1.6–4.12%) in the sample studied. Of\n                these, 21 were from Bolivia; the prevalence of CD in the subgroup of Bolivian\n                patients studied (n = 127) was 16.53% (95% CI,\n                9.6–23.39%). The remaining patient was from Paraguay.\nAll the patients infected by T. cruzi were in the chronic phase of\n                CD. The clinical form and the reasons why they visited the health center are\n                presented in Table 3. Four\n                patients (18.2%) had been previously diagnosed in the country of origin, but\n                none of them mentioned it in the primary care visit because they thought it was a\n                health problem proper to their country that would be unknown to the Spanish health\n                staff (this information was obtained when they were asked for informed consent to\n                participate in the study). None of them were aware of their clinical phase and 2\n                patients had received incomplete treatment.",
    "Discussion": "The prevalence of T. cruzi infection in the sample studied was\n                2.87% and in the subgroup of Bolivian patients it was 16.53%. In the\n                medical literature we found few studies of similar characteristics to ours\n                (involving screening of the adult Latin American population in primary care) and\n                their results varied [29], [12] due to the heterogeneity of the populations analyzed and\n                the distribution of CD in Latin America.\nThe laboratory confirmation of a clinical suspicion of CD is based on consistent\n                results of at least 2 different immunological tests [24]. ICTs are attractive in primary\n                care because they are easy to use in routine clinical practice and do not require\n                sophisticated facilities or specialized staff. In the substudy that we performed in\n                101 patients [25], for the ICT used we found a sensitivity of 92.5%\n                and a specificity of 96.8%. Other studies have evaluated the sensitivity and\n                specificity of ICTs [30], [31] with similar results. The current sensitivity of ICTs\n                must be increased so that they can be used as effective screening tests. Meanwhile,\n                they should be combined with other methods that offer greater sensitivity [25], [31].\nThe highest prevalence was found among Bolivian patients, in agreement with other\n                studies performed in Spain [9], [16] and other non-endemic countries [12], [32]. No cases were diagnosed among\n                the Peruvian or Ecuadorian patients, who formed 45% of the sample, probably\n                due to the heterogeneous distribution of CD in endemic countries and the lower\n                seroprevalence of T. cruzi estimated in Peru (0.69%) and\n                Ecuador (1.74%) [33].\nAn epidemiologic history of having lived in rural areas and/or adobe houses showed a\n                significant relationship with T. cruzi infection, consistent with\n                the dominant vector-borne transmission mechanism in the countries of origin. All\n                patients with T. cruzi infection had heard of CD in their countries\n                of origin and approximately 82% knew someone who was affected. These data\n                should be taken into account for establishing CD screening criteria in immigrants\n                from endemic zones, because mere knowledge of the disease may be considered as an\n                indirect indicator of its presence in the region of origin.\nIn non-endemic countries CD screening programs have been aimed at particularly\n                susceptible groups: in blood banks (France [34], the USA [35] and Spain [36]), and in\n                pregnant Latin American women and their neonates (the Spanish autonomous communities\n                of Catalonia [37] and Valencia [38]). In our study only\n                9.5% of the patients with T. cruzi infection had visited the\n                health center due to clinical symptoms suggestive of CD. As it is a silent disease\n                that has recently appeared in non-endemic countries, we stress the importance of\n                establishing in these countries health screening programs based on compatible\n                epidemiologic history among the general immigrant population from endemic areas.\n                These programs should be multidisciplinary [3], supported by the best\n                scientific evidence possible, and promoted by the health authorities.\nIn non-endemic countries, detecting persons infected by T. cruzi is important in\n                order to control the transmission (vertical, by transfusion, or by organ\n                transplant), reduce reactivations in immunodepressed persons, and delay the onset of\n                the chronic cardiac form through antiparasite treatment [39], all of which have a great\n                impact on the persons affected, on public health, and on health systems.\n                Nevertheless, the best solution for CD is a combination of treatment and prevention\n                in endemic countries [40], [41], where many programs and initiatives are underway [2], [42].\nThe data obtained in this study and the experiences described elsewhere [4], [12], [14], [16], [20], [27] suggest that it\n                is advisable to perform CD screening in non-endemic countries on all patients from\n                continental Latin America who: (1) have a suggestive epidemiologic history (having\n                lived in a rural area, in adobe houses or having knowledge of CD in the country of\n                origin), (2) are pregnant, (3) are immunosuppressed, (4) have symptoms suggestive of\n                CD, or (5) request screening."
