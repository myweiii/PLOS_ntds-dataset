Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan
                        Trypanosoma cruzi, and is becoming an emerging health
                    problem in non-endemic areas because of growing population movements. The
                    clinical manifestations of chronic T. cruzi infection include
                    the latent form (the indeterminate chronic form), the cardiac form, the
                    digestive or cardiodigestive form, and sudden death. Therefore, many diagnoses
                    of Chagas disease are based on epidemiological suspicion rather than on clinical
                    signs and symptoms. This study showed that the prevalence of Chagas disease in
                    Latin American patients attending at a health center in Barcelona is
                    2,87% and the highest prevalence was found among Bolivian patients
                    (16,53%). All the infected patients were in a chronic phase of Chagas
                    disease. Detection of T. cruziâ€“infected persons by
                    screening programs in non-endemic countries would control non-vectorial
                    transmission and would benefit the persons affected, public health and national
                    health systems. The data obtained in this study and the experiences described
                    elsewhere suggest that it is advisable to perform Chagas disease screening in
                    non-endemic countries on all patients from continental Latin America who:
                    (1)have a suggestive epidemiologic history, (2)are pregnant, (3)are
                    immunosuppressed, (4)have symptoms suggestive of Chagas disease, or (5)request
                    screening.
