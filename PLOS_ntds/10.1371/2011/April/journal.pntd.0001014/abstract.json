    "Background": "In 2006 there were an estimated 645,000 people in Amhara, Ethiopia, with trachomatous trichiasis (TT) who needed surgery. Despite an extensive integrated eye care worker training programme (IECW) and robust support for TT surgical services, productivity has not reached targets. We investigated why surgeon productivity was below target.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "Confidential interviews were conducted in person with TT surgeons trained from 24 selected districts in Amhara Region and their supervisors. Determinants of attrition and productivity were investigated. We interviewed 225 people who had received IECW training; 139 (59%) had subsequently changed career/job. Staff retention was associated with good road access to their health centre, mobile telephone network and a shorter time from initial training. Amongst the 94 IECW still working in the programme, the average number of patients operated was 41/year, which was mostly (86%) done through outreach campaigns and only 14% of cases were performed in the static facilities where they routinely worked. Spot checks were made of surgical instruments and consumables: only 3/94 IECW had the minimum instruments and consumables to perform surgery. The main barriers to operating were lack of time, shortage of consumables, lack of patients, lack of support and equipment problems. Very few IECW received ongoing supervision or active management.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Surgeon attrition rates are high. Vertical surgery campaigns were effective in treating large numbers of cases, whilst static-site service productivity was low. Good health system management is key to building a well-staffed and well-run service."
