    "Introduction": "The vast majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals with low and stable HTLV-1 proviral\n                load levels are clinically asymptomatic for life [1]. However, 1\u20133% of\n                subjects develop progressive neurological complications related to HTLV-1 infection,\n                classically denominated as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis\n                (HAM/TSP) [2],\n                    [3], [4]. The infection\n                can also lead to a debilitating malignancy, known as HTLV-1 associated adult T cell\n                leukemia (ATL) in approximately 2\u20135% of infected individuals [4], [5], [6], [7].\nThe immune response, and in particular the cellular immune response, plays an\n                important role in the control of HTLV-1 infection [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In vitro\n                studies further demonstrate that CD8+ T cell responses are able to\n                directly lyse HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells [9], [11], [13]. In patients with HAM/TSP,\n                    CD8+ T cells are capable of producing multi-cytokine responses\n                and are able to release cytotoxic molecules [14], [15]. Recent studies have selected\n                out patients with HLA-A*02 and HLA-Cw08 genes as being associated with lower\n                HTLV-1 proviral load and a reduced risk of progression to HAM/TSP [16], [17].\nWhile these data support an important protective role for the CD8+ T\n                cell immune response with the potential for viral control, other studies suggest\n                that HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells may paradoxically contribute to\n                the neuromuscular immunopathology through autoimmune mechanisms, leading to the\n                clinical manifestation of HAM/TSP [18]. Furthermore, patients with HAM/TSP also present with\n                high numbers of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CD8+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid\n                    [15], [19], [20], [21], [22] that are\n                thought to play a immunopathogenic role, either by release of neurotoxic cytokines,\n                such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 [23], [24], or by direct cytotoxicity. It is evident from these\n                studies that the precise role of CD8+ T cells in the control or\n                pathogenesis of HTLV-1 disease progression remain unclear. Further knowledge of the\n                mechanisms leading to T cell induced immunopathology in HTLV-1 infection will be\n                important in determining successful immune-based therapies and provide insights for\n                effective vaccine designs.\nDuring chronic viral infections, virus-specific CD8+ T cells undergo\n                an altered pattern of differentiation and can become exhausted [25], [26]. CD8+ T cell\n                exhaustion is a transcriptionally altered state of T cell differentiation distinct\n                from functional effector or memory CD8+ T cells [27].\n                    CD8+ T cell exhaustion leads to profound T cell dysfunction and\n                the inability of the T cells to control retroviral replication [28], [29], [30]. Conversely, downregulation\n                of exhaustion markers could lead to a highly functional population of T cells. T\n                cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3), is upregulated on\n                    CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infections [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36].\n                Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) is also known as another immune exhaustion\n                biomarker expressed in chronic viral infections [28], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. High levels of PD-1 and Tim-3 on\n                virus-specific T cells have been shown to lead to poor proliferative capacity and,\n                in some cases, ineffective Th1 cytokine production [29], [39], [44]. A sustained downregulation\n                of these receptors would lead to an exacerbated constitutively active T cell\n                population. The phenotypic profile of immune exhaustion markers on T cells is\n                unknown in seropositive HTLV-1 individuals. In this study, we show for the first\n                time that HTLV-1 associated complications may be related to the highly responsive\n                inflammatory Tax-specific T cells in HTLV-1-infected individuals. These results\n                support the idea that HTLV-1 infection induces mechanisms resulting in a limited T\n                cell exhaustion profile, leading potentially to neuro-immunopathology and disease\n                complications.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Ethics Statement\nThe research involving human participants reported in this study was approved by\n                    the institutional review board of the University of Sao Paulo (IRB #0855/08) Sao\n                    Paulo, Brazil. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects. All clinical\n                    investigation were conducted according to the principles expressed in the\n                    Declaration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html).\n\n\nHumans Subjects\nPatients were serially recruited in the HTLV-1 Outpatient Clinic at the\n                    University of Sao Paulo, Brazil in two stages with written informed consent\n                    approved by the University of Sao Paulo's Institutional Review Board\n                    (#0855/08). The diagnosis of HAM/TSP based on criteria outlined by the WHO [45] (Table 1). The majority of\n                    the patients were female (63%) with a median age of 48 (IQR: 22\u201366)\n                    years. We enrolled age and sex matched healthy uninfected volunteers without\n                    clinical and laboratory evidence of HTLV-1-associated disease, from the same\n                    demographics as the infected subjects. All HTLV -1 seropositive subjects tested\n                    negative for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV infections. No other inflammatory\n                    diseases or disorders were present in any of the participants. Blood samples\n                    were processed with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala,\n                    Sweden) gradient centrifugation, and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)\n                    were isolated and cyropreserved in fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing\n                    10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen.\n\n\nPentamers, Peptides and Cytokines\nConjugated Pentamers were obtained commercially from Proimmune (Oxford, UK). The\n                    HLA-A*02 restricted HTLV-1 Tax (LLFGYPVYV) and CMV (NLVPMVATV) peptides were\n                    obtained from New England Peptide (Gardner, MA). In some experiments rIL-2\n                    [80 IU/ml] (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and rIL-15 [50\n                    ng/ml] (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used during in\n                        vitro culture studies.\n\n\nFlow Cytometry Assessment\nCryopreserved PBMC were rapidly thawed in warm RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS,\n                    washed in FACS buffer (PBS, with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM EDTA\n                    (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)). For staining, 5\u00d7105 cells were\n                    incubated with conjugated antibodies against Tim-3 (R&D Systems,\n                    Minneapolis, MN), PD-1 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), CD4, CD8, CD3 (all from BD\n                    Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 30 min on ice. In some experiments, PMBC were\n                    then fixed and permeabilized prior to staining with conjugated anti-Tax (clone\n                    Lt-4) antibodies [46] or a control labeled IgG. Fluorescence minus one\n                    (FMO) samples were prepared for each fluorochrome to facilitate gating as well\n                    as conjugated isotype control antibodies. Anti-mouse IgG-coated beads were\n                    stained with each fluorochrome separately and used for software-based\n                    compensation. Analysis was performed using a FACSCanto instrument (BD\n                    Biosciences) and at least 100,000 events were collected and analyzed with FlowJo\n                    software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).\nTo define pentamer positive cells: staining was initially performed immediately\n                    after thawing with biotin-labeled HLA-A2 Tax or CMV epitope specific pentamer\n                    fluorotags followed a secondary staining step with fluorophore conjugated\n                    antibodies against CD8 (BD), Tim-3 (R&D Systems), PD-1 (Biolegend) and CD3\n                    (BD), and with labeled streptavidin. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing\n                    1% FBS, then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and run on a customized\n                    BD FACSCanto within 12 hours.\n\n\nViral Load Assessment\nHTLV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from PBMC using a commercial kit (Qiagen GmbH,\n                    Hilden Germany) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The\n                    extracted DNA was used as a template to amplify a fragment of 158 bp from the\n                    viral tax region using previously published primers[47]. The SYBR green\n                    real-time PCR assay was carried out in 25 \u00b5l PCR mixture containing\n                    10\u00d7 Tris (pH 8.3; Invitrogen, Brazil), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2\n                    \u00b5M of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, SYBR Green (18.75\n                    Units/r\u00d7n; Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME) and 1 unit of platinum Taq\n                    polymerase (Invitrogen, Brazil). The amplification was performed in the Bio-Rad\n                    iCycler iQ system using an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes,\n                    followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 57\u00b0C for 30 seconds and\n                    72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. The human housekeeping \u03b2 globin gene primers GH20\n                    and PC04[48]\n                    were used as an internal control calibrator. For each run, standard curves for\n                    the value of HTLV-1 tax were generated from MT-2 cells of log10\n                    dilutions (from 105 to 100 copies). The threshold cycle\n                    for each clinical sample was calculated by defining the point at which the\n                    fluorescence exceeded a threshold limit. Each sample was assayed in duplicate\n                    and the mean of the two values was considered as the copy number of the sample.\n                    The amount of HTLV-1 proviral load was calculated as follows: copy number of\n                    HTLV-1 (tax) per 1,000 cells \u200a=\u200a (copy number of HTLV-1\n                    tax)/(copy number of \u03b2 globin/2) \u00d71,000 cells. The method could detect\n                    1 copy per 103 PBMC.\n\n\nElispot Assays\nMAIPS4510 Elispot plates (Millipore, Danvers, MA) were coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3\n                    (10 \u00b5g/ml) (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) in PBS, 50 \u00b5l/well,\n                    either overnight at 4\u00b0C or for one hour at room temperature. After three\n                    washes with PBS, PBMC (1\u00d7105 cells/well) and the appropriate\n                    antigens were added (Tax peptide and CMV peptide), with a final volume of 200\n                    \u00b5l/well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for\n                    16\u201320 hours. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus\n                    0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), biotinylated anti-IFN-\u03b3 1 \u00b5g/ml)\n                    (Mabtech), antibodies were added to the appropriate wells in PBS 0.1%\n                    tween 1% BSA (PBSTB) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were\n                    washed again three times with PBST, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated\n                    streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was added (50 \u00b5l of\n                    1\u22361,000 dilution in PBSTB) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.\n                    Plates were washed in PBSTB, soaked for 1 hour in PBSTB and incubated with blue\n                    substrate (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) until spots were clearly visible, then\n                    rinsed with tap water. When plates were dry, spots were counted using an\n                    automated ELISPOT reader.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism statistical software\n                    (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Non-parametric statistical tests were used.\n                    The Mann-Whitney U was used for comparison tests and the Spearman rank test were\n                    used for correlation analyses.",
    "Results": "Subjects\nPeripheral venous blood was drawn from 22 HTLV-1 seropositive patients and 7\n                    HTLV-1 seronegative matched donors, all screened for the presence of\n                    HLA-A*02 alleles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were\n                    extracted and cryopreserved.\n\n\nTim-3 and PD-1 Expression on CD8+ and CD4+ T Cells in Patients with\n                    HTLV-1 Infection\nTim-3 and PD-1 are two cellular molecules expressed on T cells implicated in\n                    immune exhaustion. We evaluated the expression and co-expression of Tim-3 and\n                    PD-1 on T cells derived from HTLV-1 seropositive (both asymptomatic carriers and\n                    patients with the diagnosis of HAM/TSP) and seronegative controls to determine\n                    whether they were modulated in HTLV-1 infection. We observed a significant\n                    decrease in the frequency of Tim-3+ PD-1\u2212\n                    expressing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells among HTLV-1\n                    seropositive subjects (CD8+: median 8.01%, IQR\n                    5.42\u201310.50; CD4+: median 4.3%, IQR 3.50\u20135.99)\n                    compared to HTLV-1 seronegative controls (CD8+ median\n                    15.10%, IQR 10.50\u201317.60; CD4+: median 6.84%,\n                    IQR 5.74\u20137.85) (Figure 1A and\n                        B). Patients with HAM/TSP (red circles) had significantly lower\n                    levels of Tim-3+ PD-1\u2212 expressing\n                        CD8+ (p\u200a=\u200a0.002) and\n                        CD4+ (p\u200a=\u200a0.004) T cells compared to\n                    healthy uninfected controls (open circles). In contrast, the frequency of\n                        Tim-3\u2212 PD1+ T cells trended to an increase\n                    in subjects with HTLV-1 infection (CD8+: median 18.80%,\n                    IQR 10.42\u201324.90; CD4+: median 20.70%, IQR\n                    13.6\u201325.35) compared to healthy uninfected controls (CD8+:\n                    median 9.22%, IQR 8.97\u201315.50; CD4+: median\n                    13.60%, IQR 12.7\u201318.6) (Figure 1A and B). Only a few T cells\n                    co-expressed both Tim-3 and PD-1, and no differences were observed between\n                    uninfected subjects and those with HTLV-1 asymptomatic infection or HAM/TSP\n                    patients. Using linear regression analysis we observed no association between\n                    the frequency of Tim-3 or PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells in\n                    HTLV-1 infected subjects and proviral load.

Statistically significant differences are reported as\n                            p<0.05.\n\n\nDistribution of Tim-3 Expression on HTLV-1-Specific T Cells\nHLA- A*02 positive HTLV-1-infected patients have high amounts of circulating\n                        CD8+ T cells specific for an immunodominant HLA- A*02\n                    -restricted epitope, HTLV-1 Tax 11\u201319 [20], [49], [50]. In HAM/TSP patients, these\n                    HTLV-1's Tax-specific CD8+ T cells correlate with HTLV-1\n                    proviral load [23]. Among this cohort, we identified 15 HLA-A2 positive\n                    subjects (asymptomatic carriers, n\u200a=\u200a9 and HAM/TSP,\n                    n\u200a=\u200a6; Table\n                        1), and evaluated the Tim-3 and PD-1 receptor expression on\n                    Tax-specific CD8+ T cells. Eight patients had Tax-specific\n                        CD8+ T cells (median 2.45%, IQR 1.11\u20135.31) as\n                    determined by specific pentamers. Among these patients we also observed\n                    HLA-A*02 -restricted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells (median 2.49%, IQR\n                    1.87\u201311.37). Interestingly, Tim-3 levels were dramatically reduced on\n                        CD8+ Tax 11\u201319-specific T cells (median 24.77%,\n                    IQR 15.2\u201339.54) compared to the expression of PD-1 (median 48.06%,\n                    IQR 36.81\u201365) (Figure 2A,C\n                        and E). We also evaluated Tim-3 expression on HLA- A*02 CMV\n                    specific T cells and found a similar pattern of expression with Tim-3 levels\n                    reduced on CD8+ CMV-specific T cells (median 27.62%, IQR\n                    21.48\u201343.19) compared to PD-1 (median 47.70%, IQR\n                    40.45\u201351.16) (Figure 2B,D and\n                        F).\nPBMC from HLA-A*02+ chronically HTLV-1 infected individuals were\n                            stained with matched HLA pentamers presenting CMV and HTLV-1 epitopes,\n                            and with an anti-Tim-3 antibody. Shown are representative flow cytometry\n                            data from one HTLV-1-infected person using HLA-A*02 pentamers\n                            presenting the (A) HTLV-I-Tax 11\u201319 epitope and, (B) CMV-pp65\n                            epitope \u2018NLVPMVATV\u2019. (C, D) Plots show co-expression of\n                            Tim-3 (upper panel) and PD-1 (lower panel) with the respective\n                            HLA-A*02 pentamers (Tax (left) and CMVpp65 (right)) from the gated\n                            CD8+ T population depicted in Fig 2 A, B.

Statistical\n                            analyses comparing pooled responses were performed using the\n                            Mann-Whitney test.\n\n\nRelationship between the Functionality of Tax 11-19-Specific\n                        CD8+ T Cells and Tim-3 Levels\nTo determine whether there was an association with Tim-3 or PD-1 levels on Tax\n                    11\u201319-specific CD8+ T cells and their functionality, we\n                    evaluated the production of IFN-\u03b3 in response to the HLA-A*02-restricted\n                    Tax 11\u201319 immuno-dominant epitope and in comparison, the CMVpp65 epitope\n                    by an ELISPOT assay derived from PBMCs derived from 8 HLA- A*02 restricted\n                    infected individuals with Tax 11\u201319- and CMVpp65 specific\n                        CD8+ T cells (Figure 3). We saw no correlation between IFN-\u03b3 secretion and\n                    global PD-1 or Tim-3 expression on either the CD4+ or\n                        CD8+ T cells, irrespective of disease status (data not\n                    shown). The frequency of PD-1 expression on Tax-specific or CMV-specific\n                        CD8+ T cells also did not associate with the amount of\n                    IFN-\u03b3 secreted (r\u200a=\u200a0.1317;\n                    P\u200a=\u200a0.7520 and r\u200a=\u200a0.2245;\n                    P\u200a=\u200a0.594, respectively) (Figure 3B). However, we observed a\n                    statistically significant inverse correlation between the frequency of Tim-3 on\n                    both Tax-specific as well as CMV-specific CD8+ T cells and the\n                    amount of IFN-\u03b3 secreted (r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.8982;\n                    P\u200a=\u200a0.0046; r\u200a=\u200a0.9710;\n                    P\u200a=\u200a0.0028; Figure 3A).\nThe graphs show the association between the frequency of Tim-3 (A) and\n                            PD-1 (B) expression on HLA-A*02 restricted Tax11-19 or CMV pp65\n                            specific CD8+ T cells with the number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells\n                                (SFU/106) in response to Tax 11\u201319 peptide or the\n                            CMV pp65 epitope. The Spearman rank test was used for correlation\n                            analyses.\n\n\nCo-Expression of Tim-3 and Tax on T Cells in HTLV-1 Infected Cells\nTax expression marks HTLV-1 viral replication in both CD4+ and\n                        CD8+ infected T cells. We aimed to determine whether the\n                    downregulation of Tim-3 we had observed was occurring only among infected cells,\n                    or in bystander cells as well. We therefore co-stained for Tax and Tim-3\n                    expression on T cells from HTLV-1 infected subjects. We also stained for PD-1\n                    expression as a control. The culture of PBMC overnight did not alter Tim-3 or\n                    PD-1 expression levels on the HTLV-1-infected T cells (data not shown). We\n                    observed that Tax was expressed on PBMC from some subjects following 24 hours of\n                    culture and was detected on both Tim-3+ as well as\n                        Tim-3\u2212 CD4+ T cells (Figure 4A). Similarly, Tax was present on\n                    both PD-1+ and PD-1\u2212 T cells. We further\n                    identified a unique subset of Tax expressing CD4+ T cells that were\n                        Tim-3hi and lacked PD-1 in most of the subjects expressing Tax\n                        (Fig. 4A). No difference\n                    in the pattern of co-expression between HTLV-1 seropositive asymptomatic\n                    patients and those diagnosed with HAM/TSP was observed.\n(A) Plots demonstrate representative co-staining for Tax, PD-1 and Tim-3\n                            on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry following 24 hours\n                            incubation for the induction of Tax in two representative HTLV-1\n                            infected patients. An isotype control was used to delineate the\n                            measurements for Tax expression. (B, C) Plots and graph depict the\n                            co-expression of Tim-3 and PD-1 by the indicated cytokines after 12 hr\n                            in vitro culture of 1\u00d7106 PBMC from 4 HTLV-1 infected\n                            patients. A representative donor is shown in B.\n\n\nElevated Tim-3 Expression by IL-2 and IL-15 Stimulated T Cells from HTLV-1\n                    Infected Subjects\nAn increase in Tim-3 levels on T cells would potentially lead to a downregulation\n                    of T cell functionality. We therefore tested several gamma-chain associated\n                    cytokine mediators that could potentially modulate Tim-3 expression. We observed\n                    that IL-2, and especially IL-15, led to a prominent increase in the frequency of\n                    Tim-3 levels, specifically on the CD8+ T cell population after only 12\n                    hours in culture (Figure\n                        4B,C). No change in the levels of PD-1 expression were observed on\n                    both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Figure 4B,C).",
    "Discussion": "CD8+ T cell dysfunction and/or exhaustion are common features of many\n                chronic viral infections, including HIV-1 and HCV infections [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. The mechanisms of T cell\n                dysfunction are complex, but are in part mediated by a distinct set of inhibitory\n                receptors [27],\n                    [51]. A\n                high, and sustained, expression of Tim-3 and PD-1, have emerged as hallmarks of T\n                cell exhaustion in human viral infections, and blockade of these pathways can\n                reinvigorate immune responses during persisting viral infections [29], [30], [33], [34], [36]. In this\n                study, we report that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in\n                HTLV-1 infection express lower levels of Tim-3, and this was more pronounced in\n                patients with HAM/TSP. Phenotypically, we observed that Tax HTLV-1-specific,\n                HLA-A*02 -restricted CD8+ T cells consistently retain a lower\n                frequency of Tim-3. We propose that this low expression of Tim-3 on HTLV-1\n                Tax-specific T cells may lead to a persistent and deleterious effector T cell pool\n                leading to more inflammation.\nThe pattern of expression of PD-1 in HTLV-1 infection has recently been shown to be\n                elevated on T cells in HTLV-1 carriers and also on CMV and EBV specific T cells in\n                asymptomatic carriers compared to healthy controls [52]. This opposing relationship of\n                PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells in patients with HTLV-1 infection suggests that\n                the downregulation of Tim-3 expression potentially leads to more vigorous T cell\n                activity in the HTLV-1-infected individual, whereas PD-1 may not fully reflect T\n                cell dysfunction, but rather an activated status of the T cell response to\n                infection. Indeed the association between the frequency of Tim-3 and PD-1 levels\n                with IFN-\u03b3 secretion in response to either Tax or CMVpp65 epitopes show\n                remarkably different correlations. In a study by Petrovas and colleagues, it was\n                apparent that PD-1 expressing T cells are able to secrete cytokines in response to\n                viral peptides [39]. Our data suggests that PD-1 and Tim-3 on antigen\n                specific CD8+ T cells are functionally different, and this may\n                reflect a distinct stage of differentiation. PD-1 appears to mark early T-cell\n                activation and exhaustion, while Tim-3 represents a more terminal stage of\n                impairment.\nThe positive association between the frequency of HTLV-1's Tax-specific\n                    CD8+ T cells and HTLV-1's Tax mRNA load and proviral load\n                is well documented [8], [53], [54]. Studies evaluating the phenotype of CD8+\n                T cells in HTLV-1 infection have been largely limited to characterizing the\n                expression of T cell maturation and differentiation markers (CD28, CD45RO) [14]. Our data\n                suggest that downregulation of Tim-3, rather than PD-1, marks global and\n                Tax-specific CD8+ T cells, which are hyperfunctional. This contrasts\n                with HIV-1 and HCV infections, where the expression of Tim-3 is increased, leading\n                to a population of CD8+ T cells that are rendered dysfunctional both\n                in terms of proliferative capacity and cytokine release as well as release of\n                cytolytic granules [29], [36].\nSurface receptors known to regulate T cell function like CD244 and PD-1 have been\n                shown to be upregulated either directly due to Tax or indirectly due to the cytokine\n                milieu [52], [55]. We\n                postulate that either direct HTLV-1 viral components led to a downregulation of\n                Tim-3, or as yet to be defined cytokine(s), suppress Tim-3 expression. In several\n                human and murine studies, the manifestation of autoimmune diseases such as multiple\n                sclerosis, have been attributed as a result of downregulated Tim-3 expression on T\n                cells [56].\nIt still remains unclear how HTLV-1 infection sustains low levels of Tim-3 on T cells\n                in infected patients and whether this is a cause or a consequence of disease\n                progression. Multilayered mechanisms for this regulation may be occurring in the\n                context of HTLV-1 infection. One strategy to reduce the T cells response would be\n                through enhancement of the Tim-3 receptor for engagement with its cognate ligand.\n                This could serve as a novel strategy to dampen the inflammatory inducing T cells.\n                From our results, PD-1 engagement may not be as effective since both\n                    PD-1\u2212 and PD-1+ cells retain the potential for\n                    CD8+ T cell lytic function.\nA novel strategy to reverse or prevent the onset of neurological complications would\n                be through dampening effector T cell functions. From our results, it appears the\n                \u03b3-chain cytokines elicited higher levels of Tim-3 on specifically on\n                    CD8+ T cells, and such a strategy could be harnessed to dampen T\n                cell function in the HTLV-1 infected individual. Further work to understand the\n                mechanisms for HTLV-1 disease progression and devise strategies to effectively\n                prevent neurological complications will be needed. Targeted modulation of the Tim-3\n                pathway provides a viable model for this intervention."
