    "Abstract": "The T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (Tim-3) receptor is highly expressed on\n                    HIV-1-specific T cells, rendering them partially “exhausted” and\n                    unable to contribute to the effective immune mediated control of viral\n                    replication. To elucidate novel mechanisms contributing to the HTLV-1\n                    neurological complex and its classic neurological presentation called HAM/TSP\n                    (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis), we investigated the\n                    expression of the Tim-3 receptor on CD8+ T cells from a cohort\n                    of HTLV-1 seropositive asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Patients diagnosed\n                    with HAM/TSP down-regulated Tim-3 expression on both CD8+ and\n                        CD4+ T cells compared to asymptomatic patients and HTLV-1\n                    seronegative controls. HTLV-1 Tax-specific, HLA-A*02 restricted\n                        CD8+ T cells among HAM/TSP individuals expressed markedly\n                    lower levels of Tim-3. We observed Tax expressing cells in both\n                        Tim-3+ and Tim-3− fractions. Taken\n                    together, these data indicate that there is a systematic downregulation of Tim-3\n                    levels on T cells in HTLV-1 infection, sustaining a profoundly highly active\n                    population of potentially pathogenic T cells that may allow for the development\n                    of HTLV-1 complications."
