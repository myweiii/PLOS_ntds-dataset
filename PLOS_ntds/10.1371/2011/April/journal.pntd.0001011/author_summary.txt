Schistosomes are parasitic worms that live for many years in the blood stream of ∼200 million people globally. How they manage to avoid getting killed by host immune mechanisms is a puzzle. We hypothesize that molecules in their skin (tegument), e.g. the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (SmAP), help them in this regard. In this work, we characterize SmAP. It is predicted to be a ∼60 kDa glycoprotein that is most highly expressed in those parasite life stages that live inside a mammalian host. We confirm that SmAP is expressed at the host/parasite interface as well as in internal tissues. To monitor the function of the enzyme, we have suppressed the expression of the SmAP gene using RNA interference. These parasites largely loose their ability to cleave the added substrate AMP (adenosine monophosphate) to generate adenosine. Since adenosine is very efficient at dampening host immune mechanisms, our work lends support to the idea that one function for tegumental SmAP is to generate the immunosuppressant adenosine so that the worms can remain unperturbed by host immune effectors. Our results do not preclude other functions for the generated adenosine. For example it could also be taken up as a nutrient by the parasites.
