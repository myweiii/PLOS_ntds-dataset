Chagas disease is a vector-borne parasitic zoonosis endemic throughout South and Central America and Mexico. Guatemala is engaged in the Central America Initiative to interrupt Chagas disease transmission. A major strategy is the reduction of Triatoma dimidiata domiciliary infestations through indoor application of residual insecticides. Successful control of T. dimidiata will depend on accurate identification of areas at greatest risk for infestation. Initial efforts focused primarily on targeted surveys of presumed risk factors and suspected infestation to define intervention areas. This policy has not been evaluated and might not maximize the effectiveness of limited resources if high prevalence villages are missed or low prevalence villages are visited unnecessarily. We compare findings from the targeted surveys to concurrent random surveys in two primary foci of Chagas disease transmission in Guatemala to evaluate the performance of the targeted surveys. Our results indicate that random surveys performed better than targeted surveys and should be considered over targeted surveys when reliability of risk factors has not been evaluated, identify useful environmental factors to predict infestation, and indicate that infestation risk varies locally. These findings are useful for decision-makers at national Chagas Disease control programs in Central America, institutions supporting development efforts, and funding agencies.
