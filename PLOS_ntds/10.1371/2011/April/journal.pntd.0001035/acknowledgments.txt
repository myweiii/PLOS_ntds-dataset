We are grateful for the support provided by Dr. Robert Wirtz from the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, at the CDC, and to Dr. Simon Brooker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for comments on an earlier draft. We would also like to thank Jun Nakagawa and Ken Hashimoto from JICA for their advice and facilitating the database exchange. Technical assistance with the existing databases was kindly provided by Estuardo Barrios Girron, Gustavo Chajon, and Jose Roberto Ramirez at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, and Emil Cherrington at CATHALAC/SERVIR graciously provided support with the satellite imagery. This research could not have been conducted without the hard work of the UVG field technicians and the department vector control teams for which we are extremely grateful. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the late Dr. Hugo Alvarez, former Chief of the Guatemalan Chagas Program, for access to the national database for Guatemala.
