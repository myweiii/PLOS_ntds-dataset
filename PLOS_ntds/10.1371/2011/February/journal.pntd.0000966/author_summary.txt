Advanced schistosomiasis japonica, an extreme form of chronic schistosomiasis that occurs in Asia, is more serious than the advanced hepatosplenic disease of schistosomiasis encountered in Africa and the Americas. The advanced schistosomiasis japonica is a chronic disabling condition associated with portal hypertension, splenomegaly, ascites, and gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding, or with severe growth retardation or granulomatous disease of the large intestine. However, the actual disability caused by advanced schistosomiasis japonica is unknown. We carried out a patient-based quality-of-life evaluation employing a standardized and widely used questionnaire (known as “EQ-5D plus”), coupled with ultrasonography and laboratory tests on advanced schistosomiasis japonica cases in a hyperendemic area of China. Among 215 confirmed cases of advanced schistosomiasis japonica, we found an overall disability weight of 0.447 with age-specific weights ranging from 0.378 to 0.510. Importantly, advanced schistosomiasis japonica is not only associated with heavy disability weights, but also with high morbidity and poor self-reported quality of life. Our results provide valuable data for the current revision of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
