The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness, a fatal disease affecting nearly half a million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Current treatments for HAT have very poor safety profiles and are difficult to administer. There is an urgent need for new, safe and effective treatments for sleeping sickness. This work describes the discovery of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines, exemplified by 4-[4-amino-5-(2-methoxy-benzoyl)-pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid phenylamide or SCYX-5070, as potent inhibitors of T. brucei growth in vitro and also in animal models for HAT. To determine the parasite proteins responsible for interaction with SCYX-5070 and related compounds, affinity pull-downs were performed followed by sequence analysis and parasite genome database searching. The work revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cdc2-related kinases (CRKs) are the major proteins specifically bound to the immobilized compound, suggesting their potential participation in the pharmacological effects of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines against trypanosomatid protozoan parasites. These data strongly support the use of 2,4-diminipyrimidines as leads for the development of new drug candidates for the treatment of HAT.
