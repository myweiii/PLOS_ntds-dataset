Trypanosoma cruzi, an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and results in the development of cardiomyopathy, is a major health problem in endemic areas. This parasite can invade a wide variety of mammalian cells. The mechanisms by which these parasites invade their host cells are not completely understood. Our study highlights, for the first time, that the Low Density Lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) is important in the invasion and the subsequent fusion of the parasitophorous vacuole with host lysosomes. We demonstrate that T. cruzi directly binds to LDLr, and inhibition or disruption of LDLr significantly decreases parasite entry. Additionally, we have determined that this cross-linking triggers the accumulation of LDLr and phosphotidylinositol phosphates in coated pits, which initiates a signaling cascade that results in the recruitment of lysosomes, possibly via the sorting motif in the cytoplasmic tail of LDLr, to the site of adhesion/invasion. Studies of infected CD1 mice demonstrate that LDLs accumulate in infected heart and that LDLr co-localize with internalized parasites. Overall, this study demonstrates that LDLr and its family members, engaged mainly in lipoprotein transportation, are also involved in T. cruzi entry into host cells and this interaction likely contributes to the progression of chronic cardiomyopathy.
