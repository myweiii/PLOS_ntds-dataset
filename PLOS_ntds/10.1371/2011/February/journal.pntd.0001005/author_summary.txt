As researchers develop more sophisticated technologies, parts of the world are left behind. The front lines of fighting many diseases lie in regions where expensive technology is not feasible. As part of the effort to eradicate lymphatic filariasis in Haiti, our group's goal was to design an assay that would allow a chemist, with basic equipment, to quantify the levels of diethylcarbamazine citrate on medicated salt. With access to university research facilities, we were able to devise and test a back-titration procedure that can measure the medication levels with sufficient accuracy and precision. Our method capitalized on the fact that the medication is acidic. This characteristic allows us to combine an unknown, medicated salt sample with a known quantity of base and then back-titrate with acid to determine diethylcarbamazine citrate concentration based on the neutralization point. Developing this protocol has put the power of quality control into the hands of the Haitian factory producing the medicated salt. With the ability to better monitor dosing levels, we have increased the effectiveness of this program in Haiti. Using modern research facilities to produce effective, low-tech methods could be a useful approach for tackling many worldwide medical and environmental issues.
