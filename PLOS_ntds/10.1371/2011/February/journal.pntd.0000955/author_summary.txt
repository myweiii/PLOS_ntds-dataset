Strongyloides stercoralis is almost unique among human nematode infections in its ability to replicate within a patient's body, potentially leading to life-long infections if left untreated. Given the potential for severe life threatening Strongyloides infections and the unsatisfactory results of current parasitologic and antibody tests, there is a need for more efficient diagnostic tools. In this study we generated an assay to specifically detect proteins expelled by Strongyloides. Initially this assay for Strongyloides detection was not specific for the parasite; however, after developing a methodology using formaldehyde preservation of feces we specifically detected Strongyloides antigens in rodent and human stool. This methodology was then tested for cross-reactivity with purified proteins from closely related parasites and furthermore for cross-reactivity against faeces collected from animals harbouring single parasitic infections. Using this approach we found no non-specific reactivity with host or to various parasite antigens, suggesting that this assay is truly specific for Strongyloides detection.
