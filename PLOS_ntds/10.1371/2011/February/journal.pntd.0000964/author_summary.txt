Neglected diseases are often restricted to poor, marginalized sections of the population. Tools exist to combat these diseases, making it imperative to work towards their elimination. In 2009, the Pan American Health Organization received a mandate to support the countries in the Region in eliminating neglected diseases and other poverty-related infections. This study analyzed the presence of selected diseases using geo-processing techniques. Five diseases (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma and human rabies transmitted by dogs) were mapped by state, showing the presence of the disease (“hotspots”) and overlap of diseases (“major hotspots”). Additional information about soil-transmitted helminths was included. In the 45 countries/territories (approximately 570 states) of the Region, there are 108 states with one or more of the selected diseases, and 36 states present the diseases in overlapping areas (“major hotspots”). Integrated plans and a comprehensive approach, ensuring access to existing diagnostic and treatment methods, and establishing a multi-sectoral agenda that addresses social determinants, are required.
