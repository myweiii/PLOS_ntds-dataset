Fasciola gigantica (Digenea) is a socioeconomically important liver fluke of humans and other mammals. It is the predominant cause of fascioliasis in the tropics and has a serious impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and other animals; yet, very little is known about this parasite and its relationship with its hosts at the molecular level. Here, advanced sequencing and bioinformatic technologies were employed to explore the genes transcribed in the adult stage of F. gigantica. From >20 million raw reads, >30,000 contiguous sequences were assembled. Relative levels of transcription were estimated; and molecules were characterized based on homology, gene ontology, and/or pathway mapping. Comparisons of the transcriptome of F. gigantica with those of other trematodes, including F. hepatica, showed similarities in transcription for molecules predicted to play roles in parasite-host interactions. The findings of the present study provide a foundation for a wide range of fundamental molecular studies of this neglected parasite, as well as research focused on developing new methods for the treatment, diagnosis, and control of fascioliasis.
