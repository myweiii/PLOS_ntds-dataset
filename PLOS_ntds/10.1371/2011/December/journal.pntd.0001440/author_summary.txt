Mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex are important vectors of human pathogens including filarial parasites and many currently expanding arboviruses. The absence of effective vaccines and the evolution of insecticide resistance stress the urgent need for the development of novel control strategies. One strategy that is receiving increasing attention is based upon the use of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which induce a form of sterility known as cytoplasmic incompatibility in mosquitoes. Here, we show that a Wolbachia strain, named wPip(Is) and naturally infecting Cx. p. pipiens from Turkey, can be used in the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) to sterilize Cx. p. quinquefasciatus females from several islands of the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO). The wPip(Is) strain was introduced into SWIO Cx. p. quinquefasciatus nuclear background leading to the LR[wPip(Is)] line. Males from this latter line were found to sterilize all wild females tested, and no difference in mating competition was observed between LR[wPip(Is)] and wild males. These results encourage the development of an IIT program based on the wPip(Is) strain to control mosquito populations in the SWIO.
