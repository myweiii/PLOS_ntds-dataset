Urogenital schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a worm, Schistosoma haematobium, which lives in the bloodstream of infected individuals. It affects at least 112 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, and has been suggested to be a risk factor for becoming infected with HIV. We reviewed publications in order to examine whether it seems likely that this parasitic infection could be a risk factor for HIV. Evidence from many types of studies supports the hypothesis that urogenital schistosomiasis does increase a person's risk of becoming infected with HIV. Studies also suggest that individuals who have both urogenital schistosomiasis and HIV have a more aggressive HIV infection and can more easily transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Praziquantel is an oral, nontoxic, inexpensive medication that is safe in pregnancy and is recommended for treatment of schistosomiasis. In areas where both infections co-exist, regular administration of praziquantel both to young girls and to sexually-active women may be an important approach to reducing HIV transmission. Our findings support the importance of making praziquantel more available to people who live in areas of the world where both urogenital schistosomiasis and HIV infection are widespread.
