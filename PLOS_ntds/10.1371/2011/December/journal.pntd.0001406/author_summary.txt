The leishmaniases are tropical diseases that affect the poorest of the poor. They are caused by Leishmania species, protozoan parasites transmitted by blood sucking insects and the visceral form of the disease is fatal. Vaccines that would tremendously boost disease control strategies need to be designed cost-efficiently and for the existing infrastructure. Salmonella-based live vaccines could fulfil these requirements as they can be cheaply produced on an industrial scale and the lyophilized product can be stored at room temperature and upon rehydration is ready for oral, needle-free application. Salmonella, like Leishmania, are intracellular pathogens that primarily target host macrophages. The bacteria induce a viscerotropic immune response. Herein lies a potentially significant advantage of using attenuated Salmonella as delivery vehicles for parasite antigens for vaccination against visceral leishmaniasis. We used in vivo inducible promoters and optimized expression systems to construct attenuated Salmonella carriers that deliver novel vaccine antigens and show a host protective effect in small rodent models of visceral leishmaniasis. These proof-of-concept studies should serve to further promote exploration of live Salmonella as a cost effective and widely applicable carrier for vaccination against leishmaniases.
