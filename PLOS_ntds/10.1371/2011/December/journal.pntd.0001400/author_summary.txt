In the Americas, the incidence and severity of dengue cases has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy can substantially reduce dengue morbidity and mortality. However the absence of a point-of-care diagnostic test and the non-specific clinical signs and symptoms in early disease make differentiating dengue from other acute febrile illnesses challenging. Identifying dengue during an outbreak of another disease is especially difficult. The combination of a simple bedside test, the tourniquet test (TT), and a readily available laboratory test, the white blood cell count, has been reported to be a useful triage tool for identifying children with dengue in Asia, but little information exists on the performance of these tests in the Americas or among adults. We evaluated the utility of these tests in the setting of a concurrent influenza epidemic in Puerto Rico in 2009. A positive TT or leucopenia (white blood cell count <5000) was present in 94% of patients with laboratory proven dengue. Patients without either of these findings rarely had dengue. Our study indicates that a combination of two rapid, widely available tests can assist clinicians in distinguishing dengue from other illnesses with similar signs and symptoms.
