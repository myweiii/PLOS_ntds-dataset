Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is a tropical disease affecting over 120 million people worldwide. More than 40 million people live with painful, disfiguring symptoms that can cause severe debilitation and social stigma. The disease is caused by infection with thread-like filarial nematodes (roundworms) that have a complex parasitic lifecycle involving both human and mosquito hosts. In the study, the authors profiled the transcriptome (the set of genes transcribed into messenger RNA rather than all of those in the genome) of the human filarial worm Brugia malayi in different lifecyle stages using deep sequencing technology. The analysis revealed major transitions in RNA expression from eggs through larval stages to adults. Using statistical approaches, the authors identified groups of genes with distinct life stage dependent transcriptional patterns, with particular emphasis on genes displaying sex-biased or germline-enriched patterns and those displaying significant changes during larval development. This study presents a first comprehensive analysis of the lifecycle transcriptome of B. malayi, providing fundamental molecular information that should help researchers better understand parasite biology and could provide clues for the development of more effective interventions.
