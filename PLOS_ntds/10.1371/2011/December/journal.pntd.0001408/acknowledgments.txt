We would like to thank all participants in the study and all the staffs at the stations for schistosomiasis control at county level for collection of stool and blood samples. We also thank Prof Patricia P. Wilkins and Mr. Yeuk-Mui Lee from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, for their kindness to supply the EITB kit as lab reference for quality control of our tests.
