Clonorchis sinensis adults habituating in the bile duct cause clonorchiasis endemic in East Asian countries, in which about 15–20 million people are supposedly infected. It has previously been reported that C. sinensis metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and that the juvenile flukes migrate to the bile duct through the ampulla of Vater in 4–7 hours. Recently advanced imaging technologies have enabled visualization of movements and localizations of parasites in mammalian hosts. From present study, we found the following: newly excysted C. sinensis juveniles (CsNEJs) were efficiently in vitro radiolabeled with 18F-FDG since CsNEJs have glucose transporters; CCK-8-induced gallbladder contraction was various rabbit to rabbit; CsNEJs promptly recognized bile and migrated up the duodenum to reach the intrahepatic bile ducts by way of the ampulla of Vater and the common bile duct as early as 7–9 minutes after inoculation. Some CsNEJs responding slowly to the bile delayed arriving at the distal bile capillaries. It was visualized for the first time that the CsNEJs migrate quickly within 10–20 minutes from the duodenum to the intrahepatic bile duct. These findings provide fundamental information on the migration of parasites living in the biliary passages of mammals.
