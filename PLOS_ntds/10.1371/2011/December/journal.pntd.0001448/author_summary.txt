Leishmaniases are a serious public health problem, especially in developing countries, caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted by sandfly bites. More information is needed on the population biology of these pathogens for diagnostic and epidemiological inquiries and for drug and vaccine elaboration. For studies dealing with the population genetics, exploring the genetic patterns of such organisms at microgeographic scales is fundamental. In this context, we made a population genetic study, based on 20 microsatellite loci, on 61 strains of Leishmania donovani complex collected in a Sudanese village, Babar El Fugara, during the epidemic of 1996â€“2000. Results showed that considering the whole sample as a single population was not adequate because of the coexistence of several genetic entities and a genetic differentiation between the human or canine strains. In addition, our findings suggested that clonality may have a strong impact on the L. donovani complex, unlike other Leishmania species. This study demonstrates the need to pursue population genetics studies in Leishmania species from sampling designs that control maximum possible confounding factors and to elaborate such kinds of analyses at the smallest possible spatio-temporal and ecological scales.
