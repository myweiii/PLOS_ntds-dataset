Malaria is endemic in 22 countries in the Americas where the Anopheles aquasalis mosquito is an important malaria vector and the Plasmodium vivax parasite is responsible for most malaria cases. This natural vector-parasite pair is difficult to study due to the lack of cultivating system for P. vivax, and to the lack of genome data for A. aquasalis. Moreover, almost all previous studies are based on African and Asian anopheline species. Understanding the interaction mechanisms between mosquito vectors and plasmodia is important for the development of malaria control strategies. Our results showed that the JAK-STAT immune pathway is activated in A. aquasalis after P. vivax challenge and is important to maintain the low levels of P. vivax load observed in this vector. Our results add to the understanding of the A. aquasalis interaction with P. vivax and lead to possible explanations for this vector competence in P. vivax transmission. All information generated here may be used to direct the development of new or specific strategies to block malaria transmission by A. aquasalis in some parts of the Americas.
