Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite responsible for Chagas disease. Chronic Chagas' heart disease (cChHD) is not only the most frequent and severe consequence of the chronic infection by T. cruzi, but is also the main cause of cardiomyopathy in South and Central America. Patients with cChHD possess high levels of antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal tail of the ribosomal P proteins of T. cruzi (called the R13 epitope). These antibodies, as well as the murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 17.2, are able to cross-react with, and stimulate, the ß1 adrenergic receptor (ß1-AR). Indeed, the mAb 17.2 was able to specifically detect human β1-AR and induce some of the classical cardiac symptoms after passive transfer to mice. To study the structural basis of this cross-reactivity, we determined the crystal structure of the Fab region of the mAb 17.2 alone and in complex with R13. Additionally, we generated a model of human β1-AR to elucidate the interaction with anti-R13 antibodies in order to understand the molecular basis of cross-reactive antibodies induced by chronic infection with T. cruzi.
