Filarial nematode parasites are responsible for a number of devastating diseases in humans and animals. These include lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis that afflict 150 million people in the tropics and threaten the health of over one billion. The parasites possess intracellular bacteria, Wolbachia, which are needed for worm survival. Clearance of these bacteria with certain antibiotics leads to parasite death. These findings have pioneered the approach of using antibiotics to treat and control filarial infections. In the present study, we have investigated the cell division process in Wolbachia for new drug target discovery. We have identified the essential cell division protein FtsZ, which has a GTPase activity, as an attractive Wolbachia drug target. We describe the molecular characterization and catalytic properties of the enzyme and demonstrate that the GTPase activity is inhibited by the natural product, berberine, and small molecule inhibitors identified from a high-throughput screen. We also found that berberine was effective in reducing motility and reproduction in B. malayi parasites in vitro. Our results should facilitate the discovery of selective inhibitors of FtsZ as a novel antibiotic approach for controlling filarial infection.
