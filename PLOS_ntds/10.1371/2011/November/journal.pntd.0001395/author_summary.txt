Ebolavirus causes often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. During infection, the virus is internalized into the low pH endosomes prior to the delivery of viral RNA to the infected cell. Cleavage by endosomal cathepsins of the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain and glycan cap from the ebolavirus surface glycoprotein GP1,2 is an essential step in infection. The effect of cleavage and the low pH of the endosomes on the conformation of GP1,2 is as yet unknown. To investigate the effect of priming, we cleaved the mucin-like domain and glycan cap of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) GP1,2 with thermolysin and engineered a mutant of Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) GP1,2 that is cleaved with furin. We demonstrate by DXMS and antibody binding studies that cleavage of the mucin domain and glycan cap and incubation at low pH are insufficient to trigger the conformational changes of GP1,2 that effect fusion. Unraveling the trigger that leads to the conformational change of GP1,2 to its fusogenic form will enhance the understanding of ebolavirus infection and pinpoint key sites for therapeutic intervention.
