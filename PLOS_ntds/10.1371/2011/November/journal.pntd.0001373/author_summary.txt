Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A is a pathogen that causes a systemic disease that is marked by serious complications and, if untreated, high mortality. The study of S. Paratyphi A pathogenesis and vaccine development has been extremely challenging since S. Paratyphi A is human host-restricted and no appropriate animal model exists. Since there is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent paratyphoid fever caused by this organism, our study represents a pioneering attempt to develop and refine a vaccine against S. Paratyphi A. We employed live attenuated strains which allow in vivo presentation of bacterial antigens via the natural route of infection, without the complications associated with antigen production and purification for subunit vaccines. For determining protective immunity against infection, we developed a mouse model that allowed evaluation of vaccine efficacy. We used our system to examine the protective capacity of a major Salmonella antigen, the flagellum. Due to its unique immunogenic properties, the flagellum is considered a major immune mediator, but its role in protection is controversial. We clearly show that cell-associated flagellar protein, presented by mucosally administered attenuated bacterial live vaccines, provides superior protection when compared to strains exporting FliC monomers, and we discuss possible mechanisms of immunity.
