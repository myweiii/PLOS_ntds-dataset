Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer disease, which causes skin wounds and often results in disabilities. The transmission of M. ulcerans remains unknown. Environmental and biological studies have gathered evidence that insects could play a role in M. ulcerans circulation. A case-control study performed in central Cameroon in 2007 unexpectedly illuminated an association between bed net use and a decreased risk of Buruli ulcer. As this result suggested a potential domestic transmission involving insects, we set up a new study to investigate whether this association existed in Bankim, a newly discovered Buruli ulcer endemic site in northwestern Cameroon. Our results confirm the protective effect of bed nets in this region, despite very different population, environment, and climate factors. They also confirm the role of good hygienic practices, a protective factor repeatedly identified in previous studies. These repeated associations now warrant further research on a possible domestic or peri-domestic transmission of the disease, involving local water collections and possibly insects.
