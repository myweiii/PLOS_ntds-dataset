We observed that LipoK (Mycobacterium leprae lipopeptide with 13 amino acids) is capable of inducing a good immune response in M. leprae infected human dendritic cells (DCs). These activated DCs had up-regulated expression of costimulatory molecule CD86 as well as CD83 (well known maturation marker) on their surface, and secreted IL-12, which is an important cytokine involved in the host defense against pathogens. Importantly, these mature DCs were capable of further driving type 1 responses by stimulating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells for proliferation and interferon-gamma production. Further, both subsets of T cells were capable of producing cytotoxic granules: granulysin and granzyme B. In vitro experiments proved that these molecules are capable of killing M. leprae directly. It is the first report of the type, which proves that granulysin as well as granzyme B could partially kill M. leprae. LipoK would facilitate in inducing the immune responses in patients' harboring M. leprae.
