We appreciate the helpful assistance of Drs. Masanori Matsuoka and Masaichi Gidoh for the M. leprae propagation and isolation. Technical help for ELISA was kindly provided by Yukie Harada, Mizuho Kujiraoka, and Kumiko Matsubara for the isolation of PBMCs. We also thank the Japanese Red Cross Society for kindly providing the whole blood cells from healthy donors.
