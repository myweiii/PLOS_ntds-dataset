We systematically reviewed the existing literature, collected 95 cases of Human African Sleeping Sickness in travelers and expatriates from non-endemic countries, and observed that Sleeping Sickness in travelers generally presents as an acute febrile illness irrespective of the causative species. If present, a trypanosomal chancre or rash and itching are important diagnostic clues. Diarrhea, hepatomegaly, or jaundice are frequent and may lead to a wrong gastroenterological diagnosis. Contrary to endemic populations, where lymphadenopathy (‘Winterbottom sign’) or sleep disorders are hallmarks of the disease, such alterations are only occasionally found in patients from non-endemic regions. The progression of the disease to the second stage is rapid and it is only treatable with toxic drugs. The risk of a fatal outcome exists and requires a rapid diagnosis and start of treatment. The clinical presentation in immigrants with human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is dominated by low grade fever and neurological symptoms as well as psychiatric features. Because of the long incubation period, HAT must be considered even if the patient has left the endemic country years ago.
