Syphilis has been resurgent in many parts of the world in past decades. Understanding the epidemiology of syphilis is important for estimating disease burdens, monitoring epidemic trends, and evaluating intervention activities. Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum), the pathogen of syphilis, cannot be grown in vitro. Because T. pallidum cannot be cultured, molecular typing of T. pallidum is particularly useful and allows for investigation of infection diversity and epidemiology. We conducted a statistical analysis of available published data to investigate the current research progress of molecular typing of syphilis. Our analysis showed that primary lesion was a better specimen for obtaining T. pallidum DNA than blood. Blood specimens collected from scraping the ear lobes had high yield of T. pallidum DNA and high full typing efficiency. Ear lobe blood is a promising specimen for future T. pallidum molecular typing, but further research should verify this finding using a larger sample size. Within all studies, subtype 14d was most prevalent, and subtype distribution varied across geographic areas. Subtype data associated with macrolide resistance and neurosyphilis were limited. More research on molecular typing of T. pallidum can be useful for investigating syphilis epidemiology and designing syphilis control strategies.
