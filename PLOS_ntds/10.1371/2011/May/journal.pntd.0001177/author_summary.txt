St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV, Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is an emerging arbovirus in South America, with human SLEV encephalitis cases reported in Argentina and Brazil. Genotype III strains of SLEV were isolated from mosquitoes during the largest SLEV outbreak ever reported in South America (CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, 2005). These strains are related to a non-epidemic genotype III SLEV strain isolated in 1979 in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. There is currently no clear explanation for the reemergence of SLEV in Argentina. This study tested the hypothesis that the epidemic strain exhibited greater virulence compared to a non-epidemic genotype III strain in an avian model, the House sparrow (Passer domesticus). House sparrows were susceptible to infection with Argentinean SLEV strains; however, the proportion of birds that became detectably viremic was low for both strains. Although no significant difference was detected between both strains, House sparrows inoculated with epidemic strain developed higher and longer viremias than those inoculated with non-epidemic strain. The virus amplification role of House sparrows was apparently enhanced when they had previous flavivirus immunity. The evolutionary/introduction process of a more viremogenic SLEV strain and the immunological interactions among antigenically-related flaviviruses will undoubtedly affect the continued reemergence of SLEV in Argentina.
