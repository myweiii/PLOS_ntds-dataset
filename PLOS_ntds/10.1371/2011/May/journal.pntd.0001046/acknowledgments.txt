We would like to thank the Early Dengue (EDEN) team, which has put in concerted effort in obtaining and processing the series of clinical samples. EDEN is a research collaboration among seven Singapore groups: the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, NHG Polyclinic Group, the Singapore Tissue Network, the DSO National Laboratories, the National Environment Agency, the Genome Institute of Singapore, and the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases. We would also like to thank the EDEN participants for enrolling in this study.
