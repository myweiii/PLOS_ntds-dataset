Diseases like malaria and sleeping sickness are caused by tropical parasites and represent a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the developing world. A pragmatic approach to discover new drugs for these diseases is to search for drug leads among existing small molecule collections generated in the for-profit pharmaceutical industry. In this study, we searched for new drug leads among a collection of small molecules donated by Celera Genomics. This collection of molecules was originally developed to inhibit a class of human enzymes (cathepsins) implicated in diseases like osteoporosis and psoriasis. Similar enzymes are also present in most tropical parasites, making this collection a logical place to search for new drug leads. The end result of this effort saw the identification of compounds that inhibit the growth of one or more tropical parasites and that will serve as good starting points for the development of new drugs for tropical parasitic diseases.
