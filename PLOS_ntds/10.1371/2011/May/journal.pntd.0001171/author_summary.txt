Post kala azar dermal leishamniasis (PKDL), an unusual dermatosis develops in 5â€“15% of apparently cured visceral leishmaniasis cases in India and in about 60% of cases in Sudan. PKDL cases assume importance since they constitute a major human reservoir for the parasite. Inadequate treatment of VL, genetics, nutrition and immunological mechanisms that allow renewed multiplication of latent parasites or reinfection predispose to PKDL. Immunopathogenesis of PKDL is poorly understood. IL-10 is widely accepted as an immuno-suppressive cytokine and produced by diverse cell populations including, B cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Natural T regulatory (nTreg) cells are subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that inhibit the response of other T cells. In this study we reported the accumulation of nTreg cells in lesion tissues of PKDL patients. Further correlation of Treg markers and IL-10 with parasite load in lesion tissues suggested a role of IL-10 and Treg in parasite establishment or persistence. Further studies are warranted to explore antigen specific IL-10 source in lesion tissues and unravel the concerted induction or accumulation of Treg in PKDL.
