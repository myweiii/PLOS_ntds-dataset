The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) functioned in reference diagnostic, the infrastructure to store and ship clinical specimens and helpful assistance in data interpretation (in particular Dr. Thomas G Ksiazek and Dr. Pierre E Rollin). The US-CDC and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa, took care for sample shipments from Luanda to Atlanta/Winnipeg. The MLU collaborated in the field with international aid organizations such as WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and Red Cross. The authors would like to thank Anita Mora, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, for her assistance with the graphical work. We kindly appreciate the scientific support by Dr. Hans-Dieter Klenk and Dr. Stephan Becker, Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany. We would like to acknowledge the management of the Uige Provincial Hospital (in particular Dr. Anastaco Matos and Dr. Gakoula Kisantou) for providing us with space and support, and the MSF teams for their collaboration in specimen sampling and case patient discussions. We are also grateful to Dr. Filomena Gomes Da Silva, Instituto Nacional de Saúde Pública, Luanda, Angola, Dr. Sebastião Sapuile Veloso, Ministry of Health of the Republic of Angola, and Dr. Diallo, WHO representative in Angola, for their encouragement and support throughout the mission. Finally, we very much appreciated the hospitality, patience and support by the people from Uige during this difficult time for their community.
