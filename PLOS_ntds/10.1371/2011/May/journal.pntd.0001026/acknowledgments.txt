This work benefited from international collaboration through the ECLAT network, and we particularly thank Chris Schofield and Ricardo Gürtler for helpful comments. Our thanks also thank to Eduardo Du Bois for training and taking care of NERO; to Paula Marcet and Ellen Dotson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the sequencing and molecular analysis; to Hugo Rolón, for processing data and images; to Estación Experimental Chaco Central (MAG) for hosting the research team; and to the members of the indigenous communities 10 Leguas and 12 de Junio, who have always supported our work.
