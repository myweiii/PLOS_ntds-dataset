Severity of toxoplasmosis, a water-borne zoonosis, varies widely from chronic and benign to acutely fatal. Here, we investigate polyparasitism (infection with multiple parasite species) as one factor governing the spectrum of disease in Toxoplasma gondii infections. This study utilized wild marine mammals as sentinels to detect contamination of waterways by T. gondii and a similar protozoan, Sarcocystis neurona, which have been linked to water-borne outbreaks in humans and wildlife along North America's Pacific Coast. Using genetic tools, we found high rates of protozoal infection, predominantly concomitant infections, in animals inhabiting major waterways of the Pacific Northwest. These dual infections of T. gondii and S. neurona were more frequently associated with mortality and protozoal encephalitis than single infections, indicating a role for polyparasitism in disease severity. Finally, rare T. gondii genotypes linked to a major human outbreak in the Pacific Northwest were abundant in marine mammals of the region, emphasizing wildlife as relevant sentinels for evaluation of human health risks. Our data implicate polyparasitism as a critical factor associated with the severity of protozoal disease. We also identify the need for vigilant surveillance of public waterways to prevent fecal contamination recurrently threatening human and wildlife health along the Pacific coast.
