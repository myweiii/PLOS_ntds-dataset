Female sand flies transmit a parasite called Leishmania that causes a disease called cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Several species of sand flies are found in West Africa, but only one species, Phlebotomus duboscqi, has been proven to transmit the parasite. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis has also been reported from Mali, Central West Africa, but the sand fly transmitting the parasite and its annual abundance has not been established, until now. Sand flies were collected during three consecutive years from two neighboring villages in Central Mali, Kemena and Sougoula, where CL is present. P. duboscqi was collected year-round and was the dominant sand fly inside of and surrounding human dwellings. Other sand fly species, known not to be vectors of CL, were primarily found outside the village. Additionally, P. duboscqi females were found infected with L. major, the same Leishmania species identified from human CL cases in Mali. The estimated infection prevalence of P. duboscqi females was 2.7%. Interestingly, the sand fly abundance and infection prevalence was similar in the two villages despite a previous report indicating a disparate L. major exposure rate in humans. This study greatly enhances our knowledge of CL transmission in Mali, poorly studied in this country to date.
