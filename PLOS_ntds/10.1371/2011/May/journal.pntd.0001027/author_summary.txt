Trachoma is an infectious disease which is caused by a bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis and is the leading cause of preventable blindness, estimated to be responsible for 2.9% of blindness globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an integrated strategy for control and elimination of blinding trachoma known as SAFE, which stands for: surgery; antibiotics; facial cleanliness; and environmental improvement. In order to identify districts where trachoma is a public health problem, we undertook 88 district-level surveys in 12 northern states of Sudan. Our findings revealed that interventions to prevent blinding trachoma are recommended in 14 out of 88 districts where the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1â€“9 years exceeded the WHO thresholds for intervention. Services to provide surgery to those with trachomatous trichiasis (TT) should be prioritized in 20 districts where prevalence of TT in adults exceeded 1%. These findings are important since they will help the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to prioritize resources for elimination of trachoma.
