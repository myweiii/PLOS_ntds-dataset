Vaccines for neglected parasitic diseases are of paramount importance. An understanding of the basic biology underpinning target expression within parasite populations is one of the pre-requisites for vaccine discovery and development. Fasciola hepatica causes global disease in humans and their livestock. The pathology of the disease is associated with the release of cathepsin L (Cat L) proteases from the parasite into the host. The Cat L proteases are the leading vaccine candidates and are split into 5 clades with different functions. The CL1 clade has undergone significant divergence resulting in the formation of sub-clades. We have studied this vaccine candidate family at the population level with proteomic based assays using F. hepatica as a case study. We have identified differences in Cat L protein expression profiles between in vitro culture compared to in vivo host bile, with CL1 members showing greater expression plasticity. Selection pressure exerted by the host driving the divergence of the CL1 clade is revealed by single amino acid polymorphisms. This case study highlights that high resolution population based proteomic assays at the vaccine discovery stage will support the successful development of broad population based commercial vaccines based on defined antigens and their families.
