Control efforts for schistosomiasis have in part been hampered by the lack of a sensitive and accurate test that can be utilized to rapidly map the prevalence of the disease in different areas. Recently, new tests have become commercially available that may address this problem. This study was designed to compare the new tests, which detect a schistosome antigen in patients' urine, with more traditional tests that look for parasite eggs in stool or anti-parasite antibodies in serum. We found that the new tests performed very well to detect schistosomiasis in children in western Kenya, an area with a high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infections. There was no apparent effect of soil transmitted helminth infections on the performance of the tests and the intensity of the antigen detection assays correlated well with the levels of S. mansoni eggs in the stool and schistosome-specific antibody in serum. Additional evaluation is needed in areas with lower schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity levels but we believe that point of contact testing of urine for schistosome antigen could be an effective tool in schistosomiasis mapping and control efforts.
