Dengue fever, dengue haemmorhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which are caused by dengue virus infection, are a major public health problem in many parts of the world, especially South East Asia. The investigation of host cell transcriptional changes in response to virus infection using DNA microarray technology has been an area of great interest. In our previous study, we used microarray technology to study expression of individual human genes in relation to dengue virus infection. Most of the genes that were upregulated were type 1 interferon related genes. To gain a better understanding of the innate immune response to dengue virus, we knocked down RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 genes in HUH-7 cells. Silencing these genes using siRNA technology resulted in significant increase in viral replication. This increase in viral load induced ER stress leading to apoptosis. This study demonstrates a synergistic role for RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 in restricting dengue virus infection.
