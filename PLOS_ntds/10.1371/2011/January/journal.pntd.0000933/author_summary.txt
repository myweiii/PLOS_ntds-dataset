Buruli ulcer (BU) is found throughout the world but is particularly prevalent in West Africa. Until 2004, treatment for this disfiguring disease was surgical excision followed by skin grafting, procedures often requiring months of hospitalization. More recently, an 8-week regimen of oral rifampin and streptomycin administered by injection has become the standard of care recommended by the World Health Organization. However, daily injections require sterile needles and syringes to prevent spread of blood borne pathogens and streptomycin has potentially serious side effects, most notably hearing loss. We tested an entirely oral regimen, substituting the long acting rifapentine for rifampin and clarithromycin for streptomycin. We also evaluated each drug separately. We found that rifapentine alone is as good as rifampin plus streptomycin, but the simultaneous addition of effective clarithromycin doses, at least in the mouse, reduces the activity of both rifampin and rifapentine, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of the oral regimens in the model. Studies of serum drug concentrations indicated that separating treatment times by one hour or reducing the clarithromycin dose to one active in humans should overcome this issue in experimental and clinical BU treatment, respectively.
