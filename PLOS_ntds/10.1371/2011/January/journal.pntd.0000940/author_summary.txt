Dengue infection is the leading cause of arbovirus illness worldwide with an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk. The primary dengue vector, Ae. aegypti, develops mainly in artificial containers in and around human dwellings. Often a small number of container types are responsible for a large proportion of adult mosquitoes in a region. To this point, most studies of Ae. aegypti production have failed to consider the spatial arrangement of development sites. For this investigation, mosquito populations and development sites were sampled in a spatially exhaustive manner over a four year time period in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. The data indicate that not only are some container types more productive than others, but that the local density of development sites has a large effect on the productivity of individual containers. Specifically, containers in areas of high development site density are more likely to be productive. The ecological setting and density of development sites should be incorporated in efforts to model and predict Ae. aegypti population levels. This understanding is vital in determining the feasibility of population control and the effort necessary to reduce vector populations below epidemic thresholds.
