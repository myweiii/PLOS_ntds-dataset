Clonorchiasis is a major neglected disease in East Asia. Worm data in infected humans are very limited, and only egg counts roughly estimate infection burden of the worms. In endemic areas, we recruited infected cases and tried to collect the adult worms from them. They were treated with 3 doses of praziquantel, and purged next day under fasting. Adult worms of C. sinensis were recovered from their diarrheal feces. The worms discharged from humans after treatment are minimum confirmed numbers. The worm recovery rate noticeably increased in subjects with higher egg counts. The number of collected worms was well-correlated with the egg counts. Worm collection by praziquantel medication and purgation is a safe non-invasive method to get worm information from human. The present study confirms that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with egg counts per gram of feces around 3,000, and egg productivity of a worm per day is around 4,000.
