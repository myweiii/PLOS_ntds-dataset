Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito transmitted disease that is best known for causing elephantiasis (grossly swollen legs and genitals). The current strategy for halting lymphatic filariasis in sub Saharan Africa is to establish programs that deliver 6 or more years of annual doses of tablets in community wide treatment programs (called mass drug administration). The tablets are safe, and donated by Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline. We describe a mass drug administration program in central Nigeria that has, since 2000, provided over 23 million cumulative annual treatments to a population of 3.7 million persons. To assess what should be happening generally throughout the program area, lymphatic filariasis infection was monitored in ten ‘sentinel villages.’ In 2009, sentinel village monitoring showed that lymphatic filariasis infection had been reduced between 67–86% compared to levels present when the program began. However, these results were not as good as desired, and suggest that longer or increased efforts are needed beyond 6 years if lymphatic filariasis elimination is to be achieved.
