The 26 million treatments reported were delivered by local volunteer drug distributors, who were the heart and soul of this prolonged community-based intervention. They were supported by local and state government health personnel of Plateau and Nasarawa States. We thank the staff of The Carter Center's Nigeria and Atlanta offices, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Government of Nigeria. We acknowledge the nocturnal survey team members who worked long night hours, and entomological workers from the University of Jos who performed their dissections in the villages. The contribution and participation of the residents and community leaders of the sentinel villages cannot go unrecognized. We thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Mectizan Donation Program, Lions Clubs International Foundation SightFirst Program, the Task Force for Global Health and WHO/World Bank African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control for support.
