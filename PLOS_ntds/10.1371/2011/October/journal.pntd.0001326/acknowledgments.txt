The authors thank all the people who assisted in the data collection, in particular the Chief Medical Officers and NTD co-ordinators and the PNLBG staff, in particular Hannatou Sebangou who undertook most of the data entry. Nadine Seward and Artemis Koukarani undertook the data analysis for the baseline and follow-up sentinel surveys. Michael French provided valuable discussion on modelling force of infection and its implications for estimating infection averted. My thanks to the reviewers for their comments.
