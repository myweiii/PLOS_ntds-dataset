    "Background": "In 2004 Niger established a large scale schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths control programme targeting children aged 5\u201314 years and adults. In two years 4.3 million treatments were delivered in 40 districts using school based and community distribution.",
    "Method and Findings": "Four districts were surveyed in 2006 to estimate the economic cost per district, per treatment and per schistosomiasis infection averted. The study compares the costs of treatment at start up and in a subsequent year, identifies the allocation of costs by activity, input and organisation, and assesses the cost of treatment. The cost of delivery provided by teachers is compared to cost of delivery by community distributers (CDD).",
    "Conclusions": "The relative cost effectiveness of school and community delivery differs by country according to the composition of the population treated, the numbers targeted and treated at school and in the community, the cost and frequency of training teachers and CDDs. Options analysis of technical and implementation alternatives including a financial analysis should form part of the programme design process."
