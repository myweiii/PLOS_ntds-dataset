Several viruses in the Arenaviridae family cause severe life-threatening hemorrhagic fever syndromes, which are considered neglected tropical diseases in endemic areas of Africa and South America. Ribavirin, the only licensed antiviral indicated for use has limited efficacy when treating advanced cases of disease and is associated with toxicity. In the present study, we use a model of acute arenaviral disease in guinea pigs based on infection with an adapted strain of the Pichind√© arenavirus (PICV) to further preclinical development of a promising broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate, favipiravir. Oral favipiravir was highly effective in the treatment of sick animals with marked fevers, as all recovered fully from lethal PICV infection even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge. Antiviral activity and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in serum virus loads and serum aspartate aminotransferase, an enzyme released into the bloodstream following tissue damage and a marker for severe arenaviral infections. Moreover, a sharp decrease in fever was observed shortly after the onset of treatment. Our findings support further development of favipiravir for the treatment of severe arenaviral infections, for which there are presently no safe and effective therapies for treating advanced cases of disease.
