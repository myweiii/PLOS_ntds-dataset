Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae an obligate intracellular pathogen that can infect cells in skin and nerves. Leprosy still affects 211,903 individuals per year worldwide and lead to permanent nerve injury that is generally associated with late diagnosis. The mechanisms of interaction between pathogen and the human host that leads to active disease are complex and there is no gold standard to detect M. leprae or host response that could early identify patients preventing severe forms of the disease, extensive nerve damage and disabilities. Thus, diagnosis relies mainly on clinical parameters and histopathological and bacteriological sometimes help to ascertain clinical form of patients. But, recently, advances in the genome of the pathogen provided extended information towards new targets to design novel genetic or immunological markers. Also novel molecular biology methods exhibiting higher sensitivity along with easy to handle apparatus based on nucleic acid detection are available. Here, we test and compare different assays for quantitative PCR (qPCR) designed to amplify specific M. leprae targets enriching the test sample with difficult-to-diagnose leprosy cases. Our results suggest that qPCR specially the one targeting repetitive element (RLEP) could be used to early detection of leprosy cases.
