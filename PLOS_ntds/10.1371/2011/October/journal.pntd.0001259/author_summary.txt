Zoonotic diseases (ones that infect both animals and humans) exact a significant economic and human cost, especially in developing economies. Developing effective policies for mitigating zoonotic infections is often challenging, both because of the complexity of their spread and because very limited resources must be allocated among a range of control options. It is increasingly becoming clear that mathematical modeling, and in particular network modeling, of disease spread can aid in analyzing and mitigating these spreads. Here, we develop a network model for the spread and control of a zoonotic infection, focusing particularly on a case study of brucellosis transmission and control among wildlife, cattle herds, and human subpopulations in an agricultural community. After motivating and formulating the model, we introduce tools for 1) parameterization of the model from time-course and snapshot data, 2) simulation and analysis of the model, and 3) optimal design of control policies using the model. The study shows that the network model can inform design of heterogeneous control policies that mitigate zoonotic disease spread with limited resources.
