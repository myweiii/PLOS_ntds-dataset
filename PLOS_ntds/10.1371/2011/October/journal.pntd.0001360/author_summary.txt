Eliminating Rhodesian sleeping sickness, the zoonotic form of Human African Trypanosomiasis found in East and Southern Africa, can be achieved only through eliminating the vectors, species of tsetse fly (Glossina). The deployment of insecticide-treated cattle is the most cost-effective means of achieving this. However, the even distribution of insecticide-treated cattle is seldom possible due to the patchy distribution of grazing, water and human settlement. We used a simulation model to explore the likely impact of such patchiness on the outcome of control operations against tsetse. The results suggest that even in areas that are highly suitable for tsetse, gaps of up to 3 km in the distribution of insecticide-treated cattle will not have a material impact on the success of an operation provided the overall mean density of cattle across all areas is adequate to achieve control (e.g., âˆ¼4 insecticide-treated cattle/km2 killing 10% per day of the tsetse in the area treated). If the gaps are larger than 3 km, then deploying insecticide-treated targets at densities of 4/km2 in the cattle-free areas will ensure success.
