Gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infections are major causes of human and animal disease. Much of their morbidity is associated with establishment of chronic infections in the host, reflecting the deployment of mechanisms to evade and modulate the immune response. The molecules responsible for these activities are poorly known. The proteins released from nematode species as excretory-secretory products (ESP) have potent immunomodulatory effects. The murine parasite Heligmosomoides bakeri (polygyrus) has served as a model to understand several aspects related to GI nematode infections. Here, we aimed to identify the protein components of H. polygyrus ESP through a proteomic approach, but the lack of genomic sequence information for this organism limited our ability to identify proteins by relying on comparisons between experimental and database-predicted mass spectra. To overcome these difficulties, we used transcriptome next-generation sequencing and several bioinformatic tools to generate and annotate a sequence assembly for this parasite. We used this information to support the protein identification process. Among the 209 proteins identified, we delineated particular processes and proteins that define the functional specialization of ESP. This work provides valuable data to establish a path to identify and understand particular parasite proteins involved in the orchestration of immune evasion events.
