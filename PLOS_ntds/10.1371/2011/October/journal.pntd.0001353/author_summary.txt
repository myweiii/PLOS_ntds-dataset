Thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungi are responsible for potentially life-threatening diseases of immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. These microorganisms grow as conidia-producing mycelia in the environment, which when inhaled by the host convert to the pathogenic yeast form at 37Â°C. During adaptation and growth, fungi interact with host immune cells and must cope with defense mechanisms such as imposed-oxidative stress (e.g., reactive oxygen species; ROS). Alternative oxidase (AOX) is an enzyme recently implicated in the reduction of ROS production by the mitochondria when triggered by external stimuli, such as temperature and ROS. During this work we have evaluated the relevance of AOX during infection with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the etiological agent of one of the most prevalent mycoses in Latin America, paracoccidioidomycosis. We show that PbAOX gene expression is stimulated after interaction with alveolar macrophages or in the presence of H2O2 and is essential for survival against fungicidal activity of both the immune cells and the ROS compound. Moreover, decreasing PbAOX gene expression in P. brasiliensis led to increased survival of infected mice. Altogether, our data supports a relevant role for AOX in the virulence of P. brasiliensis.
