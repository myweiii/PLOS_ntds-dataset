Loiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the filarial parasite Loa loa, transmitted by Chrysops vectors. Loiasis has recently emerged as a disease of public health importance when neurologic serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in individuals with high L. loa microfilaraemia after ivermectin treatment. This had a negative impact on the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in areas of co-endemicity with loiasis. Microfilarial prevalence of 20% has been suggested as the threshold above which there is an unacceptable risk of SAEs with ivermectin treatment.The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) undertook large scale mapping of loiasis in 11 potentially endemic countries using a rapid assessment procedure for loiasis (RAPLOA) that uses a simple questionnaire on the history of eye worm. A geostatistical analysis method called kriging applied to the results in 4798 sampled villages generated a contour map of eye worm prevalence, providing the first global map of loiasis based on actual survey data. This map showed high risk levels of loiasis in 10 countries where an estimated 14.4 million people live in high risk areas.
