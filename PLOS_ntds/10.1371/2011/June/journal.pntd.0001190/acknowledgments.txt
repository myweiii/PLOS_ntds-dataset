The authors are very grateful to the staff and supporters of the Haydom Lutheran Hospital, especially to Michaeli Ombay and Bartholomayo Mathias, who are in charge of the Mental Health Unit. Without their support this study would not have been possible. We are also indebted to the PWE of the Haydom Lutheran Epilepsy Clinic who have patiently endured our lengthy interviews.
