Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the most common tsetse species in Uganda where it is responsible for transmitting Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense parasites causing sleeping sickness in humans in addition to related trypanosomes that cause Nagana in cattle. An understanding of the reproductive biology of this vector is essential for the application of sustainable control/eradication methods such as Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We have analysed the number of times a female mates in the wild as this aspect of the reproductive behaviour may affect the stability and size of populations. We provide evidence that remating is a common event in the wild and females store sperm from multiple males, which may potentially be used for insemination. In vector eradication programmes, re-infestation of cleared areas and/or in cases of residual populations, the occurrence of remating may unfortunately enhance the reproductive potential of the re-invading propagules. We suggest that population age structure may influence remating frequency. Considering the seasonal demographic changes that this fly undergoes during the dry and wet seasons, control programmes based on SIT should release large numbers of sterile males, even in residual surviving target populations, in the dry season.
