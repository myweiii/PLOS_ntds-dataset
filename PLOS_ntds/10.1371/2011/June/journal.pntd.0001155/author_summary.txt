Leishmaniasis is a vector borne disease with a broad spectrum of clinical forms caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe, systemic form of the disease. It is caused by parasites belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex, which includes L. infantum and L. donovani in the Old World (OW) and L. infantum (syn. L. chagasi) in the New World (NW). The identity and origin of the causative agent of VL in the Americas have been the subjects of much debate for decades. Different scientific approaches led to different conclusions, either favouring the hypothesis of indigenous origin of this parasite and its status as distinct species, or a recent importation of L. infantum by European colonists and synonymy of L. infantum and L. chagasi. We performed the first broad population study of these parasites from the NW using highly variable microsatellite markers. The level of heterogeneity and population structure was very low in contrast to the OW. Using a combined data analysis of NW and OW strains we have provided conclusive evidence of recent multiple introductions of L. infantum from Southwest Europe into the New World and for synonymy of L. infantum and L. chagasi.
