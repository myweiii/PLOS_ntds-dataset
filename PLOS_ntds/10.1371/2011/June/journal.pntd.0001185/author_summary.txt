Neurocysticercosis, a preventable and treatable disease, is one of the main causes of epilepsy in low income countries. In these countries, the diagnosis of epilepsy is often based on clinical presentation and interviews as neuroimaging is rarely available. It is crucial to distinguish people with epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis from other people with epilepsy by clinical symptoms and/or serology, because the former warrants a specific approach both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The authors compared the demographic and clinical data of the two groups and found that people with epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis are older, more likely to consume pork, and respond better to anti-epileptic treatment. Additionally, the authors compared two antibody tests for cysticercosis with computed tomography images, which showed a higher sensitivity of the CDC electroimmunotransfer blot compared to a commercial western blot. The number of neurocysticercosis lesions was significantly associated with a positive antibody result in both tests. In summary, this research describes clinical characteristics of people with epilepsy and neurocysticercosis and assesses the usefulness of two immunoblots in those patients. This has implications not only for the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis in low income countries, but also for future epidemiological research.
