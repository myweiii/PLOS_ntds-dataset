An estimated 132 to 391 million cases of Plasmodium vivax occur annually, accounting for up to 50% of malaria cases in South and East Asia. Vivax malaria is called “benign tertian malaria” and is not considered to be associated with life threatening or severe complications. Recently, observational studies and case series or reports have reported features of severe disease normally only seen in falciparum malaria, including coma. However, the majority of these reports did not exclude mixed infections using molecular methods or estimate the risk to the population in an endemic area. In Indonesia Papua, which has a high rate of vivax malaria and drug resistance, we prospectively enrolled all patients with coma and vivax monoinfection by microscopy over a 4 year period. We excluded falciparum malaria by molecular and antigenic methods, and sought evidence for other central nervous system (CNS) infections by cerebrospinal fluid microscopic examination. The majority of patients had evidence of mixed infections with P. falciparum or non-malarial causes of coma, however six patients had clinically significant coma, with no evidence of falciparum malaria or other CNS infections. The study was limited by the absence of bacterial cultures. Our study highlights that P. vivax can be associated with coma, but that this phenomenon is 23 times less frequent than that seen with falciparum malaria and was not associated with a fatal outcome.
