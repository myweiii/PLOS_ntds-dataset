Chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC) affects millions in endemic areas and is presenting in growing numbers in the USA and European countries due to migration currents. Clinical progression, length of survival and overall prognosis are significantly worse in CCC patients when compared to patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of non-inflammatory etiology. Impairment of energy metabolism seems to play a role in heart failure due to cardiomyopathies. Herein, we have analyzed energy metabolism enzymes in myocardium samples of CCC patients comparing to other non-inflammatory cardiomyopathies. We found that myocardial tissue from CCC patients displays a significant reduction of both myocardial protein levels of ATP synthase alpha and creatine kinase enzyme activity, in comparison to control heart samples, as well as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our results suggest that CCC myocardium displays a selective energetic deficit, which may play a role in the reduced heart function observed in such patients.
