Infection with parasitic worms, known as helminths, alters the immune system, causing individuals to produce high levels of a type of antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE is typically very low in western populations, but is many times higher where helminth infections are common, particularly indigenous populations in South America. Helminths infect more than one seventh of the world's population. Since helminths tend to infect people at younger ages in areas where they are more common, a disproportionate number of those affected are schoolchildren. In this paper we examine IgE levels in two indigenous South American groups in comparison to levels in the United States. In these groups we find that IgE levels are not only higher, but that they also reach their highest levels at earlier ages in more infected populations. This finding is important since effects on immune function, including IgE production, may have additional consequences if they occur at young ages, changing the development of allergy and asthma, growth, and response to vaccines.
