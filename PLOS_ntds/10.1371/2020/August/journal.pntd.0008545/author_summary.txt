This work focuses on utilizing animal disease data to try and inform our understanding of the spread of diseases in humans. We implement predictive models to estimate the relationship between the distribution of disease in animal populations and the distribution of disease in human populations. Development of a better understanding of this relationship could inform animal and public health interventions aiming to mitigate against human disease before it spreads. Missing data and limited data resources made discovery of these relationships difficult, but we fit multiple model types to try and identify any connection between these two populations. We found specific areas with elevated risk of human disease and changes in disease risk over time. Finally, there was some indication of an association between previous yearsâ€™ levels of animal disease and human disease when using animals as covariables.
