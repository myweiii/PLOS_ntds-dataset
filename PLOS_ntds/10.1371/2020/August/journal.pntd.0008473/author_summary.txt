Schistosomiasis is one of the most common neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) worldwide with more than 200 million people at risk. Despite intensive control efforts and scaling up of programmes by public-private partnerships, schistosomiasis remains a serious public health problem. The true burden of schistosomiasis and its risk factors among very young children are not yet well-described. Here, we assessed schistosomiasis infection in 361 Kenyan children under two years of age in a high burden setting. We found extremely high prevalence of schistosomiasis (90.5%) when using a new, simple, rapid, point-of-care test which detects the presence of a schistosome glycoprotein (circulating cathodic antigen (CCA)) in urine samples, but a much lower prevalence (3.6%) when using the traditional method of stool microscopy for detecting the presence of schistosome eggs. Only area of residence was associated with schistosomiasis determined by Kato-Katz, whereas age and breastfeeding in the past 24 hours were independently associated with schistosomiasis by the point-of-care CCA test. Our findings reveal that very young children may carry an enormous burden of schistosomiasis and further research is required to determine how control programmes should encompass this neglected vulnerable group.
