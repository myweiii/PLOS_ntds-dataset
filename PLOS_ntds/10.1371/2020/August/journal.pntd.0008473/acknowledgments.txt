Our first acknowledgment is to all the study participants and people in Mbita, Homa Bay County, Kenya. Without their cooperation, this study would not have been carried out. We would also like to thank research assistants, clinicians, and laboratory staff in Mbita. We also thank for administrative support from Yasuko Kawabata and Chiaki Hisata and the staff members of the NUTIM-KEMRI project and the school of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University. We would also like to express sincere gratitude to Professor Yeri Kombe, the Director General of KEMRI for his guidance and support.
