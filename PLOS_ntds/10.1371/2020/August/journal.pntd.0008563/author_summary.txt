Leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem in 1994 in Shandong Province. However, the district continues to report a relatively high number of cases of leprosy infection involving deformity. Several studies have shown that individuals in contact with people infected with leprosy are at high risk of developing the disease. Subclinical infections among such individuals are important in the chain of M. leprae transmission. Some hyperendemic areas show growing interest in active case finding (ACF). Recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that high rates of relapsed patients, grade 2 disability (G2D) since 2011, and the extensive family history of leprosy among people in Shandong Province P.R. China, indicate a need to reconsider the current approach to leprosy prevention. Active case finding was conducted in 21 counties of Shandong Province among patients with leprosy released from treatment (RFT) and their contacts. We achieved a detection rate of 0.12%, which was much higher than the rate for passive case finding. Our ACF program confirmed the need to implement this strategy among families and neighbors of RFT patients in historically high-endemic areas of leprosy. The program could reduce the risk of G2D by facilitating early detection and treatment, thereby reducing the disease burden.
