We are grateful to teams from AIDES (DRC) and Solidarités International (DRC, Haiti) who provided logistical support for, and participated in, this research while actively responding to cholera outbreaks. We would like to acknowledge the critical contribution of the translator-enumerators who conducted or helped with all interviews and surveys: François Mitima Namuhusa, Eddy Mbuyamba Kashala, Miché Payen, and José Filipe Chapare. We are thankful to participants who welcomed us into their homes and took the time to answer all our questions. We also would like to thank Médecins Sans Frontières (Belgium) and Action Contre la Faim for their inputs on initial protocols, and Marie-Laure Quilici (Institut Pasteur, France) for insightful advice on V. cholerae results interpretation.
