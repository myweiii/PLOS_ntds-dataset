The strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to combat schistosomiasis is based on administering praziquantel as preventive chemotherapy to school-age children only, or including adults. For Schistosoma haematobium the treatment decision is based on observed prevalence by urine filtration which involves counting eggs under a light microscope. Urine filtration is time intensive and requires trained technicians to operate the microscope. Blood in urine is a common symptom of urogenital schistosomiasis and therefore, the use of screening tools based on the detection of hematuria has been suggested. We analyze three such screening tools, namely reagent strip to detect microhematuria, a questionnaire regarding recent history of blood in urine, and visible inspection of urine and determine their diagnostic accuracy to evaluate treatment need at district level in comparison to urine filtration in a national survey in Zimbabwe. We find that both the questionnaire and reagent strip classify districts with sensitivity and specificity above 85% at the 10% urine filtration thresholds. Wrongly classified districts generally show urine filtration prevalence in the vicinity of the 10% prevalence thresholds. We conclude that there is evidence that a questionnaire can be used as a low cost alternative rapid screening tool for S. haematobium.
