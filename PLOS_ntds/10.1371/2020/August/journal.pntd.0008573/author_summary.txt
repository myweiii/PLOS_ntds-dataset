Leptospirosis is an important but largely under-recognized public health problem in the tropics. It is a re-emerging disease and outbreaks of leptospirosis have been frequently reported in Sri Lanka. Most of the cases, however, were clinically diagnosed, and Leptospira serotypes and genotypes currently prevailing in the country remain unknown. For the prevention of leptospirosis, doxycycline prophylaxis and health education (early medical help, use of protective wear, etc) are implemented in farmers, which is the highest risk group, in endemic areas. In the present study, we revealed that genetically diverse Leptospira strains presently cause human leptospirosis in this country. Novel STs were isolated during an outbreak in Southern Province and may be related to the recent surge in leptospirosis patients with new clinical entities. The emergence of new STs also implies the importance of strict quarantine for imported domestic animals that are potential reservoirs of Leptospira spp. as well as the unintentional introduction of rodent reservoirs and the existence of unidentified reservoir animals in this country. New information from this study will be valuable in future research for patient management and specific targeted control approaches for reservoir hosts in the prevention and control of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.
