Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease affecting at least 12 million people in 96 countries. In French Guiana, five species of Leishmania are involved in human disease: Leishmania (V.) guyanensis, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis and Leishmania (L.) amazonensis are common and have been extensively studied. Leishmania (V.) lainsoni and Leishmania (V.) naiffi are less frequent and very few data are available on the patients infected by these species. In this study, we identified five cases of human patients infected by L. (V.) naiffi and 25 cases of L. (V.) lainsoni. Patients infected by L. (V.) lainsoni were usually god miners infected in the rainforest, while L. naiffi was observed in patients infected on the anthropized coast of French Guiana. L. naiffi was associated with mild lesions. Pentamidine was an efficient treatment for most cases of both species.
