    "Introduction": "Mosquito borne diseases are becoming a threat to public health as malaria, dengue and encephalitis are increasing rapidly in the society and posing as hazardous disease that can take many people\u2019s lives if they are not eradicated properly. Mosquito borne diseases infect more than 7\u00d7106 people around the world each year whereas, 2\u00d7106 people end up dying annually [1]. In recent years, West Bengal is facing severe human health concerns due to mosquito borne diseases. According to the report of Directorate of Health Service (DHS), Govt. of West Bengal, 35236 malaria cases, 22685 dengue cases and 2004 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were reported with 59, 45 and 275 deaths respectively in 2016 [2]. One of the most important parts of the mosquito life cycle is larval aquatic stage. Aquatic habitat of mosquito possesses a wide range of physicochemical factors that may strongly influence the abundance of different mosquito involving disease transmission. Many environmental factors may have effect on larval distribution, density, survivability and development. Nowadays, physico-chemical nature of water is changing due to industrial and other irresponsible waste management system which contaminates ground water, and acid rain which is the result of increased environmental pollution.\nThe physico-chemical nature of water might act as a determining factor for the selection of oviposition and breeding sites of mosquitoes[3]. It was reported that water quality determines whether female mosquitoes will lay eggs or the immature stages of mosquitoes develop into the adult stage[4]. Although, diagnostic and scientific research has showed that habitats without Oxygen tension are preferred by many mosquito species, some of them breed in open pools where the area is fully exposed to sunlight [5].Hagstrum and Gunstream [6] have identified two groups of mosquito species: one of the groups have a limited abundance and the other have a widespread abundance in relation to inorganic ions. Suman et al.[7] reported in 2014 that the presence of oxygen in water was a positive sign for the growth of several mosquito species.\nIn our present research, for mosquito\u2019s larval habitat study we have selected those districts of West Bengal which were most affected by mosquito borne diseases in 2016. According to the report of DHS, WB, most malaria cases were reported from Puruliya (3305 cases) and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) areas (16498 cases), most dengue cases were reported from North 24 Parganas (8250 cases) and Haora (2237 cases) and most Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) cases were reported from Bardhamman (145 cases) and Alipurduar (169 cases) in 2016 [2]. Anopheles stephensi is considered to be the primary vector for transmitting malaria in urban areas asreported by National vector borne disease control programme which was conducted in 2014\u201315 by Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of health & family welfare, Government of India. Similarly, Culex vishnui is reported to be the primary vector for transmitting encephalitis and Aedes albopictus is found to be responsible for transmitting Dengue (DGHS, India, 2014\u20132015) [8]. With the help of local health workers we have identified some areas of the afore mentioned districts where the vectors (mosquito larvae) of malaria, dengue and encephalitis were found to occur in abundance. Mosquito larvae were identified. Larval densities of three medicinally important mosquitoes were measured and water quality factors of each habitat were analyzed. How these factors affect larval density in different habitats in the case of three mosquitoes was carefully examined and analyzed. Therefore, the primary objective of this research work is to correlate water quality parameters with larval density in the select two years, and also make an analysis based on the findings of careful examination about three mosquito\u2019s inter-correlation with water quality parameters. A thorough knowledge of the physico-chemical factors which influence mosquito habitat on larval production and a good understanding of the biological and ecological aspects of mosquito vector species are of great importance in the case of formulating effective plan and careful implementation of integrated vector control strategies by environmental management. Based on our laborious and assiduous reading about the existing research in this particular field we wish to bring to the notice with emphasis that it is the first attempt of any kind of research work in this field about the water quality analysis in respect to larval density of three medicinally important mosquitoes in the respective disease affected districts of West Bengal.",
    "Materials and methods": "Study area and identification of larvae\nWe have selected five disease affected districts of West Bengal, India by literature study (S1 Fig). Areas of KMC and Puruliya (most malaria cases reported) were surveyed for larval habitat of An.stephensi, North 24 Parganas and Haora (most dengue cases reported) were screened for larval habitat of A.albopictus,and Alipurduar and Burdwan (most AES cases reported) for C. vishnui larvae habitat study(DHS, WB, 2016).We have identified and took samples from five blocks, each with three different habitats of three respective disease spreading mosquito vectors by field study in every disease affected district(S1 Fig). All samplings were done on public lands. So, a total of ten blocks in two districts with thirty different habitats for each mosquito was identified for habitat study, and these are mentioned with coordinates within brackets. Mosquito larvae were identified with the help of pictorial key [9] and confirmed by scientist of Zoological Survey of India. In KMC area, An. stephensi larval habitats were mainly found in the areas of Borough I (22.617889, 88.370556), Borough IV(22.586861, 88.351667), Borough VII (22.55525, 88.378611), Borough XI (22.491833, 88.383694) and Borough XV (22.481833, 88.316694),and in Puruliya district, An. stephensi larvae were found to be occurred in the blocks of Arsha(23.3264194,86.1660509), Jhalda II(23.3028632,86.6482258), Balarampur (23.0940236,86.2139204), Puruliya I (23.3308211,86.3273684) and Puruliya II (23.4881729,86.5562797) by random field study. In North 24 Parganas, A. albopictus larval habitats were found in Basirhat(22.6601025,88.8499545), Haroa(22.6079539,88.6731112), Bangoan (23.0430912,88.8100947), Habra (22.8440812,88.6493081) and Swarupnagar (22.8117446,88.8467814) and in Haora, A. albopictus larval habitats were mainly found in the areas of Bally (22.6457334,88.3391052), Sankrail (22.5431297,88.2038402), Uluberia (22.4693578,88.0529668), Domjur (22.6254437,88.1929857) and Bagnan I (22.4643467,87.9588736)by random field study.C. vishnui larval habitats were found in Alipurduar I (26.5189189,89.4767753), Alipurduar II(26.3896047,89.7365952), Falkata (26.5193448,89.1654674), Kumargram (26.6128239,89.8074704) and Kalchini(26.68674,89.4453446) areas of Alipurduar districts and in Burdwan districts, C. vishnui larval habitats were found to be occurred in the areas of Kalna II (23.1969095,88.2715329), Galsi II(23.3447561,87.6710485), Rayna II(23.072774,87.8727204), Katwa I(23.6053212,88.1690036) and Burdwan I (23.2579754,87.9761552) by random field survey. Three larval habitats were randomly selected from each area for the study of water quality and density determination. The average temperature readings of these districts at the end of August were ranging from 24.00\u00b12\u00b0C (Min) to 34.3\u00b12\u00b0C (Max) with high humidity of 86%-91%. Average rainfall in rainy season was 170-313cm. At the end of the rainy season, many grassy ditches, roadside ditches, potholes created on the roadside by vehicle\u2019s wheel tracks, blocked drains, marshy swamps, water pools in cultivation field of jute during retting, artificial container like broken sinks left at construction sites were filled with stagnant rain water, and mosquito larvae created colony as these places are ideal locations for their habitat. In the figure given below (S2 Fig), some photographs are presented of larval habitats of three mosquito species the sample of which was collected for the analysis of the examination. (S2 Fig).\n\n\nSampling of habitat water, mosquito larvae\nLarvae and water sampling from the selected larval habitats were collected from the areas of six districts during the end of rainy season in the last week of August. All samples were collected from open access public areas. At first, inspection was done for the presence of medicinally important three mosquito larvae with high density and the coordinates were recorded using a GPS unit. Three mosquito habitats were selected randomly in each area and total ten areas in two districts with thirty habitats were selected for each mosquito. So a total of ninety larval habitats for three mosquitoes were identified in mosquito borne disease affected six districts of West Bengal. For larvae sampling, soup ladle of 10 cm diameter with water holding capacity of 100 ml was used [10, 11]. The soup ladle was dipped into the water pool to collect larvae. Three samplings were taken from each habitat.\nAfter collection water samples were preserved following the procedure mentioned in the manual of Kori et. al.[12]. Narrow mouth glass B.O.D. bottle (300ml) with DO sampler was used to collect water sample for DO analysis.B.O.D. bottles were let to overflow while collecting water samples and then stopper the bottle to avoid air bubbles formation. After that, 1ml of MnSO4 and 1ml of alkali-iodide-azide reagent were added by using micropipette up to the brim immediately. Then glass stopper was put immediately. The reagents were mixed up by inverting the bottles 2\u20134 times and allowed to settle down the precipitate. After that, 1ml of H2SO4 was added by replacing stopper and mixed well until the precipitates were properly mixed into the solution. After acidification, the samples were packed in crushed ice containing sample box before further analysis inside laboratory within 8 hrs.\nFor COD, Ammonia nitrogen and Hardness analysis, samples were collected in 500ml glass bottles and were preserved by acidification to pH\u22642 using conc. H2SO4 and packed in crushed ice inside sample box before analysis in laboratory. For total alkalinity, Nitrate nitrogen and specific conductance analysis the samples were collected in glass container and were packed in crushed ice inside sample box for preservation before analysis in laboratory.\n\n\nWater quality analysis\nHaving collected and preserved the water samples by aforementioned techniques, they were taken to the laboratory for further analysis in a sample box. Physico-chemical parameters like pH, Specific Conductance (SC), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total alkalinity (Talk), Water Hardness, Ammonia nitrogen, Nitrate nitrogen of water samples which were collected from each mosquito habitat were assayed at laboratory following the manual [12]. \npH of the water samples was measured by electrometric method using a pH meter consisting of potentiometer, a glass electrode, a reference electrode and a temperature compensating device. Specific conductance was measured using conductivity meter and due procedures were followed as per instruction manual. Dissolved Oxygen of the water sample was analysed by the Winkler method with azide modification. COD of the water samples was analyzed by open reflux method. Total alkalinity of sample was estimated by titrating with standard 0.02N H2SO4 where phenolphthalein and methyl orange were used as indicator. Water Hardness was analyzed by EDTA titration method, Ammonia nitrogen of the water samples was assayed by Nesslerisation method. Nitrate nitrogen of the water samples were measured by UV spectrophotometer method.\n\n\nData analysis\nLarval population estimation.The total population of larvae (P) in each habitat was calculated by the following formula. P = vn/c, where c = water holding capacity of the ladle, v = the volume of the water contained in the pool, n = mean number of larvae per dip [13].Larval population was estimated for each habitat by MSEXCEL 2007.\n\nLarval density estimation.Density of mosquito larvae in a habitat was measured as the number of larvae per dip collected from respective mosquito habitat.\nDensity index of each mosquito species was analysed as percent of specimens in the total larval sample according to the following formulae [14].\nWhere, l = number of mosquito larvae of a species, L = number of total larvae collected.\n\n\n\nMultivariate analysis of three mosquito species with different environmental variables\nEnvironmental variables like pH, Specific conductance (SC), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demands (COD), Total alkalinity, hardness, Ammonia nitrogen content (AN) and Nitrate nitrogen (NN) content of the water samples were analysed in the laboratory. Correlation between different environmental factors with larval density at different habitats of each mosquito was examined using Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation testafter log transformation and 2D kernel test was done to interpret the optimum range of different physico-chemical factors for three mosquito species in two sampling years. Variables were plotted using ggplot2 through R (Ver: 3.4.4) i.e. Contour plot. The range of physico-chemical factors of habitats where respective mosquitoes were found were carefully observed and identified. For every water quality parameter, we have taken the highest and lowest value of the parameters, where and in between which mosquito habitat has found, and interpreted as optimum range for those parameters for respective mosquito species. Significance of the correlation was tested by Pearson\u2019s chi square test. Multiple logistic regression equations were carried out for three mosquito species to elucidate how the water quality parameters affect the respective mosquito larval density.\n\n\nAnalysis of inter- association of mosquito larvae\nWe have done an inter-correlation study for detecting the possible effect of inter-relation among three mosquito species. We have performed Spearman correlation analysis with R (Ver: 3.4.4) as our data was non-normally distributed and plotted with ggcorrplot2.\n\n\nAnalysis of correlation of water quality parameters and larval density for each larval habitat with years\nWe have analysed spot- wise density data and environmental parameters of each species in the respect of years. After assembling them, we have performed Spearman correlation with R (Ver: 3.4.4) analysis for detecting the change of water quality parameters within the two sampling years at each spot.",
    "Results": "Total estimated population and density of mosquito larvae in study area and their identification\nMosquito larvae were identified as Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex vishnui. In 2017, the total estimated An. stephensi larval population in our identified ten areas of two districts (KMC and Puruliya) was 5031.25. In 2018, the total estimated anopheline larvae population was increased to 5292 in those areas. Total estimated larval population of C.vishnui in our selected ten areas of two districts (Alipurduar& Burdwan) was 45,823.66 in 2017, and in 2018, the larval population of C.vishnui was increased to 48,383.76 in those areas. Total larval population of A. albopictus was estimated to 1343.88 in 2017 and it increased to 1455.5 in 2018 in selected ten areas of two districts (N 24 Parganas & Haora). Mosquito populations were found to be increased in most of the habitats of every disease affected districts of West Bengal in 2018 for three mosquitoes. District- wise total larvae population data are presented in the S1 Table.\nHabitat-wise mosquito larval density in 2017 and 2018 for three mosquitoes is represented by MS Excel graphs which exhibits an increased larval population at most of the habitats in 2018 for all three mosquitoes (Fig 1).\nLarval density index of three mosquito species is presented in S2 Table.\nDensity of each mosquito species in a single habitat to total number of larvae collected in that area during two years of sampling is calculated and presented (S3, S4 & S5 Tables).\n\n\nAssociation with mosquito larval density and physico-chemical factors of water\nThe results(Table 1) of Pearson correlation tests for water samples of 2017 reveals that larval density of An. stephensi in selected 30 larval habitats of two districts (KMC and Puruliya) are in negative correlation with pH of the water (r: -0.851, P: 2.523e-09), Chemical Oxygen Demand (r: -0.911, P:2.87e-12) and Total alkalinity (r: -0.0966, P: <2.2e-16) but larval density of An. stephensi is in positive correlation with parameters like Specific conductance (r: 0.871, P: 3.914e-10), Dissolved Oxygen (r: 0.963, P:<2.2e-16), Hardness (r: 0.919, P: 7.86e-13), Ammonia nitrogen (r: 0.971, P:<2.2e-16) and Nitrate nitrogen (r: 0.707, P: 1.251e-05).Larval density of C.vishnui in select 30 habitats of two districts (Alipurduar and Burdwan) in 2017 was found to be positively correlated with pH (r: 0.969, P: <2.2e-16), Specific conductance (r: 0.897, P: 1.921e-11), Dissolved Oxygen (r:0.971, P: < 2.2e-16), Hardness (r:0.970, P:<2.2e-16), Ammonia nitrogen (r:0.918, P: 9.068e-13)and Nitrate nitrogen (r: 0.953, P: 4.618e-16) and on the other hand it was negatively associated with COD (r: -0.932, P: 7.064e-14), Total alkalinity (r: -0.967, P:< 2.2e-16). In case of A.albopictus, larval density in select 30 habitats of two districts (North 24 Parganas and Haora) was positively associated with pH (r: 0.989, P: < 2.2e-16), Specific conductance (r: 0.868, P: 5.377e-10), Dissolved Oxygen (r: 0.747, P: 2.088e-06), Ammonia nitrogen (r: 0.838, P: 7.153e-09) and Nitrate nitrogen (r: 0.835, P: 8.984e-09) but it was negatively correlated with Chemical Oxygen Demand (r: -0.984, P:<2.2e-16), Total alkalinity (r: -0.924, P: 3.198e-13) and Hardness (r:-0.945, P: 3.226e-15).The results of correlation analysis are presented in Table 1.\nThe results (Table 2) of Pearson correlation tests for water samples of 2018 exhibited that larval density of An. stephensi was also negatively associated with pH of the water (r: -0.973, P:< 2.2e-16), Chemical Oxygen Demand (r: -0.908, P: 4.029e-12) and Total alkalinity (r: -0.899, P: 1.489e-11) but it was found to be positively associated with parameters like Specific conductance (r: 0.963, P: < 2.2e-16), Dissolved Oxygen (r: 0.955, P: 2.777e-16), Hardness (r: 0.937, P: 2.249e-14), Ammonia nitrogen (r: 0.963, P: <2.2e-16) and Nitrate nitrogen (r: 0.918, P: 8.257e-13).Larval density of C.vishnui in select 30 habitats of two districts (Alipurduar and Burdwan) in 2018 was found to be positively correlated with pH (r: 0.952, P:5.326e-16), Specific conductance (r: 0.979, P: <2.2e-16), Dissolved oxygen (r: 0.879, P: 1.62e-10), Hardness (r: 0.960, P: < 2.2e-16), Ammonia nitrogen (r: 0.953, P: 3.997e-16) and Nitrate nitrogen (r: 0.923, P: 4.084e-13) but it was negatively associated with COD (r: -0.951, P: 6.869e-16) and Total alkalinity (r: -0.938, P: 1.897e-14).

Higher larval density of An. stephensi is observed in lower pH, COD, Talk along with higher Dissolved oxygen, Specific Conductance, Hardness, Ammonia nitrogen, Nitrate nitrogen(p = 1.37e-13, R2 = 0.9521). Higher pH, Specific Conductance, Dissolved oxygen, Ammonia nitrogen, Nitrate nitrogen and lower COD, Talk and Hardness, are observed for higher density of A. albopictus (p = < 2.2e-16, R2 = 0.9737). On the other hand, higher larval density of C. vishnui is noted in higher pH, Dissolved oxygen, Specific Conductance, Hardness, Ammonia nitrogen, Nitrate nitrogen in combination with lower COD and lower Talk (p = < 2.2e-16, R2 = 0.9862).All of these water quality variables are significant to elucidate the larval abundance.\n\n\nInter-species association of mosquito larvae\nSpearman correlation revealed that occurrence of all the three mosquitoes (An. stephensi, C. vishnui and A. albopictus) was negatively correlated with each other due to the presence of different water quality parameters in different mosquito habitats.

    "Discussion": "Water quality parameters, which were analysed in our present study, have significant effects on density of medicinally important mosquitoes responsible for several mosquito borne diseases in West Bengal. Pearson correlation analysis exhibited that larval density of An. stephensi is negatively correlated with pH of the water but larval densities of C.vishnui and A. albopictus are positively correlated with pH. In the issue of larval density, An. stephensi, A. albopictus and C. vishnui, have positive correlation with specific conductance of the water. Dissolved oxygen is another significant parameter for larval density that has positive correlation with all three kinds of mosquitoes. Chemical Oxygen Demand is also a determining factor for larval occurrence which has negative correlation with all three mosquito species. Total alkalinity showed negative correlation with larval occurrence of all three types. It is widely known that hardness of water is a significant parameter for larval occurrence, and in our research, a positive correlation was noticed with larval density of C. vishnui and An. stephensi but a negative correlation was observed in the case of A.albopictus. Ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen content of water also plays a significant part for larval occurrence, and both have shown positive correlations with larval density of three types of mosquitoes. Bashar et al. [15] have reported the significance of water quality parameters in 2016 in Bangladesh. Our results of Pearson correlation test have validated their experimental data completely. A report about life stages of Anopheles sp. mosquito interpreted that a pH value that ranges from 6.8\u20137.2 is generally preferred by Anopheles mosquito for breeding [16]. 2D kernel test and Contour plot mapping of our study in two sampling years revealed that the optimum range of pH for An. stephensi was 6.31\u20136.90. It was reported that abundance of An. stephensi mosquito positively associated with Dissolved Oxygen [17, 18]. Sunish and Reuben [19] observed that Dissolved oxygen had a negative relationship with immature larval density in 2001. Amerasinghe et al. [20] determined that Dissolved oxygen is a major contributor to the mosquito larval habitat. In our study, Dissolved oxygen is also a major positive factor for density of mosquito larvae. Kengluecha et al. [21] reported in 2005 that Water Hardness is the good predictor for Anopheles in tropical climate where temperature is on the higher side and demonstrated a requirement of higher total hardness for the dominance of A.minimus. Similarly, our present research work clearly indicates that Water Hardness stands a good positive factor for larval density of An. stephensi and C. vishnui but this factor is not positive in case of larval density of A. albopictus. Contour plot analysis suggested that optimum range of Water Hardness for An. stephensi was138-170ppm and 268\u2013283 ppm for C.vishnui. Comparatively lower range of Water hardness (60\u201380 ppm) requirement was found for A. albopictus. Bashar et al.[15] also reported lower requirement of Water Hardness for Aedes sp. larvae for its habitat selection which validated our data. Bradley and Kutz [22] reported positive co-relation of Ammonia nitrogen with larval abundance and the result of our present research corroborates with former workers. In a study, Sanford et al.[23], observed high Ammonia nitrogen requirement for Culex sp. larval abundance in wetland. Similarly, in our research, we have found that C. vishnui requires highest amount of Ammonia nitrogen, and in this case our observation matches with the observation of other researchers in the past. It was reported that municipal waste water effluence with high Ammonia nitrogen content significantly increases vegetation and mosquito population in wetland [24]. Increased organic pollution due to contamination from human wastes and agrochemicals is responsible for the change of physico-chemical property of the surface water. In our present study, we have detected a spot- wise positive correlation of larval density and water quality parameters within two sampling years for three species of mosquito. This study indicates that environmental pollution, which changes the water quality, can be a determining factor for mosquito population density. Inter- correlation study clearly demonstrates that all three (An. stephensi, C.vishnui and A. albopictus) disease transmitting mosquitoes are in negative correlation with each other due to the presence of different water quality parameters in different mosquito habitats.\nAfter forgoing discussion, we may come to the conclusion that analysis in the laboratory of selected samples from different vulnerable localities in West Bengal helps us to have a good understanding about the parameters of the surface water that are suitable for oviposition of disease transmitting mosquitoes and to comprehend the larval density of respective mosquitoes. In the context of growing mosquito population as well as increased mosquito borne diseases, the findings of this research might be proved to be highly beneficial in the adoption of mosquito control program by environmental management, and accordingly, appropriate plans can be designed to control the larval population density. Moreover, water pollution is a positive indicator of larval density. Furthermore, our research establishes the fact that larval habitat of one disease transmitting mosquito is not suitable for other two. It needs to be emphasized that this kind of work has not been carried out much, this research work is relatively new in the mosquito borne disease affected areas of West Bengal where correlations between water quality parameters with larval densities of primary vectors of malaria, dengue and encephalitis were measured by the advance version of R (3.4.4). This technique can be useful in other zones of the world for larval population and density analysis, which is a pre- requisite criterion for management of mosquito borne human diseases."
