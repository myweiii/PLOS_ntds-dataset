We thank Ryan C. Maves, MD and Anne T. Fox, MD for clinical adjudications of our cohort.
We would also like to acknowledge the Diagnostic Microbiology Development Program (DMDP). DMDP, working with partners, established the diagnostic microbiology laboratory in the Takeo Provincial Hospital and has provided ongoing bench training and technical support to the staff in that laboratory and clinical mentoring to the physicians in the hospital. DMDP also provides reagents and supplies, including blood culture bottles and culture media, to the laboratory. More information about DMDP can be found at http://www.dmdp.org/. Finally, Kheng Sim and the Cambodian Communicable Disease Control center in the Ministry of Health, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
