Chagas disease (CD) infection is a debilitating and neglected disease that occurs in 21 Latin America countries. CD has two distinct phases: acute and chronic. The generally asymptomatic acute phase begins shortly after infection and can last up to four months. When symptoms do appear, they are typically mild and unspecific. Following this phase, infected individuals evolve to a long-lasting chronic phase, which can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. In Brazil, only acute cases are mandatorily notifiable in the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (Brazilian Ministry of Health). Most chronic cases are unknown and untreated. Considering that epidemiological data related to ACD is publicly available, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of notified cases of ACD and evaluated relevant epidemiological indicators throughout Brazil from 2001 to 2018. The data present here may contribute to surveillance actions designed at preventing new CD cases. We observed 5,184 cases of ACD during the period under study. The annual incidence rate in Brazil was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Three distinct epidemiological periods were identified: a rapid increase prior to 2005 (Period 1), a stable drop from 2005 to 2009 (Period 2), followed by another increasing trend after 2009 (Period 3). Vectorial transmission was the main route reported during Period 1, while oral transmission was found to increase significantly in the North during the other periods. Despite regional differences, over time cases of ACD decreased significantly nationwide. An increasing trend was noted in the North (especially after 2007). In light of the newly identified epidemiological profile of CD transmission in Brazil, we emphasize the need for strategically integrated entomological and health surveillance actions.
