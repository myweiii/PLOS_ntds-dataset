Burkholderia pseudomallei has the potential to cause mycotic aneurysm, an infrequently-occurred complication of melioidosis, with a high mortality rate despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and vascular surgery. The comprehensive clinical features of mycotic aneurysm due to B. pseudomallaei have not been documented in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and might be underrecognized. Therefore, we described eight patients with mycotic aneurysm from 159 bacteremic melioidosis patients in Hainan, China, over a seven-year period (between 2013 to 2019). We summarized their clinical characteristics, demographical features, treatments and outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of mycotic aneurysm secondary to melioidosis in China. In summary, in melioidosis endemic areas, or for those returning from endemic areas, increased awareness of the risk factors is required for early diagnosis and management of mycotic aneurysm secondary to melioidosis.
