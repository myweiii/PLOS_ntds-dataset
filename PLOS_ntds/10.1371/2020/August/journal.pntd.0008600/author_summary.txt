Parasitic helminths (worms) are important infections of humans in many less well developed countries, particularly those in tropical and sub-tropical regions. These infections are not a major problem in modern Europe but parasite eggs are readily detected in archaeological contexts. To estimate a key epidemiological parameter, the prevalence of infection, we examined large numbers of single graves from Medieval Europe and found that the rates of infection with two soil transmitted nematodes (Ascaris spp. and Trichuris trichiura) were as prevalent as in many modern endemic areas. We also identified two cestodes that humans acquire from eating undercooked red meat (Taenia spp.) or freshwater fish (Diphyllobothrium latum). Using prevalence and ancient DNA data we explored helminth epidemiology in Medieval European populations and factors that may influence infection including age, sex, sanitation, hygiene and culinary practices. The Medieval prevalence rates provide a historical baseline for Europe and an interesting comparator for modern epidemiological studies in other parts of the world. It is noteworthy that helminths were endemic in historical Europe but were eradicated prior to the development of modern drugs. In this sense studying changes in helminth prevalence in historical Europe may provide insights into control efforts in modern endemic regions.
