Clonorchiasis, which is caused by Clonorchis sinensis, is one of the most endemic parasite diseases in China. Humans get infected by eating the raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain the nymphal stage of Clonorchis sinensis. There are about 15 million cases globally with 85% of those in China. Two major endemic areas were found in China, including Guangdong and Guangxi Province in the south part of China, and Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Province in the north part of China. In this study, by analysing the dataset from one county in Guangxi Province, we found the overall proportion of infection was high, with one third of infection persons were classified as high intensity of infection. Male and persons aged 30â€“59 years developed higher burden of infection. Besides, persons who eat high frequency of raw fish developed high intensity of infection. Health education on the high risk populations should be strengthened to change the diet custom. Other measure such as examination of freshwater fish in the market should also be implemented.
