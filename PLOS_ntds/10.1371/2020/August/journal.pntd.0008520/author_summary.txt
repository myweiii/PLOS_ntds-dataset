Because diarrhea is the second-leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), effective vaccines against diarrheal pathogens may have the collateral benefit of reducing antibiotic exposure and resistance selection in these settings. Whereas antibiotic treatment is only recommended for diarrhea cases with blood in the stool (which suggests Shigella etiology), little is known about real-world diarrhea treatment practices in LMICs. We used data from a study of children experiencing diarrhea and matched, asymptomatic controls residing in LMICs of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to understand factors leading to antibiotic treatment of diarrhea cases, and the proportion of cases attributable to various enteric pathogens. We identify rotavirus and Shigella as the predominant causes of antibiotic-treated diarrhea at ages 0–23 months and 24–59 months; additional leading causes include adenovirus serotypes 40/41, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium. We estimate that approximately 12.6 diarrhea cases receive antibiotics inappropriately for each appropriately-treated case in the study settings. Vaccines against prominent enteropathogens may substantially reduce antibiotic consumption among children in LMICs.
