Although Japanese encephalitis (JE) has been well-controlled in Zhejiang Province, it remains a hot public health issue due to heavy disease burden. The epidemiological characteristics of JE have changed recently in Zhejiang Province. Increasing proportion of adult cases (>40 years old) have been reported. Genotype I (GI) of JEV has displaced genotype III (GIII) as the dominant genotype. The population immunity against JE was notably low among participants aged 4–25 years old, with the lowest GMT being in the 7-14-year-old group. Two doses of JEV-L did not provide effective protection after 4 or more years past the 2nd dose. Therefore, issues about duration of protection and necessity of a booster dose at 6 years of age need further research. JEV strains isolated from mosquitoes during 2015–2018 in Zhejiang Province all belonged to GI. Compared with the JE vaccine strain, mutations at the eight amino acid residues on E gene related to virulence in Zhejiang strains were detected, while the antigenic sites remained the same. JE serological survey in healthy populations with different sequential immunization schedule should be conducted to provide evidence for reformation on JE immunization strategy, including type, dose and interval.
