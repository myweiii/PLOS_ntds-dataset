Cryptococcosis is a fatal systemic fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii species complexes. As a former member of the C. neoformans, C. gattii had been easily neglected before being elevated to species level. Human C. gattii species complex infection was previously confined to the tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. However, in 1999, an outbreak of C. gattii species complex occurred on Vancouver Island in Canada then expanded to the Pacific Northwest in the USA, causing over 200 infections. The highly virulent, highly pathogenic and more resistant to antifungal drugs of this species have become a therapeutic problem. To initiate a better understanding of the infection characteristics and pathogenicity of C. gattii species complex in Guangxi, southern China, the current study aimed to characterize the C. gattii species complex isolates genetically and phenotypically. The ISHAM consensus MLST scheme was utilized to investigate the genetic structure of C. gattii species complex and to correlate their geographic origin, clinical source, virulence factors and antifungal susceptibility. The authors expect that this work can support surveillance and encourage more research and public health initiatives to prevent and control the cryptococcosis cause by C. gattii species complex.
