    "Abstract": "The emergence and spread of cryptococcosis caused by the Cryptococcus gattii species complex has become a major public concern worldwide. C. deuterogattii (VGIIa) outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest region demonstrate the expansion of this fungal infection to temperate climate regions. However, infections due to the C. gattii species complex in China have rarely been reported. In this study, we studied eleven clinical strains of the C. gattii species complex isolated from Guangxi, southern China. The genetic identity and variability of these isolates were analyzed via multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and the phylogenetic relationships among these isolates and global isolates were evaluated. The mating type, physiological features and antifungal susceptibilities of these isolates were also characterized. Among the eleven isolates, six belonged to C. deuterogattii, while five belonged to C. gattii sensu stricto. The C. deuterogattii strains from Guangxi, southern China were genetically variable and clustered with different clinical isolates from Brazil. All strains were MATÎ±, and three C. deuterogattii isolates (GX0104, GX0105 and GX0147) were able to undergo sexual reproduction. Moreover, most strains had capsule and were capable of melanin production when compared to the outbreak strain from Canada. Most isolates were susceptible to antifungal drugs; yet one of eleven immunocompetent patients died of cryptococcal meningitis caused by C. deuterogattii (GX0147). Our study indicated that the highly pathogenic C. deuterogattii may be emerging in southern China, and effective nationwide surveillance of C. gattii species complex infection is necessary."
