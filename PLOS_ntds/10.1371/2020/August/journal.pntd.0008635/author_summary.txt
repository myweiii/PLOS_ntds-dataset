Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic disease in the world and is caused by the Schistosoma trematode. This disease is characterized by a granulomatous reaction around parasite eggs trapped in the tissues. The liver is one of the most affected organs and can develop severe fibrosis. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the treatment for schistosomiasis and kills the adult the worm; however, inflammation still persists around the eggs in the tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been extensively studied as an alternative therapy to repair tissues and to stop inflammation due to their potential to differentiate in several cells types (bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma), and to interfere with immune responses. This scenario has motivated the authors to investigate the use of MSC extract from adipose tissue (ASC) associated with PZQ to treat schistosomiasis. Briefly, mice were treated with PZQ followed by ASC injection showing significant reduction of the granulomas and normal levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase, an indicator of liver damage. These results suggest that ASC has the potential to be used as a novel therapeutic approach to control inflammation following infection by S. mansoni or liver disorders. Although the findings are promising, further studies using the chronic model of schistosomiasis are required to confirm using ASC for schistosomiasis therapy.
