The microbiome is defined as a community of microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses) living on or within a host organism. The microbiome influences physiological traits of medically important mosquitoes and can alter disease transmission dynamics in vector populations. The composition of the mosquito microbiome varies across mosquito populations; however, the factors that contribute to this variation are poorly understood. Understanding the factors that shape the mosquito microbiome will inform how mosquito-borne disease transmission varies among environments and help to develop effective disease-mitigating strategies. In this study, we assessed the diversity and variation of the microbiome of a medically important mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We found that the mosquito microbiome composition varies across geographic locations but is not affected by rainfall or temperature. We discovered that mosquitoes infected with the parasite Ascogregarina taiwanensis had a different microbiome composition than that of mosquitoes with little to no infection. This study contributes to our understanding of the factors that influence the diversity and variation in the mosquito microbiome. This and other studies like it will contribute to the development of new and innovative strategies to prevent and mitigate diseases vectored by mosquitoes.
