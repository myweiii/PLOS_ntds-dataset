    "Background": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases increasing in its public health importance. In Ethiopia over 28 million people are living at risk of infection.",
    "Method": "Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Borumeda Hospital from February to May 2019. A total 205 leishmaniasis suspected patients were included by systematic random sampling technique. Socio demographic characteristics were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. Parasitological investigation was done from skin slit sample by using Geimsa staining method. Species identification was done by PCR-RFLP. Data were entered in to EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. P-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
    "Result": "A total of 205 participants consisting 59% male and 41% female included in this study. The mean age (±SD) of the study participants was 31.9 (±14.29). The overall prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis was 22.4% (46/205). The prevalence in males (13.7%) was higher than in females (8.8%). It was more prevalent in the age group 16-45years old (15.6%). Clinically, 60% of patients’ hade single lesion with 1.55 average number of lesions. About 30.7% of patients’ had indurated plaque type of lesion. Most of the lesions were found on head and face (59%). House near to farmland, presence of hyrax in the village and presence of other cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the neighborhood were independent predicator of cutaneous leishmaniasis prevalence. L.aethopica was found to be the etiologic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the study participants.",
    "Conclusion": "The prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis was 22.4%, this alerts the need of intervention. It is statistically associated with house near to farm land, presence of other cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the neighborhood and presence of hyrax in village. Head and face were the most common sites of lesion."
