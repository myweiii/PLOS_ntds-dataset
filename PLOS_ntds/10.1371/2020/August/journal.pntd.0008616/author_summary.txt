Podoconiosis is one of the major causes of tropical lymphedema and results in massive swelling of the lower limbs. It is caused by exposure to mineral particle-induced inflammation among genetically susceptible individuals. People affected by the disease often suffer both physical and psychological comorbidities, which can include painful swelling, distress, depression, stigma and discrimination. In spite of its presence among some African countries, its geographical distribution and burden in Africa are uncertain. We applied statistical modelling to the most comprehensive database compiled to date to predict the environmental suitability of podoconiosis in the African continent. By combining climate and environmental data (elevation, annual precipitation, land surface temperature, vegetation index, and soil characteristics such as clay and silt fraction) and overlaying population figures, we predicted both the environmental suitability as well as the human population at risk for podoconiosis in Africa. Environmental suitability for podoconiosis was predicted in 29 African countries. Our estimates provide key evidence that will help decision-makers to better plan more integrated intervention programmes.
