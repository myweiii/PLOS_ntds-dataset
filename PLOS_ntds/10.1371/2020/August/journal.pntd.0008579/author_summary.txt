Antivenom is the first-choice therapy for victims of snakebite envenoming. Currently there is very little robust evidence that many of the antivenoms currently being used in Africa are suitable or effective. Unusually for a human medicine, clinical trials are not a pre-requisite for antivenom approval, licensing and use in patients. This leaves a situation where nearly all the information of an antivenom’s effectiveness is based on mouse assays assessing neutralisation of venom-induced lethality, so-called “preclinical” antivenom testing. Here we analysed all the publicly available preclinical data on antivenoms for Africa published in the last 20 years. Our results demonstrate that there is worryingly little publicly available information on the preclinical efficacy of antivenoms and that the efficacy of some products is seemingly very weak. We hope that the World Health Organization’s antivenom assessment and listing scheme (independently and systematically testing antivenom efficacy and quality) will fill many of these crucial information gaps. Furthermore, the quality of the result reporting was highly variable across studies, making meaningful comparisons difficult and causing challenges for clinicians treating snakebites to rapidly decipher efficacy information. To remedy this, we have developed a reporting checklist to harmonise preclinical antivenom efficacy reporting across the globe.
