The baseline enrolled 285 patients admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital (Guangzhou, Guangdong) with a diagnosis of COVID-19. We reported the epidemiology, clinical laboratory, radiological characteristics, virological results, treatment, and definite outcomes (getting PCR retested positive (RP) or not during post-discharge surveillance) of the cases. RP events occurred in nearly 10% of cases, were not associated with worsening symptoms and unlikely reflect reinfection. The lack of efficiency in virus clearance was a risk factor for RP result. Elder RP patients (≥ 60 years old) were more susceptible to clinical symptom at readmission. In the context of numerous COVID-19 cases showed SARS-CoV-2 positive again after discharged, the data in China may provide recommendations for post-discharge management, especially for other developing countries.
