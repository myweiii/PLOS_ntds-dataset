Muscle cells are potential targets of many arboviruses, such as Ross River, Dengue, Sindbis, and chikungunya viruses, and may be involved in the disease manifestation. During the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), myalgia was one of the most frequently reported symptoms. We investigated the susceptibility of human muscle cells to ZIKV infection. Using an in vitro model of human muscle stem cells (myoblasts) that can be differentiated into differentiated muscle cells (myotubes), we found that myoblasts can be infected by ZIKV. In contrast, myotubes were shown to be resistant to ZIKV infection. Infection induced the death of infected cells. Protein levels 24h and 48h post-infection indicate that ZIKV infection induces an upregulation of proteins involved in the activation of the Interferon type I pathway, and a downregulation of protein synthesis. This work constitutes the first observation of primary human muscle cells susceptibility to ZIKV infection, muscle stem cells being susceptible while differentiated muscle cells are resistant. Since myoblasts constitute the reservoir of stem cells involved in reparation/regeneration in muscle tissue, the infection of muscle cells and the viral-induced alterations observed here could have consequences during ZIKV infection.
