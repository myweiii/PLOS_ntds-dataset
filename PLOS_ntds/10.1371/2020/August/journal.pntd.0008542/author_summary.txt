The intolerable burden of malaria demands the development of novel approaches to fight this deadly disease. Previously, the engineered symbiotic bacterium Serratia AS1 was shown in the laboratory to be able to spread through mosquito populations and render mosquitoes resistant to the parasite. However, a major concern of regulators for the release of such engineered bacteria into the field is that there is no option for “recall” in case something goes wrong. Here we show that Serratia AS1 loses plasmids as it replicates in mosquitoes and in culture, reverting to wild type. We also show that horizontal transfer of the plasmid from Serratia AS1 to other bacteria is extremely rare, as this was undetectable in the mosquito and in culture. Our results suggest that initial field trials can make use of this reversible system whereby released recombinant bacteria expressing anti-plasmodial compounds from a plasmid revert to wild type at a predictable rate.
