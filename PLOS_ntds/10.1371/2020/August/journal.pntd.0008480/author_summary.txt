Clonorchiasis is an important neglected tropical disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, which can induce malignant bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). Little precise information is available on the biology, epidemiology and population genetics of C. sinensis. For this reason, we explored here the genetic composition of C. sinensis populations in distinct endemic areas in China and Russia. Using a deep sequencing-informatic approach, we revealed marked mitochondrial genetic variation within and between individuals and populations of C. sinensis, with no particular affiliation with geographic or host origin. These molecular findings and the methodology established should underpin future genetic studies of C. sinensis causing human clonorchiasis and associated complications (cancer) as well as transmission patterns in endemic regions.
