Lassa virus (LASV) infection constitutes a major public health threat as it has a direct impact on the mortality of febrile patients, healthcare workers, pregnant women, visitors of endemic countries with a consequential negative impact on national and individual economies. It is necessary to have accurate epidemiological data on LASV infection, in order to prioritize the policies, funding for public health interventions, and health-care planning, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Data concerning virus occurrence in rodents and other mammal species can also assist in guiding control of Lassa fever from an ecological perspective. This could include preventive measures such as the protection of food fields by anti-rodent barriers, the protection of rodent predatory fauna, the sanitation of home and particularly the food storage place and the blocking of rodent access to home and food stored. Our systematic review and meta-analysis of LASV infection in SSA has contemporarily and comprehensively summarized the prevalence of current, recent, and past infection both in humans, rodents and other mammals. Broadly, the study showed relatively high CFR estimates in humans. Additionally, Western Africa presented the highest burden of LASV infections compared to other regions. This study emphasized various populations of SSA with relatively high burden of LASV infection. We have identified specific populations at high risk of LASV infection, who may urgently benefit from routine screening, detection and management programmes. Beyond, preventive strategies should be promoted, by educating and raising people’s awareness about LASV infection, and strengthening practitioners’ capacities towards adequate diagnosis and proper management of this infection in SSA.
