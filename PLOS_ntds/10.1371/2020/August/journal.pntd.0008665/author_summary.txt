Schistosomiasis is a preventable yet serious disease in many developing countries. Although schistosomiasis control strategies include the provision of water and sanitation facilities, specific WASH solutions are often lacking. Control programs generally focus on preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel which is effective in killing adult worms in humans but does not prevent re-infection. Communities lacking safe alternative water sources therefore have no choice but to rely on unsafe water for their daily water contact activities, even if this exposes them to high risk of infection. Water treatment can provide communities with safe water on a household or community scale. However, to-date there are no guidelines for treating cercaria-contaminated water. We rigorously tested the effectiveness of chlorine against S. mansoni cercariae in lab and field settings. The resulting chlorination recommendation can be used to treat water and provide schistosomiasis-endemic communities with safe water facilities (e.g. laundry or bathing stations).
