Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are endemic zoonotic infectious diseases caused by hantaviruses, which have threatened public health worldwide for decades. However, our knowledge about the emergence and evolution of HTNV still need to be improved. To get more information about HTNV genetic diversity and phylogenetic features with a holistic perspective, we investigated the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of HTNV using all available whole-genome sequences of small (S) and medium (M) segments collected from 18 different regions and using a larger timescale; 11 phylogenetic groups were defined. The sequences showed geographic clustering, and divergence with recombinant or reassortment events occurred. Using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection method, geographic origins and migration patterns of HTNV epidemics were deduced. Our data provided important biological information to better understand hantavirus evolution, transmission, and epidemics.
