Egypt vision 2030 aiming that all Egyptians should have healthy, safe, and secure life. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Egypt has the highest rate of NTDs. Current medical and nursing students are the future healthcare workers who will be responsible to participate in control activities for the elimination of these diseases in Egypt. The present study aimed to provide information about the awareness of medical and nursing students regarding NTDs and their control activities. We targeted medical and nursing students who have finished an epidemiology course. Our results showed that only one fourth of the students knew the meaning of NTDs and nearly half of them agreed that the awareness of NTDs is poor among Egyptians. Although only 5% of the included students are aware of NTDs control activities, about one third of them agreed to participate in these activities. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to update the curricula of medical students in Egypt, especially because of the new program the medical schools in Egypt are experiencing currently (five years of studying and two years for training). Also, the engagement of medical and nursing students in research and prevention activities to combat NTDs should be encouraged in the training years.
