ZIKV is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause severe birth defects and other disorders. Large outbreaks of ZIKV occurred in 2015 and 2016 and there are still no drugs or vaccines available to protect against ZIKV infection. Vaccine development has been hindered by the lack of safe and efficient methods to screen ZIKV neutralizing properties of patient sera or antibodies, especially in the context of large clinical trials. To address this unmet need, we developed and validated the use of ZIKV reporter virus particles (RVPs), a safe, high-throughput, and quantitative alternative to using live virus for neutralization studies. We show that ZIKV RVPs are stable, show lot-to-lot consistency, and provide reproducible neutralization data that is suitable for the large-scale studies needed for development of a ZIKV vaccine, epidemiologic surveillance, and high-throughput screening.
