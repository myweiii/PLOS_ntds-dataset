Lymphatic filariasis is a disease caused by worms and transmitted between humans by mosquitoes. A global program underway aims to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by distributing two deworming drugs to the whole population once a year for at least five years. In some countries, including Samoa, this strategy has not been sufficient to eliminate transmission. A new drug has been added, and in 2018, Samoa was the first country in the world to distribute country-wide triple-drug mass drug administration (MDA) using ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. This study reports on the coverage achieved (percentage of people who reported taking the drugs) and adverse events after taking the drugs. The study was a large community survey of over 4000 people, done 7â€“11 weeks after the distribution of the first round of triple-drug MDA. We found that the program reached and offered MDA to approximately 90% of the whole population, and approximately 80% of the whole population swallowed the drugs. We also collected data on whether people felt unwell after taking the pills, and found that 84% of people taking the pills did not feel unwell at all, while 13% reported feeling unwell afterwards but were able to do normal everyday activities, and 3% reported that they had felt unwell and that it stopped them doing normal everyday activities, such as going to school or work.
