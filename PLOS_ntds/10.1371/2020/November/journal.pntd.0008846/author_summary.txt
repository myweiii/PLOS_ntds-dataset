Mosquito control approaches primarily depend on lowering the number of potential adult mosquito vectors by inhibiting juvenile stages to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission. Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analog that inhibits the emergence of adult mosquitoes by interrupting metamorphosis, but does not target larvae. This mechanism allows natural sources of mortality like predation to act in combination with pyriproxyfen to affect mosquito population size. Here, we determined the effects of juvenile exposure to pyriproxyfen and predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus on adult Aedes aegypti traits, including infection with Zika virus. Combined effects of pyriproxyfen and Tx. rutilus led to strong inhibition of adult emergence in Ae. aegypti. Treatments containing predators or those mimicking the daily mortality of predation produced larger sized adults. Susceptibility to ZIKV infection was lowest in the predator treatment and highest in the pyriproxyfen treatment. Disseminated infection, transmission, and viral titers of ZIKV were similar between treatments. Our data suggest that the combination of pyriproxyfen and predators can enhance inhibition of adult Ae. aegypti emergence, but survivors may have fitness benefits such being larger mosquitoes. Understanding the consequences of control approaches in mosquito-pathogen interactions will assist to evaluate their suitability in mosquito control programs.
