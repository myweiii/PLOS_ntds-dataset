Filarial parasitic nematodes are vector-borne parasites that infect humans and animals. Brugia malayi and Dirofilaria immitis are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause human lymphatic filariasis and canine heartworm disease, respectively. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in genomic and transcriptomic data sets and the concomitant increase in innovative strategies for drug target identification, validation, and screening. However, while the completeness of genome assemblies of filarial parasitic nematodes has seen steady improvements, the reliability of gene models has not kept pace, hindering cloning efforts. Long-read RNA sequencing technologies are uniquely able to improve gene models, but have not been widely used for the causative agents of neglected tropical diseases. Here, we report the improvement of gene models in both B. malayi and D. immitis by long-read RNA sequencing. We identified novel operons, deprecated false positive operons, identified dozens of novel genes, and described the parameters of polyadenylation. We also focused on putative anthelmintic targets, identifying novel isoforms and correcting gene models. These data substantially increase the trustworthiness of gene models in these two species and demonstrate how long-read sequencing approaches should be prioritized in the continued improvement of genome assemblies and their gene annotations.
