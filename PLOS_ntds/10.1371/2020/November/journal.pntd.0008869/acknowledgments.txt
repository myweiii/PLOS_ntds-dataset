Some parasite materials were provided by the NIH/NIAID Filariasis Research Reagent Resource Center (www.filariasiscenter.org). D. immitis RNA extractions were carried out by Jessica Grant and Steve Williams at Smith College. RNA sequencing was carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. B. malayi data was uploaded to WormBase and B. malayi gene and operon curation was performed by Michael Paulini. Faye Rogers at WormBase ParaSite assisted in setting up the Apollo instance for D. immitis gene curation. The authors would like to thank members of the Zamanian laboratory for assistance in D. immitis gene curation and critical comments on the manuscript.
