Epilepsy is a clinical concern in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome and microcephaly; however, it is unknown whether epilepsy rates are elevated in normocephalic children with prenatal Zika virus exposure. We found a modest elevation of epilepsy rates in the first year of life of exposed, relative to unexposed, children, despite no other neurological manifestations. Seizures in exposed children had features of focal, rather than generalized, epilepsy and were well controlled with carbamazepine. Our findings suggest that epilepsy surveillance should be included in the neurodevelopmental assessment of children with prenatal Zika virus exposure, even in the absence of neurologic manifestations at birth.
