Nigeria has the highest number of people affected by neglected tropical diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these diseases (onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths) can be prevented and treated using mass administration of medicines (MAM), which involves giving everyone in communities medicines based on their height. MAM has been going on for a long time in Nigeria and has achieved many successes, however, the programmatic, social, political and economic context in Nigeria is rapidly changing and there is limited evidence about the ability of current MAM approaches to ensure everyone who needs these medicines is able to access them during this time of change. We asked MAM programme implementers at different levels of the health system in Nigeria to tell us what they thought the key strengths and weaknesses of the current programme were and what they would do to make it better to ensure that everyone who needs the medicines would still be able to access them. They told us that the commitment of health workers and community leaders to telling communities about the medicines and encouraging them to accept them as well as the knowledge of the disability these diseases can cause had supported programme success. However, they also told us that in some areas, such as those with security concerns or where communities feel fatigued by the programme, the way communities respond is changing. To address the change in community responses our study participants felt that we need to support programme implementers with the time, tools and resources to build stronger more trusting relationships with communities to ensure everyone can access medicines.
