Snakebite envenoming is an important public health problem around the world. Bungarus multicinctus envenomation is regarded as most dangerous animal bitten disease in China and neighboring countries. At present, the most widely clinic used B. multicinctus antisera was term as B. multicinctus antivenin and manufactured by Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co. Ltd. By using high purity α-, β- and γ-bungarotoxins isolated from B. multicinctus crude venom and prepared corresponding rabbit anti- α-, β- and γ-bungarotoxin antisera, we evaluated the efficacy of B. multicinctus antivenin against the crude venom, isolated bungarotoxins, as well as other 8 medical important Chinese venomous snake venoms. B. multicinctus antivenin showed strong immunoreaction with high molecular weight fractions of the B. multicinctus venom but weakly recognized low molecular weight fractions like α- and γ-bungarotoxins. Moreover, B. multicinctus antivenin can neutralize Ophiophagus hannah venom but not B. fasciatus venom was demonstrated.
