Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a Pan-American emerging disease with a high mortality rate caused by a rodent-borne virus. In Argentina, almost half of the HPS infections occur in the northwestern endemic region. Most of the reported cases (75%) developed severe respiratory insufficiency, of which 30% required mechanical ventilation and 15% with a fatal outcome. In this study area, nearly half of the population is below the poverty line, particularly in rural areas, where most infections occur. Since there are no vaccines currently available nor specific therapeutic treatments, prevention of hantavirus infection involves mainly environmental management practices and educational campaigns. Our results provide a framework for the planning and implementation of early public health prevention campaigns based on the significant relationship between hantavirus outbreaks and delayed climatic variables.
