The early COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February 2020. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 57 available and 58 newly generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering, was linked to attendees, and became predominant (65.2%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Asia Pacific countries were temporally linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia Pacific countries. We also report a mutation in the virus nsp3 gene found in 47.3% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the second wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.
