Guinea worm–Dracunculus medinensis–was historically one of the major parasites of humans and has been known since antiquity. Guinea worm is now on the brink of eradication, as a global effort seeking to make this parasite extinct has reduced the number of people infected each year from millions in the 1980s to only 54 human cases in 2019. Despite the enormous success of eradication efforts to date, one complication has arisen. Over the last few years, hundreds of dogs have been found infected with Guinea worm, which was previously considered to be transmitted between people. Almost all of these infected animals are in Chad. We have used whole-genome sequence data to try and understand this peculiar situation. We confirm that the same population of worms are causing both infections and show suspected transmission from humans to dogs. The diversity of worms in Chad appears to exclude the possibility that there were no, or very few, worms present in the country during a 10-year absence of reported cases. This work reinforces the importance of adequate surveillance of both human and dog populations and suggests that control programs should stay aware of the emergence of unusual epidemiology as pathogens approach elimination.
