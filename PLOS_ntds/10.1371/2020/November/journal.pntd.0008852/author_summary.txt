Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a globally distributed zoonotic vector-borne neglected tropical disease transmitted by female sandflies. The aim of this study was to estimate habitat suitability of the CL-transmitting sandfly in Jordan using spatial data on variables that influence the sandfliesâ€™ presence and survival including temperature, humidity, precipitation, vegetation, wind speed, presence of human households and presence of the fat sand rat. Once high-risk areas were identified, the number of people at risk of infection could be estimated. Sandfly habitat suitability increased over the summer months and was generally highest in the north-western parts of the country and along the Jordan Valley, coinciding with highly populated regions, including areas containing Syrian refugee camps. These results suggest the need for targeted surveillance and disease control efforts.
