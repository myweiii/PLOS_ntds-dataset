B. bacilliformis is a bacterial pathogen that is transmitted between humans by phlebotomine sand flies. Bacteria often express sRNAs to fine-tune the production of proteins involved in a wide array of biological processes. We cultured B. bacilliformis in vitro under standard conditions then shifted the pathogen for a period of time to ten distinct environments, including multiple temperatures, pH levels, and infections of human blood and human vascular endothelial cells. After RNA-sequencing, a manual transcriptome search identified 160 putative sRNAs, including seven highly-conserved sRNAs and 153 novel potential sRNAs. We then characterized two of the novel sRNAs, BbgpI and BbsR9. BbgpI is a group I intron (ribozyme) that self-splices and disrupts an unannotated gene coding for a transfer RNA (tRNACCUArg). BbsR9 is an intergenic sRNA expressed under conditions that simulate the sand fly. We found that BbsR9 targets transcripts of the ftsH, nuoF, and gcvT genes. Furthermore, we determined the specific sRNA-mRNA interactions responsible for BbsR9 binding to its target mRNAs through in vitro mutagenesis and binding assays.
