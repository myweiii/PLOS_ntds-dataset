    "Abstract": "The development of insecticide resistance is becoming a threat to many arboviruses control programs worldwide. While this has been attributed to the indiscriminate use of insecticide, a more theoretical study is apparently not available. Using in-silico experiments, we investigated the effects of two different policies: one used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (which follows the World Health Organization protocol) and a more permissive one, akin to those employed by various gated communities and private companies. The results show that the public policy does not lead to resistance fixation. On the other hand, permissive application of adulticide, such as intensive domestic use mainly during epidemic periods, might lead to the fixation of a resistant population, even when resistance is associated with moderate fitness costs."
