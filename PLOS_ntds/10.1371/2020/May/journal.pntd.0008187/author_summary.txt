Loa loa is a filarial worm which infects millions of people living in the forested areas of central Africa. The infection is rarely diagnosed outside Africa, but individual case management is also important in non-endemic countries to treat migrants, tourists and expatriates. Aim of this study was to describe the performance of a Rapid Test and an ELISA pan filarial test for the diagnosis of Loa loa infection. Both tests demonstrated good performance for the detection of cases of loiasis. In case of infection with other parasites, the RDT gave less false positive results.
