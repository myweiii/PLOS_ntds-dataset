Chagas disease is a significant human health concern as it can cause severe cardiomyopathies in chronically infected patients. Due to the high morbidity associated with Chagasic cardiomyopathies, it is vital to investigate new treatment options. In this study, we use state-of-the-art techniques to interrogate the host signaling events induced by chronic Chagas disease in the primary affected organ, the heart. We identify proteins and phospho-sites significantly altered upon infection, predict activated and inhibited kinases, and link our findings to known drug targets. For the first time, this study provides insight into the in vivo host signaling responses to T. cruzi in the heart, uncovering pathways that can be validated for contributions to disease and suitability as drug targets.
