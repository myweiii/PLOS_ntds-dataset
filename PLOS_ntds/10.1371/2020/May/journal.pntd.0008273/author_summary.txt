Increasing global urbanization is having a profound effect on infectious disease risk, in particular presenting challenges for governments to allocate limited resources for controlling disease incidence at different locations within a city. With recent advances in the way data is collected, getting evidence about the efficacy of highly localized containment and intervention activities, which can lead to optimal deployment of resources, is possible. Here we develop methods for systematically analyzing the localized sub-city relationship between containment activities and disease incidence. Using precisely geo-located data on dengue containment activities and incidence, collected from two cities in Pakistan, we identify how the generation of new dengue cases changes in space and time with the application of seven types of containment activities. Our results show that activities targeted at adult stage of mosquito can reduce the generation of new dengue cases by 20% in their immediate vicinity and are effective up to a distance of 1km from the site of application. Further, given limitations due to the real-world nature of the data, we provide guidelines to improve data collection practices. The methods and results will enable governments and practitioners to improve the deployment of containment activities in an outbreak setting.
