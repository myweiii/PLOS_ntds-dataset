Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe disease caused by a micro-organism called Leishmania. This disease occurs in South America, East Africa, the Mediterranean, and Asia. There are several treatments with differing success rates, side effects, and costs. Some of the VL patients who seek care in health facilities die, and knowing which patients are at risk of dying is useful for patient management. Indeed, it makes sense to reserve the best treatment and closest follow-up for those patients with the highest risk of dying. We searched the medical literature in December 2018 and found 48 studies evaluating associations between clinical or laboratory factors and risk of dying among VL patients treated in East Africa. These studies described 150,072 VL patients of whom 7,847 (5.2%) died. Factors that were evaluated in five or more studies were analysed further. VL patients were at increased risk of dying if they had jaundice, HIV, tuberculosis, old (more than 45 years) or young (below five years) age, oedema, bleeding, anaemia, malnutrition, long duration of illness, and large spleen size. We recommend to include these factors, which can easily be detected by health professionals, in future studies that aim at improving the prognosis of VL patients.
