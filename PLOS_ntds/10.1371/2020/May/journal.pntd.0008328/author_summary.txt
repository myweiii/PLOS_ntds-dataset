Campylobacter infection is a gastrointestinal bacterial infection that is widespread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Children in poor living conditions are particularly at risk for infection and are often also suffering from poor linear growth. We conducted an analysis of data collected from children in urban Bangladesh who participated in the MAL-ED study, a project that examined the effect of gastrointestinal infection on growth. We used innovative analytic methods to examine the linear growth of the children from 0 to 24 months of age and whether Campylobacter infection as well as household factors were associated with growth. We found that the height of the mother and the birth order of the child had a positive relationship with child’s length at birth. Campylobacter infection was found to have a negative impact on linear growth in children between 12–21 months of age. A longer duration of antibiotic use in the children, as well as the treatment of drinking water in the household had a negative relationship with Campylobacter infection, thus indirectly had a positive effect on the children’s growth. The negative relationship between Campylobacter and growth highlights the importance of reducing infection and addressing associated factors, such as water quality.
