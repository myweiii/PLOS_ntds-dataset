Guinea worm is a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm Dracunculus medinensis. The potential route(s) and risk factors for transmission in dogs are under research. Since 2012, the Chad Guinea Worm Eradication Program (CGWEP) has conducted intensive surveillance to detect infections in dogs in addition to ongoing surveillance to detect cases in humans. In this report, we describe the methods employed by CGWEP to identify canine cases and explore the characteristics of infected dogs. During the period of interest, 2015â€“2018, there were an increased number of canine cases detected by the system, with evidence of better canine case containment over time (i.e., contamination of water was prevented). About 13% of dogs had experienced a previous Guinea worm infection in a different year, suggesting that infection risk is not equally distributed among all dogs over time. Two regions within Chad, Chari Baguirmi and Moyen Chari Regions, reported approximately 80% of all canine cases detected, and a strong seasonal pattern was observed.
