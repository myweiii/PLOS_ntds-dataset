Salmonella and Shigella are responsible for gastrointestinal diseases and continue to remain a serious health hazard in South and South-East Asia and African countries, even more with the emergence of multi drug resistances. Developed vaccines are either not commercialized (for Shigella) or cover only a limited number of serotypes (for Salmonella). There is thus a crucial need to develop cross-protective therapies. By targeting proteins SipD and IpaD belonging respectively to the injectisome of Salmonella and Shigella and necessary to their virulence, we have shown that these proteins are able to induce immune response and a cross-protection in a murine model of infection by Salmonella and Shigella despite relatively weak identity sequence (38%). Such a candidate vaccine offers promising perspectives to control Salmonella and Shigella diseases.
