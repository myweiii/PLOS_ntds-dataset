WHO-defined Neglected Tropical Diseases, including schistosomiasis, are a burden for a significant part of the human world population. The fight against the diecious trematode Schistosoma mansoni can be supported by investigations of the specific molecular communication in male/female and in worm/host interactions. Improving the knowledge about S. mansoni is mandatory, since there is justified fear of the possibility of resistance development against the only available drug Praziquantel. We used mass spectrometry imaging as a powerful tool to provide topographic and tissue-specific information on the parasite. We investigated single male and female worms, as well as mating couples, regarding both, their inner tissue, and their intact surfaces, the tegument. We found highly specific lipid species and visualized their local distributions and abundances in high-resolution molecular images. Our findings may help to improve knowledge of the complex life cycles and of molecular communication mechanisms of schistosomes and may help to develop new drugs and strategies for treatment of the infectious disease.
