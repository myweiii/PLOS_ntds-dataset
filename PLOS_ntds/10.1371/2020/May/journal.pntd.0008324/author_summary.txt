The cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease transmitted by insects. The incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis has increased in Colombia and the state of Norte de Santander is one of the Colombian states where cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission is high. Local changes in rainfall and temperature induced by El Niño and La Niña episodes could change the distribution of the vector. A database of published records and field collections of four vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia was compiled. Also, a database with cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis from Norte de Santander was obtained. Maps of potential distribution in Colombia of the four vectors during the La Niña 2010–2011, Neutral 2012–2015 and El Niño 2015–2016 episodes were elaborated. During the El Niño 2015–2016 episode, two vector species increased their distribution into environmentally suitable areas, and three vector species showed increases in the range of their altitudinal distribution. During the La Niña 2010–2011 episode, a reduction was observed in the area suitable for occupation by two vectors. During the El Niño 2015–2016 episode, the occurrence of at least one cutaneous leishmaniasis case was related to a higher percentage of area with a predicted distribution of four vectors.
