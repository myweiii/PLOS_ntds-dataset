Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are important with regard to public health. However many CNS infections are never diagnosed. In this analysis we investigated spatial and temporal patterns in hospitalized patients with suspected CNS infections in Lao PDR. We found that patients were most likely to come from villages located along major roads and highways. Patients from remote areas may have more difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. The most commonly diagnosed infection in these patients was Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Patients with this disease came from locations that were optimal for the mosquito vectors that spread JEV, rural areas with surface water and during the rainy season. Our analyses suggest that CNS infections should be a priority for public health workers in the region. Diagnostic capabilities should be increased throughout the nation; surveillance efforts should be broadened; and efforts should be increased toward providing easy access to healthcare for rural and remote populations.
