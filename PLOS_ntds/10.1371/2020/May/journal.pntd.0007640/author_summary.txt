Various infectious diseases in humans have been associated with altered expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in negative regulation of gene expression. Herein, we revealed that significant alteration of miRNAs expression occurred in murine liver subsequently to experimental infection with E. multilocularis eggs when compared to non-infected controls. At the early stage of murine AE, hepatic miRNAs were mainly down-regulated. Respective target genes of the most extensively down-regulated miRNAs were involved in angiogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, we found higher mRNA levels of three angiogenic and two lipogenic genes in E. multilocularis infected livers compared to non-infected controls. Angiogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis may be beneficial for development of the E. multilocularis metacestodes. In fact the formation of new blood vessels in the periparasitic area may ensure that parasites are supplied with oxygen and nutrients and get rid of waste products. Additionally, E. multilocularis is not able to undertake de novo fatty acid synthesis, thus lipids must be scavenged from its host. More research on the regulation of the hepatic miRNA transcriptome at more advanced stages of AE is needed.
