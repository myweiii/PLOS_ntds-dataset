Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection of major importance worldwide, affecting not only domestic animals but different wildlife species. Due to its ways of transmission, direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their contaminated biological products, the disease exhibits a strong occupational character. This systematic review addressed the main occupations affected by Brucella spp. infection, due to the regular exposure to aerosol and contact of non-intact skin (e.g. wounds and abrasion) with infected materials, such as carcasses, viscera and live attenuated anti-brucellosis vaccines. The main risk factors for the disease were identified, as well as the most common forms of exposure to the pathogen. In addition, the most frequently Brucella species isolated from farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and veterinary technicians, laboratory workers and hunters were also described. The constant contact with the pathogen, the lack of information and instructions to occupational groups exposed, as well as the low adhesion to personal protective equipment in the work environment are determining factors for the occurrence of brucellosis among these individuals.
