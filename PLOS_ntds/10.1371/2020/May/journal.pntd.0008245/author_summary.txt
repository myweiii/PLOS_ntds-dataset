The human T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) are endemic and neglected in Brazil, and although these viruses were considered to have prognostic value when associated with HIV, e.g., HTLV-1 has been associated with fast progression and death to AIDS and more cases of lymphoma and neurological disorders, and HTLV-2 has been associated with slow progression to AIDS, their impact on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) outcomes remain unknown. The present study analyzed the influence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 coinfection on HBV and HCV virological outcomes (viral load levels and virus clearance during follow-up) in serum samples from 1,910 patients with hepatitis B and 1,315 patients with hepatitis C from SÃ£o Paulo, southeast Brazil. The results obtained confirmed the positive impact of HTLV-2 on HBV and HCV virological outcomes (lower HBV and HCV viral loads and increased HCV clearance when compared with HCV-monoinfected patients) and the opposite effect of HTLV-1; these findings are similar to the effects observed in HIV/AIDS patients. Taking into consideration these results and the differential impact of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in viral hepatitis B and C, we suggest including the serology of HTLV-1/2 in the follow-up of such patients in Brazil.
