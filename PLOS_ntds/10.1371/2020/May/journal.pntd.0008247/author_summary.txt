Leprosy is chronic infectious diseases caused by Mycobacterium leprae that affect the skin and peripheral nerves. The incidence is still high where approximately 200,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. There is no clear sign for early diagnosis and transmission is likely to occur before treatment, which, irrespective of its success, has not hampered stationary incidence in the past 20 years. Thus, there is pressing need for markers that discriminate exposure, infection and disease in order to better detect leprosy progression, control transmission and prevent disabilities. Here, we investigated whether polymorphisms located in eleven genes are associated to leprosy in a population from Amazon state (northern Brazil) which is admixed and it contains the highest proportion of Native American genetic ancestry in Brazil. We validated NOD2 and IFNG associations with resistance and risk of leprosy, respectively, in the Amazon ethnic admixed population. Genetic patterns of leprosy susceptibility could have an impact on the prognosis of individuals that are more likely to develop the disease (among household contacts, for example). Therefore, this strategy could identify high-risk individuals prone for prophylactic measures such as treatment with single-dose rifampicin and BCG vaccination.
