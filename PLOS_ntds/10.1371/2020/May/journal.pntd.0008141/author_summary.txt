Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by different species belonging to the genus Sporothrix. In the past, the disease was usually associated with armadillo hunting and horticulturists, acquired after traumatic inoculation. Nevertheless, from 1997 to 2011, 4,188 human cases of sporotrichosis associated with feline transmissions were recorded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Since then, the disease became an epidemic that is currently spreading within different regions of the country. Nevertheless, pulmonary sporotrichosis, specifically after conidial inhalation (without traumatic inoculation) is still a rare entity. In the present study, a female patient had the habit to have a nap at her workplace in a small room full of stray cats, daily. Tuberculosis was investigated, but the laboratory tests were negative. Then, pulmonary aspergillosis was suspected and Amphotericin B was initiated. A culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which evidenced Sporothrix sp. growth. The final species identification was Sporothrix brasilensis, as demonstrated by PCR. However, the patient evolved to death. This finding reinforces the idea of exploring different possibilities of etiological agents involved in pulmonary infections, specific in areas of the globe where zoonotic sporotrichosis transmitted by cats have been reported.
