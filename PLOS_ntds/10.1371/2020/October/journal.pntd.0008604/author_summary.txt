This paper presents the findings of an evaluation survey conducted in Year 6 of the Kenya National School-Based Deworming (NSBD) Program, following five years (2012–2017) of prior baseline and subsequent impact monitoring. The survey was conducted in 20 counties, covering six regions in Kenya. The survey showed continued and considerable reductions in prevalence over time, with most marked decline for hookworm, followed by Ascaris lumbricoides. Overall, the mass drug administration (MDA) program has driven both STH and schistosomiasis prevalence to relatively low levels, however not to a point where they no longer constitute a public health problem in Kenya. For these neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and STH in particular, there are relatively few published examples of programmatic impact assessments enabling refined decisions regarding helminth control strategies. Kenya’s experiences in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating a high-coverage NSBD program are a continuing and increasingly important success story for the country, which provides learnings of importance for the international community.
