Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in the world, with about 200 million humans infected in 74 tropical countries. The infection of schistosome is initiated when the larvae, cercariae, penetrate the human skin. Proteolytic enzymes are likely involved in the invasion process, but these have yet to be characterized for S. japonicum. Here, we have functionally expressed a recombinant form of the cathepsin B cysteine protease SjCB2 in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Our study showed that SjCB2 degraded a number of proteins associated with the skin and immune systems, and disrupted the structure of the human epidermis. The enzyme was located in the acetabular glands and their ducts in the cercariae, where it would be stored before released into the skin. Antibody-blocking studies revealed that SjCB2 had a 22.94% contribution during the cercariae invasion process. Taken together, our findings suggest that SjCB2 helped cercariae penetrating the skin barrier and evading the immune attack to allow successful infection in the mammalian host.
