The Colombian armed conflict affected vulnerable communities with already precarious governmental and health care assistance. Epidemiological surveillance applied to public health is fundamental to prevent zoonotic diseases in vulnerable Colombian populations. Systematic analysis are needed in order to diagnose the problem, to design, to implement public health practices and to evaluate the interventions associated with the identification of parasitic risk factors. In livestock there are several risks linked to human behaviors that have an impact on the occurrence, dissemination, perpetuity of parasitic agents and the quality of life of people. Therefore, it is required to study the risk of parasitic diseases for the farmer production at the high mountain rural communities of Palmira in the post-conflict period. Overall, this study represents an important approach to understand endemic parasites in high elevations of the Andes region of Colombia, to prevent zoonotic diseases and to recognize the relevance of the One Health approach considering ecosystems, domestic animals, wild animals and human health as a unit.
