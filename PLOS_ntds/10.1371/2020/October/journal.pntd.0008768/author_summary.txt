Vector control is the basis of preventing dengue virus infection. Measurement of dengue vector indices is widely used to monitor dengue control activities, but their utility as predictors of dengue infection is not clear. We used data about vector indices and evidence of recent dengue virus infection from a trial of community mobilization for dengue prevention in Mexico and Nicaragua (Camino Verde), to examine how four standard vector indices could predict dengue infection. Only the Breteau index was associated with evidence of dengue infection, and that only at cluster level. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the Breteau Index was only a weak predictor of infection at cluster level; none of the other indices had predictive value. These findings indicate that the four entomological indices studied were not useful predictors of dengue infection. The results are compatible with the idea of sources of infection outside the household which were tackled by community action in the Camino Verde trial.
