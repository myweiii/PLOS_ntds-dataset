Schistosomiasis, caused by infection with blood fluke schistosomes, is a neglected tropical disease that negatively impacts the lives of approximately 300 million people worldwide. In the absence of a vaccine, it is currently controlled by a single drug, Praziquantel (PZQ). Although incredibly valuable in controlling disease burden, PZQ-mediated chemotherapy is ineffective against juvenile worms and may not be sustainable should resistance develop. The need to identify an alternative or combinatorial drug is, therefore, a priority in contributing to the control of this parasitic disease into the 21st century. In this study, we have identified a new class of anthelmintic, N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are normally used by bacteria for quorum sensing and population density control. The tested N-acyl homoserine lactones were active against all intra-human schistosome lifecycle stages, in particular, when a thiolactone modification to the core N-acyl homoserine ring was made. Interestingly, these N-acyl homoserine lactones also displayed antimicrobial activities against Gram+ Staphylococcus aureus. By demonstrating broad activities against schistosomes and bacteria exemplars, this study identified a potential route for the further development of a new anti-infective class.
