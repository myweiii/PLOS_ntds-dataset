Clonorchis sinensis is a kind of liver fluke whose infection can cause inflammation and, fibrosis around the bile ducts. As type I biological agents (carcinogens) Type, it can also cause bile ductal cancer. However, the mechanisms by which the parasite interacts with host cells and further induce serious sequences are poorly understood. Here, we found a~34 kDa rCsHscB from C. sinensis that can bind with TLR2, a well-known pattern recognition receptor. Importantly, we found that rCsHscB could lead to the activation of macrophage and induce a strong production of cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6 through the TLR2-mediated signaling pathway. Besides, the animal study demonstrated that rCsHscB induce a high production of IL-10 in the wild-type (WT) but not in Tlr2-/- mice. These data showed that rCsHscB from C. sinensis interacted with TLR2 have immune-regulatory abilities, which can be used for other inflammatory disorders in the future beyond parasitology.
