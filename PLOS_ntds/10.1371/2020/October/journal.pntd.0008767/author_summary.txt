Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by the helminth Schistosoma. The control and treatment of the disease rely almost exclusively on praziquantel (PZQ), poorly effective on some developmental stage of the parasite. Identification of novel targets and drugs is required. The aim of this study was to use a 1H-NMR metabolomic approach to characterize the response of Schistosoma mansoni to perhexiline maleate (PHX), a multi-stage schistosomicidal drug previously investigated by our group. Remarkably we identified a metabolic signature specifically associated to drug-treatment in adult male parasites. This approach could contribute to the identification of novel targets and biochemical pathways implicated in parasite development and survival.
