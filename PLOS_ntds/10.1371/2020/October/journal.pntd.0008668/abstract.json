    "Background": "Detection and quantification of snake venom in envenomed patients’ blood is important for identifying the species responsible for the bite, determining administration of antivenom, confirming whether sufficient antivenom has been given, detecting recurrence of envenoming, and in forensic investigation. Currently, snake venom detection is not available in clinical practice in Sri Lanka. This study describes the development of enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to differentiate and quantify venoms of Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii), saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus), common cobra (Naja naja), Indian krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale) in the blood of envenomed patients in Sri Lanka.",
    "Methodology / Principal findings": "A double sandwich EIA of high analytical sensitivity was developed using biotin-streptavidin amplification for detection of venom antigens. Detection and quantification of D. russelii, N. naja, B. caeruleus, and H. hypnale venoms in samples from envenomed patients was achieved with the assay. Minimum (less than 5%) cross reactivity was observed between species, except in the case of closely related species of the same genus (i.e., Hypnale). Persistence/ recurrence of venom detection following D. russelii envenoming is also reported, as well as detection of venom in samples collected after antivenom administration. The lack of specific antivenom for Hypnale sp envenoming allowed the detection of venom antigen in circulation up to 24 hours post bite.",
    "Conclusion": "The EIA developed provides a highly sensitive assay to detect and quantify five types of Sri Lankan snake venoms, and should be useful for toxinological research, clinical studies, and forensic diagnosis."
