Snakebite is a major medical and public health problem in tropical agricultural world. Detection of the type of snake venom and measurement of venom levels in blood are important for snakebite research, selecting the appropriate antivenom, and assessing venom levels in blood at the clinical setting. Currently, a snake venom detection platform is not available in clinical practice in Sri Lanka. This study aimed to develop a double sandwich enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to differentiate and quantify venoms of Russellâ€™s viper (Daboia russelii), saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus), common cobra (Naja naja), Indian krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale) in blood samples of envenomed patients in Sri Lanka. The EIA developed used biotin-streptavidin amplification for detection of venom antigens and showed high analytical sensitivity. The assay allowed the quantification of venoms of the five species in blood samples from envenomed patients. Low level of cross reactivity was noted between species, except in the case of closely related Hypnale species. The presence of D. russelii venom after antivenom treatment is reported, a finding that has implications in the dosing of antivenom in these envenomings. Lack of specific antivenom for H. hypnale envenoming offered an opportunity of study the remaining venom antigen in circulation up to 24 hr post bite. The EIA developed constitutes a useful tool to detect and quantify the five types of Sri Lankan snake venoms, and should be useful for research purposes, as well as for the diagnosis and therapy evaluation of clinical cases of envenomings in this country, and for forensic purposes.
