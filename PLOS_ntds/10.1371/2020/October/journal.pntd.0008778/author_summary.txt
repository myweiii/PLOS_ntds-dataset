Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a serious public health problem and affected Baoji in Shaanxi, China despite onset of free vaccination in populations. Hence, the epidemiology of HFRS was analyzed and a molecular investigation was performed in Baoji. During 1984â€“2019, a total of 13,042 HFRS cases were recorded and three epidemic peaks were observed. Moreover, 275 deaths were registered, with an average fatality rate of 2.10%. Phylogenetic analysis was indicative of directive transmission of Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) from rodents, including nontraditional rodent hosts to humans because viral sequences obtained from patients in Baoji were very closely related to those from rodents. Our limited data indicated a continual spillover of HTNV from rodents to humans occurred in Baoji, responsible for the periodic high prevalence of HFRS, highlighting the need of continuous surveillance of HTNV in rodents and humans. In addition, two novel Dabieshan orthohantavirus (DBSV) lineages were also identified, suggesting its high genetic diversity.
