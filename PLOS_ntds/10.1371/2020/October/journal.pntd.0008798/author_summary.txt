Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by an insect transmitted protist parasite. In South America and Brazil in particular, it causes significant morbidity and mortality, with thousands of human cases and deaths reported every year. Domestic dogs are the most important source of human infection. Controlling the sand flies that transmit the parasite is one way to reduce the number of VL cases and recent research has shown the potential for a new pheromone-based approach to vector control. In a recent cluster-randomised control trial, co-location of a synthetic copy of the male sand fly sex-aggregation pheromone with pyrethroid insecticide reduced numbers of sand flies in households and provided protection for dogs against leishmaniasis infection incidence. The current study was carried out to determine the distance over which the synthetic sex-aggregation pheromone could attract Lu. longipalpis in a peridomestic environment in a Brazilian city. Male and female Lu. longipalpis were attracted up to 30m in one night towards a source of the pheromone. This information will help to inform the optimisation of placement of sex pheromone/insecticide intervention in Brazil.
