Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging RNA virus, belonging to the tick-borne flavivirus family and transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick. Infection can produce severe neurological manifestations, including meningitis and encephalitis, leading to death. Despite the potential for its emergence, currently antiviral therapies are not available to treat or prevent this emerging infection. This situation calls for concern and needs to be addressed. In this study, we have designed and produced a consensus, synthetic enhanced vaccine (SEV) against POWV (POWV-SEV) that focuses on regions of the envelope protein. The effectiveness of this vaccine was evaluated murine models. We have tested the antigen-specific humoral responses to the POWV-SEVs including the induction of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, cellular immunogenicity including identification of dominant epitopes and polyfunctionality of cytokine-producing T-cells were characterized in POWV-SEV administered mice. Finally, we assessed the protective efficacy of POWV-SEV using a murine challenge natural infection model of POWV. These studies are highly novel and support the feasibility of developing an envelope-based synthetic enhanced DNA vaccine to aid in mitigating the public health threat emerging tick-borne viruses may pose to outdoor pets and humans in endemic areas.
