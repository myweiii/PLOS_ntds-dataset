There have been large declines in the number of cases of sleeping sickness as a result of programmes that actively screen and treat the at-risk population. Additional control is needed in areas where the disease persists such as parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The disease is transmitted by tsetse flies, and reducing the tsetse population using Tiny Targets has been shown to control the disease in other countries. Extensive tsetse monitoring has been undertaken in one Health Zone in DRC where Tiny Targets have been deployed. We used these data to gain a better understanding of tsetse habitat, to produce habitat suitability maps, and to subsequently measure the impact of Tiny Targets on the tsetse population. We show that tsetse flies are largely found along rivers and surrounding densely vegetated habitat, with there being a positive relationship between habitat suitability and the number of flies caught. Once Tiny Targets were introduced, the number of flies caught in monitoring traps decreased by >85%, with habitat suitability at the trap location, and the proximity of the trap to the nearest Tiny Target influencing the size of the effect of the intervention. This study adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the impact of Tiny Targets on tsetse distribution in addition to providing information that can be used to guide the expansion of tsetse control activities in this area.
