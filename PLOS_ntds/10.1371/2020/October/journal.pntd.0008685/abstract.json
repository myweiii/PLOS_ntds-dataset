    "Abstract": "Mesocestoides vogae is a cestode parasite of the family Mesocestoididae (order Cyclophyllidea). Its larvae, tetrathyridium, are approximately 1 mm long and 300 \u03bcm wide and infect a wide range of host species including humans. Tetrathyridium migrate through the intestinal wall to invade the peritoneal cavity. Despite intestinal penetration by such a large-sized parasite, symptomatic intestinal disorders are not common during the migration period. In this study, the dynamics of tetrathyridia migration and their pathogenicity towards intestinal tissues were examined in mice infected orally with these parasites. Most tetrathyridia were found to migrate through the intestinal wall, moving into the peritoneal cavity or liver 24 to 48 hours after the oral infections. Next, the pathogenicity of tetrathyridium in the intestinal wall was histopathologically evaluated, and tissue injury from tetrathyridium migration was confirmed. Inflammatory foci were observed as tetrathyridium migration tracks from 48 hours after oral infection; however, the number of inflammatory foci had decreased by half more than 48 hours later. Therefore, we examined the gene expression levels of the macrophage driving cytokine, IL-1\u03b2, and the eosinophil recruiting chemokine, CCL11, by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. The expression levels of these genes in the infected group were significantly lower than those of the non-infected group at 48 hours post-infection. Although the immunomodulating ability of the excretory-secretory products released from tetrathyridium has been previously shown by in vitro assays, the significance of this ability in their lifecycle has remained unclear. In this study, we discovered that tetrathyridium causes temporal inflammation in the intestinal wall during penetration and large-scale migration in this organ, but tetrathyridium simultaneously suppresses the host\u2019s inflammatory gene expression, might to be a strategy that reduces inflammatory responses and increases survival of the parasite."
