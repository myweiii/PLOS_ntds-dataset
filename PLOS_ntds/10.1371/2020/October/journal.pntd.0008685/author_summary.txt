Excretory-secretory (ES) products are released by parasitic helminths into their migration sites and/or the intestinal regions they inhabit where parasite and host immune responses interact. ES products are release by a wide range of parasitic helminths, some of which are known to modulate the host’s immune system. Some ES products from some cestode parasites are known to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from artificially stimulated cells under in vitro conditions. However, the immunomodulatory properties of the ES products have only been observed with in vitro experimental models and the biological consequences of their potential ability to suppress the host’s immune system during the parasite’s lifecycle and how they affect host–parasite interactions await discovery. Our results show that tetrathyridium, the larval stage of the Mesocestoides vogae cestode, strongly inhibits the host’s inflammatory gene expression in the injured intestinal wall, and that the inflammatory hot-spots caused by larval migration disappear almost immediately after mice are orally infected with these parasites. The ability to suppress the host’s inflammatory gene expression when larvae migrate through and damage the host’s tissues is an effective survival strategy for M. vogae intestinal parasites.
