Orthobunyaviruses are commonly implicated as causes of CNS disease. Well known examples include La Crosse virus, the primary cause of encephalitis in children in the United States, and Schmallenberg virus, responsible for causing large outbreaks of CNS defects in newborn ruminants in Europe and Asia. In addition, several other less-known and novel orthobunyaviruses have also been implicated in CNS disease, yet association does not imply causality. Considering that nearly one hundred orthobunyaviruses are known to date and more are discovered every year, it is important to determine which orthobunyaviruses are relevant in the context of CNS disease, yet an overview of such information was lacking. To solve this problem, we first identified all orthobunyaviruses associated with CNS disease in literature and subsequently–given that the classical causality indicators are unfit for orthobunyaviral CNS disease–evaluated the strength of causality for each virus using tailor-made causality indicators. The results provide a comprehensible overview of orthobunyaviral CNS disease which can be used to guide future research.
