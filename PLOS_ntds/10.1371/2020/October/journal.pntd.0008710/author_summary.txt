Accurate and timely forecasts of dengue fever can help mitigate the impact of the disease. Currently, regression and time series models are frequently used to predict dengue cases and outbreaks. However, these models may be limited in terms of model assumptions and the number of predictors that can be included. Machine learning (ML) models offer an appealing alternative as they have a nonlinear framework and can be applied to high dimensional data. In this study, we compared the performance of ML algorithms with that of regression and time series models in predicting dengue cases and outbreaks from 4 to up to 12 weeks in advance in 3 dengue-endemic regions. Model predictions were based upon local dengue surveillance (e.g., case counts), population, temporal, and weather data. Many countries lack sufficient health surveillance infrastructure, as such we evaluated the contribution of dengue surveillance and weather data on the predictive power of the models. Our results identified 2 scenarios when ML models performed better than conventional models: 1) predicting dengue weekly case counts 4 weeks ahead when dengue surveillance data are available and 2) predicting weekly dengue outbreaks 12 weeks ahead when dengue surveillance data are unavailable. This research suggests that ML models can be a beneficial tool for dengue early warning systems.
