Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. The disease is caused by repeated eye infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and characterized clinically in its active stage by follicles (TF) and/or severe inflammation (TI). Scarring of the inner surface of the eyelid results from repeated exposure to infection during childhood, and while active trachoma is mostly observed in childhood, scarring and late complications are often only seen in adulthood. In areas with heavy burden of trachoma, scarring may be observed among children, particularly among those with constant, severe trachoma and/or infection. Few studies have examined the incidence and progression of scarring in children in areas where the prevalence of trachoma has been substantially reduced. In this study, we examined the 2-year incidence and progression of scarring in Kongwa district, Tanzania where the prevalence of TF was about 5%. Incidence of new scarring was 0.8%/year and more common among girls. Progression of scarring was 21% in our cohort of children ages 1â€“9 years. Incidence in children was low in this formerly hyper-endemic area, but a substantial fraction of those with scarring at baseline demonstrated progression over the follow-up period. These data provide support for the thesis that without repeated exposure to trachoma, incident scarring is low, but other mechanisms for progression of scarring apart from ongoing transmission are operating, at least in children.
