Plasmodium vivax is the geographically most widespread human malaria parasite and causes 80% of the malaria burden in the Americas. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to explore levels of parasite relatedness and infer P. vivax transmission networks in the upper Juru√° Valley, the main transmission hotspot in Amazonian Brazil. We characterize a genetically diverse population that displays significant linkage disequilibrium, consistent with the local circulation of highly inbred but genetically distant parasite lineages. Noteworthy, these discrete lineages remain stable over time and share recent ancestry with parasites at a large geographic distance. These results illustrate the power of genomic epidemiology approaches to map potential source parasite populations and prioritize areas for targeted control interventions to eliminate residual P. vivax transmission in the Amazon and similar endemic settings worldwide.
