    "Background": "Plasmodium vivax is a neglected human malaria parasite that causes significant morbidity in the Americas, the Middle East, Asia, and the Western Pacific. Population genomic approaches remain little explored to map local and regional transmission pathways of P. vivax across the main endemic sites in the Americas, where great progress has been made towards malaria elimination over the past decades.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We analyze 38 patient-derived P. vivax genome sequences from M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML)\u2013the Amazonian malaria hotspot next to the Brazil-Peru border\u2014and 24 sequences from two other sites in Acre State, Brazil, a country that contributes 23% of malaria cases in the Americas. We show that the P. vivax population of ML is genetically diverse (\u03c0 = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124), with a high polymorphism particularly in genes encoding proteins putatively involved in red blood cell invasion. Paradoxically, however, parasites display strong genome-wide linkage disequilibrium, being fragmented into discrete lineages that are remarkably stable across time and space, with only occasional recombination between them. Using identity-by-descent approaches, we identified a large cluster of closely related sequences that comprises 16 of 38 genomes sampled in ML over 26 months. Importantly, we found significant ancestry sharing between parasites at a large geographic distance, consistent with substantial gene flow between regional P. vivax populations.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "We have characterized the sustained expansion of highly inbred P. vivax lineages in a malaria hotspot that can seed regional transmission. Potential source populations in hotspots represent a priority target for malaria elimination in the Amazon."
