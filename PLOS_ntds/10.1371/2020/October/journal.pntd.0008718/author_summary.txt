Mass de-worming is recommended by the World Health Organisation in communities with a heavy burden of worms, but coverage can be sub-optimal. We used data from a four-year long cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a heavy worm burden area on Lake Victoria, Uganda, to investigate coverage of community-delivered albendazole and praziquantel treatment. We also investigated which factors were associated with receipt of treatment and with refusal. We found that, on average, a lower proportion of residents received praziquantel than albendazole, and that absence and refusal were the most common reasons for not receiving treatment. In the absence of adequate provision of water and sanitation, or of an effective vaccine, innovative approaches to increasing treatment coverage are likely to be needed to substantially reduce worm prevalence.
