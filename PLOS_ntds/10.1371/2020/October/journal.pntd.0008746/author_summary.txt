Leprosy as a chronic infectious disease that affects the skin and nervous system is treated with a treatment cocktail, including rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone. Unfortunately, one of these drugs, namely dapsone, may cause the patient to exhibit adverse symptoms that appear as skin hypersensitivity and may potentially lead to death up to 9.9% of the time. In a previous study, it has been established that this adverse drug reaction, which is called dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS), is associated with an allele in the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-B*13:01. In the light of validating the association of HLA-B*13:01 with DHS in a leprosy endemic area like Indonesia, we conducted a study involving leprosy patients who had DHS during the course of their multi-drug treatment as well as leprosy patients who managed to complete their course of treatment without exhibiting DHS. The results of this study validated the association of HLA-B*13:01 and DHS at a very significant level of evidence and the odds of people carrying at least one allele is 233.3-times the risk of non-carriers. This allele was also able to predict a person at risk of DHS 95% of the time. Thus, screening of HLA-B*13:01 to prevent DHS is warranted.
