Nucleic acid amplification methods allow for a sensitive detection and specific identification of a number of pathogens, including Trypanosoma parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). However, conventional molecular tools such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly resource-demanding and time-consuming and are seldom used in HAT-endemic countries. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) provides a promising alternative to the conventional PCR, as this technique can amplify nucleic acids under isothermal conditions using minimal resources within one hour. In this study, we established a protocol to produce a dried-format LAMP kit for the diagnosis of HAT, that used a bio-ink-jet printer machine. The produced test kit (CZC-LAMP HAT and CZC-LAMP rHAT) was determined to be stable for up to 180 days at room temperature. The test provided a good performance for the detection of the trypanosome parasites using both DNA and crude blood samples, and the test results were comparable to those obtained from PCR. The findings from this study suggest that the dried LAMP test can be useful for the diagnosis of HAT, particularly in areas where laboratory resources are limited.
