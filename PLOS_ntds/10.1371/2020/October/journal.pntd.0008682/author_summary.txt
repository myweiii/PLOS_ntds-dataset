Ever since the emergence of Extensively Drug Resistant (XDR) Typhoid fever in Pakistan, which is resistant to all but two classes of anti-microbials, we need to find an effective treatment plan so that S.Typhi does not also make these anti-microbials redundant in the future. In this retrospective case series review, we observed the response of XDR Typhoid fever patients treated with meropenem or azithromycin or combination of both. All 3 groups showed a similar therapeutic response based on number of complications developed and time taken for fever clearance. The higher price of meropenem however could become a deterrent to its use in poor socio-economic areas. This new knowledge may contribute to better treatment plans in handling XDR enteric fever in the future whilst also serving as a rough guide in how to treat patients with XDR Typhoid fever in the present.
