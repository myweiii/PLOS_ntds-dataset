Preschool-aged children (PSAC), i.e. aged â‰¤ 6 years, are not included in preventative chemotherapy programmes, currently advocated by the WHO for the treatment of schistosomiasis. This is due to the lack of a paediatric formulation of the drug of choice, praziquantel, and the current guidelines which requires diagnosis before treatment. As the global community prepares for the deployment of a new paediatric formulation of praziquantel, there is a need to find a strategy to quantify infection in this age group. In schistosome endemic areas, infection levels in school-aged children (SAC) are already used to inform infection levels in the community. Thus, we investigated the relationship between SAC and PSAC schistosome prevalence levels within the same community, to determine if data from SAC could be used to predict infection levels in PSAC. Our results show that PSAC prevalence levels are significantly correlated with SAC prevalence levels. Our findings are applicable to communities that have received preventative chemotherapy in SAC or in SAC and adults, as well as those that have not received any. Our study indicates that it is possible to extrapolate PSAC prevalence levels from SAC prevalence, and to make a treatment decision on that basis.
