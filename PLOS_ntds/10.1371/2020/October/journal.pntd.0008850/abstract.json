    "Abstract": "Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). In lepromatous leprosy (LL), skin macrophages, harboring extensive bacterial multiplication, gain a distinctive foamy appearance due to increased intracellular lipid load. To determine the mechanism by which M. leprae modifies the lipid homeostasis in host cells, an in vitro M. leprae infection system, using human macrophage precursor THP-1 cells and M. leprae prepared from the footpads of nude mice, was employed. RNA extracted from skin smear samples of patients was used to investigate host gene expressions before and after multidrug therapy (MDT). We found that a cluster of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target genes associated with adipocyte differentiation were strongly induced in M. leprae-infected THP-1 cells, with increased intracellular lipid accumulation. PPAR-\u03b4 and PPAR-\u03b3 expressions were induced by M. leprae infection in a bacterial load-dependent manner, and their proteins underwent nuclear translocalization after infection, indicating activation of PPAR signaling in host cells. Either PPAR-\u03b4 or PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist abolished the effect of M. leprae to modify host gene expressions and inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation in host cells. M. leprae-specific gene expressions were detected in the skin smear samples both before and after MDT, whereas PPAR target gene expressions were dramatically diminished after MDT. These results suggest that M. leprae infection activates host PPAR signaling to induce an array of adipocyte differentiation-associated genes, leading to accumulation of intracellular lipids to accommodate M. leprae parasitization. Certain PPAR target genes in skin lesions may serve as biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy."
