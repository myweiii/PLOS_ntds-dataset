Selenium is both a toxic compound and a micronutrient. As a micronutrient, it participates in the synthesis of specific proteins, selenoproteins, as the amino acid selenocysteine. The synthesis of selenocysteine is present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. The protist parasites of the Trypanosomatidae family, that cause major tropical diseases, conserve the complex machinery responsible for selenocysteine biosynthesis and incorporation in selenoproteins. However, this pathway has been considered dispensable for the parasitic protist cells. This has intrigued us, and lead to question that if maintained in the cell it should be under selective pressure and therefore be necessary. Also, extensive and dynamic protein-protein interactions must happen to deliver selenium-containing intermediates along the pathway in order to warrant efficient usage of biological selenium in the cell. In this study we have investigated the molecular interactions of different proteins involved in selenocysteine synthesis and its putative involvement in the endoplasmic reticulum redox homeostasis.
