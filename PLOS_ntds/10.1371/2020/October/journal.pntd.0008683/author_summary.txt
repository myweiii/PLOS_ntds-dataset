Powassan disease has greatly increased in frequency since its discovery in Powassan, Ontario in 1958. Powassan virus (lineage I; POWV) and Powassan virus lineage II (deer tick virus; DTV) are endemic to North America and there were 133 reported cases between 2009 and 2018, the majority since 2016. Nymphal and adult Ixodes scapularis ticks are thought to be the primary vectors of POWV/DTV to humans. However, little is known regarding DTV infection of male Ixodes ticks or their potential as vectors. In this study we characterized LGTV, a model tick-borne flavivirus, and DTV infection and propagation in male I. scapularis salivary gland cultures using an ex vivo organ culture system. This work provides insight into potential flavivirus transmission by the male I. scapularis tick.
