This report describes the clinical course and final clinical outcomes of the full spectrum of disease severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluates risk factors of pneumonia in 193 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had mild disease. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in approximately 40% of patients. Older age, obesity, and higher grade of fever at presentation were independent risk factors of pneumonia in adult patients with COVID-19. Most patients in our cohort recovered and were discharged from hospital (recovery rate, 98%). Our findings can help the public health systems to estimate the burden of the disease and identify vulnerable patients in a timely manner.
