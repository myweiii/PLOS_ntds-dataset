Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic skin infection characterized by one or more skin lesions. Depending on the location of the lesions, patients may experience difficulties in their day-to-day life including stigma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life of CL patients with lesions. We collected the data among 163 CL patients with two different questionnaires assessing various parts of their quality of life; 46 patients provided additional information through in depth interviews. All patients were divided in four groups according to location of lesions on the body: head and face, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk. We found that patients experienced more difficulties when lesions were located on the lower limbs. Little to no social stigma was reported in the in-depth interviews. The study concluded that Surinamese patients with lesions on the lower limbs had a lower quality of life compared to other body locations.
