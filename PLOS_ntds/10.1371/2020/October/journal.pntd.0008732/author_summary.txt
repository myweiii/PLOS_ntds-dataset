Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection is a foodborne disease with a global heavy burden. NTS usually causes diarrheal enterocolitis in humans and may also cause severe invasive NTS (iNTS) infections. Antimicrobial agents are not recommended for non-severe NTS diarrhea, but they are recommended for people at risk of severe or invasive infection. However, the recognition of iNTS infection among children is difficult before culture. We studied children who had NTS infections in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ningbo and found that iNTS infections were more likely to occur in infants â‰¤6 months or children with an underlying medical condition of leukemia at admission, while diarrhea was more common in children with non-iNTS infections. The high rates of antibiotic resistance among children with NTS in Ningbo calls for continuous NTS surveillance. On the other hand, high temperatures and heavy rainfall were positively associated with NTS hospitalizations among children. These findings may help us to improve measures for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of NTS infections among children.
