The genetic and molecular epidemiological studies on small mammals derived from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)-endemic areas have consistently conducted for the public health surveillance and mitigation of orthohantavirus outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Implementing viral genome-based surveillance at new expansion sites that may identify HFRS risks is critical for tracking the location of orthohantavirus infections and diagnosing HFRS. In the present study, whole-genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from small mammals in Gangwon Province were recovered using multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing during 2015â€“2018. In HFRS-endemic regions including Cheorwon-gun, Chuncheon-si, and Hwacheon-gun, additional HTNV genome sequences contribute to establish a high-resolution phylogeographic map for tracking emerging orthohantavirus-induced diseases. The cline analysis revealed a remarkable hybrid zone by showing spatial contact regions of HTNV at two sites (Cheorwon-gun and Hwacheon-gun) and the spatial separation and sequence divergence across genome segments of HTNV in Gangwon Province. These results demonstrate the genetic diversity and hybrid zone of HTNV circulating in Gangwon Province. These findings increase an awareness raising about HFRS in the endemic area of ROK.
