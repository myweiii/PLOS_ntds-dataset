The tapeworm Taenia solium causes epilepsy and severe headaches in humans and economic losses to smallholder farmers in endemic areas where free-roaming pigs, poor sanitation and informal animal slaughter are prevalent. Treatment of human taeniosis and interventions in pigs (vaccination and anthelmintic treatment) have been established as essential tools to achieve short-term control, but health education will be crucial to sustain long-term control. ‘The Vicious Worm’ is a specific T. solium health education tool aiming to convey simple and meaningful messages concerning disease prevention and control. Previous studies found significant knowledge increases after the use of the educational tool in Tanzanian medical and agricultural professionals, and Zambian primary school students. We organized half-day educational workshops using ‘The Vicious Worm’ for pork supply chain workers at two study sites in Zambia, with follow-up visits three weeks later. We found a significant increase in participants’ knowledge, both immediately and three weeks after the health education. Furthermore, the program was well received and potentially led to attitudinal and behavioral change that could deter the propagation of T. solium. We conclude that ‘The Vicious Worm’ educational interventions may contribute to a safer pork supply chain and we encourage its implementation in future T. solium control strategies.
