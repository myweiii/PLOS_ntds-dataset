Since the beginning of the HIV pandemic in 1980, infections due to isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complexes have caused many deaths worldwide, especially in the HIV-infected population. Annually, approximately one-third, of all AIDS-related deaths,—representing more than 1,000,000 cases,—are caused by cryptococcosis. Since 1980, extensive molecular epidemiological surveys have been conducted, and the VNI molecular type has been found to be responsible for more than 90% of cryptococcosis in HIV patients. Whether the high VNI prevalence is associated with the HIV pandemic remains controversial as information on the isolates of the pre-HIV pandemic era is lacking. Therefore, this study of the molecular epidemiology and in vitro characteristics of the strains from the pre-HIV-pandemic era was undertaken. We found that only 64% of cryptococcosis was caused by VNI, and 9 sequence types existed only in the pre-HIV pandemic era. Unlike what was already known about the strains collected during the HIV pandemic era, ST5 and VGIIIa,—supposedly high virulence genotypes,—did not express higher virulence factors than other genotypes. These results implied that the HIV pandemic altered both the molecular epidemiology and virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complexes have been altered during HIV pandemic. However, detailed mechanism of these alteration remains to be deciphered further.
