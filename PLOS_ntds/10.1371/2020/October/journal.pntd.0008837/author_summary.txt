This landscape analysis explored successful concepts, approaches and interventions of past and ongoing parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination efforts and programs with regard to relevance for progress in the elimination of human schistosome infections. Schistosomiasis is a disabling, water borne parasitic disease of public health concern with an estimated 250 million people infected worldwide. The long-term morbidity of this neglected tropical disease significantly impacts growth, cognition and socioeconomic development at all ages. Despite increased global efforts to control morbidity and advance elimination, challenges in view of the complex life cycle which involves freshwater sources, intermediate snail hosts and humans, remain. This calls for targeted interventions and concerted programs. According to the evidence from the literature and as proposed by a wide range of key informants, comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies supported by strong political commitment and adequate funding are required in order to achieve and sustain the set goals. Based on the findings, we propose here a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination for review and evaluation to inform implementation research needs and elimination program design.
