This study shows that there are lower levels of total antioxidant capacity and higher levels of total plasma peroxide, malondialdehyde in leprosy patients undergoing multidrug therapy and those relieved from treatment and higher levels of 8-OHdg and oxidative stress index in leprosy patients undergoing multidrug therapy. This is suggestive of increased oxidative stress, in multibacillary leprosy patients irrespective of drug treatment status and increased oxidative DNA damage in those undergoing multidrug therapy. Antioxidants supplementation may be beneficial in the treatment of leprosy to protect against the effects of oxidative stress and DNA damage. Leprosy patients relieved from treatment may be susceptible to cardiovascular events as shown by higher levels of VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and atherogenic index of plasma observed in that group compared to controls. It therefore points to the need to monitor cardiovascular comorbidities in patients on multidrug therapy and those released from therapy.
