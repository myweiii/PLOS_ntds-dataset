Tsutsugamushi disease (TD) is a natural focal disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is widespread in some areas. The incidence of TD is greatly influenced by meteorological factors. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the epidemiological features of TD, investigate chigger mites and their hosts, and explore the relationship between meteorological factors and TD incidence and whether meteorological factors affect the host of O. tsutsugamushi in Xiamen city, China. The results showed significant positive correlations between the number of reported cases and average temperature, sunshine duration, and rainfall. A positive correlation between rat density and average temperature. No correlations were observed between the rat density and sunshine duration and rainfall. We believe our findings may provide scientific basis for studies or health strategies conducted in areas that are meteorologically similar in characteristics with Xiamen city, China.
