A number of diagnostic tests for HAT have recently been developed, to improve case detection. We report on the use of these technologies in a strategy to increase coverage and early detection of HAT cases in Kongo Central province of DRC.
All 620 health facilities in the focus were equipped with RDTs to test patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HAT. Among these health facilities, 23 were upgraded to perform confirmatory testing, for a final diagnosis.
This strategy has reduced the distance a patient travels to a facility screening for HAT, from 13.7km to 3.4km. From August 2015 to December 2016, the proportion of HAT cases detected, adjusted annually, increased by between 30% and 130% compared to the previous two years, and 64% of them were in early stage disease, compared to 27% previously. This strategy has enabled better population coverage, and when supplemented with reactive screening, the identification of local outbreaks and early detection of most cases, which is critical in removing the HAT reservoir and interrupting transmission, thus contributing to elimination of the disease.
