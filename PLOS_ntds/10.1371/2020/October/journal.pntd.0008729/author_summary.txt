The olfactory system of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is highly tuned for the detection of human odorants, as well as other chemical cues influencing host and food-search behavior, egg-laying and mating. To provide insights into the neuroanatomical organization of the olfactory system of this globally important disease vector, we have generated an updated in vitro atlas for the primary smell processing center of the Ae. aegypti brain, called the antennal lobe. These new guide maps facilitate systematic interrogation of antennal lobe morphology and naming of associated substructures in dissected brain samples of this species labeled with two common neural staining methods. We report that landmark features of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe morphology and spatial organization appear conserved between mosquito sexes and across geographically divergent strains of this mosquito species. An improved understanding of Ae. aegypti antennal lobe neuroanatomy and how attractive or repellent odorant stimuli are encoded in this brain center has the potential to rapidly accelerate reverse engineering of synthetic chemical blends that effectively lure, confuse or repel this major disease vector.
