Lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by nematode parasiteâ€“Wuchereria bancrofti, is prevalent in 72 countries with about 1.39 billion people facing the risk of infection. In India LF is endemic in 256 districts. A physiological variant of the parasite, the diurnally sub-periodic Wb (DspWb) is confined to a small pocket of four remotely located isles, in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The parasite is transmitted by a day-biting and forest dwelling mosquito, Aedes niveus. Even after 9 rounds of Mass Drug Administration under the National Programme for LF elimination, microfilaria prevalence was above transmission threshold level (1%), indicating continued transmission. We studied filarial infection in Ae. niveus using molecular xenomonitoring (MX). The vector mosquito was sampled using BioGents Sentinel, Gravid and human baited double bed net-traps. Since the traps did not yield adequate numbers, man landing collections were carried out. The prevalence filarial infection in mosquitoes assessed by molecular assay was above the provisional threshold level (<0.1%.), confirming that the transmission has not been interrupted. MX protocol can further be standardised for use as a surveillance tool in assessing the impact of MDA in this vector-parasite combination.
