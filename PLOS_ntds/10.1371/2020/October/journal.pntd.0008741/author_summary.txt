Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected illness affecting economically vulnerable populations in more than 80 countries. Approximately 90% of the cases registered in Latin American occur in Brazil, where more than 7% of cases are also HIV-infected, and the public health system sustains the costs of illness. Considering the importance of correct diagnosis for VL control and for the optimal use of limited public health resources, we present a cost-effectiveness analysis of the available tests in Brazil up to 2019, stratified according to HIV status. In the different analyses performed, a national noncommercial direct agglutination test (DAT-LPC) and the rapid test IT LEISH were the most cost-effective diagnostic tests. DAT-LPC is especially cost-effective for VL screening among HIV-infected patients, presenting the lowest cost and highest effectiveness. DAT-LPC and IT LEISH are tests that can be performed in laboratories with minimal installed infrastructure, allowing cost-effective strategies for the diagnostic investigation of cases with VL symptoms. The results confirm the importance of cost-effectiveness analyses prior to the incorporation of new health technologies.
