    "Abstract": "Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe and potentially fatal parasitic disease if not correctly diagnosed and treated. Brazil is one of the three countries most endemic for VL and, like most countries affected by this disease, has a large budget constraint for the incorporation of new health technologies. Although different diagnostic tests for VL are currently available in the country, economic studies evaluating diagnostic kits are scarce. The objective of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the nine available diagnostic tests for human VL in HIV-infected and uninfected patients in Brazil. The perspective of analysis was the Brazilian public health system, and the outcome of interest was \"cases diagnosed correctly\". The costs of the tests were estimated using the microcosting technique, and comparisons were performed with decision trees. Sensitivity analyses were explored applying variations in cost and effectiveness values. For VL diagnosis among HIV-uninfected patients, using blood samples for the rapid tests (RDTs), the noncommercial direct agglutination test (DAT-LPC) and IT-LEISH were cost-effective tests compared with the baseline OnSite test, but they presented different incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of US$7.04 and US$ 205.40, respectively. Among HIV-infected patients, DAT-LPC was the most cost-effective diagnostic test. Comparisons among the tests with the same methodology, based on the low ICER values, revealed that IT-LEISH was the most cost-effective test among the RDTs and the Ridascreen Leishmania Ab among the ELISA tests. These results confirm that cost-effectiveness analyses can provide useful information to support the incorporation of new health technologies within a known scenario and willingness to pay threshold. It was observed that tests based on the same methodologies presented different cost-effectiveness ratios for the same group of patients and that different tests should be recommended for different patient groups. DAT-LPC was an important cost-effective strategy for all patients, requiring minimum laboratorial infrastructure, and IT-LEISH was the cost-effective test for VL screening in HIV-uninfected patients. IT-LEISH and DAT-LPC have complementary profiles and should both be provided by the Brazilian health system."
