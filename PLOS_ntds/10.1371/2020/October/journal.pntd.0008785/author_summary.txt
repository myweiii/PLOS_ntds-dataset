The pork tapeworm T. solium affects the health and income of poor people in endemic areas. A pig vaccine—TSOL18, and a drug—oxfendazole (OFZ) present options for its control. In this study we assessed the effectiveness of the two tools against the parasite in pigs. We provided one group of pigs (T1) with a concurrent administration of TSOL18 and OFZ, and another group (T2) with OFZ only, in three rounds at 4 months intervals. We compared infection prevalence before and after the interventions by detection of cysticerci through carcase dissections. In addition, untreated pigs from the T1 and T2 areas were also sacrificed to serve as controls. We found a significant reduction in prevalence within the groups after the interventions. However, the reductions were not significant when compared with the reductions in the control groups, hence could not be definitively attributed to the interventions. Further, concurrent administration of TSOL18 and OFZ cleared infection among assessed pigs whereas OFZ alone did not clear the infection. Further studies would be required to make more definitive conclusions. We advocate for a One Health approach for a more rapid and sustainable impact.
