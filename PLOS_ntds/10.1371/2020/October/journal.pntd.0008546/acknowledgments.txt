We thank all the Grenadian mothers and their children who agreed to travel to health clinics and participate in the study. We thank the nurses and other healthcare professionals in the clinics who hosted our research teams and gave freely of their time. We thank the Grenada Ministry of Health and Chief Medical Officer; without whose support this study would not have been possible.
