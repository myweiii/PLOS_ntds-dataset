Schistosomiasis is a major infectious disease of humans and animals, and is a global concern. In China, it is endemically found across 12 provinces along the Yangtze River and in the area south of the river. According to the “13th Five-Year Plan for National Schistosomiasis Control”, by the end of 2020, schistosomiasis epidemic will continue to decline towards eradication throughout China. However, the control and elimination of its intermediate snail host, Oncomelania hupensis, is crucial for blocking schistosomiasis transmissions in China. Therefore, further understanding, surveillance, and control of O. hupensis distribution is critical to protect the health of individuals in endemic areas and to formulate relevant prevention and control strategies in order to reduce the burden of schistosomiasis, and ultimately overcome this epidemic. In this study, we reviewed local chronicles and annual records and extensively surveyed Hubei Province to collect information on the historical, current, and suspected habitats of O. hupensis. Subsequently, we used various geospatial tools (ArcGIS and Google Earth) to visualize the spatial distributions of habitats. Our study provides valuable data that will facilitate more effective habitat management of this intermediate host species and contribute to more precise management of schistosomiasis in China.
