Typhoid fever is a disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and remains a significant health burden in the developing world, with an estimated 11 million cases that result in ~116,000 annual deaths. Although the widely available unconjugated typhoid fever vaccines provide some level of protection for adults, they are not approved for young children and infants, whom are at higher risk of disease than previously documented. However, conjugate vaccines that target the predominant cell surface Vi polysaccharide have been recently approved for use in these two age groups in endemic typhoid areas. As an alternative to conjugate vaccines, Matrivax has developed Typhax, a novel typhoid Protein Capsular Matrix Vaccine, or ‘virtual conjugate’ that consists of Vi antigen, non-covalently entrapped in a protein matrix. Here we describe the safety and immunogenicity results of a Phase 1 clinical study of three dose levels of Typhax administered in a two-dose regimen in healthy subjects. Overall, Typhax was well tolerated at all three dose levels and elicited comparable antibody titers and seroconversion at the 2.5 and 10 μg dose levels to the commercial FDA licensed vaccine, Typhim Vi (25 μg dose) after a single administration. These findings support the further clinical evaluation of Typhax as a typhoid fever vaccine candidate.
