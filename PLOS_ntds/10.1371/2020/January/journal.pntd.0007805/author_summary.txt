Typhoid fever is a serious illness caused by a bacterial infection in the blood. Typhoid spreads through contaminated water sources, poor sanitation or poor hygiene, and occurs most often in low-resource environments, with children being most at risk. It is hard to determine how common typhoid infections are in low-resource setting as there are many pathogens that can cause diseases with similar characteristics, and not all patients present to health-care facilities. The culture test to detect the presence of bacteria in the blood is poorly sensitive, costly to perform, and not available in all facilities. Therefore, true disease cases often go undetected, resulting in an underestimation of the true burden of disease. We examined factors associated with blood culture collection in fever patients attending typhoid surveillance clinics in Kathmandu, Nepal. We aimed to determine whether those who did not have a blood culture were different in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics to those who did have blood taken for culture and, additionally, whether they were more or less likely to test blood culture positive for typhoid fever. We provide estimates of inflation factors that can be used to adjust the crude incidence rate to account for the under-detection of typhoid cases.
