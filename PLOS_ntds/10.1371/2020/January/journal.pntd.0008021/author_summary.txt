Dogs are the main reservoir of Leishmania infantum, a protozoan parasite that causes lethal systemic disease in human beings (Visceral Leishmaniasis, VL) and dogs (Canine Leishmaniasis, CanL). In dogs, the disease is often associated with extensive skin lesions. Curbing canine infection could help control human VL. Currently available drugs are not effective in treating CanL, and treated dogs frequently relapse, even when removed from an endemic area. Developing new drugs or alternative therapeutic strategies are essential for the proper treatment of CanL. Dogs that acquire the parasite can develop the disease or control the infection, depending on the bodyâ€™s immune response. Cellular immune responses lead to infection control and prevent the disease from developing. Some proteins called cytokines, produced mainly by cells of the immune system, can favor the development of cellular immune responses. In this study, several recombinant cytokines and/or one cytokine blocking protein were tested, alone or in combination, for their ability to promote cellular immune response in dogs with leishmaniasis. One of the combinations of recombinant protein tested was the best at facilitating this cellular immune response. The findings reported here are encouraging and indicate the use of a combination of two recombinant cytokines (rcaIL-12/rcaIL-15) in future immunotherapeutic trials for CanL.
