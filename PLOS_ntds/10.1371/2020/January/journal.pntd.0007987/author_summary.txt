One risk factor for Chagas disease is whether its insect vector is present in a person’s home. Although excluding these vectors–triatomine bugs–is important, we will need to know what predicts a person’s intention to exclude bugs from their homes and what kinds of messages we should use to promote intentions to exclude bugs. This study applied the Health Belief Model to identify predictors of people’s intentions. We surveyed 112 heads of household in five communities in Loja province, Ecuador, to examine five predictors of people’s intentions. We looked at perceived severity (how bad people think bugs bits are), susceptibility (how likely they think a bite is), benefits to action, barriers to action, and self-efficacy (the feeling that they can act). Community members reported strong intentions to prevent bugs from entering homes. Perceived susceptibility and severity predict behavioral intention poorly; perceived barriers and self-efficacy are better predictors. These intentions, however, do not directly lead to lower rates of infestation. Based on these findings, if we want to persuade people to try to prevent infestation of the home, we should send messages about self-efficacy in participating in surveillance systems and overcoming barriers to small-scale action that reduce likelihood of infestation. A focus on risk should not be the central message when designing and implementing educational interventions. In addition to promoting better messages, we must also attend to people’s actual behaviors and the actual efficacy of these behaviors if we want the fullest enactment of the Health Belief Model in promoting effective change.
