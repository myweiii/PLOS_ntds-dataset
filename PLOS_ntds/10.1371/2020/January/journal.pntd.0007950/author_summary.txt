Leptospirosis is a neglected disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira that affects humans and animals. Hosts contract Leptospira after exposure to contaminated water through cuts and bruises on skin and mucous membranes. We hypothesized that the route of infection may affect the kinetics of Leptospira dissemination to tissues and leptospirosis progression. In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcomes, and kidney colonization and inflammation after exposure of mice to pathogenic Leptospira using three natural routes of infection. In contrast to transdermal and nasal mucosa, infection through oral mucosa did not cause weight loss and did not result in renal colonization or inflammation. We also found that different natural routes of infection affect the timing at which Leptospira gain access to blood for dissemination, as well as bacterial burden and levels of pro-inflammatory markers in kidney. Precise timing of bacterial dissemination in blood and urine are important differences to consider for assessment of clinical signs of leptospirosis and for development of diagnostic assays for direct detection of Leptospira in human and veterinary biological samples. These studies also provide disease model tools in which to test the efficacy of vaccine candidates using natural routes of infection.
