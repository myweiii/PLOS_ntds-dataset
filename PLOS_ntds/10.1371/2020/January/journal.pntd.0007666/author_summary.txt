Control of Ebola Virus Disease requires facilities where patients can be isolated and treated safely, without risk to medical personnel or family members. In the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone emphasis was at first placed on large field hospitals known as Ebola Treatment Centers (ETC). These were often located far from areas where new cases were being discovered. Patients were distrustful of their purpose and slow to report, and the disease continued to spread. Six months into the epidemic a new approach was tried, based on much smaller and more rapidly constructed centres (Community Care Centres (CCC) located where new cases were occurring. This paper examines community reactions to the CCC. There was a much greater sense of community ownership of these small, localised centres, and reporting times improved. Families were able easily to visit and observe activities, even though restricted from crossing red lines. The staff were often local and provided trustworthy information on the progress of patients. Families were able to prepare home food for patients, and this was thought to improve their morale and chances of survival. CCC were also appreciated for treating other disease, and not only Ebola. Referral of patients to ETC was easier to accept when the outcome of an Ebola blood test was known. There were some differences of opinion over “safe burial” procedures and acquisition of sites for the CCC, but on balance CCC were well accepted by communities, and were seen locally as a positive development in Ebola control.
