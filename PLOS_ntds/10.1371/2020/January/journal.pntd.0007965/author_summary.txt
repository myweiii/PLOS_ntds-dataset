Ebola virus disease is a severe disease caused by Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family, which occurs in humans and other primates. Ebola is believed to be zoonotic, however the natural reservoir is unknown. Overlapping symptoms with other endemic diseases, such as malaria and cholera, make accurate diagnostic challenging. Outbreaks of Ebola have been widespread as the consequence of the absence of available rapid, sensitive, specific, robust, and affordable licensed diagnostic test in remote areas, where outbreaks usually start. Here we have established and validated a rapid diagnostic test, which is fast, sensitive, specific, efficient, affordable, and user-friendly. Its analytical characteristics make it suitable for clinical management during Ebola virus outbreaks in remote areas. Of interest, this rapid diagnostic test detects the presence of an early viral antigen, the secreted glycoprotein, found in blood of patients shortly after infection, suggesting that it could be used to identify infected patients shortly after onset of symptoms.
