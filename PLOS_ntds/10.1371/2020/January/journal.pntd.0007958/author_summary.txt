Mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being released in the tropics to replace natural mosquito populations and suppress dengue transmission. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the wMel strain of Wolbachia were first released in Cairns, Australia in 2011 and releases were then expanded to the entire city and surrounding suburbs. Today, wMel is at a high frequency within the Ae. aegypti population and local dengue transmission in Cairns has declined to nearly zero. Wolbachia infections are vulnerable to high temperatures and the ability of wMel to persist in populations and block dengue may be constrained by climate. Cairns experienced a record heatwave of 43.6Â°C in November 2018 and we wanted to see whether this affected the wMel-infected Ae. aegypti population. Our results show that the frequency and density of wMel declined after the heatwave, with effects depending on the mosquito life stage tested. When we monitored the population again in April 2019, wMel had returned to a high frequency. We suggest that heatwaves of the magnitude experienced in Cairns will not have long-term impacts on the wMel infection but may affect invasion during releases or interfere with dengue blockage. Heatwaves may affect interventions with wMel-infected Ae. aegypti that are being deployed in several countries. Effects may depend on the proportion of larval habitats that are protected from extreme temperature fluctuations.
