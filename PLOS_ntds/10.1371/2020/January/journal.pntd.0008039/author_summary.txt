Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks are on the rise worldwide and may cause life-threatening symptoms, such as brain damage or excessive bleeding. In recent years we experienced several epidemic threats caused by colonization of new geographic areas by the infected vector with large numbers of naive population at risk of infection. Furthermore, increased travel contributed to a rise of imported infections in non-endemic countries. Reliable diagnostics for these viruses have therefore become a pressing need. Serology of infection is complicated by a high level of cross reactivity among structural virion proteins that are generally used as antigens. Therefore, use of the viral non-structural protein NS1 secreted by Flaviviruses, a family of highly significant vector borne viruses that include that infectious cause of Zika, Dengue, west Nile fever and Tick-borne encephalitis, has been proposed as a more specific antigen for detecting specific immune responses. In this work NS1 from representative Flaviviruses were purified from mammalian cells to maintain full antigenic potential and used in serological assays in a comparative analysis with commercial assays. Results showed a high level of specificity and sensitivity of NS1-based assays that can be proposed in a variety of diagnostic formats, from standard assays to multiparametric portable devices for rapid deployment.
