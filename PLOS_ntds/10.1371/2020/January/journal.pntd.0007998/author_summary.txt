Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Although infections are usually mild or asymptomatic, they can be severe, with high mortality rates, in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including organ transplant recipients. It is therefore relevant for countries endemic for infectious diseases such as strongyloidiasis to have a special focus on endemic diseases in organ transplant recipients. In this study, we describe the risk factors for and clinical findings of severe infection with S. stercoralis in kidney transplant recipients in Brazil. We retrospectively collected data from the medical charts of kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with severe strongyloidiasis, comparing them with those obtained for a control group of kidney transplant recipients with similar characteristics and no signs of strongyloidiasis. Gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were common, and 30-day crude mortality was 28.3% among the infected patients. Mortality was significantly higher when infection occurred within the first three months after transplantation, and we identified specific risk factors for S. stercoralis infection. Because there is little available information about severe strongyloidiasis in kidney transplant recipients, we believe that specific risk factors and clinical manifestations could identify patients at risk, who should receive prophylaxis or early treatment.
