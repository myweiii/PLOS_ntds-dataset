Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes severe disease in ruminants, wildlife and humans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Outbreaks are characterised by high mortality rates among newborn lambs and abortion storms in sheep herds. The severe outcome of RVFV infection during pregnancy in livestock is well documented, whereas the pathological changes that result in abortion have not yet been described. To investigate how RVFV crosses the placenta and how infection results in abortion, pregnant ewes were infected with RVFV and target cells in maternal and foetal tissues were identified at different time points after inoculation. We show that epithelial cells of the ovine placenta and foetal trophoblasts are primary target cells of RVFV and that placental demise is the primary cause of abortion. The same RVFV strain was shown to replicate efficiently in human placental explants, targeting both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts.
