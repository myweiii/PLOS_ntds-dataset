Dengue fever is one of the most common mosquito-borne viral diseases. Weather extremes such as El Ni√±o event and extreme hot summer can affect dengue incidence rate and dengue outbreaks. More frequent, more intensive and longer lasting heatwaves in the 21st century is anticipated because of global warming, making it necessary to investigate the association between heatwaves and dengue outbreaks. In this study, we estimated 4.6%, 11.6%, and 21.9% of incident dengue cases during small, medium, and large outbreaks attributable to temperature in Hanoi, Vietnam. We also found evidence of an association between heatwaves and dengue outbreaks, with longer delayed effects on large outbreaks than small and medium outbreaks. Compared with non-heatwave years, dengue outbreaks in heatwave years had higher number of dengue cases. Heatwave weather may represent an emerging risk factor or predicator of dengue outbreaks in tropical regions. Future dengue prediction models incorporating heatwaves may help increase the accuracy of predictability.
