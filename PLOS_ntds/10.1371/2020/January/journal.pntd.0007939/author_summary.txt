Different strains of Lactococcus lactis can be used as a suitable non-pathogenic vehicle for live vaccination. In this study, our results demonstrated that recombinant L. lactis could express PpSP15, an immunogenic component of Phlebotomus papatasi saliva, on the cell wall. Furthermore, localizing PpSP15 on the cell wall of L. lactis could trigger short (2 weeks) and long (6 months) memory cellular immunity in BALB/c mice, immunized with the recombinant L. lactis. In addition, after challenging the immunized mice with Leishmania major, the cytokine assays indicated that their immune response was shifted to Th1 which controlled the footpad swelling and propagation of L. major in the lymph nodes.
