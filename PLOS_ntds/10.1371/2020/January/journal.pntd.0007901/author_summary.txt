To date, large-scale deworming programs have strategically targeted the high risk groups of school-age and preschool-age children in worm-endemic areas using the highly cost-effective existing infrastructure of schools. To achieve elimination of worm-attributable morbidity, however, adult populations will also need to be treated. The World Health Organization considers women of reproductive age to also be a high risk group for worm-attributable morbidity and they will be increasingly included in large-scale community-based deworming programs. Although deworming treatment is considered safe and effective at any time, it is recommended that pregnant women in the first trimester be excluded from deworming treatment. Therefore, program managers need to have a screening tool in order to rule out early trimester pregnant women during deworming program implementation. To respond to this need, we evaluated the predictive properties of a parsimonious set of questions in a study population of adult women of reproductive age in a worm-endemic region of the Peruvian Amazon. We present several question scenarios to assist program managers in using questions to rule out early trimester pregnant women. Adapted to local cultural settings, such a screening tool can optimize deworming coverage in women of reproductive age.
