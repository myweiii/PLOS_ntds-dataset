Opisthorchiasis is a parasitic infection caused by liver flukes of the Opisthorchiidae family. The liver fluke infection triggers development of hepatobiliary pathologies such as chronic forms of cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and cholelithiasis and increases the risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This manuscript is the second part of our outgoing project dedicated to a comprehensive description of the metabolic response to opisthorchiasis (more specifically Opisthorchis felineus) in an animal model. We show that the metabolic response in blood plasma is unfolding according to the same scenario as in urine, reaching its peak at the 4th week and stabilizing after the 10th week post-infection. Yet, unlike the response described in urine, the observed metabolic response in plasma is less gender specific. Moreover, the biochemical basis of the detected response in blood plasma is restricted to the remodeling of the lipid metabolism and the transient depletion of essential amino acids. Together with our first manuscript this report forms the first systematic description of the metabolic response on opisthorchiasis in an animal model using two easily accessible biofluids. Thus, this contribution provides novel results and fills an information gap still existing in the analytically driven characterization of the “Siberian liver fluke”, Opisthorchis felineus.
