Understanding how environmental factors, such as land use change, affect vector-borne disease risk helps control and prevent human diseases. However the ecological preferences associated with these vectors of many neglected diseases remains poorly investigated. In this study, we found that abundance of vectors of scrub typhus (chigger mites) and spotted fever (hard ticks), two emerging neglected diseases, on primary hosts were much higher in sites invaded by exotic plants than the other major land cover types in a small island of Taiwan. Additionally, ectoparasite burdens of chigger mites in invasion sites were more stable across seasons, suggesting that plant invasion sites could be a refuge for disease vectors even under unfavorable climatic conditions. Higher abundance of chigger mites and ticks was related to a higher abundance of a superior rodent host instead of a difference in soil microclimate. More significantly, the establishment of these invasive plants has been facilitated by extensive abandonment of farmlands driven by industrialization and rural to urban human migration, thus demonstrating an important but largely overlooked issue that socioeconomic change, when mediated through a change in land cover, can have unexpected downstream effects on emerging neglected tropical diseases.
