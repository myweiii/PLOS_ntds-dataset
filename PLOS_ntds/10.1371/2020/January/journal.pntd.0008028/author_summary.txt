Sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite, the trypanosome, transmitted by the tse-tse fly. It affects people in Sub-Saharan Africa, most of them living in poor rural settings with limited access to healthcare. If the disease remains untreated, it usually progresses from a haemo-lymphatic invasion into a second stage or neuro-encephalitic infection evolving into coma and death. When these second stage patients are referred to treatment centres, the disease is often advanced. Therefore, on top of sleeping sickness treatment, additional care and medications are regularly required. We report here the concomitant medications that were prescribed to second stage sleeping sickness patients, including vulnerable populations such as children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, in the context of a phase IIIb trial assessing the safety, effectiveness, and feasibility of implementation of the Nifurtimox Eflornithine Combination Therapy (NECT) in field conditions. Our objective is to provide evidence to national health systems or private actors to plan and fund their essential medicine supplies adapted to second stage sleeping sickness patients.
