We thank the patients and their families for their participation in the NECT-FIELD study, and the medical and support staff of the Ministry of Health hospitals and the national HAT control programme for their patient care. The World Health Organisation (WHO) provided the drugs for free and supported logistics together with Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). The HAT Platform in Kinshasa provided liaison with the local ethics committee and the local authorities. The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute supported the implementation and monitoring of the NECT-FIELD study. Data management was provided by RCTs, Lyon, France.
