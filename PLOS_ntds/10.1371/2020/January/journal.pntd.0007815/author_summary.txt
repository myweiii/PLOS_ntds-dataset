Because of the worldwide prevalence of schistosomiasis and cysticercosis, it is critical to develop drugs and vaccines against their causative agents. The glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) is a dual-edged sword against diseases caused by parasitic helminths. This is because helminths heavily depend on glycolysis for energy and because the surface localization exhibited by TPIs that elicits an immune response against those organisms. Here we provide the crystal structures TPIs from Taenia solium and Schistosoma mansoni as a first step for vaccine and drug design. As a proof of concept we found that modifications in the single solvent exposed cysteine of TPI from S. mansoni decreases catalysis, making this enzyme a novel target against schistosomiasis.
