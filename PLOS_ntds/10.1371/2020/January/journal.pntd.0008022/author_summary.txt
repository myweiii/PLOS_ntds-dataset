Western Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) represent a resource-constrained developing region that suffers from numerous health disparities. It has some of the highest rates of Chlamydia trachomatis sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the world where syndromic management is practiced. Screening has been performed in only a few PICT and for specific populations such as pregnant women while little is known about risk indicators. We enrolled a diversity of women with low to high risk for acquiring C. trachomatis infection and found a high burden of asymptomatic disease at hyperendemic levels among 18â€“24 year old women. We also found that the highest risk for Chlamydia was among native Pacific Islanders of iTaukei ethnicity. Few infected women met syndromic management criteria for treatment, leaving a high number at risk of developing severe upper genital tract disease and transmitting the pathogen to their partners. STI education, testing and treatment of at-risk women and their partner(s) are urgently needed to control this epidemic. Most importantly, C. trachomatis is a risk factor for HIV acquisition and, while HIV prevalence remains low in most of the PICT, hyperendemic disease in conjunction with an economy built on tourism leaves Fiji vulnerable to the rapid spread of HIV and its consequent morbidity and mortality.
