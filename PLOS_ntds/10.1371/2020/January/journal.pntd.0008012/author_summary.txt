Follicular atresia is a phenomenon in response to environmental and physiological conditions in which female insects are able to signal the degeneration and resorption of their oocytes. It is crucial for the maintenance of female survival, as the energy stored in the developing oocytes can be reallocated allowing them to adapt to a stress condition. In the context of insect vectors of human diseases, such as flies, bugs and mosquitoes, the ability of the hematophagous female to interrupt oogenesis and reallocate its energy resources is strategic for safeguarding vector fitness. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the oocytes degradation during atresia are mostly unknown. In this work, we found that a special degradation organelle, named autophagosome, is formed in the oocytes, and that these organelles are not needed for the oocytes to be degenerated during atresia in this insect. These findings are important in the context of vector population control as they provide us with knowledge regarding the vectorâ€™s specific molecular biology. Information such as these are important, as they can be used for the elaboration and design of novel population control strategies.
