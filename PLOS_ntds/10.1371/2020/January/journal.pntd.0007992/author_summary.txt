Visceral leishmaniases (VL), also known as ‘Kala azar’, is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies. South Sudan is one of the countries in the world with the highest disease burden of VL. Existing evidence about treatment and outcomes of VL in pregnancy is limited. We described outcomes of pregnant women with VL and women diagnosed with VL in the first two weeks postpartum. Pregnant women with VL were treated with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) in this cohort. Survival rates and initial cure rates of women with VL in pregnancy treated in this resource constrained setting were high. However, these patients often required extension of treatment to achieve cure after the initial standard dose of 30mg/kg AmBisome in six doses. Careful evaluation of patients is needed at the end of the standard treatment regimen, in order to ensure proper (parasitological) cure before discharge. We reported a high incidence of complications (including severe anaemia with a need for blood transfusion), adverse pregnancy outcomes (including miscarriage and premature delivery), and obstetric complications. This research adds to the existing body of knowledge concerning VL in pregnancy, although several questions about this condition remain unanswered. Topics for future research include the immunological response to leishmania infection in pregnancy, and maternal, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes after discharge from VL treatment.
