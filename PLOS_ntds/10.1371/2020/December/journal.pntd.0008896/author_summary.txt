Diagnostic differentiation between dengue virus and Zika virus infections is a challenge due to serological cross-reactivity. In this study, we used a novel T cell receptor sequencing platform to identify T cell receptor sequences significantly associated with either dengue or Zika virus infection in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. These libraries were used to computationally train diagnostic classifiers which were capable of distinguishing between dengue and Zika virus in independent cohorts of infected mice.
