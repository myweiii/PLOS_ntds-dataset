Scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease, caused by the Orientia tsutsugamushi bacterium, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality in the Asia-Pacific region. Diagnosis is difficult since it does not present with any distinctive clinical signs compared to other febrile illnesses in this region, except for a necrotic skin lesion (eschar) in some patients. Laboratory tests are therefore crucial to identify scrub typhus. Reliable laboratory tests need significant infrastructure and experienced staff, making access to accurate tests very limited in the low-resource endemic regions. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of less expensive and easier-to-use in-house Enzyme Linked Immunoassays (ELISAs) detecting immunoglobulin IgM and IgG antibodies against scrub typhus infection compared to the “gold-standard” Immunofluorescence Assays (IFAs). There was a strong positive relationship between ELISA and IFA antibody levels for both IgM and IgG. If the ELISA would be used as a stand-alone test for scrub typhus diagnosis in Laos, an ideal balance between sensitivity and specificity would likely be around an ELISA optical density (OD) of 0.8–1.0 for IgM and 1.2–1.8 for IgG. There is a need to investigate the use of these cut-offs in other endemic regions, which could improve the rate of scrub typhus diagnosis in low-resource settings.
