The discovery of new drugs is vital to achieving the World Health Organization eradication targets for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Traditional medicines serve as sources of primary healthcare needs for most affected populations and therefore represent a valuable resource in this regard, albeit largely underdeveloped. We investigated extracts of a selection of traditional medicines for efficacy and safety to justify their use for treating NTDs in Ghana. We screened the extracts for activity against schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni), onchocerciasis (Onchocera ochengi) and trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei brucei). Generally, more extracts effectively inhibited O. ochengi than S. mansoni lifecycle stages. Further, S. mansoni juvenile and O. ochengi adult-stage male worms were more susceptible to the extracts than adult-stage S. mansoni and O. ochengi female worms. Overall, the extracts were most active against the trypanosomes. Hence, we selected the antitrypanosomal assay to identify active principles and this resulted in a non-toxic oil which was more active than the extract, and also more effective than the standard antitrypanosomal drug, diminazene aceturate. The major oil constituent, eupatriochromene, has demonstrated antitrypanosomal activity in other studies. We recommend that the quality of traditional medicines is improved.
