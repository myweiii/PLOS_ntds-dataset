Scabies is causally linked to impetigo in endemic populations. In turn, impetigo can progress to more serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). However, there are few data on the epidemiology of SSTIs in settings where scabies is endemic. We conducted a prospective study of the incidence of hospitalizations for SSTIs in 2018 and 2019 at the referral centre for the Northern Division of Fiji (population of 131,914) where community scabies prevalence is very high. We measured the incidence of admissions for abscesses, cellulitis, impetigo, wound infections, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis and crusted scabies. We observed a high incidence of SSTI admissions (647 cases per 100,000 person-years) with high associated morbidity and case fatality in this population. We found a very high incidence in young children, the elderly and iTaukei (Indigenous Fijian) population which is concordant with the distribution of scabies and impetigo in the community. These findings highlight SSTIs as an important public health concern and provide further impetus to advance research into strategies that will alleviate this burden.
