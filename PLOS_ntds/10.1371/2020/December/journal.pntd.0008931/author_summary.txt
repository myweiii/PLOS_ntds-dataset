Despite very effective antiviral therapies, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication remains a major challenge, especially in resource-limited countries. In Nepal, which ranks among the poorest countries in the world an expert consortium was established to treat HCV patients in six centers throughout the country.
A cohort of 600 individuals with HCV infection and past or current drug use were treated using different treatment strategies over time. Very high treatment response rates were achieved in a difficult-to-treat, low-income population whatever the patientâ€™s profile and disease severity and despite the severe 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. The excellent treatment outcomes observed in this real-life community study should prompt further HCV treatment initiatives in Nepal.
