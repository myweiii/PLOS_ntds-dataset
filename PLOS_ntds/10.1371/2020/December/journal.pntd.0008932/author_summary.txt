Chagas disease is a neglected zoonosis of growing concern in the southern US, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Here we analyzed the parasite genetic diversity in a large cohort of infected dogs to better understand parasite transmission cycles and assess potential relationships between parasite diversity and serological test performance. We used DNA sequencing of a well characterized T. cruzi genetic marker to assess parasite diversity. We confirmed the presence of T. cruzi lineages TcI and TcIV, and report TcII, TcV and TcVI for the first time in US dogs. Parasite lineages TcIV TcII and TcVI appeared more frequent in dogs compared to insect vectors. Dogs with negative, discordant or confirmed positive T. cruzi serology harbored genetically different TcI parasites, which shows that parasite genetic diversity is a key factor affecting serological test performance. Thus, the identification of parasite antigens conserved across strains and lineages should be a high priority for the improvement of current serological tests.
