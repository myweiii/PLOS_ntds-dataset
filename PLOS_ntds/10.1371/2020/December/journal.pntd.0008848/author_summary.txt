Lipids are of vital importance in the biology of parasitic worms, particularly in relation to cellular membranes, energy storage, and intra- and intercellular signalling. However, very little is known about the biology of lipids in parasitic nematodes. Using a high-throughput LC-MS/MS approach, we characterised the first global lipidome for Ascaris. We investigated the lipid composition and abundance in key developmental stages/sexes as well as the organ systems of Ascaris. We observed substantial differences in lipid composition and abundance among these stages/sexes and among the organ systems studied. The findings provide a basis to start to understand lipid biology in Ascaris, with possible implications for developing new interventions against ascariasis.
