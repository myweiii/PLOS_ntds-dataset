Snakebite envenomation (SBE) is a major neglected tropical disease that primarily affects poor communities living in rural areas of developing countries. The lack of knowledge about snakes and SBE is a major factor in augmenting SBE-induced disabilities and deaths. This study reports the significance of a multidimensional community education approach for the dissemination of public health information on SBE across the state of Tamil Nadu in Southern India. We also highlight the extent to which misconceptions about snakes and SBE treatment are held by people in rural communities of Tamil Nadu and demonstrate that key messages and appropriate actions can be effectively communicated through targeted engagement activities and use of the mass media. A one-day symposium provided clinical knowledge and training to healthcare professionals in rural areas about SBE. By providing appropriate awareness about snakes and SBE among the rural population through a variety of approaches, we should be able to reduce SBE-induced complications and the resulting disabilities and deaths. The approaches used in this study can be used as a proof of concept to educate rural communities in other parts of India and also other countries in the world where SBE is a significant issue.
