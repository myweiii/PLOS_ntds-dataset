Hunan, the main epidemic area of HRFS in China. Hunan has had a cumulative incidence of 117,000 cases since 1963. During this time Hunan experienced two high incidence periods in the 1980s and 1990s. We used an Information quantity + Logistic regression model (I+LR model) to predict high-incidence and potential epidemic HFRS areas. Normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI)contributed most to HFRS risk. Per capita GDP, population size, land-use type, rainfall, elevation, and soil type were all factors found to influence HFRS risk. Our study is useful for risk prediction, prevention, and control of HFRS.
