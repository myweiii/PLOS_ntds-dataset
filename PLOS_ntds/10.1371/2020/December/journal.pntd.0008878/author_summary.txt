Mycolactone is the major virulence factor of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the human pathogen causing Buruli ulcer (BU) disease. While it is now established that mycolactone is able to diffuse from infected tissues to exert immunomodulatory and analgesic effects at the systemic level, the in vivo spatiotemporal distribution of mycolactone remained largely unknown. Here, using the zebrafish larva, we describe the spatiotemporal distribution of a fluorescent derivative of mycolactone in vivo. We show that fluorescent mycolactone quickly diffuses from the blood circulation into various organs, and accumulates in muscles and brain. Mycolactoneâ€™s diffusion into the central nervous system was further confirmed in the mouse model of M. ulcerans infection. We reported previously that mycolactone suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators by primary microglia at nanomolar concentrations in vitro [1]. In the present study, we provide evidence suggesting that bacterially-produced mycolactone is able to reach the brain. While additional in vivo investigations will be required, we can speculate that the amount of mycolactone reaching the brain in the context of M. ulcerans infection is sufficient to modulate inflammation and pain transmission.
