    "Abstract": "Schistosomiasis is among the major neglected tropical diseases and effective prevention by boosting the immune system is still not available. T cells are key cellular components governing adaptive immune response to various infections. While common laboratory mice, such as C57BL/6, are highly susceptible to schistosomiasis, the SD rats are extremely resistant. However, whether adaptive immunity is necessary for such natural resistance to schistosomiasis in rats remains to be determined. Therefore, it is necessary to establish genetic model deficient in T cells and adaptive immunity on the resistant SD background, and to characterize liver pathology during schistosomiasis. In this study we compared experimental schistosomiasis in highly susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mice and in resistant SD rats, using cercariae of Schistosoma japonicum. We observed a marked T cell expansion in the spleen of infected B6 mice, but not resistant SD rats. Interestingly, CD3e−/− B6 mice in which T cells are completely absent, the infectious burden of adult worms was significantly higher than that in WT mice, suggesting an anti-parasitic role for T cells in B6 mice during schistosome infection. In further experiments, we established Lck deficient SD rats by using CRISPR/Cas9 in which T cell development was completely abolished. Strikingly, we found that such Lck deficiency in SD rats severely impaired their natural resistance to schistosome infection, and fostered parasite growth. Together with an additional genetic model deficient in T cells, the CD3e−/− SD rats, we confirmed the absence of T cell resulted in loss of natural resistance to schistosome infection, but also mitigated liver immunopathology. Our further experiments showed that regulatory T cell differentiation in infected SD rats was significantly decreased during schistosomiasis, in contrast to significant increase of regulatory T cells in infected B6 mice. These data suggest that T cell mediated immune tolerance facilitates persistent infection in mice but not in SD rats. The demonstration of an important role for T cells in natural resistance of SD rats to schistosomiasis provides experimental evidences supporting the rationale to boost T cell responses in humans to prevent and treat schistosomiasis."
