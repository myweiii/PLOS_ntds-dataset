    "Abstract": "Brucella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens that can persistently colonize host cells and cause the zoonosis- brucellosis. The WHO recommended a treatment for brucellosis that involves a combination of doxycycline, rifampicin, or streptomycin. The aim of this study was to screen rifampicin-resistance related genes by transcriptomic analysis and gene recombination method at low rifampicin concentrations and to predict the major rifampicin- resistance pathways in Brucella spp. The results showed that the MIC value of rifampicin for B. melitensis bv.3 Ether was 0.5 \u03bcg / mL. Meanwhile, B. melitensis had an adaptive response to the resistance of low rifampicin in the early stages of growth, while the SNPs changed in the rpoB gene in the late stages of growth when incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. The transcriptome results of rifampicin induction showed that the functions of significant differentially expressed genes were focused on metabolic process, catalytic activity and membrane and membrane part. The VirB operon, \u03b2-resistance genes, ABC transporters, quorum-sensing genes, DNA repair- and replication -related genes were associated with rifampicin resistance when no variations of the in rpoB were detected. Among the VirB operons, VirB7-11 may play a central role in rifampicin resistance. This study provided new insights for screening rifampicin resistance-related genes and also provided basic data for the prevention and control of rifampicin-resistant Brucella isolates."
