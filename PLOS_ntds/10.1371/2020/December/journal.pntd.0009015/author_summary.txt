Trypanosoma rangeli development inside vertebrates is a highly controversial field of study, since there is no evidence of parasite multiplication in host tissues. One of the difficulties that turns it even more complex, it’s the challenge to maintain T. rangeli infectivity, since its maintenance in culture decreases parasite’s ability to infect its hosts. Our group developed a methodology in which parasites are kept in frequent passages through triatomines and mice, assuring its infectivity and allowing the development of studies more similar to natural transmission. In this study we used qPCR, flow cytometry and histological techniques to evaluate parasite persistence in different tissues and organs of mice infected by the bite of infected bugs, mimicking a natural infection. We found that after one week of infection, parasites as well as inflammatory infiltrates disappear from the inoculation site at the host´s skin. Evaluation of infected mice for a period of 30 days demonstrated that a stable basal amount of parasites was detected in circulating blood, although an increased amount of T. rangeli DNA was found in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. In spleen, through marking the parasite with a monoclonal antibody we confirmed the presence of live parasites which were seen in apparent close association with cells and also inside them as apparently amastigote forms, indicating that the parasite is preserved and possibly replicates in these tissues. Our study provides new insights into the interaction of T. rangeli with its vertebrate hosts.
