We thank Rebekah Ireland and other members of the Arthropod Genetics Group for technical assistance. We also thank Dr Jaroslaw Krzywinski for providing us with the Ae. aegypti ‘Liverpool’ strain that originated from Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The Cx. quinquefasciatus ‘Pel’ strain was a kind gift from Professor Steven Sinkins.
