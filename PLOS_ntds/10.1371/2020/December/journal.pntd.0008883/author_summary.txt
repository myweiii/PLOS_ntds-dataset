Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, and the global new case detection rate remains high after the introduction of multidrug therapy for almost four decades with a significant reduction in prevalence. The identification of possible new genetic loci involved in susceptibility to leprosy is needed to the further understanding of the pathogenesis of leprosy and help achieve final elimination of leprosy. Here, we report a potential leprosy-associated variant in mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5 (MRPS5) by using whole exome sequencing performed on 28 individuals including 8 leprosy-affected families and the follow-up SNP genotyping of the candidate variant in case-control sample sets. We provide genetic evidence and expression data suggesting that MRPS5 is a novel leprosy-associated gene which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of leprosy.
