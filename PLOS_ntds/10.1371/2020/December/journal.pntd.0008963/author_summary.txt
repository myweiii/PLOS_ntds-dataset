In northwest Ethiopia the rates of VL patients coinfected with HIV ranges from 20 to 40%. Limited data are available on the sensitivity and specificity of antibody and antigen detection tests for VL diagnosis in HIV coinfected. Often tests are implemented without prior verification in its specific setting. However, many variables such as regional differences, molecular divergency, age of affected populations and HIV status influence performance and may substantially impact testing algorithms and outcomes.
Several tests were evaluated on a panel of samples obtained in a highly endemic Ethiopian region. rK28 antigen based rapid tests were included as they have previously shown higher sensitivity compared to rk39 based antigen tests. Though this was not confirmed here. Performance was also compared between HIV coinfected and non-HIV infected VL patients. Not all tests equally declined in sensitivity in the HIV coinfected group. Clear guidelines on minimal sensitivity and specificity, with differentiation between HIV and non-HIV infected patients are needed. Even when a national algorithm is available, verification of performance in a specific setting with selected tests and proposed criteria for acceptance remains necessary.
