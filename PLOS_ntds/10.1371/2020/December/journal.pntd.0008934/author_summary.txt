Outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are a common occurrence in Indonesia. However, limited data is available on CHIKV from regions outside of the main, central islands of Java and Bali. We recruited hospital patients from three cities located in the east (Ambon), west (Batam) and north (Banjarmasin) of the country, and screened their blood for evidence of CHIKV infection. Our results showed that CHIKV infections were relatively uncommon across patients from all three sites, suggesting that CHIKV transmission is currently relatively rare in these regions.
Additional analysis of 25 recent Indonesian CHIKV genome sequences revealed that a new lineage of CHIKV has recently emerged in Indonesia. Several reports have highlighted Indonesia as a major source of imported CHIKV cases, suggesting that this new lineage has the potential to be introduced into neighbouring countries in the near future, with unknown consequences. Overall, our results indicate that additional CHIKV surveillance studies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia are needed in order to gain a clearer understanding of transmission routes and hot spots throughout the region.
