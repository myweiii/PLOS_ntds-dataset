Sadly, our colleague and friend Stefan Kunz passed away on 10th January 2020. The authors want to dedicate this study to his memory. The authors thank Dr. Katherine Sayler (Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida) for the tick-derived isolate and Dr. Paula M Cannon for providing the plasmid encoding for WWAV-Ref GP. We would like to thank Prof. Juan Carlos de la Torre and Dr. Jérôme Gouttenoire for enriching scientific discussion and advice. We are truly thankful to Dr. Roberto Balbontin for his scientific feedback, critical thinking and discussion as well as for his help in the manuscript refinement.
