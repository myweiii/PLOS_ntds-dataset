Vibrio cholerae, is the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, which infects millions of people worldwide. Despite intensive research, the environmental reservoir of V. cholerae is still unclear and under debate within the scientific community. Chironomids, an aquatic insect group that is closely related to mosquitoes, were reported to function as reservoirs of V. cholerae. Nevertheless, until now, there have been no reports regarding the presence of pandemic-causing V. cholerae O1/O139 serogroups in chironomids. By using molecular tools including metagenomic analyses of chironomids larval microbiomes, we provide here evidence for the first time, that chironomids harbor pandemic serogroups (O1/O139) of V. cholerae, which possess the cholera-toxin gene. Chironomid populations and V. cholerae demonstrate biannual peaks similar to the biannual peaks of cholera epidemics in the Bengal Delta region in India. Thus, we hypothesize that monitoring and controlling chironomid populations in endemic areas could be used as a tool for predicting and controlling the devastating cholera outbreaks.
