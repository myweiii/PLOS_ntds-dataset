It is widely known that not all mosquito species serve as medically-important virus’ vectors. Even among the vectors, there are variations in their ability to transmit one virus or the other. Nonetheless, while the known primary vectors’ transmission efficiency is evident, the importance of confirming the ability of other potential vectors is indispensable when it comes to the threat of disease introduction to new areas. Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease mainly circulating in Asia. However, pockets of infection have been detected outside this endemic area, where the primary mosquito vector (a Culex species) is almost nonexistent. One possibility is that the causal virus is carried by the invasive mosquito species (an Aedes species), originating from Asia, confirmed to adapt well in Europe and North America. Thus, a thorough evaluation will be needed to determine the competence of both the Culex and Aedes species to transmit Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Here, the authors found that although the difference in the transmission efficiency between the Culex and Aedes was significant, their competence as vector is evident. This research provides evidence of the possible relevance of the Aedes species in the distribution and spread of JE into new areas.
