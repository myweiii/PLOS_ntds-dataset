We used a custom-developed vaccination tracking device—the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) Data Logger—to capture dog rabies vaccination data during the 2019 and 2020 mass vaccination campaign in the Northern Communal Areas of Namibia, and then integrated the collected data into the web-based Rabies Epidemiological Bulletin, a rabies-specific disease surveillance platform for rabies-endemic countries. This approach allowed automatic collation, analysis and, visualization of data and drastically improved the data capturing and monitoring capacity of the Namibian government led campaign. Additionally, subsequent GIS analysis enabled a better estimation of vaccination coverage at a much higher spatial resolution, thus identifying areas where improvements in the vaccination strategy are needed to ensure long-term success of the project.
