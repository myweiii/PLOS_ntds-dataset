Infection of the human nervous system with larvae of the parasite Taenia solium is a significant cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Despite this, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in neurocysticercosis remain unclear. Acetylcholinesterases are a family of enzymes widely produced by helminthic parasites. These enzymes facilitate the breakdown of acetylcholine, which is also a major neurotransmitter in the human nervous system. If T. solium larvae produce acetylcholinesterases, this could potentially disrupt host cholinergic signalling, which may in turn contribute to seizures and epilepsy. We therefore set out to investigate the presence and activity of acetylcholinesterases in T. solium larvae, as well as in Taenia crassiceps larvae, a species commonly used as a model parasite in neurocysticercosis research. We found that both T. crassiceps and T. solium larvae produce acetylcholinesterases with substantial activity and that the functional protein domains in the Taenia solium acetylcholinesterases have great similarity to those of human acetylcholinesterases. We further demonstrate that the acetylcholinesterase activity in the products of these parasites is sufficient to break down acetylcholine at a concentration which induces changes in neuronal signalling in an ex vivo brain slice model. This study provides evidence that Taenia larvae produce acetylcholinesterases and that these can potentially interfere with cholinergic signalling in the host and contribute to pathogenesis in neurocysticercosis.
