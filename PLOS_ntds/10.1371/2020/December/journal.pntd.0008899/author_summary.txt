Scorpionism (the medical consequence of scorpion stings in humans) is a neglected health problem in tropical and subtropical areas associated with poverty. This study is the first to compare venoms among core (Argentinean) and peripheral (Paraguayan) populations of the noxious Tityus trivittatus, the most medically important scorpion in the southernmost section of South America. The work demonstrated the lethality of the venom of urban populations of T. trivittatus in Paraguay, where it has caused severe cases in children. We obtained data indicating that there are significant differences in venom composition and function, and also recognition by therapeutic antivenoms available in the region, among these Argentinean and Paraguayan scorpion populations which historically have been assigned to the same species. Our genetic study revealed that in fact these two populations diverged between ~15â€“5 Million years ago, indicating they are distinct species. These results indicate that southern South American scorpions in the genus Tityus which co-distribute with humans are more diverse in terms of their venoms and species composition than previously thought, and that further studies are warranted to design more effective therapeutic tools against scorpionism in the region to tackle such diversity.
