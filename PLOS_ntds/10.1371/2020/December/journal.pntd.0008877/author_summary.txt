Lymphatic filariasis or elephantiasis is targeted for elimination in Sierra Leone, with annual mass treatment with ivermectin and albendazole, and required coverage was achieved in all 12 districts annually. In 2017, transmission assessment survey (TAS) was conducted in eight districts to assess whether treatment can be stopped and pre-TAS was conducted in six other districts to assess whether TAS can be conducted. Eight TAS districts were surveyed as four evaluation units (EU), and a school-based survey was conducted in 1703–1926 children aged 6–7 years from 30 clusters per EU. Six pre-TAS districts were surveyed with one sentinel and one/two spot check sites per district and 300–350 persons aged ≥5 years were tested. All tests were using the Filariasis Test Strips with finger prick blood samples. There were 0–7 positive cases in each TAS EU respectively, all below the critical cut-off value, confirming that mass treatment was no longer needed in these eight districts, a significant progress towards LF elimination. One district had prevalence of <1% in two sites and qualified for TAS, while other five districts had sites with prevalence >2%, suggesting that mass treatment needs to continue. Repeated failure of pre-TAS poses great challenge to eliminate LF in Sierra Leone.YMB is the former NTDP manager and coordinated the MDAs with AC and MS.
