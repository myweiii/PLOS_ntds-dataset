Echinococcosis is a life-threatening disease in humans that is caused by the larval stages of the tapeworms Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus s.l.. For the histological diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) and cystic echinococcosis (CE) the two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) Em2G11, specific for AE, and the mAb EmG3, specific for AE and CE are available. We have analyzed a large cohort of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human tissue (FFPE) specimens of AE (n = 360) and CE (n = 178) using these two antibodies. We show that the mAb EmG3 has a specific staining pattern of the metacestode stadium of E. multilocularis and E. granulosus s.l. while staining of the larval state of E. multilocularis is limited to the mAb Em2G11. We further identified so called “small particles of Echinococcus multilocularis” (spems) and “small particles of Echinococcus granulosus” (spegs) not only in the main lesion of AE and CE, but also in the adjacent tissue and in the vast majority of lymph nodes analyzed draining the main lesion. The lymph nodes with these microparticles are enlarged as compared to a control group. We conclude that immunochemistry with these two antibodies is a valuable adjunct for the final histological diagnosis of AE und CE. The frequent detection of microparticles of E. multilocularis and E. granulosus in lymph nodes of patients with AE and CE argue for a larger interface of interaction of the parasite with the host`s immune system than previously assumed and point to further mechanisms of these infections in humans which may be the basis for immunological reactions in the host.
