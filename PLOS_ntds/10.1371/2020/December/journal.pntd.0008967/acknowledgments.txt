We thank Hugh M. Robertson (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL) for his guidance on annotating the chemoreceptors, and David C. Rinker (Vanderbilt University, TN) for his recommendations for calculating gene copy number and VST. We would also like to thank Cleilton Sampaio de Farias (Instituto Federal do Acre, Brazil) for the map construction, and Felipe Vigoder (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for sharing the original recordings of the copulation songs displayed in Fig 2. We acknowledge the late Alexandre Peixoto, whose previous work inspired this research and who participated in the sampling strategy prior to his untimely death. L. longipalpis genome data were generated by Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center in collaboration with Washington University in Saint Louis as part of the sand fly NHGRI project.
