Care-seeking preferences of dog bite victims (DBVs) who would rather present to traditional caregivers in rural areas than to conventional hospitals have partly contributed to under-reported cases of suspected rabies in Liberia. For this reason, we reviewed cases of DBVs presented for treatment at human hospitals in Buchanan, Gbarnga and Voinjama cities, and their environs over a 10-year period, 2008–2017. We compared the findings with patronage of traditional caregivers for treatment of dog bite victims among representative households in each of the three cities, based on questionnaire survey and used the ratio derived to correct for under-reporting. Finally, we used a standardized clinical decision tree model to estimate the annual prevalence of human deaths due to suspected rabies cases. We then estimated 559 persons died of suspected rabies in the three cities and their environs during 2008–2017. The average annual prevalence of DBVs was 179±106.82, 393±257.85 and 76.9±38.11, respectively in the three cities, while average annual human deaths due to suspected rabies were 14.3±8.47, 35.5± 23.25, and 6.1±3.21 per 100,000 population, respectively. The mixed-method that we have used in this study for estimating chronologic annual prevalence of human deaths due to suspected rabies is adaptable to other cities of Liberia.
