We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the staff of the respective district & sub-district health officials, field staff, and survey participants in Bangladesh, as well as the multiple CWW team members and consultants who historically contributed to protocol development and early implementation of some surveys. Technical support and field implementation was supported by CWW and the Bangladesh National ELFSTH.
