Scrub typhus is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is mostly carried by rodents and chigger mites, and occasionally transmitted to humans by bites of infected larval mites. Scrub typhus is geographically endemic across broad areas of south and southeastern Asia, the Pacific islands and northern Australia. In recent years, an obvious increasing trend of the incidence of this disease has been noticed all around the world. China is one of the most endemic country for this disease, with an approximate 10-fold increase of the annual case number from 2006 to 2013. In this study, by using a prediction model for infectious diseases, we found that the highest infection risk area was located at the mid-east and northeast regions of Qingdao, with gross domestic product and precipitation might developed the greatest impact for the occurrence of scrub typhus. Furthermore, 68.7% of the region in Qingdao might have a suitable environment for the occurrence of scrub typhus, with most of them hadnâ€™t reported cases yet. This study highlights the emergency to enhance the awareness of this disease and improve the capacity of diagnosis and treatment among medical institutions in high risk areas in Qingdao.
