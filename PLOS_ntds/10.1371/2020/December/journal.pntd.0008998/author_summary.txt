Human clonorchiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis. Humans are infected through eating raw freshwater fishes carrying C. sinensis metacercariae, the encysted larvae. They excyst in the duodenum, move into the liver via bile duct and grow to adult worms. Excretory-secretory products of the worm damage the liver causing various inflammatory pathological changes and may lead to bile duct cancer. Although there exists an anthelmintic choice praziquantel to kill the fluke, emphasis is placed on early diagnosis and prevention before the infection becomes disease. Microscopic stool examination is the standard diagnostic method but is cumbersome and time consuming. Blood serum antibodies from clonorchiasis patients could provide a simple and fast diagnosis. However, antibody detecting diagnostics developed so far have a low specificity and sensitivity. In the present study we selected 607 antigenic candidate proteins from the genomic database and synthesized them through an integrated high-throughput proteogenomic tools. We identified several antigenic proteins and evaluated their diagnostic potential for clonorchiasis. One of them, CsAg17, showed a high sensitivity and specificity. This antigen deserves development of point-of-care serodiagnostics for C. sinensis infections.
