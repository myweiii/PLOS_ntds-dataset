Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by helminth worms called schistosomes, and millions of people worldwide are infected. Studies in animal models indicate that the infection can cause alterations in metabolism of the host, leading to the observed clinical manifestations of the disease. However, there are limited human studies on the impact of schistosome infection on host metabolism, and none describing the changes that occur early in infection. There are also no studies relating to the species Schistosoma haematobium, which causes disease manifested in both the urinary and genital organs. To address this, we analysed the metabolic changes in response to the first S. haematobium infection and treatment in Zimbabwean preschool-aged children. We determined for the first time, that within three months of first infection, there are significant changes in metabolite profiles related to host energy (G6P, 3-PG, AMP, ADP) and purine (AMP, ADP) metabolism. These changes were associated with infection burden and were resolved within three months, following curative treatment. Our findings provide further understanding into the early host metabolic responses to the infection, consistent with clinical manifestations such as malnutrition, poor growth and poor physical and cognitive performance observed in schistosome-infected children. This demonstrates the need for early treatment of the infection, and will inform the development of appropriate interventions such as nutraceuticals in child feeding programs, aimed at reducing disease consequences. Further mechanistic studies will contribute to more understanding of the relationship between metabolic alterations and schistosomiasis in young children.
