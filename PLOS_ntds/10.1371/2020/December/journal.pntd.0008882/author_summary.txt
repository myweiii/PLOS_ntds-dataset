Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT), the blinding stage of trachoma, ranges from few peripheral eyelashes touching the eye to all eyelashes scratching the cornea. TT is mainly treated with corrective eyelid surgery. However, not all TT cases require surgical correction, and some, particularly, those with few eyelashes decline surgery. Epilation, the repeated removal of eyelashes, is a very common clinical and traditional practice in many trachoma endemic settings. The World Health Organisation recommends that epilation can be offered as an alternative management strategy to surgery for patients with few eyelashes touching the eye or refusing surgery. However, some trachoma control programmes hesitated to implement epilation with the concern that it would hamper surgical acceptance and results in larger numbers of and stiffer eyelashes touching the eye than the original TT eyelashes. In this study, we explored if these concerns are true in epilating minor (â‰¤5 eyelashes from the upper eyelid touching the eye or evidence of epilation in <1/3rd of the upper eyelid) unoperated (170) and postoperative TT (169) cases. We found, in the contrary to these concerns, the post-epilation eyelashes touching the eye were less damaging being fewer in number, thinner, weaker and shorter than the pre-epilation eyelashes. In addition, the majority of both unoperated and postoperative cases indicated that they are willing to accept surgery if their trichiasis progressed.
