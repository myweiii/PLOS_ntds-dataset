Rabies is a fatal neurologic disease affecting people and animals. Rabies is caused by infection with a virus of the genus Lyssavirus. People usually get infected from dog bites, but bats are an increasingly important source of the disease. To better understand the biology of rabies in bats, we developed a laboratory model to study the disease in bats under controlled circumstances. For this model we used Lagos bat virus in straw-colored fruit bats and, as part of its development, we wanted to know the best virus dose to use to cause rabies. Therefore, we compared the outcomes of five different virus doses injected into the muscle of the bats. The best dose for our model was the middle dose, which caused rabies more frequently than either the highest or the lowest doses. The higher doses more frequently resulted in the development of an anti-viral immune response which appeared to protect against disease, while bats with low doses also often failed to develop disease. The virus dose thus followed the Goldilocks principle, with the middle dose being just right.
