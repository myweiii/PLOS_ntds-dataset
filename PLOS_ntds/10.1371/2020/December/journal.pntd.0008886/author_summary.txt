Ivermectin is an important drug for the control and treatment of neglected tropical diseases. However, despite numerous studies showing that ivermectin is safe and well tolerated in young children, it is not currently recommended in young children <5 years and <15 kg. Therefore, there are no guidelines for the dose of ivermectin in young or small children. In this study, we firstly determined how much ivermectin is present in blood in children aged 5 years and older. We then used this information to model what happens to ivermectin in childrensâ€™ bodies allowing us to calculate the dose required in children aged less than 5 years and weighing under 15 kg. This study provides a new dosing guideline that can now be tested in clinical studies of children <5 years and <15 kg.
