This study reports the infection rates and genetic characteristics of Enterocytozoon bieneusi in 609 children in kindergarten in Southern Xinjiang, China. All samples were screened for this pathogen with PCR, based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of E. bieneusi. Thirty-six fecal samples (5.9%, 36/609) were positive, with the highest prevalence observed in children from Yopurga (17.5%, 11/63). Three novel genotypes were identified (CXJH1, CXJH2 and CXJH3). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the E. bieneusi isolates clustered into two groups: Group 1 (A, CXJH1, D, EbpA, KB-1, and NIA1) and Group 2 (CHN6, CXJH2, and CXJH3). Genotype NIA1 used to be detected in HIV-positive patients, however, it was most prevalent (52.8%, 19/36) among the nine genotypes identified in this study. Additionally, we confirmed the zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi genotype D and this is the first report of human infection by E. bieneusi genotypes KB-1 and CHN6.
