Vivax malaria is an important parasitic disease in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Plasmodium vivax, which is less sensitive to chloroquine, has been reported in the region. However, as part of the GMS, the drug sensitivity of P. vivax is unclear in the China-Myanmar border area. In view of the important role of antimalarial drugs in malaria elimination strategies, we investigate the drug sensitivity profile and genetic variations of the P. vivax isolates from the China-Myanmar border. We obtained baseline data of ex vivo sensitivities to eight antimalarial drugs and found that chloroquine-resistant P. vivax was possibly emerging this area. Studies of genetic polymorphisms in two candidate genes of drug resistance (pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o) of the P. vivax isolates from this area and found association between the M908L substitution in pvmdr1 with reduced sensitivities to and chloroquine, mefloquine, pyronaridine, piperaquine, quinine, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin. It is worth noting that the M908L substitution was almost fixed in our samples, which limits the robustness of the conclusion. Our finding suggests that more rigorous in vivo and ex vivo studies are needed to monitor the efficacy of the frontline drugs and discover drug resistance mechanisms.
