A pathogen can cause variable disease severity across different host individuals, and these presentations change over the time-course from infection to recovery. In addition, different pathogens may induce similar clinical presentations. These facts complicate efforts to identify infections caused by rare or neglected pathogens and to understand factors governing disease spread in humans and animals, particularly when data are limited. These biological complexities are omitted from classical approaches to modeling infectious disease, which typically rely on discrete and well-defined disease states. Here we show that by analyzing multiple biomarkers of health and infection simultaneously, treating these values as quantitative rather than binary indicators, and including a modest amount of longitudinal sampling of hosts, we can create a map of the host-pathogen interaction that shows the full spectrum of disease presentations and opens doors for new insights and predictions. By accounting for individual variation and capturing changes through time since infection, this mapping framework enables more robust interpretation of cross-sectional data; e.g., to detect predictive relationships between biomarkers and key outcomes such as survival, or to assess whether observed disease is associated with the pathogen of interest. This approach can help epidemiologists, ecologists and clinicians to better study and manage the many infectious diseases that exhibit complex relationships with their hosts.
