Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most lethal human pathogens in existence. No approved vaccine or therapies exist and rapid diagnosis of CCHFV is a critical aspect of disease management. We describe the selection and characterization of a high affinity non-antibody binding protein, Affimer-NP, that specifically recognises the CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Affimer-NP interferes with the RNA-binding function of CCHFV NP and inhibits CCHFV gene expression in mammalian cells. Solution of the crystallographic structure of the CCHFV NP/Affimer-NP complex at 2.84 Ã… resolution revealed the structural basis for this interference, and we validated the in vitro application of this novel molecule for the development of ELISA and lateral flow assays, presenting the first published prototype point-of-care test able to detect recombinant CCHFV NP in spiked human and animal sera. These findings present a possible starting point for the future development of anti-viral molecules targeted to CCHFV NP, and diagnostic assays for the detection of CCHFV NP, contributing to the preparedness for potential future outbreak scenarios.
