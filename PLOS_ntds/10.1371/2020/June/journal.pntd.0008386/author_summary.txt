Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic subcutaneous infection caused by several dimorphic, pigmented dematiaceous fungi. CD4+ T cells modulations are crucial for the proper immune response against this fungal infection and play a key role in CBM resolution in a self-healing mouse model. In this work we report Th17 cells as being the main CD4+ subpopulation in the infected area during the early stages of experimental murine CBM, followed by Th1 predominance in the later stages, coinciding with the remission phase of the disease in this experimental model. Depletion of CD25+ cells resulted in fungal burden reduction after 14 days of infection, but it compromised fungal clearing in later stages of the disease, prolonging CBM clinical features in those animals. In vivo analysis with IL-17A and IFN-γ neutralization hindered fungal cell elimination in the course of the disease. Dectin-2 deficiency was associated with impairment of Th17 response and fungal control in the early phase of CBM but did not affect disease resolution. In this study, we gained insight into T helper subsets’ dynamics following footpad injections of F. pedrosoi fungal cells and uncovered their contribution to disease resolution.
