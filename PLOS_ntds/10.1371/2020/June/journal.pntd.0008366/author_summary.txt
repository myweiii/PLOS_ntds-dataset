Millions of people are bitten by venomous snakes each year, resulting in over 100,000 deaths. Currently, such envenomings are treated with animal derived antivenoms that contain undefined antibodies against snake venom toxins that have been raised by the production animal’s immune system. To date, our understanding of these antibody toxin interactions is sparse, but with the help of high-density peptide microarray (hdpm) technology this is starting to change. Whilst this technology is very powerful, analysis of the output data is complex and requires expert training. Therefore, in this study, we developed a user-friendly, and high-throughput web application named “Snake Toxin and Antivenom Binding Profiles” (STAB Profiles). Furthermore, we ensured our tool was functional and able to handle large amounts of data by creating an entirely novel and larger than ever hdpm dataset based on all African snake toxin proteins together with eight commercial antivenoms. With these data and our tool, we were able to further our understanding on toxin-antivenom interactions and were able to differentiate the ability of different antivenoms to interact with certain toxins of interest. Ideally, these and future insights can help guide the improvement and optimization of current antivenoms, as well as aid the informed development of next-generation antivenoms.
