Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive mosquito and a vector for a number of arboviruses. The arrival and establishment of Ae. albopictus in temperature regions of the world, such as Europe, has been accompanied by re-emergence of arboviral diseases. There are no effective therapeutic treatments for arboviruses meaning control of vector populations is the primary strategy to prevent arboviral disease transmission. Pyrethroids are frequently used for control of vectors based on their low mammalian toxicity and rapid knockdown effect on mosquitoes. The identification of mutations predictive of resistance phenotype in the para sodium channel gene, the target site of pyrethroids, has provided for molecular markers to test for resistance by genotyping wild-collected mosquitoes. Here we analysed all currently known predictive mutations for pyrethroid resistance in 512 geographic mosquitoes sampled in a span of seven years. Thus, we are able to add a temporal dimension to the analysis of geographic distribution of resistance alleles. Overall our data confirm a patchy distribution of mutations predictive of the resistance phenotype, but also reveal an alarming increase of resistance mutations in China, Greece and Italy. Resistance mutations appear to have arisen locally more than being spread through mosquito migration/invasions.
