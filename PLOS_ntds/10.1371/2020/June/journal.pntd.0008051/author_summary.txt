We have proposed a preoperative mapping biopsy procedure to perform optimal debridement for Buruli ulcer presenting complicated skin lesions. Briefly, multiple punch biopsies are performed from various sites around the Buruli ulcer lesions and the range of resection is decided according to the histological findings of the biopsies. Herein, we performed histological examination and quantitative PCR analysis using 83 tissue samples taken from mapping biopsy and debrided Buruli ulcer to validate our method. Our results suggested that the sites with histological necrosis need to be resected during surgical debridement and that the sites without histological necrosis can be preserved. These results in combination with those of previous studies are supportive of the mapping biopsy procedure that we have proposed. However, a randomized controlled study questioned the need for adjunct surgical treatment in Buruli ulcer. Further studies are needed to establish the Japanese evidence for surgical treatment in Japanese cases of Buruli ulcer.
