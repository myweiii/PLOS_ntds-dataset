Following a national helminth prevalence survey conducted in 2010/2011, Zimbabwe launched a national schistosomiasis and intestinal worm control program in 2012 targeting school children aged 6â€“15 years who carry the highest infection burden. The control strategy as advocated by the World Health Assembly in 2012 was adopted to suit the country context. We conducted a study in a cohort of children to assess the effect of praziquantel treatment on schistosome infection intensity and prevalence as well as on urogenital schistosomiasis morbidity prevalence after every annual MDA for 6 years. Maximum treatment coverage in a cohort of children reached 90% over the 6 rounds of annual treatment. Annual surveys in sentinel sites throughout the country showed that schistosome infection prevalence and intensity as well as the marker of urogenital schistosomiasis, haematuria decreased significantly after each round of treatment from the pre-treatment levels in the same year. Most notably, both urogenital schistosomiasis infection and morbidity prevalence reduced from 32% at baseline in 2012 to 1.56% before the 6th MDA in 2017, and infection intensity reduced from 28.75 eggs/10ml urine to a mean of 0.07eggs/10ml urine prior to the 6th MDA. Both infection prevalence and intensity fell to 0 after the 6th MDA. Intestinal schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity reduced from 4.6% and 0.28 eggs/25mg of stool to 0% and 0 eggs, respectively. Thus, the control program significantly reduced schistosome infection and morbidity in this cohort of schoolchildren.
