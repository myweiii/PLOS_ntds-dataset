Rickettsiosis is a tick-borne infectious disease of global importance. The disease has been prevailing in Northeastern China but the distribution of tick and tick-borne Rickettsia species from different areas of Northeastern China remain poorly studied. We collected a total of 1,286 ticks in the seven counties with different geographic environments of Harbin, an area of Northeastern China, and all the ticks were classified as Dermacentor nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis concinna, Haemaphysalis longicornis or Ixodes persulcatus. A total of 28.8% of the ticks tested positive for either Rickettsia raoultii or “Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae”, in which 37.6% of the D. nuttalli, D. silvarum and H. longicornis ticks were positive for R. raoultii while 22.8% of the I. persulcatus ticks were positive for “Ca. R. tarasevichiae”. The positive rate of both R. raoultii and “Ca. R. tarasevichiae” in ticks from the livestock (40.7%) was significantly higher than that from the vegetation (19.5%). All the data indicate that ticks in the Harbin area have a high infection rate with Rickettsia species and domestic animals may have a tick-livestock rickettsial circulation that may play an important role in transmission of rickettsioses.
