Opisthorchis felineus is a trematode (liver fluke) that infects the hepatobiliary systems of humans in endemic regions. The infection may lead to severe liver and bile duct diseases, making it a public health issue in endemic communities like Western Siberia. Yet, little information is available from this region about its epidemiology. We aimed to assess the current prevalence of O. felineus infection along with associated risk factors and morbidity in one district in rural Western Siberia. We conducted a cross-sectional community-based study in the Shegarskiy district, Tomsk Oblast, Russian Federation. All household members (â‰¥ 7 years) present on the survey day were enrolled (n = 600). Two stool samples per person were examined for helminth eggs. We interviewed study participants to determine risk factors using a questionnaire. An abdominal ultrasonography examination was performed to assess liver and bile duct pathology. In total, 488 persons completed assessments. We found a high O. felineus infection prevalence of 60.2%. Women and older study participants had a higher risk of infection. The consumption of river fish, particularly stock, smoked, frozen and raw fish; and fishing activities increased the risk of infection. Study participants with a higher socio-economic status had a lower risk of infection. The ultrasonography showed that participants with infection had an increased risk of gallbladder stones and bile duct pathologies. Our study provides valuable information about Opisthorchis infection prevalence, its risk factors and morbidity in rural Siberia. The results will be useful for developing a multidisciplinary, community-based control program against Opisthorchis infection in endemic regions.
