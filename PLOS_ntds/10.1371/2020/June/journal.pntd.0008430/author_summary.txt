The World Health Organization included snakebite envenoming into the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017 and launched a strategy for prevention and control of snakebite envenoming in 2019 in order to reduce the number of deaths and cases of disability by 50% before 2030. The neglect includes first and foremost epidemiology of snakebites, knowledge about management of snakebite envenoming and the medically relevant snake fauna, and access to life saving treatment with snake antivenom. In Vietnam reliable data on snakebite incidence and on snake species responsible for envenoming are largely missing. The present community-based survey showed that incidence of snakebites in Can Tho Municipality in the Mekong Delta in South Vietnam is significantly lower than in neighbouring countries and lower poverty rates among others are most likely the principal reason. Green pit vipers are responsible for the vast majority of snakebites. Treatment practices need to be reviewed and national guidelines are needed to achieve the best outcome for snakebite patients.
