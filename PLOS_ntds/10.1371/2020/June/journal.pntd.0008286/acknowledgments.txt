We have collaborated with many local health and political leaders of the area, and with multiple professionals, students, and friends who have aided this research. Among them, we thank Dr. Ramiro Barriga from Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador, and Jorge Maigua for their expert advice identifying freshwater fish. Moreover, we thank people from the studied communities whom aided vastly on fish collection and hosting our research; parasitology would not be a doable enterprise if it were not because of the commitment of the local people that, sadly, is usually the most affected by tropical diseases. We also thank Town Peterson for edits and proofreading of the manuscript. DRA thanks Fernando Machado-Stredel for discussion on taxonomy issues.
