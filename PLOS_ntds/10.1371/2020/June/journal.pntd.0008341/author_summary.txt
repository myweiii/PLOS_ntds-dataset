Tsetse flies are insect vectors of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock in sub-Sahara Africa. Tsetse flies identify their hosts (preferred and non-preferred) by detecting and processing odor cues emitted by the hosts in their environment. Tsetse flies use chemosensory proteins and associated pathways in their antennae to identify these cues. In this study, we identified expansions of these chemosensory protein in six tsetse fly species (Glossina morsitans morsitans, Glossina pallidipes, Glossina austeni, Glossina palpalis gambiensis, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and Glossina brevipalpis) with different known hosts. We also identified potential ligands to these proteins based on fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) orthologs. With G. m. morsitans as an example, we identified the proteins and associated molecular pathways preferentially expressed in tsetse fly antennae. These proteins may be responsible for the tsetse fly species-specific host discrimination, with the ligands eliciting species-specific behavioral responses in the flies. The expressed orthologs may be functionally important in odor detection in tsetse fly and lay down useful groundwork for downstream functional genomics R&D for more effective tsetse fly species-specific odor attractants and repellents for routine tsetse fly control operations.
