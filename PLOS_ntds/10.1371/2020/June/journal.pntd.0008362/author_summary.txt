Transovarial transmission, or vertical transmission, is the spread of a pathogen from parent to offspring. It has been observed that some mosquito-borne viruses can be transmitted from female mosquitoes to their offspring during follicle development or during oviposition. The occurrence of transovarial transmission is evident in the presence of virally infected male mosquitoes, which typically do not take bloodmeals, and the presence of virus in immature mosquitoes of any sex. Transovarial transmission aids in the amplification of mosquito-borne viruses in the environment by increasing the number of infected mosquitoes in a given region, thus expanding the possibility of viral transmission to humans. The combination of transovarial transmission and the preservation of viable eggs during dry seasons may trigger sudden amplification of the virus after rainy periods, resulting in an outbreak. This study provides some of the first evidence of transovarial transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Africa during interepidemic periods, which has important implications for local virus persistence and epidemic patterns.
