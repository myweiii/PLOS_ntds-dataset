Rift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the most important vector borne disease in Africa, seriously affecting the health of domestic ruminants and humans and leading to severe economic consequences. This disease is endemic in northern Senegal, a Sahelian area characterized by a temporary pond network that drive both RVF mosquito population dynamics and nomadic herd movements. Two non-exclusive mechanisms may support this endemicity: recurrent introductions of the virus by nomadic animals, and vertical transmission of the virus (i.e. from infected female mosquito to eggs) in local Aedes populations. The authors followed resident and nomadic domestic herds for 1 year. They used the data thus obtained to model a realistic epidemiological system at the pond level integrating vector population dynamics, resident and nomadic ruminant herd population dynamics. They found that the best scenario explaining RVF remanence combined yearly introductions of RVFV by nomadic herds, with a viraemic proportion predicted to be larger in animals arriving during the 2nd half of the rainy season, which is consistent with an amplification of virus circulation in the area during the rainy season. Although the existence of a vertical transmission mechanism in Aedes cannot be ruled out, their results demonstrates that nomadic movements are sufficient to account for this endemic circulation in northern Senegal.
