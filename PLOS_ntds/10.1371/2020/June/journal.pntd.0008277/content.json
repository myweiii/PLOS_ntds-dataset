    "Introduction": "The global schistosomiasis control strategy relies upon preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel, primarily targeting school-age children. In moderate- and high-risk communities, treatment is also extended to adults [1]. Of note, preschool-age children contribute a considerable fraction of the total burden of schistosomiasis [2–4]. The current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines are that preschool-age children should be treated on a case-by-case basis upon diagnosis of infection due to a lack of an age-appropriate formulation of praziquantel [5]. WHO is considering the inclusion of preschool-age children in preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel, should an appropriate formulation of praziquantel become available [5–7]. The reason is that the current formulation (large, bitter tasting 600 mg tablets), although often crushed and dissolved in practice, is unsuited for use in young children, and hence, efforts are underway to develop an orally dispersible tablet formulation for young children [8, 9]. Evidence of efficacy and safety of praziquantel in preschool-age children is limited [5], and it is unclear whether they should receive the same dose (i.e., oral administration at a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight) as their school-age counterparts, adolescents, and adults [10].\nTo address this issue, we analyzed data from clinical trials and epidemiologic studies that enrolled preschool- and school-age children who were treated with praziquantel at a single 40 mg/kg oral dose, for which data were available at the individual participant level. This information is important both for treatment recommendations and for adapting the strength of praziquantel to be used in pediatric formulation.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThis is a secondary analysis of published work. Ethical approval and written (or oral) informed consent have been reported in the original papers [5, 11–30].\n\n\nDatasets\nBased on a scoping paper [31], the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases at WHO contacted investigators for the availability of suitable patient datasets from studies that enrolled preschool-age children. The investigators of 23 clinical studies [5, 11–30] agreed to share data with the specific purpose of pooled analyses aimed at answering the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcome) question below. The datasets were curated in order to allow for the pooled analysis. One article [18] contained two different studies, which were analyzed separately. Subsequently, studies were further assessed as to their eligibility for inclusion in the analysis (whole study or subset of participants). In this dataset, studies are identified by the name of the main data contributor and the year the study was conducted.\n\n\nPICO question\nIn preschool-age children, is praziquantel given at 40 mg/kg body weight in a single oral dose as efficacious as it is in school-age children in reducing Schistosoma infection (measured as egg counts in stool or urine)?\n\n\nStudy and patient inclusion criteria\nThe following inclusion criteria were employed: (i) treatment with praziquantel 40 mg/kg body weight; (ii) participant’s age 0–14 years; (iii) confirmed infection with Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, or S. japonicum, as determined by the presence of eggs in stool or urine; and (iv) treatment outcome assessed at follow-up visit between 21 and 60 days post-treatment.\n\n\nAssessment of methodological quality\nKey characteristics of studies were extracted from the published articles. The methodologic quality was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration’s [32] risk of bias table, including items such as random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective reporting (reporting bias). We also prepared funnel plots to check for publication bias, stratified by Schistosoma species.\n\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe investigated heterogeneity by examining the forest plots, and carried out sensitivity analyses by calculating the pooled mean difference of individual egg reduction rate (ERR) between preschool- and school-age children.\n\n\nAssessment of reporting bias\nWe compared studies included in this analysis with those identified by a prior scoping review [31]. However, only studies for which individual participant-level data were made available could be included in the present analysis.\n\n\nStatistical methods\nSummarizing infection intensity.The arithmetic mean (AM) eggs per gram of stool (EPG) was calculated at pre- and post-treatment for S. mansoni by multiplying the mean individual fecal egg counts (FECs) obtained by a single, duplicate, or quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears (41.7 mg) by a factor of 24 [33, 34]. For S. haematobium, egg counts were presented as eggs per 10 ml of urine [34].\n\nMeasuring efficacy.Drug efficacy was expressed as AM egg reduction rate (ERR) (the difference in AM egg counts between pre- and post-treatment assessments), cure rate (CR, proportion of cases with zero egg counts post-treatment), and mean of individual ERR, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Individual ERRs were calculated as the ratio of the difference between the pre- and post-treatment EPG or eggs per 10 ml urine, multiplied by 100. In this analysis, no change or increase in egg counts post-treatment indicates an ERR = 0 (no reduction). CIs were determined using a bootstrap resampling method (with replacement) over 1,000 replicates. This methodology has been described in greater detail elsewhere [35]. According to WHO guidelines, the reference target efficacy for AM-ERR is ≥95% [36].\nThe distribution of the individual ERRs was plotted by using histograms of the frequencies and scatterplot of the cumulative frequencies as ‘centiles plots’. Forest plots were utilized to visualize mean individual ERRs by age categories. Results are presented separately by Schistosoma species.\n\nStatistical analyses.Modeling of baseline log-transformed egg counts was performed with age categories and country as fixed factors in a general linear model, and with country as a random factor in a mixed model. Modeling of the individual ERRs was carried out through a general linear model and mixed models. Separate models were fitted for S. mansoni and S. haematobium.\nIn the general linear model, the level of infection at baseline was included as covariate (log-transformed baseline EPG for S. mansoni and eggs per 10 ml of urine for S. haematobium). Fixed variables were country, participant’s sex, and three age categories: (i) 0 to <6 years; (ii) 6 to <10 years; and (iii) 10–14 years to more accurately reflect the age-range of the included studies (see below), or preschool-age (0 to <6 years) versus school-age children (6–14 years). Mixed models were further fitted with a random effect on the country. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with the same models by removing the baseline log-transformed egg counts.\nPairwise differences (with a Tukey adjustment) in least square means (LSM) were performed for each of the age groups. This post-hoc comparison was allowed by the implicit network of possible preschool- and school-age children comparisons across all studies (S1 Fig) [37, 38].\nAll tests were two-tailed and a p-value of 5% was deemed statistically significant. Calculations and analyses were performed by using Revman version 5.3.5 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre; Copenhagen, Denmark) (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) and SAS system version 9.3 (SAS Institute; Cary, United States of America).\nSafety was assessed using reported adverse events (AEs), classified as mild, moderate, or severe. We extrapolated the number of patients exposed and assessed for safety at 4 and 24 hours post-treatment and at the end of follow-up and calculated the frequency of those with at least one AE. We also report the total number and type of AEs for each age-category and by severity.\nThe PRISMA guidelines were used and followed for reporting the current work. The PRISMA checklist is attached as supplementary material.",
    "Results": "Data were available from 23 studies with children treated either for S. mansoni, S. haematobium, or S. japonicum infection with single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel (Table 1 and S1 Table, including diagnostic approach used). The study flowchart (overall and by age-group; preschool- versus school-age children) is presented in Fig 1. Details by study and age-group (preschool- versus school-age) are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\nExclusions\nA total of seven studies and four study arms were excluded for the following reasons. First, six studies were excluded as a whole, as they did not meet one or more of the inclusion criteria (two studies because the praziquantel dose was not 40 mg/kg [20, 28], and four studies because the duration of follow-up was >60 days) [5, 18, 29]. Second, we excluded study arms that were outside the set criteria, namely those who received a praziquantel dose higher or lower than 40 mg/kg [13, 14, 22], or were outside the 0–14 years age range [22]. Third, we excluded participants with S. japonicum infection because only one preschool-child was enrolled in Xu et al. [30] out of six participants, and none in Olliaro et al. [22] (Table 1).\nThe remaining 16 studies and study groups enrolled a total of 4,484 (63%) children who were treated with single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel: preschool-age children (n = 1,422; 32%) and school-age children (n = 3,062; 68%). Of note, five studies [11, 15, 22, 27] did not enroll preschool-age children. Sousa-Figueiredo et al. [25] enrolled both preschool- and school-age children aged 6–10 years, and Olliaro et al. [22] included only school-age children aged 10–14 years (Table 1). Overall 75% of the treated children (n = 2,675) were followed up and had a measurable outcome 21–60 days post-treatment; 665 preschool-age children and 2,010 school-age children. More losses to follow-up occurred among the preschool-age children compared to their older counterparts (33% versus 21%, p <0.001).\nOut of the 16 studies included in the analyses, three were randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 13 were single-arm intervention or cohort studies. The RCTs were at low risk of selection bias with computer-generated block randomization, adequate allocation concealment, and blinding of either participants, personnel, or outcome assessment. The single-arm intervention or cohort studies were at unclear risk of bias as there was no randomization, no allocation concealment, and no blinding. Furthermore, no study mentioned if sampling was stratified for preschool- and school-age children. Regarding incomplete outcome data and selective reporting items of the risk of bias tables, attrition rate was generally low (Figs 2 and 3). The funnel plots showed extensive publications bias (Figs 4 and 5). However, for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, half of the studies could not be plotted because they were non-comparative, hence a mean difference and a standard error of the mean between preschool- and school-age children could not be calculated (see also Figs 2 and 3).\nOf the 2,010 evaluable school-age children, 988 were aged 6 to <10 years (382 (56%) presenting with S. mansoni and 301 (44%) with S. haematobium infections), and 1,022 were aged 10–14 years (667 (33%) S. mansoni and 1,343 (67%) S. haematobium infections) (Table 3). Intensity of infection at baseline and treatment outcomes expressed as ERRs calculated as AM as well as CRs are presented in Table 4, stratified by Schistosoma species for the three age groups (details by study in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, stratified by Schistosoma species). The baseline intensity of infection analyses adjusted on study and sex showed a significant difference between age groups with higher counts in the school- than the preschool-age children (Fig 6, S4 Table, S4 Table, S5 Table, and S6 Table). A significant difference in baseline egg counts between boys and girls was found for S. haematobium but not for S. mansoni (S6 Table). The age distribution of participants by Schistosoma species can be found in S2 Fig.\nThe AM-ERRs are also presented graphically as forest plots in Figs 7 and 8 for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively against the ≥95% WHO threshold for efficacy [36]. Overall, 6/13 (2/6 for S. mansoni and 4/7 for S. haematobium) of the study groups with participants in the age-group under 6 years (preschool-age) met the WHO efficacy threshold, compared to 5/14 (1/6 for S. mansoni and 4/8 for S. haematobium) of the children aged 6 to <10 years and 2/14 (0/6 for S. mansoni and 2/8 for S. haematobium) of the children aged 10–14 years).\nThe centile distribution of the individual-patient ERRs is displayed in Figs 9 and 10 for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively.\nThe percentage of patients with ERRs = 0 (no decrease), between >0 and <100%, and 100% (corresponding to the CR) in the different age categories is represented in the bar graphs for each study and in Table 5.\nA majority of ERRs are in the 100% category (i.e. ‘cured' from the current infection). For preschool-age children as well as younger school-age children (aged 6 to 10 years) almost 80% of the subjects have an ERR above 70%, whereas the results per studies are highly hetegeneous in the 10–14 years old for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium as ascertained by the very different cumulative curves. There was a significant difference between age groups (p <0.001) for both species, though for different reasons: for S. mansoni the difference is driven by preschool-age children having about twice as many non-responders as school-age children (10.2% versus 5.1%), while for S. haematobium more preschool-age children were cured (100% ERR: 77.4% versus 60.2%). However, no age difference was seen in treatment outcomes after multivariable adjustment in statistical models. The general linear model of individual-participant ERR with baseline log-transformed egg count as covariate and study, age, and sex as fixed variables did not show any difference in efficacy between age categories in the post-hoc pairwise comparisons of marginal means (least squares means) for either S. mansoni or S. haematobium (Table 6). This was confirmed in a mixed model employing a random effect for each study (Table 7). Neither baseline egg counts nor duration of follow-up influenced treatment outcome (S7 Table and S8 Table). Sensitivity analyses with log-transformed baseline egg counts for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium provided similar results for studies accounted for either as fixed factor (general linear model, S4 Table) or as random effect (mixed model, S5 Table).\nSafety was reported in 7/16 studies with only four studies [13, 16, 19, 35] reporting on evaluable patients who had safety data corresponding to participants with follow-up <60 days, age ≤14 years, and praziquantel dose of 40 mg/kg (total number assessed on day 1 = 1,128; at follow-up = 1,065, 94%) (Table 8). Overall, 226 (20%) patients suffered from at least one AE 4 hours after drug intake, 88 (8%) after 24 hours, and 33 (3%) at the treatment follow-up, respectively. At least one AE was experienced at 4 hours post-treatment by 19% and 44% of under 6-year-old children and children aged 10–14 years, respectively. Only one child had an AE in the 6- to <10-year-old age group. The relative proportions at 24 hours were 5%, 21%, and 0%. At follow-up, 10% of the children aged 10–14 years reported at least one AE, and none in the other age-groups.\nA total of 370, 272, and 134 AEs were reported on the day of treatment 4 hours after drug intake, at 24 hours post-treatment, and at the follow-up visit, respectively. At 4 hours, there were 81 AEs of mild intensity in children aged 0 to <6 years; one mild in the age group 6 to <10 years; and 228 mild, 159 moderate, and one severe AEs in children aged 10–14 years. At 24 hours, 19 mild AEs in the 0 to <6 year age group; none in the children aged 6 to <10 years; and 205 mild, 46 moderate, and two severe AEs in the oldest group of children 10–14 years. At treatment follow-up, a total of 88 mild and 46 moderate AEs were observed in the 10- to 14-year-old age group. The severe AEs were dizziness, anorexia, and diarrhea, but none of the AEs were judged as serious.\nAt 4 hours post-treatment, the most frequent AE was abdominal pain (39.7% of AEs), followed by diarrhea (14.3%), vomiting (9.5%), headache and dizziness (both 8.4%). At 24 hours, it was headache (23.2%) then abdominal pain (16.5%), dizziness (15.1%), and diarrhea (11%). At treatment follow-up, headache (27.6%), abdominal pain (19.4%), anorexia (14.2%), and dizziness (12.7%) were the most frequent AEs.",
    "Discussion": "This individual-participant data meta-analysis aimed to assess whether a single 40 mg/kg oral dose of 40 mg/kg of praziquantel administered to preschool-age children (aged <6 years) would be as efficacious and safe as in school-age children. This kind of evidence is important. Indeed, while the current emphasis of preventive chemotherapy is on school-age children [1, 34], preschool-age children are now also recognized to carry a significant burden of disease, and hence, they are becoming a target for preventive chemotherapy, especially if a pediatric formulation of praziquantel becomes available [6, 7]. Furthermore, efforts are under way to strategically move from morbidity control to elimination, which means preventive chemotherapy might need to be expanded to include all age-groups in order to remove all untreated reservoirs of infection that contribute to ongoing local transmission [40].\nTaken together, our results point to no age-effect on treatment efficacy with the standard single-dose of 40 mg/kg praziquantel, whether administered to children under the age of 6 years (preschool-age), or to school-age children (aged 6–14 years), or whether the latter group is further broken down into 6 to less than 10, and 10 through 14 years (as some studies only included either age-group).\nWe analyzed data using two models: (i) a general linear model with or without baseline log-transformed Schistosoma egg counts as covariate and study, age, and sex as cofactors; and (ii) a mixed model with or without baseline log-transformed egg counts as covariate, age as a fixed factor, with a random effect for each study. None of these models detected a statistically significant difference in the individual ERRs between age categories. These analyses also show that the lower baseline egg counts found in preschool-age children did not have an effect on treatment outcome, nor did duration of follow-up within the 21–60 day time-frame.\nOur conclusions are further supported by the observation that, when using the WHO-recommended AM-ERR, there is no indication that fewer groups composed of preschool-age children meet the WHO ≥95% efficacy threshold compared to school-age children. These results are in overall agreement with mixed-effect multivariate analysis of aggregated data that found no significant difference between preschool- and school-age children for CR or geometric mean ERR for either S. mansoni or S. haematobium after controlling for time of assessment, formulation, intensity of infection, and diagnostic approach [41]. While host factors, like age-related differences in drug metabolizing activity [42] might play a role in praziquantel metabolism and overall efficacy, increasing the dose to 60 mg/kg may not lead to better efficacy. Two of the studies conducted in Côte d’Ivoire contributing to this analysis, which also studied the response to placebo and doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg, showed a flat dose-response curve in both preschool- and school-age children infected with S. haematobium and preschool-children infected with S. mansoni [13, 14]. Another study [22] compared 40 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg in children aged 10–14 years, and did not find a difference either. Similarly, in an aggregated-data meta-analysis using a random-effect meta-analysis regression model, a dose-effect for CR was found up to 40 mg/kg for S. mansoni and 30 mg/kg for S. haematobium with no benefit in increasing the dose, in school-age children [43].\nTreatment with a single 40 mg/kg oral dose of praziquantel was well tolerated, especially in preschool-age children who experienced fewer and generally only mild AEs when compared to school-age children. Previous systematic reviews pertaining to the efficacy and safety of praziquantel for schistosomiasis already showed that praziquantel is safe and AEs usually mild and self-limiting [41, 44, 45]. It is, however, conceivable that this is a result of underreporting by younger children, if AEs were not specifically and proactively elicited.\nOur study has several limitations. First, out of 16 studies included in the analysis, 13 were single-arm thus with an unclear risk of bias concerning selection of participants. Second, the studies enrolled selectively different age groups, so we used the principles of network meta-analysis to compare participant outcomes in different groups, which were not necessarily enrolled at the same site and time, and might thus not be comparable. Third, safety and tolerability at large were also generally underreported. Fourth, no information is available for S. japonicum. A more general methodological issue is the limitations of counting eggs in excreta in young children, and the imperfect correlation between egg shedding and worm burden, which would be better reflected by antigen-detection methods. [46] However, the significance and comparability of results of efficacy studies based on antigen-detection methods vis-à-vis direct egg-detection remains unclear.\nIn conclusion, based on the data presented here, there is no indication that preventive chemotherapy with single-dose 40 mg/kg praziquantel would be less efficacious and tolerated in preschool-age children than it is in school-age children. However, these conclusions are drawn from an available, limited body of evidence, which is only a tiny fraction of the overall use of praziquantel, with only a few studies designed for direct comparisons between age groups. Whether and when preschool-age children will be exposed systematically to preventive chemotherapy, close monitoring of efficacy as well as safety will be required. This in particular considering preschool-age children have about twice as high rates of non-responders in the individual-patient ERR analysis than older children.\nIt should also be noted that the WHO-recommended 95% ERR threshold was not met in many studies, which calls for improved dosing and delivery strategies."
