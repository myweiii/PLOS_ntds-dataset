Schistosomiasis is a diseases caused by helminths (parasitic worms) which affects the intestinal and urogenital systems. In areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, the disease is controlled by the large scale distributing of praziquantel, primarily targeting school-age children. Younger children (preschool-age) too might be affected by schistosomiasis, but are currently not receiving praziquantel within treatment campaigns. Instead, preschool-age children are treated on a case-by-case basis because the current praziquantel formulation is not adapted to young children. Questions have also been raised as to whether the standard dose of 40 mg/kg given once is effective in preschool-age children. To answer this question, we collected individual-participant data from a series of studies in which 40 mg/kg of praziquantel had been given to children with intestinal or urinary schistosomiasis, and compared its efficacy and tolerability across age-groups. Since few direct comparisons had been made, we used statistical tools to make these comparisons. We found no evidence that treatment is less efficacious in preschool- than in school-age children and conclude that 40 mg/kg praziquantel may be given to preschool-age children in large-scale programs. When this happens, efficacy and tolerability will have to be closely monitored.
