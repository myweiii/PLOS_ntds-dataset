The tick-born Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes severe human disease with high fatality rates. Outbreaks have been documented in a large geographic area from Africa to Asia. Unfortunately, vaccines that would prevent infection with the virus or antiviral drugs that can be administered for disease treatment are not available. Biosafety requirements further impede research in this area. The development of biochemical tools could potentially address this problem. Here we have expressed recombinant viral L-protein in insect cells. The L-protein is unusually large and exhibits RNA synthesis and deubiquitinating activities that are required for efficient viral growth. We have demonstrated that two distinct activities can be monitored in biochemical assays. Inhibition of these activities was shown with prototypic compounds. Hence, the purified L-protein provides an attractive target and tool for future drug discovery and development efforts.
