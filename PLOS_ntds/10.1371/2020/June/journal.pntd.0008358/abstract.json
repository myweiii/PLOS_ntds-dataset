    "Abstract": "Antibody-mediated parasite killing is considered the most effective host immune response against extracellular trypanosome parasites. However, due to host-parasite co-evolution pressure, these parasites have \u201clearned\u201d how to hijack the host immune system via the development of immune evasion strategies. Hereby they prevent elimination and promote transmission. In the past, our group has shown that African trypanosome parasites are able to \u201cshut down\u201d the host B cell compartment, via the abolishment of the homeostatic B cell compartment. In line with this, we have reported that trypanosome infections result in detrimental outcomes on auto-reactive and cancer B cells. To unravel the immune mechanisms involved in these processes we adopted here a well-defined B cell vaccine model, i.e. the thymo-dependent hapten-carrier NP-CGG (4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin) emulsified in Alum adjuvant. Results show that T. brucei infections abrogate the circulating titres of vaccine-induced CGG-specific as well as NP-specific IgG1+ antibodies, a hallmark of memory B cell responses in this model. This happens independently of their affinity and IFN\u0263 signalling. Next, we demonstrate that T. brucei infections also induce a decrease of anti-NP IgG3+ antibodies induced by the administration of NP coupled to Ficoll, a thymo-independent antigen. Confirming the non-specificity of the infection-associated immunopathology, this report also shows that trypanosome infections abolish vaccine-induced memory response against malaria parasite in BALB/c mice. Together, these data indicates that T. brucei infections impair every stages of B cell development, including effector plasma B cells, independently of their specificity and affinity as well as the host genetic background."
