Zika virus has gained new significance during the past few years when it became associated with increased numbers of birth defects. Zika virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are other ways the virus can be transmitted. One of these ways is through sexual transmission. In order to better understand how Zika virus can persist in humans and may be transmitted sexually, we examined the interactions between Zika virus and Sertoli cells, a specialized male testicular cell responsible for sperm production. We examined how Zika virus infection affected more than 1300 Sertoli cell proteins and found that virus infection altered cellular pathways responsible for sperm production. At the same time, Zika virus had little effect upon overall structure of the cells. This information helps better explain the long-lived persistence of Zika virus in human male reproductive cells and the virusâ€™ capacity to be sexually transmitted.
