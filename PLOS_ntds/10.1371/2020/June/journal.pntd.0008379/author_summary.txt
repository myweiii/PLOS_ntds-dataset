Bothrops jararaca snakebites induce hemostatic disturbances in man and animals, but no information is available about how the liver, the main organ involved in the synthesis of hemostasis-related factors, copes with this condition. In an effort to understand how these factors recover after B. jararaca snakebites, we evaluated the hepatic gene expression of hemostatic-related factors after experimental envenomation in mice. We noticed that a marked increase in gene expression of fibrinogen chains occurred 3 and 6 h after subcutaneous administration of B. jararaca venom, explaining thereby the rapid recovery of the coagulation disturbance after administration of specific antivenom to patients. Interestingly, gene expression of other coagulation factors consumed during envenomation, e.g. factors V, VIII, and prothrombin, was scarcely affected over time, while the expression of tissue factor mRNA was promptly decreased at 3 h. Moreover, gene expression of acute-phase proteins was modified by envenomation, as well as of the transcription factor STAT3. Gene expression of NF-ÎºB1 was not altered significantly over time, but it was associated with the regulation of mRNA levels of various hemostasis-related genes. Our results showed that B. jararaca envenomation induces a rapid change in gene expression of some coagulation factors and acute phase proteins.
