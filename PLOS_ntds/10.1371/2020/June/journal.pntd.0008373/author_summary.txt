Atypical EPEC (aEPEC) is one of the most frequent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes isolated from patients in Brazil and is associated with diarrheal outbreaks. This study is the first to sequence the genomes of a collection of aEPEC isolates from a South American country, Brazil, and compare their phylogenetic relationships and gene content with a global collection of aEPEC. This approach identified Brazilian aEPEC genomes in previously characterized EPEC/EHEC phylogenomic lineages and resulted in the identification of five novel EPEC phylogenomic lineages, designated EPEC11 to EPEC15. We also observed that virulence genes, such as espG2, espT and espC were more frequently identified among the Brazilian aEPEC genomes, demonstrating potential differences in the virulence repertoire of this pathogen in Brazil.
