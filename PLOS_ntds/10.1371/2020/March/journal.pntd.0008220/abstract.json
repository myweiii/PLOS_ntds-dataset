    "Abstract": "Human clonorchiasis, caused by Clonorchis sinensis, is endemic in East Asian countries. C. sinensis metacercariae excyst in the duodenum of mammalian hosts, migrate to the intrahepatic bile duct, and mature into adults in the milieu of bile. We have previously shown that newly excysted juvenile C. sinensis move chemotactically toward bile and bile acids. Here, the chemotactic behavior of adult C. sinensis (CsAd) toward bile and bile acids was investigated. CsAds moved toward 0.05–5% bile and were most attracted to 0.5% bile but moved away from 10% bile. Upon exposure to 1–10% bile, CsAds eventually stopped moving and then died quickly. Among bile acids, CsAds showed strong chemotaxis toward cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid. On the contrary, CsAds repelled from lithocholic acid (LCA). Moreover, at higher than 10 mM LCA, CsAds became sluggish and eventually died. Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists (LE-300 and SKF-83566), D2/3 receptor antagonists (raclopride and its derivative CS-49612), and a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor inhibited CA-induced chemotaxis of CsAds almost completely. Clinically used antipsychotic drugs, namely chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and clozapine, are dopaminergic antagonists and are secreted into bile. They completely inhibited chemotaxis of CsAds toward CA. At the maximum doses used to treat patients, the three tested medicines only expelled 2–12% of CsAds from the experimentally infected rabbits, but reduced egg production by 64–79%. Thus, antipsychotic medicines with dopaminergic antagonism could be considered as new anthelmintic candidates for human C. sinensis infections."
