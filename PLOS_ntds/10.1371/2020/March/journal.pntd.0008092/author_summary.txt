Sosuga virus (SOSV) was first identified in August 2012 in a sample obtained from a biologist that had become severely ill after working with bats in Sudan and Uganda. Testing of bat tissues from Uganda revealed the presence of SOSV RNA in Egyptian rousette bats (ERB: Rousettus aegyptiacus). To more definitively determine if these bats could be reservoir hosts of SOSV with potential for transmitting the virus to humans, we subcutaneously inoculated 12 captive-bred ERBs with a recombinant SOSV and collected biological samples daily through 21 days post inoculation (DPI) to investigate the dynamics of virus infection and shedding. All bats became infected with SOSV and exhibited only mild cellular pathology following histopathological analyses. Multiple qRT-PCR and virus isolation positive tissues were collected as well as urine, oral, rectal, and fecal swabs, indicative of a systemic infection. At study completion, no animals had displayed any overt clinical signs of infection, virus was detected in multiple tissues, and all infected bats euthanized at the latest time point had seroconverted to SOSV. Collectively, our study demonstrates ERBs are a competent host and exhibit attributes consistent with being a natural reservoir and zoonotic source for SOSV.
