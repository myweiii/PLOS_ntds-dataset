Trachoma elimination efforts are hampered by limited understanding of Ct transmission routes. One previous study demonstrated Ct in nasal secretions, with lower loads than in paired ocular samples. Two other studies reported 15–23% of Musca sorbens caught leaving the faces of Ethiopian children to be PCR-positive for Ct in untreated villages with 30–50% TF prevalence. To date, no published studies have systematically documented the relative frequency of Ct by PCR on non-ocular surfaces and flies. Cross-sectional studies consistently find active trachoma and ocular Ct infection associated with factors such as dirty faces, fly-eye contact, limited water access, crowded living conditions and limited sanitation. In this study, we conducted a population-based household survey in Oromia Region, Ethiopia and test the hypothesis that Ct can be detected at multiple non-ocular sites and on eye-seeking flies. The results of our study show that Ct DNA was only detected on hands, faces and clothing of individuals living in ocular-positive households. In addition, Ct-positive flies were much more likely to be found in ocular-positive households. These findings suggest there may be several plausible ocular Ct transmission routes between people, within and between households, which would need to be simultaneously addressed within communities to suppress transmission.
