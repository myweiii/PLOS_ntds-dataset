    "Background": "Trachoma elimination efforts are hampered by limited understanding of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) transmission routes. Here we aimed to detect Ct DNA at non-ocular sites and on eye-seeking flies.",
    "Methods": "A population-based household survey was conducted in Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Ocular and non-ocular (faces, hands, clothing, water containers and sleeping surfaces) swabs were collected from all individuals. Flies were caught from faces of children. Flies, ocular swabs and non-ocular swabs were tested for Ct by quantitative PCR.",
    "Results": "In total, 1220 individuals in 247 households were assessed. Active trachoma (trachomatous inflammation—follicular) and ocular Ct were detected in 10% and 2% of all-ages, and 21% and 3% of 1–9-year-olds, respectively. Ct was detected in 12% (95% CI:8–15%) of tested non-ocular swabs from ocular-positive households, but in none of the non-ocular swabs from ocular-negative households. Ct was detected on 24% (95% CI:18–32%) of flies from ocular-positive households and 3% (95% CI:1–6%) of flies from ocular-negative households.",
    "Conclusion": "Ct DNA was detected on hands, faces and clothing of individuals living in ocular-positive households suggesting that this might be a route of transmission within Ct infected households. In addition, we detected Ct on flies from ocular-positive households and occasionally in ocular-negative households suggesting that flies might be a vector for transmission within and between Ct infected and uninfected households. These potential transmission routes may need to be simultaneously addressed to suppress transmission."
