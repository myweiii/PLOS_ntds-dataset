Typhoid fever remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Historical investments in water and sanitation systems are thought to have led to the decline in typhoid fever in developed countries, such that most of the global burden of disease now occurs in regions with poor sanitary conditions and inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. However, there is limited empirical evidence to quantify the impact of investments in water and sanitation on typhoid fever incidence. We developed a mathematical model to examine trends in weekly typhoid mortality data from 1889â€“1931 in 16 U.S. cities. Through this analysis, we were able to examine how seasonal patterns of typhoid transmission varied geographically and historically depending on the water supply and treatment, and quantify the relationship between investments in water and sanitation infrastructures and long-term typhoid transmission rates. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of typhoid transmission dynamics and potential impact of improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure. Resource-poor countries must prioritize spending on public health issues, weighing the costs and benefits of interventions. Our results can help to inform comparative cost-effectiveness analyses of different interventions to reduce the global burden of typhoid fever.
