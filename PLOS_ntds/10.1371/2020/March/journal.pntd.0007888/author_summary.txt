Campylobacter infections are increasing worldwide but we still know little about the true burden of disease in the developing world, and even less about the role of wildlife and environmental reservoirs in human exposure and infection. Here we take a one-health approach evaluating Campylobacter infections in humans, banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), and the environment. We found evidence of widespread infection with Campylobacter spp. infecting nearly a quarter of sampled adults and children (23.0%, n = 122, 2011), dominantly with C. jejuni. Banded mongooses live in close association with humans in the area and over half of the animals sampled were found positive for Campylobacter spp. (56%, n = 201, 2017). Infection with C. jejuni was greater among mongooses utilizing human-made structures as den sites than those using natural dens. These data suggest that wildlife utilization of anthropogenic landscapes may increase C. jejuni exposure and infection. In turn, pathogen circulation and transmission in urbanizing wildlife reservoirs may increase human vulnerability to infection, particularly impoverished populations, where greater environmental exposures are expected.
