This study used Bayesian spatiotemporal modelling to analyze the factors that influence the incidence of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)in Shenzhen, including socioeconomic factors and air pollution factors. A total of 171,210 HFMD cases and socioeconomic and air pollution data from 2012â€“2015 were included in the analysis. Studies have confirmed that socioeconomic factors and air pollution factors affect the risk of HFMD in Shenzhen, China. By testing the optimal model, the relative risk map of each area was drawn to identify the high-risk areas of HFMD and the future trends of the disease. The results will be of great practical significance to local authorities, which is conducive to accurate prevention and can be used to formulate targeted disease intervention measures.
