Dengue virus is the most significant arthropod-borne virus infecting man. Understanding how long dengue virus can persist in populations of varying size is key to understanding its epidemiology. This is, however, impossible to achieve in settings where dengue is endemic, because of continued human movement and is further complexified by the occurrence of several co-circulating serotypes. By contrast, French Polynesia, an isolated group of 72 inhabited islands in the South Pacific, has had intermittent majoritarily monotypic dengue epidemics since the 1940s and offers a unique opportunity to address questions of viral persistence, turnover and the importance of spatial sub-structure in determining dengue epidemiology. Collating and analyzing a database of laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from across French Polynesia over a 35 year period we were able to show that dengue virus die-out can occur with or without replacement by a new serotype, monotypic transmission of dengue viruses fails to be maintained within small island populations but can persist for years among isolated islands connected via air and sea links. This remarkable long-term persistence of dengue virus in French Polynesia could be maintained by asynchronous viral transmission among connected islands and/or by repeated seeding from a reservoir of sub-clinical infections in the most populated island, Tahiti.
