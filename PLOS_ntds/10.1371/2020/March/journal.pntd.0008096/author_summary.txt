Assessing the impact of vector control programmes requires longitudinal measurements of the abundance of insect vectors within intervention areas. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases of disease are low. Efficient monitoring involves a prior selection of monitoring sites that are easy to reach and produce rich information on vector abundance. Here, we used image classification and cost-distance algorithms to produce estimates of accessibility within Koboko district, Uganda, where vector control is contributing to the elimination of sleeping sickness, a neglected tropical disease (NTD). We combine an accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine locations which are associated with low cost (lowest travel time) and potential for longitudinal data collection (high pre-intervention abundance). Our method could be adapted for use in the planning and monitoring of tsetse- and other vector-control programmes. By providing methods to ensure that vector control programmes operate at maximum efficiency, we can ensure that the limited funding associated with some of these NTDs has the largest impact.
