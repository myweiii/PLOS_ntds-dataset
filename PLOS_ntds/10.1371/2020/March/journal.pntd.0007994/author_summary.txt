Zika is an important epidemiological threat in Latin America, including the Dominican Republic. Because Zika disproportionately affects women, understanding gender’s role in Zika prevention is key to strengthening current and future programs. We explored the role of gender in Zika among men and women in the Dominican Republic. Topics included perceptions about Zika and perceived feasibility/effectiveness of specific Zika-prevention behaviors. We uncovered that women are largely responsible for household chores—including cleaning water storage containers (a primary mosquito vector habitat)—with men as assistants. In addition, men described their role in the family as the protector. Finally, men and women believed that partners would perceive suggesting condom use or abstinence during pregnancy as a sign of infidelity. Study findings offer valuable programmatic implications that integrate gender-related considerations in social and behavior change programs related to Zika and other arboviruses. In the end, integrating gender in a way that is mindful of the local context while not exploiting existing gender roles is critical for reducing the burden of Zika and other similar mosquito-borne diseases in the Dominican Republic and throughout the region.
