In male, T. vaginalis infection have been proposed to involve in several prostate diseases such as prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. However, studies for these mechanisms have been rare. We have previously reported that T. vaginalis induce the production of inflammatory cytokines in prostate cells. Among these cytokines, IL-6 have been reported to play an important role in M2 macrophage polarization, which lead to formation of tumor microenvironment in various cancers. Here we show that IL-6 produced by T. vaginalis infection in prostate epithelial cells induces M2 polarization of macrophages and these macrophages promote proliferation of prostate cancer cells. These findings suggest that T. vaginalis indirectly induces progression of prostate cancer by creating a tumor microenvironment through an inflammatory response.
