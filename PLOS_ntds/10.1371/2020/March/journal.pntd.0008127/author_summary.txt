The risk to human health of contact with armadillos infected with Mycobacterium leprae, a bacterium that causes Hansen’s Disease (leprosy), is uncertain, but evidence from Brazil and other countries appears to show a link between contact with armadillos and increased risk of Hansen’s Disease in people. How much of Hansen’s Disease in the human population is caused by contact with armadillos will depend on the size of the risk, the type and frequency of contact and how common it is in the population, and the role of other (human-to-human) transmission routes for Mycobacterium leprae. Our review has shown that one other key factor, the proportion of wild armadillos infected with Mycobacterium leprae, cannot be predicted with any certainty based on data from studies conducted to date. We suggest that much bigger and longer-term studies are needed, perhaps in partnership with animal conservation and ecology groups, to map Mycobacterium leprae infection in armadillos across Brazil and correlate this with proximity to human habitats. At the same time, data must be gathered in studies focused on populations of armadillos to characterize Mycobacterium leprae transmission and persistence within groups of animals, for example, using trackers and repeated sampling over the animals’ lifespans. In the meantime, the precautionary principle should prevail, and public health and educational efforts should be directed to improving community knowledge and changing behaviour to protect people and armadillos.
