Understanding how the environment affects Zika virus transmission is critical for protecting public health. Warmer temperatures accelerate mosquitoesâ€™ transmission of disease-causing pathogens, but this is not well-characterized for Zika virus in its primary vector, Aedes aegypti. In this study we measure the effect of a range of temperatures on Zika virus infection, dissemination, and transmission in Ae. aegypti and provide a mathematical equation that can be used in risk models to predict Zika virus transmission dynamics. We also explore how the effect of temperature on Zika virus transmission compares to the effects of temperature on other mosquito-borne viruses.
