Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which causes lesions on the skin and peripheral nerves. Some patients do not present an efficient immune response and have a disseminated infection (multibacillary, Mb). Mb patients have lipid accumulation in infected tissues that is important for microorganism survival. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is composed of proteins and lipids and is produced in the liver. It removes excess of lipids from peripheral tissues and presents anti-inflammatory activity; however, these activities are not being properly performed in leprosy. To understand more about HDL metabolism on leprosy, the chemical composition and functionality of HDL from leprosy patients were analyzed before and after treatment with antibiotics (multidrug therapy, MDT). It was observed that HDL has an altered lipid composition in Mb patients before MDT, which may lead to an impairment of its functions. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the main HDL protein, seems to be highly affected during infection. These functions can be slightly recovered after MDT, but not in the levels of healthy individuals. Our data open new perspectives to elucidate the modulation of lipid metabolism in leprosy and consequently to prevent disease complications.
