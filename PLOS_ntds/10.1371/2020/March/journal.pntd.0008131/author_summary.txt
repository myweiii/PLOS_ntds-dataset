Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent pathogen causing anthrax in West and Central African countries. It shares multiple bacteriological and genomic characteristics with Bacillus anthracis, the gram-positive bacterium causing anthrax in mammals worldwide. However, Bcbva has only been isolated in tropical humid forested environments in Africa; thus, we attempted to characterize its potential distribution and the differences with B. anthracis using an ecological niche modeling framework. According to our results, both pathogens are using different environments and their distribution looks complementary with B. anthracis occupying savanna-like environments and Bcbva occupying forested areas; further, we detected some level of overlap between the potential geographic distributions of B. anthracis and Bcbva, despite their lack of overlap in their current environmental space. This is the first time the potential distribution of Bcbva is addressed considering all the available spatial information on the pathogen occurrence available as of 2017. Although our Bcbva models are limited due to sample size, this exploration informs on areas that would likely be considered for further investigation of Bcbva outbreaks with special emphasis on areas where Bcbva and B. anthracis could co-exist.
