Among the five Plasmodium species infecting humans, P. vivax is the most prevalent parasite outside Africa. To date, there has been less research on this species than for Plasmodium falciparum, a more lethal species, principally because of the lack of an in vitro culture system and also because P. vivax is considered relatively benign. Nevertheless, P. vivax is responsible for severe and incapacitating clinical symptoms with significant effects on human health. The emergence of new drug resistance and the discovery of severe and even fatal cases due to P. vivax question the benign status of P. vivax malaria. In recent years, there has been increased interest in characterizing the distribution of genetic variation in P. vivax. However, these studies either generated genetic information from a regional geographic scale or combine genetic datasets generated in different molecular platforms, which is known to generate biased results. In this study, we used a single genotyping platform to genotype 14 microsatellite markers in 834 samples of P. vivax obtained from 28 locations in 20 countries from around the world, including several populations from East and West Africa. We discuss the worldwide population genetic structure and the evolutionary origins of P. vivax, as well as its introduction into the Americas.
