Musca sorbens, also known as the Bazaar Fly, visits peopleâ€™s faces to feed on ocular and nasal discharge. While feeding, M. sorbens can transmit Chlamydia trachomatis, the bacterium that causes the infectious eye disease trachoma. Around 1.9 million people worldwide are visually impaired or blind from this disease. Although it is believed that M. sorbens transmits trachoma, very few studies have looked at ways to control this fly. A large-scale trial has shown that control of fly populations with insecticide reduces active trachoma disease prevalence. Odour-baited traps for the suppression of disease vector populations are an attractive option as there is no widespread spraying of insecticide; however, highly attractive baits are critical to their success. Here, we demonstrate that the preference of these flies for breeding in human faeces is probably mediated by odour cues, and we isolate chemicals in the odour of human faeces that cause a response in the antennae of M. sorbens. These compounds may play a role in the specific attractiveness of human faeces to these flies, perhaps by being present in greater amounts or at favourable ratios. These may be developed into a chemical lure for odour-baited trapping to suppress M. sorbens populations.
