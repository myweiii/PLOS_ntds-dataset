Rabies is a viral disease that causes thousands of deaths worldwide every year, but can be preventable through vaccination of animals and humans. In the production of inactivated rabies vaccines, quality control assays use large amounts of laboratory animals. In order to reduce the number of animals in this practice, in vitro methods for residual live virus detection need to be developed. This study shows that combining two simple and effective techniques may be a safer and more accurate method for the detection of residual rabies virus than in vivo assays to evaluate inactivated vaccines and can be used as an intermediate quality control assay of vaccine production.
