Helminth infections are postulated to provide a degree of protection against the development of metabolic disorders such as T2DM and alleviate pathology following development of such disorders. However, the biological mechanism underlying this interaction is largely unknown. Since pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are major drivers of pathology in T2DM, we examined the influence of coexistent helminth infection (in this case, Strongyloides stercoralis) on the cytokine and chemokine milieu in T2DM. We demonstrate that helminth infection significantly alleviates the pro-inflammatory milieu in T2DM by lowering the systemic levels of cytokines and chemokines. We also demonstrate that anthelmintic therapy exacerbates this pro-inflammatory milieu by partially restoring the high levels of cytokines and chemokines. So, our data uncovers a role for cytokines and chemokines in the mainstream interaction between helminth infections and metabolic disorders.
