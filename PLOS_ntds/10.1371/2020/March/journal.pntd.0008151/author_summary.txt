Fungi of the Sporothrix schenckii Complex are the causative agents of the sporotrichosis, subcutaneous mycosis that presents a massive global distribution. In this work, we perform a taxonomic review, by a poliphasic approach, of Sporothrix sp. isolates stored in the University of Recife Culture Collection (Micoteca URM), previously identified as Sporothrix schenckii by classic methods of taxonomic identification. In addition, we perform the method of broth microdilution, aiming to acquire the minimal inhibitory concentration of the standard antifungals (itraconazole and amphotericin B) against these isolates. By sequencing of the partial Î²-tub-encoding gene, we confirm the occurrence of S. schenckii, and identified four isolates as the S. pallida Complex component, S. chilensis. All the isolates were susceptible to the antifungals, except one, that shows resistance to amphotericin B. Our study demonstrated the first occurrence of S. chilensis in Brazil. Also, we provide the first data concerned the resistance profile of this specie for the choice antifungals in the sporotrichosis treatment, what will have important implications with this regard in the future.
