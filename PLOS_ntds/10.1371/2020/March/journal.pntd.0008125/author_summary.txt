Visceral leishmaniasis is a life threatening neglected tropical disease affecting around 500,000 and killing 50,000 individuals a year. Despite its obligatory dependence on host cell metabolism and the lack of effective, non-toxic, orally bioavailable anti-leishmanial drugs, Leishmania-perturbed host cell metabolomes and its relation to anti-leishmanial chemotherapy remains unexplored. Transcriptomic analysis performed on L. donovani-infected macrophages identified patterns of gene expression associated with glutamine metabolism. In vitro and in vivo pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase (GLS), which catalyzes the first reaction in the primary pathway for the catabolism of glutamine, significantly increased the susceptibility to infection demonstrating the role of glutamine metabolism to L. donovani infection. More importantly, we demonstrated that glutamine supplementation during miltefosine treatment potentiates L. donovani clearance through the development of a more effective anti-Leishmania innate and adaptive immune response. Overall, our work demonstrated that glutamine-miltefosine synergy is a novel combined host- and pathogen-directed treatment for combating visceral leishmaniasis.
