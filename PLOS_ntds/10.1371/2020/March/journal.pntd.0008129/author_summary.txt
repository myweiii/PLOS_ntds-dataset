Schistosomiasis, otherwise known as bilharzia or snail fever, is a prevalent human disease found across tropical regions of the world and is a major cause of disability. The disease is acquired from exposure to the schistosome infectious larvae released by infected host snails in freshwaters. Programs to restrict the transmission of schistosomiasis would benefit from rapid and reliable diagnostic methods to detect schistosomes. Here we report a study that has developed new diagnostic tools to identify the DNA from three human-infecting Schistosoma species within water samples. This “environmental DNA” (eDNA) approach requires the filtering and laboratory analyses of water samples, and avoids the requirements to locate, identify and individually test the infectious status of host snails. Our results showed that eDNA methods detect the presence of the parasite in freshwater bodies. However, there is need for further refinement for sampling and laboratory techniques to improve the performance of the assays. We anticipate that eDNA approaches will provide information on the distribution and abundance the water-borne parasites, and potentially contribute to the control and elimination of schistosomiasis.
