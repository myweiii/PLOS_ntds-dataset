    "Abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi parasites utilise de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis to produce DNA and survive within mammalian host cells. This pathway can be hijacked to assess the replication of intracellular parasites with the exogenous addition of a DNA specific probe. To identify suitable probe compounds for this application, a collection of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues was assessed for incorporation into T. cruzi intracellular amastigote DNA using image-based technology and script-based analysis. Associated mammalian cell toxicity of these compounds was also determined against both the parasite host cells (3T3 cells) and HEK293 cells. Incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) into parasite DNA was the most effective of the probes tested, with minimal growth inhibition observed following either two or four hours EdU exposure. EdU was subsequently utilised as a DNA probe, followed by visualisation with click chemistry to a fluorescent azide, to assess the impact of drugs and compounds with previously demonstrated activity against T. cruzi parasites, on parasite replication. The inhibitory profiles of these molecules highlight the benefit of this approach for identifying surviving parasites post-treatment in vitro and classifying compounds as either fast or slow-acting. F-ara-EdU resulted in <50% activity observed against T. cruzi amastigotes following 48 hours incubation, at 73 \u03bcM. Collectively, this supports the further development of pyrimidine nucleosides as chemical probes to investigate replication of the parasite T. cruzi."
