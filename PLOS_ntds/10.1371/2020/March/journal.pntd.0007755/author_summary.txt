Despite many achievements in identifying novel agents for the treatment of tropical and neglected diseases, further research continues to be of fundamental importance. Our research groups have been using the cruzipain cysteine protease in its recombinant form, cruzain (Cz), to identify new trypanocidal agents. Considering the possible interchangeability with other cysteine proteases, the same series of dipeptidyl nitriles was tested in Leishmania mexicana LmCPB. Other potential targets for such inhibitors are human cysteine cathepsins, which are involved in different disease states. Thus, the inhibitors were also tested against cathepsins B, L, K, and S. Our results demonstrate that appropriate structural modifications of dipeptidyl nitriles can lead to inhibition of these cysteine proteases. It was also possible to identify trypanocidal agents, equipotent to benznidazole, the current drug of choice used for the treatment of Chagas disease.
