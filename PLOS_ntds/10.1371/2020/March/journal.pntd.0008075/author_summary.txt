The KAP research design is widely used in diagnosing the current awareness of any diseases and to evaluate the efficiency of any health-related treatments or intervention programs. Until date, such KAP assessment and health education programs regarding dengue in the disaster-affected region are relatively rare, especially in Malaysia. Providing health education to the community is as important as other vector control strategies such as source reduction and insecticide spraying because none of these will be successful without community involvement is disease prevention. The massive flood that struck the east coast region of Malaysia poses a possible threat in Kelantan for dengue transmission. Dengue KAP assessment associated with health education for the community at risk is essential to find the gaps in the community and also to ensure their understanding in vector biology, disease spread mechanisms and key behaviors that need to be adopted in order to prevent the spread of dengue. The study provides useful content and knowledge that could guide local authorities and health officials to plan and execute health education programs to disaster-affected populations and also unaffected populations to prevent and control dengue.
