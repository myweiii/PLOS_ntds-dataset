We are very grateful to the village head, agricultural extension worker, volunteers and field workers of Ochollo, who made the sample collection possible. Also, we want to thank Dr. Simon Shibru of Arba Minch University for his support in Ethiopia. Our special thanks goes out to Natalie Van Houtte of the Evolutionary Ecology Group (University of Antwerp, Belgium) for her excellent technical assistance in the laboratory.
