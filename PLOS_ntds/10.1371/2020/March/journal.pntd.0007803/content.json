    "Introduction": "Enteric bacterial pathogens constitute a major burden on global health, especially in children younger than five years of age [1, 2]. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) surveyed children ages 0\u201359 months in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia and identified the leading etiological agents of moderate-to-severe (MSD) and less-severe diarrhea (LSD) in this age group [1, 3]. Included on the list were Shigella species, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) among others. Episodes of MSD and LSD can each have long term impacts on child health, most notably linear growth faltering. Other pathogens like multidrug resistant typhoid and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) caused by different serovars of Salmonella enterica are also a source of infections in sub-Saharan Africa that can have short- and long-term health consequences [4\u20136]. The dire need for vaccines against enteric bacterial pathogens like C. jejuni, Shigella, ETEC and Salmonella has been recognized for decades, especially within military settings [2]. While there are numerous candidate vaccines under evaluation, the path forward remains challenging and alternative approaches need to be considered to combat C. jejuni, Shigella, ETEC and Salmonella in the immediate future.\nWith the advent of affordable and scalable platforms for the production of pathogen-specific IgG and secretory IgA (SIgA), the notion of oral passive immunization with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a strategy to blunt diarrheal diseases in high-risk populations is gaining attention. For example, it was reported that ingestion of polyclonal hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC), marketed as Travelan, reduces experimental traveler\u2019s associated ETEC infection [7]. Sears and colleagues recently presented evidence that IgG and possibly IgA antibodies in Travelan and a related HBC product (IMM-24E) may exert their protective effects through arresting ETEC motility and complement-mediated killing [8]. More recently, Guintini and colleagues demonstrated that oral administration of IgG or IgA mAbs targeting a single adhesin (CfaE) were able to reduce ETEC colonization by several orders of magnitude in a mouse model [9]. In the case of invasive Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm), Corth\u00e9sy and colleagues reported that polyreactive secretory-like IgA/IgM mixtures were capable of reducing bacterial entry into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues [10, 11]. While these studies represent a proof of concept that oral immunoglobulins can abrogate Salmonella infection, the amount of IgA/IgM required to achieve a reduction in bacterial burden was excessive (i.e., ~10 mg of SIgA/IgM; ~ 500 mg/kg) and likely impractical if translated to a human setting. For that reason, we sought to investigate the potential benefit of a mAb-based passive immunization approach in blocking invasive Salmonella.\nSal4 is a well-characterized, dimeric IgA mAb originally isolated from a panel of B cell hybridomas derived from Peyer\u2019s patch tissues of mice that had been immunized with an attenuated strain of STm [12]. Sal4 recognizes the O5-antigen of STm lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [13]. The O-antigen of STm is a tetrasaccharide consisting of galactose, rhamnose, and mannose, with an abequose (3,6 dideoy-galactose) moiety on the mannose side chain. The O5 antigen is conferred when the abequose residue is acetylated, while the O4 antigen is defined by the absence of acetylation modification [14]. Both STm O4 and O5 serotypes are invasive in mouse models of intragastric and parenteral challenge, although the actual lethal dose values vary slightly [13].\nIn the so-called backpack tumor model, it was shown that Sal4 IgA, when actively transported into the intestinal lumen of mice in the form of secretory IgA (SIgA), was able to reduce STm uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues [13]. Peyer\u2019s patches represent the point of entry for invasive strains of Salmonella enterica and the bottleneck for systemic dissemination [15]. Sal4 IgA\u2019s protective capacity was limited to the gut, as even high levels of Sal4 IgA in circulation were unable to curtail STm systemic infection in the face of a parenteral bacterial challenge [13]. Thus, Sal4 IgA limits STm infection exclusively in the context of the gastrointestinal lumen. Although the exact mechanisms by which Sal4 IgA prevents bacterial uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues have not been fully resolved, Sal4 IgA strongly promotes bacterial agglutination in vitro and is a potent inhibitor of STm flagella-based motility in liquid and viscous media [16].\nIn this report, Sal4 IgA was chosen as a prototype to investigate the potential of orally administered mAbs to passively immunize against invasive Salmonella. We first established a robust mouse model of bacterial entry into Peyer patch tissues and then used the model to compare the efficacy of Sal4 as dimeric IgA, secretory IgA and even IgG, in limiting bacterial access to the intestinal mucosa. We also generated and characterized a second O5-specific IgA mAb and compared it to Sal4 IgA in vitro and in vivo.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe mouse experiments described in this study were reviewed and approved by the Wadsworth Center\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol #17\u2013428. The Wadsworth Center complies with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and was issued assurance number A3183-01. The Wadsworth Center is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Obtaining this voluntary accreditation status reflects that Wadsworth Center\u2019s Animal Care and Use Program meets all standards required by law and goes beyond the standards as it strives to achieve excellence in animal care and use. Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation, as recommended by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health.\n\n\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) strains used in this study are described in Table 1. STm ATCC 14028 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) [17]. S. Typhimurium strains AR04 (zjg8101::kan oafA126::Tn10d-Tc fkpA-lacZ) and AR05 (zjg8101::kan) are derivatives of ATCC 14028, as described [16, 18]. Unless otherwise stated, single colonies were used to inoculate sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with aeration, then subcultured in fresh LB to mid-log phase (OD600 0.40) before use.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and hybridomas\nAntibodies used in this study are listed in Table 2. The B cell hybridoma cell lines secreting the monoclonal polymeric IgA antibody, Sal4, specific for O5-antigen and 2D6 IgA, specific for V. cholerae Ogawa LPS, were originally obtained from Dr. Marian Neutra (Children\u2019s Hospital Boston) [13]. Purified dimeric Sal4 IgA (dIgA) and recombinant human secretory component (rSC) were associated for 1 h at room temperature to generate Sal4 SIgA, as described [20]. Chimeric Sal4 IgG1 and PB10 IgG1, specific for ricin toxin, were provided by Mapp Biopharmaceutical (San Diego, CA). 2D6 IgA and PB10 IgG1 mAbs were used as IgA and IgG1 isotype controls respectively throughout the study. The PeA3 murine B cell hybridoma secreting a monoclonal IgA against the STm O5 antigen was generated from the Peyer\u2019s patches of BALB/c mice repeatedly immunized orally with STm, essentially as described [13]. The resulting hybridomas were screened by ELISA for reactivity with STm whole cells and purified LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\n\nMice\nFemale BALB/c mice aged 8\u201312 weeks were obtained from Taconic Biosciences (Rensselaer, NY) and cared for by the Wadsworth Center Animal Core Facility. All experiments were performed in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Wadsworth Center\u2019s IACUC, as noted above.\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)\nFor direct ELISAs, 96-well NUNC MaxiSorp plates (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) were coated with 0.1 ml of STm LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml in sterile PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Wells were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and 2% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature before washing with PBST. Plates were developed using goat anti-mouse and goat anti-human HRP-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies (final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml) and SureBlue TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). For the whole-bacteria ELISA, 96-well NUNC MaxiSorp plates were coated with poly-L-lysine (10 \u03bcg/ml) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Overnight cultures of STm were washed twice with PBS and then placed into each well of the microtiter plate. The plates were centrifuged two times at 500 x g for 3 min (rotating 180\u00b0 for the second spin), and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The bacteria-coated plate was then treated with sterile glycine (0.1 M) to quench residual PFA and ELISAs were performed as described above. All plates were read by spectrophotometry (A450) within 30 minutes of developing using a VersaMax microplate reader and SoftMaxPro 5.2 software.\n\n\nSoft agar motility assays\nFor the soft agar motility assays, LB medium with 0.3% Bacto agar (Becton Dickinson) was prepared with 15 \u03bcg/ml of each mAb of interest poured into 60 mm Petri dishes (n = 3 per treatment group) and allowed to set at room temperature for 30 min. Individual colonies of ATCC 14028 STm were then picked from a freshly-streaked LB agar plate and stabbed directly into the center of the plate [21]. The plates were placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator and the diameters of the concentrically growing bacterial cultures were measured at 60-minute intervals.\n\n\nBacterial agglutination assays\nAn aliquot of overnight liquid cultures of STm (100 \u03bcl) were mixed in equal ratio (v/v) with PBS containing a final concentration of 15 \u03bcg/ml of each IgA mAb of interest (n = 6 per treatment), and then placed into individual wells of a U-bottom 96 well plate. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C and visually monitored every 15 minutes for clumping of cells, as described [16].\n\n\nHeLa cell invasion assay\nHeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at 5 x 105 cells/mL in 96-well plates and grown for 24 to 36 h to establish 70\u201390% confluency. Prior to STm infection assays, HeLa cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM. Overnight cultures of AR05 and AR04 were subcultured in LB at 37\u00b0C with aeration and adjusted to an OD600 of ~0.7. Strains were mixed 1:1 and washed twice by centrifugation (6,000 x g for 2 minutes) and resuspended in PBS. Bacteria were then diluted 1:10 in Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Wadsworth Center Media Core) and an aliquot was plated on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) and X-gal (40 \u03bcg/mL) to compute bacterial input. For the invasion assay, bacterial mixtures were incubated with 15 ug/mL of either 2D6 IgA, PeA3 IgA, or Sal4 IgA mAb for 15 min at 37\u00b0C to minimize agglutination. Treated bacteria were applied to HeLa cell monolayers and centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min (rotating the plate 180\u00b0 at 5 min) to promote STm adherence to HeLa cell surfaces. The microtiter plates were then incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed three times with HBSS and treated with gentamicin (40 \u03bcg/mL) to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Finally, cells were washed with HBSS lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free PBS), serially diluted, plated on LB agar containing kanamycin (50\u03bcg/mL) and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside) (40\u03bcg/mL) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The competitive index [(%strain A recovered/%strain B recovered)/(%strain A inoculated/%strain B inoculated)] was calculated for each treatment group.\n\n\nSTm intragastric challenge\nOvernight cultures of AR05 and AR04 were subcultured to an OD600 of 0.7, combined 1:1 (v/v) and resuspended in PBS. An aliquot was plated on LB agar containing kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) and X-gal (40 \u03bcg/mL) at the start of the experiment to determine bacterial input (CFUs). Before gavage, bacteria (~4 x 107 CFUs) were either incubated for 10 minutes with mAbs (30 \u03bcg/mL, unless stated otherwise), or mAbs were provided as a \u201cchase\u201d immediately before STm gavage (50 \u03bcg/mouse, unless stated otherwise). Twenty-four hours later, the mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. For each mouse, laparotomy was performed, and the small intestine was removed above the cecum. Peyer\u2019s patches from each mouse were pooled and placed in 1 mL sterile PBS on ice. Samples were then homogenized with a Bead Mill 4 Homogenizer (Fisher Scientific) three times for 30 seconds each. Homogenates were serially diluted, plated on LB agar containing kanamycin and X-Gal and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Blue and white colonies were enumerated and the competitive indices (CI) were calculated as CI = [(% strain A recovered/% strain B recovered)/(% strain A inoculated/% strain B inoculated)]. Whole-plate dilutions (100 \u03bcl per plate) were required to observe enough colonies to calculate competitive indices. All samples that contained less than 30 CFUs (per 100 \u03bcl) were eliminated from the data set and considered \u201ctoo few to count\u201d (TFC). This pool of cells is more likely a representation of only a few bacteria that have successfully invaded and replicated within the lymphoid tissues, as Peyer\u2019s patch entry by Salmonella has been shown the bottleneck for further dissemination during infection [15].\n\n\nMouse model of STm systemic challenge\nBALB/c female mice were administered 40 \u03bcg or 10 \u03bcg (unless otherwise indicated) of Sal4 IgA, Sal4 IgG1, or isotype control antibody in sterile PBS by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. An overnight culture of wildtype STm (ATCC 14028) was subcultured, washed in sterile PBS, and diluted to a final concentration of 5 x 104 CFUs/mL. Twenty-four hours after passive immunization, mice were challenged with STm inoculum (1 x 104 CFUs) by i.p. injection. An additional 24 h later, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation and spleens and livers were collected, weighed, and homogenized in 1 mL sterile PBS, as described above. Homogenates were serially diluted, plated on LB agar and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Total CFUs were counted and computed for Log10 CFUs/gram (tissue).\n\n\nIn vitro digestion assay\nSal4 IgA or Sal4 IgG mAbs were diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in simplified adult simulated gastric fluid (94 mM NaCl, 13 mM KCl; pH adjusted to 3.0 with 1M HCl) with or without pepsin (2000U/mL) on ice similarly as described [22\u201324]. Samples were incubated statically at 37\u00b0C and aliquots were taken after 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes of incubation and neutralized on ice to a pH of 7.0 to 7.4 using 1M NaOH. Following neutralization, all samples were analyzed for binding of purified STm LPS by ELISA as previously described. Concentrations of Sal4 IgA and Sal4 IgG were quantified by establishing a standard curve using SoftMax Pro 5.2.",
    "Results": "Oral administration of Sal4 IgA prevents infection of STm in mice\nTo explore the benefit of passively administered Sal4 IgA on reducing the invasion of Peyer\u2019s patch tissues by STm, we developed a competitive infection assay using two STm strains, AR05 and AR04 [18]. AR05 is a kanamycin resistant derivative of the type strain ATCC 14028 (Table 1) that expresses the O5 antigen (O5-Ag). AR04 is a derivative of AR05 with a Tn10 insertion in the acetyl transferase gene (oafA126::Tn10d-Tc) that abolishes the bacterium\u2019s ability to express the O5 Ag. Therefore, Sal4 IgA reacts with AR05 but not AR04 (S1 Fig) [14, 16]. In addition, AR04 constitutively expresses \u03b2-galactosidase. Thus, AR05 (\u201cwhite\u201d) is readily distinguished from AR04 (\u201cblue\u201d) on when colonies grown on LB/X-Gal agar (S2 Fig). The competitive index (CI) is simply the ratio of AR05 to AR04 in the inoculum compared to the ratio of AR05 to AR04 recovered from Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, that allows for normalization in variations of challenge inoculum and Peyer\u2019s patch number between mice (see Materials and Methods).\nAdult BALB/c mice were challenged by gavage with a 1-to-1 mixture of AR05 and AR04 and 24 h later Peyer\u2019s patches were collected along the entire length of the small intestine. It should be noted that at this time point, there was no gross evidence of inflammation or secretory diarrhea. Peyer\u2019s patch tissues were normal in size and number and there was no evidence of fluid accumulation in the intestinal lumen. These observations are consistent with what has been reported in the literature [25\u201327].\nThe Peyer\u2019s patch tissues were pooled and homogenized and the resulting homogenates were serially diluted onto LB agar containing kanamycin and X-Gal. Preliminary studies determined that an inoculum of 4 x 107 total CFUs (1:1 AR05 and AR04), which is roughly equivalent to 20 x LD50 [13], resulted in the reproducible recovery of 102\u2212104 CFUs from each mouse. The experiments also revealed AR05 was slightly more invasive than AR04, as evidenced by a CI of ~1.2 to 1.5. This minor difference in invasiveness between the two strains was only observable after computing the CI, as the total number of AR04 and AR05 CFUs in the Peyer\u2019s patches were not significantly differ from each other (Fig 1). Furthermore, STm invasion of both AR05 and AR04 strains was confined to Peyer\u2019s patch tissues. In a representative study, we found that there were 208 CFUs/mm of Peyer\u2019s patch tissue, as compared to 0.1 CFUs/mm of proximal small intestine and 0.17 CFUs/mm distal small intestine. This ~2000 fold enrichment of STm in Peyer\u2019s patch tissues is consistent bacterial uptake occurring primarily via M cells and agrees with what has been reported in the literature dating back almost 40 years [25, 28, 29].\nAdult BALB/c mice were challenged by gavage with a one-to-one mixture of STm O5 and O4 strains STm (4 x 107 CFU total) co-administered with Sal4 IgA or an isotype control. Peyer\u2019s patches were collected ~24 h later and assessed for bacterial loads. (A) Competitive indices and (B) total CFUs of AR05 and AR04 STm. Shown are the combined results of five independent experiments with at least 4 mice per group. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Statistical significance evaluated for each concentration over the isotype control, as determined by Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn\u2019s post-hoc test. \nWe next examined the impact of Sal4 IgA on the ability of STm to invade Peyer\u2019s patch tissues. Pre-treatment of the STm inoculum with Sal4 IgA resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the number of AR05 recovered in Peyer\u2019s patch tissues (Fig 1). The highest dose of Sal4 IgA tested (12 \u03bcg) resulted in >4 log10 reduction in AR05 invasion efficiency, as compared to controls. In contrast, the number of AR04 CFUs recovered from the same Peyer\u2019s patch tissues was unaffected by Sal4 IgA treatment. The relative impact of Sal4 IgA on AR05 versus AR04 on Peyer\u2019s patch invasion was most apparent when the recovery values were expressed as a CI (Fig 1). By this metric, the addition of as little as 0.4 \u03bcg of Sal4 IgA rendered AR05 at a competitive disadvantage (Fig 1). The addition of greater amounts of Sal4 further reduced the CI with a maximal reduction occurring at concentrations above 1.2 \u03bcg Sal4 IgA. Invasion of Peyer\u2019s patch tissues by AR05 and AR04 was unaffected by 2D6, an anti-Vibrio cholerae IgA mAb that served as the isotype control for these studies [13, 21].\n\n\nInhibition of STm invasion of epithelial cells in vitro and Peyer\u2019s patch tissues in vivo by a second O5-specific IgA\nA number of important biological activities have been ascribed to Sal4 IgA that likely contribute to its ability to limit bacterial uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues [12\u201314, 16, 18, 30]. Most notability is Sal4 IgA\u2019s ability to arrest bacterial motility in liquid and semi-solid agar [16]. In addition, Sal4 IgA blocks Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system (T3SS)-mediated entry of STm into epithelial cells and limits the translocation of T3SS effector proteins SlrP and SopB [18]. However, because Sal4 IgA is the only O5-specific IgA mAb that has been characterized in detail, it is not known these activites are unique to Sal4 shared by other O5-specific IgA antibodies. For that reason, we sought to generate additional O5-specific mouse IgA mAbs and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. To this end, groups of BALB/c mice were immunized with an attenuated STm mutant [13]. B cell hybridomas were generated from Peyer\u2019s patch lymphocytes from immunized mice and screened by ELISA for IgA reactivity with STm strain 14028. Despite numerous attempts, only a single stable B cell hybridoma secreting an O5-specific IgA mAb was identified, which we designated PeA3. PeA3 IgA bound STm LPS by ELISA (S3 Fig). In liquid culture, PeA3 promoted agglutination of AR05, but not AR04, thereby demonstrating its specificity for the O5 epitope (S3 Fig). Finally, PeA3 IgA significantly impeded STm flagella-based motility through soft agar (S3 Fig).\nTo test whether PeA3 IgA impedes STm T3SS-mediated invasion into epithelial cells, a 1:1 mixture of AR05 and AR04 was treated with PeA3 IgA, Sal4 IgA, or an isotype control (2D6) before being applied to HeLa cells with gentle centrifugation to bypass the need for motility [16]. At the doses of mAb tested, PeA3 IgA treatment resulted in a significant reduction in AR05 uptake into HeLa cells (Fig 2).\n(A) A 1:1 mixture of AR04 and AR05 STm strains was treated with Sal4 IgA, PeA3 IgA, or isotype control antibody and applied to HeLa cells. Monolayers were then treated with gentamicin to eliminate extracellular bacteria and HeLa cells were lysed. The remaining cell lysate was enumerated for CFUs (n = 3 experiments, each done in triplicate). Panels B, C: Adult BALB/c mice were challenged by gavage with a 1:1 mixture of STm AR04 and AR05 O5 (4 x 107 CFU total) in the present of 30 \u03bcg/mL (B) or 10 \u03bcg/mL (C) of indicated mAb. The mice were euthanized 24 h later and Peyer\u2019s patches were assessed for bacterial loads. Shown are the combined results of two independent experiments with at least 4 mice per group. Statistical significance evaluated for each concentration over the isotype control, as determined by one-way ANOVA with either Dunnett\u2019s (A, B) or Tukey\u2019s (C) post-hoc tests.\nTo assess the ability of PeA3 IgA to block STm entry into mouse Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, groups of BALB/c mice were challenged with a 1:1 mixture of AR05 and AR04 supplemented with a high (12 \u03bcg) or low (4 \u03bcg) dose of PeA3 IgA. As a control, Sal4 IgA was included in the experiments at the same doses as PeA3. At the high dose, PeA3 and Sal4 IgA were equally effective at blocking bacterial uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, as evidenced by similar competitive indices (Fig 2). At the low dose, however, Sal4 IgA was ~five-fold more efficient than PeA3, as evidenced by mean CI values of 0.16 (\u00b1 0.30) versus 0.64 (\u00b1 0.20), respectively (Fig 2). The differences in mAb activities in vivo likely reflect different relative avidities of Sal4 and PeA3 for STm LPS. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that another O5-specific IgA mAb, besides Sal4, is able to inhibit STm invasion of epithelial cells in vitro and Peyer\u2019s patch tissues in vivo.\n\n\nPre-exposure prophylactic activity of Sal4 IgA\nGiven that human breast milk provides passive immunity to newborns primarily in the form of specific polyclonal SIgA [31], there is interest in replicating this phenomenon utilizing mAbs for protection against enteric pathogens. In vivo, antigen-specific oral IgA has already been shown to protect against rotavirus challenge in a suckling mouse model [32] and oral feedings of recombinant VHH-IgAs, specific for the F4 fimbriae of ETEC, to piglets prior to bacterial challenge significantly reduced disease progression compared to control-fed groups [33]. After establishing Sal4 as a superior anti-O5 mAb, we sought to investigate its potential prophylactically in a model of STm infection.\nWe first addressed the degree to which Sal4 IgA administered to mice in advance of ST challenge retained its capacity to limit AR05 uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues. Sal4 IgA was delivered by gavage to mice 20 min prior to challenge with 1:1 mixture of AR05 and AR04. Under these conditions, Sal4 IgA\u2019s activity was effectively lost. For example, Sal4 IgA (36 \u03bcg) given to mice by gavage 20 min before STm challenge afforded no protection against Peyer\u2019s patch uptake (S4 Fig). In an effort to overcome the possible deleterious effects of gastric pH and intestinal proteases like pepsin, the experiments were repeated with the addition of sodium bicarbonate (3% NaHCO3) or protease inhibitors. The co-administration of Sal4 IgA with either sodium bicarbonate or protease inhibitors resulted in a 40\u201350% reduction in AR05 uptake into the Peyer\u2019s patches (Fig 3), consistent with pH and proteases as being factors influencing the half life of Sal4 IgA in the gastric and intestinal lumen. While beyond the scope of the current study, these results underscore the necessity of identifying formulations capable of protecting orally administered antibodies like Sal4 IgA from the gastric environment.\nAdult BALB/c mice were gavaged with Sal4 IgA (50 \u03bcg) in (A) 3% NaHCO3 or (B) a protease inhibitor cocktail 20 min or 1 min before STm challenge. The mice were euthanized 24 h later and Peyer\u2019s patches were assessed for bacterial loads, as a readout of bacterial invasion. Shown are the results of three independent experiments with at least 5 mice per group. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Statistical significance compared to the isotype control at each time point, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n\nBenefit of SC on Sal4 IgA function in the mouse model\nSC imparts a number of biologically important activities upon SIgA in the context of the intestinal lumen, including protease resistance and mucus affinity [11, 34]. We therefore expected that Sal4 SIgA would be significantly more effective in vivo than equivalent amounts of dimeric Sal4 IgA lacking SC. To test this hypothesis, purified, dimeric Sal4 (dIgA) and dIgA complexed with human recombinant SC (SIgA) were compared side-by-side in the mouse model of invasive STm. Analysis of bacterial burdens in intestinal tissues collected 24 h after challenge revealed that Sal4 dIgA and SIgA were equally effective at limiting uptake of AR05 into Peyer\u2019s patches (Fig 4A), indicating that the addition of SC did not enhance the function of Sal4 dIgA in this model.\nAdult BALB/c mice were challenged by gavage with a one-to-one mixture of STm O5 and O4 strains (4 x 107 CFU total). Dimeric IgA (dIgA) or secretory IgA (SIgA) forms of Sal4 were (A) premixed with the bacterial inoculum or (B) administered ~1 min prior to STm challenge. The mice were euthanized 24 h later and Peyer\u2019s patches were assessed for bacterial loads. Shown are the results of two independent experiments with 4 mice per group. Statistical significance evaluated for each concentration over the isotype control, as determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test.\nWe postulated that the advantage of SC may only be apparent when antibody interacts with the intestinal environment in advance of bacterial challenge. We therefore repeated the experiments in which Sal4 dIgA and SIgA were given to mice by gavage immediately before STm challenge. Once again, however, Sal4 SIgA was no more effective than Sal4 dIgA at reducing invasion of AR05 into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues. We conclude that, at least in this model of passive oral immunization, the potency of Sal4 IgA is not enhanced by the addition of SC (Fig 4B).\n\n\nPotential of orally administered Sal4 IgG to passively immunize mice\nIn clinical trials, ingestion of bovine milk- or colostrum-derived immunoglobulins consisting mainly of IgG from immunized dairy cows is sufficient to significantly reduce ETEC infection in adult volunteers [7, 35], indicating a role for IgG in passive oral immunizations. In fact, in a recent report, orally delivered anti-colonization factor antigen CFA/I IgG and SIgA human mAbs were equally effective at blocking ETEC infection in a mouse model [9].\nTo investigate the potential of orally administered IgG to prevent STm invasion of Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, we engineered a Sal4 IgG chimeric antibody in which the VH and VL domains of the Sal4 IgA were grafted onto a human IgG1 framework (S5 Fig). The resulting Sal4 IgG1 was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana using so-called RAMP technology [21]. The chimeric IgG1 mAb reacted with STm LPS by ELISA (S5 Fig) and promoted agglutination of STm in liquid culture. In a soft agar motility assay, Sal4 IgG limited bacterial spread over the course of the 6 h experiment, although slightly less effectively than Sal4 IgA. In the HeLa cell invasion assay, Sal4 IgG and Sal4 IgA were more or less equivalent in their abilities to block AR05 uptake (Fig 5). We therefore conclude that the Sal4 IgG1 molecule has expected the biological activities associated with Sal4 IgA, at least in vitro.\n(A) Effect of Sal4 IgG on STm motility in soft agar. STm was stab-inoculated into 0.3% LB agar containing 15 \u03bcg/mL of IgA control, Sal4 IgA, IgG control, or Sal4 IgG antibody. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and the diameter of bacterial swimming was measured every hour for 6 h (n = 3 experiments each done in triplicate). (B) A one-to-one mixture of AR05 and AR04 STm (107 CFUs total) were incubated for 10 min with 15 \u03bcg/mL of IgA control, Sal4 IgA, IgG control, or Sal4 IgG antibody before being applied to HeLa cell monolayers (MOI ~10), as described in the Materials and Methods. After 1 h, the HeLa cells were lysed and the CFUs were enumerated. Asterisks indicate significant reduction in wildtype STm motility (A) or invasion (B) over the respective isotype control, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (n = 2 experiments done in triplicate; P < 0.05).\nWe next investigated the potential of chimeric Sal4 IgG1 to passively immunize mice against STm infection in both systemic and oral challenge models. For the systemic challenge model, groups of BALB/c mice were administered Sal4 IgG1 or a chimeric IgG1 isotype control (PB10) by intraperitoneal injection and then challenged 24 h later with 104 CFUs of wild type STm ATCC14028 by the same route. One day later, the mice were euthanized and CFUs in the spleens and livers were evaluated. As compared to the IgG1 control group, mice that received the high dose Sal4 IgG1 (40 \u03bcg) had 10 to 100-fold lower STm burden in the spleens and livers (S6 Fig). Bacterial numbers were also reduced in mice that received a low dose (10 \u03bcg) of Sal4 IgG1, although to a lesser extent than the high dose group of animals. These results demonstrate that passively administered Sal4 IgG1 results in dose-dependent reduction in STm systemic infection.\nTo examine Sal4 IgG1\u2019s activity in the context of intestinal immunity to STm, groups of BALB/c mice were gavaged with a 1:1 mixture of AR05 and AR04 supplemented with 30 \u03bcg/mL Sal4 IgA or IgG1 or the relevant isotype controls. Invasion of Peyer\u2019s patch tissues was measured 24 h later. As observed previously, Sal4 IgA reduced AR05 invasion into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues by several orders of magnitude (CI value of 0.04 \u00b1 0.02) (Fig 6). In contrast, Sal4 IgG1 had no effect on STm invasion, as evidenced by a CI value of 0.95 \u00b1 0.13 (Fig 6). The failure of Sal4 IgG1 to function in these studies could not be overcome by increasing antibody dose (e.g., >750 \u03bcg) or repeated administration over a 12 h period (S7 Fig) or by high dose parenteral administration (S8 Fig).\nBALB/c females were orally challenged with a competitive index of wildtype (AR05) and oafA mutant (AR04) STm (4 x 107 CFUs) either (A) pre-incubated with 30 \u03bcg/mL of antibody in PBS or (B) administered antibody prior to STm challenge at the indicated time points with sodium bicarbonate and protease inhibitors. 24 hours (p.i.) mice were euthanized and Peyer\u2019s patches were harvested and enumerated for CFUs and competitive indices. Statistical significance evaluated for each group over the isotype control, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (n = at least 5 mice per group).\nWe postulated that antibody stability in the gastric environment might account (at least in part) for the failure of Sal4 IgG1 to function in the oral passive immunization model [11, 24].To address this experimentally, Sal4 IgA and IgG1 variants were incubated in an adult simplified Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF), without and with pepsin, essentially as described [22, 23]. After 10, 30, and 60 min at 37\u00b0C, aliquots were removed and tested reactivity with STm LPS by ELISA. In the presence of SGF, Sal4 IgG1 levels declined steadily over a 30 min time period, whereas the IgA1 variant was relatively stable (S1 Table). Upon the addition of pepsin, however, IgG1 declined so precipitously that it was undetectable at 10 min. At the same time point (10 min), Sal4 IgA had declined to just ~5% of starting levels, but then remained detectable until 30 min. Collectively, these results confirmed the differential sensitivity of Sal4 IgG1 and IgA to the gastric environment.\nThe in vitro stability studies with Sal4 IgG prompted us to repeat the passive immunization studies with the addition of sodium bicarbonate plus protease inhibitors. Specifically, Sal4 IgG1 in sodium bicarbonate (3% NaHCO3) plus protease inhibitors administered to mice by gavage 1 min or 20 min prior STm challenge. Under these conditions, Sal4 IgG1 did in fact block STm invasion into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, but only when given immediately before STm challenge (Fig 6). Collectively, these results suggest that ineffectiveness of Sal4 IgG1, as compared to Sal4 IgA, is due to its instability in the gut environment.",
    "Discussion": "In this study, we investigated the potential of orally administered mAbs to passively immunize mice against invasive Salmonella. The study was motivated by several factors. First is the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistance Salmonella infections, which constitute an increasing threat to public health in developing and developed countries [36, 37]. Second, given the difficulty and extended timeline associated with vaccine development, there is pressure from federal and private foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore alternative strategies as a means of protecting at risk individuals from debilitating enteric infections. With the remarkable advances in recombinant mAb engineering and scale-up using mammalian cells, transgenic animals, plants and even seed-based production platforms, the prospect of combatting diarrheal diseases through orally administered mAb cocktails is technically feasible and cost-effective [33, 38, 39].\nWe found that direct administration of Sal4 IgA to adult mice by gavage overcomes many of the impediments associated with the so-called \u201cbackpack\u201d tumor model that was used previously to study STm-IgA interactions [29]. In the backpack model, antibody-secreting B cell hybridomas are implanted subcutaneously into mice, resulting in local tumor formation and the accumulation of antibodies at very high concentrations in serum and interstitial fluids, including the lamina propria [13]. Ultimately, hybridoma-derived, antigen-specific IgA is detected in intestinal secretions, presumably as a result of pIgR-mediated transcytosis [40, 41]. While this set-up resulted in physiologic delivery of Sal4 IgA into the intestinal lumen, the are several drawbacks with the model. First, depending on how well the hybridoma \u201ctakes,\u201d the amount of Sal4 IgA in serum and intestinal secretions varies widely from mouse to mouse, thereby confounding the ability to perform strict dose-response studies. Second, because hybridoma-derived antibodies accumulate at potentially very high levels in serum (1\u201310 mg/ml) and interstitial fluids, it is not always possible to delineate whether observed protection is due to intestinal (secretory) or interstitial antibodies [40]. Finally, while it is assumed Sal4 IgA antibodies detected in the intestinal secretions in the backpack tumor mice are complexed with SC, the actual amount of Sal4 SIgA in the lumen has never been determined. Direct administration of Sal4 IgA of known molecular forms and at specific doses overcomes these concerns.\nThe other notable benefit of the challenge model employed here is that the primary readout is bacterial load (CFUs) in Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, which are known to be the primary point of entry for invasive Salmonella [42, 43]. Uptake into Peyer\u2019s patches occurs through M cells and is dependent on the SPI-1 T3SS. Moreover, Peyer\u2019s patch invasion occurs in the presence of a normal gut microbiota. This is in contrast to models of Salmonella-induced inflammation where infection occurs primarily in the cecum and colon and involves pre-treatment of mice with antibiotics like streptomycin to deplete the gut microbiota [44, 45]. For the purposes of this study, the challenge model granted us the ability to ask vital questions about IgA biology, such as the importance of SC in intestinal immunity.\nIndeed, contrary to what we expected, the addition of SC did not augment Sal4 IgA activity in our mouse model of invasive STm. One possible explanation for this finding relates to the route of antibody delivery. Normally, dIgA is transported across the intestinal epithelium by the pIgR, which is preferentially expressed by enterocytes in intestinal crypts. Following transport, SIgA localizes to the mucus layer overlying the epithelial barrier where SC plays a central role in anchoring IgA within this microenvironment and protecting the antibody from protease-mediated degradation [20, 46, 47]. It is unclear if the physiologic distribution of SIgA is recapitulated when antibody is administered by gavage. Our attempts to track Sal4 SIgA, using immunohistochemistry, in the small intestine following oral delivery have not been successful to date. Another possible explanation for why SC did not impart a benefit to Sal4 IgA is that the rate-limiting determinant for antibody activity in this model is dilution effects upon gavage, not protease sensitivity or mucus anchoring, where SC would be expected to play an important role.\nThe comparison between PeA3 and Sal4 IgA mAbs in the mouse model of invasive Salmonella serves as an indirect demonstration of the importance of IgA avidity in protecting against invasive pathogens. By all accounts, Sal4 and PeA3 recognized the same or a very similar epitope, but differed in their relative binding affinities for the O5 antigen by ~10 fold. The difference in binding activity correlated with differences in in vivo efficacy, at least when PeA3 and Sal4 IgA were given to mice at lower doses. At higher doses, Sal4 and PeA3 were equally effective at limiting STm uptake into Peyer\u2019s patch tissues, underscoring that protection of the mucosal surface is due to the interrelationship between IgA avidity and local antibody concentrations. As illustrated by Coth\u00e9sy et al., even polyreactive SIgA is protective if present at sufficiently high concentrations [11]. From the standpoint of passive immunization, however, higher affinity/avidity antibodies are clearly advantageous since much lower doses would be required to achieve protection. Indeed, in the case of respiratory infections, the selection for higher affinity mAbs resulted in correspondingly higher neutralizing activities and in vivo potency [48].\nWe found that a recombinant human IgG1 variant of Sal4 had only marginal capacity (when co-administered with protease inhibitors and sodium bicarbonate) to passively immunize mice against intragastric Salmonella infection. These findings are consistent with IgG1 instability in the gastric environment. It is likely that the heavily glycosylated nature of IgA provides an advantage upon direct delivery into the gut in terms of maintaining both direct antigen binding and crosslinking between multiple antigens [46], while the IgG mAb, with a lone pair of N-glycans on the Fc region [49], is outmatched. Other factors may also be at play. Sal4 IgG1, which is a monomer, likely differs from Sal4 IgA, which is a dimer, in its ability to promote bacterial agglutination. We cannot rule out the possibility that the nature of agglutination between IgG and IgA is quantitatively different considering that we did observe slight differences in the kinetics of microagglutination between to two antibody isotypes (S2 Table).\nUltimately, our study highlights some of the fundamental challenges associated with oral mAb delivery as a means to combat enteric diseases, especially in children. Foremost is the remarkably short apparent \u201cstability\u201d of Sal4 IgA and Sal4 SIgA in the gastric and intestinal environments. As noted above, our results suggest that the rapid decline of Sal4 IgA activity when given prophylactically to mice is likely due to a combination of physical degradation by local proteases and acid pH, coupled with rapid clearance/dilution in the intestinal lumen. Even modest declines in the local concentration of Sal4 IgA would be expected to impact antibody potency, considering that the ability of Sal4 IgA to block bacterial entry into Peyer\u2019s patches is the result (at least in part) of bacterial agglutination in the intestinal lumen. For Sal4 or other IgA mAbs to be used clinically in the future will require a more thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetics of IgA and SIgA in mucosal tissues. Coupled with those efforts is a need to identify formulations and delivery strategies to ensure proper delivery and localization of IgA and SIgA in the regions of the gut where they are most needed. In the case of STm, that would be in the proximal small intestine, while for Shigella species the antibodies would need to reach the colon to exert their effects. Nonetheless, in spite of these barriers, specific oral IgG preparations from HBC have seen success therapeutically in clinical trials of children with rotavirus diarrhea [50], prophylactically in rotavirus-infected mice [51] and ETEC challenged humans [52, 53], suggesting the goal of using passive immunization to combat enteric disease is not far from reach."
