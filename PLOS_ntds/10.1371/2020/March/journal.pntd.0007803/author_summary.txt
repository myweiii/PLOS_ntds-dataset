The bacterium Salmonella enterica is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing worlds. While the pathogen is most renowned as the causative agent of typhoid fever, the emergence of invasive non-typhoid strains like S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) are of great concern because of their propensity to cause severe disease in children under the age of five. In this report, we demonstrate in a mouse model that oral administration of a monoclonal antibody targeting the surface of STm is able to prevent the bacterium from infecting gastrointestinal tissues, the first step in the dissemination process. We show that IgA antibodies (which are normally found in the gut) were far superior than an equivalent IgG antibody (normally found in blood) at defending the intestine from STm infection. These results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at the development of an orally administered antibody cocktail capable of providing temporary immunity to pathogens like S. enterica.
