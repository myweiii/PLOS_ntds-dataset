Schistosomiasis is one of about 20 neglected tropical diseases. It affects millions of people mainly in poor settings in African countries. The global strategy to control and eliminate schistosomiasis emphasizes large-scale preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel targeting school-age children. Evidence of the effectiveness of these control measures is largely available, while less is known about the costs of their implementation. We systematically reviewed the literature and analyzed studies that estimated costs of schistosomiasis interventions. We summarized the available evidence in three intervention groups: (i) preventive chemotherapy; (ii) preventive chemotherapy plus an individual diagnostic test to identify at-risk population; and (iii) test-and-treat interventions. Costs were overall hard to compare and varied considerably from one study to another. There is a need for higher reporting standards and transparency that should be fostered by peer-review journal policies. Cost information on these interventions is crucial to inform resource allocation decisions and those regarding the affordability of scaling-up interventions.
