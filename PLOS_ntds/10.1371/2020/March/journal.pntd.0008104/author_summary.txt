Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria-causing parasite species outside of Sub-Saharan Africa and has many unique and poorly understood biological characteristics that make it particularly challenging to study and combat. Transcriptomic profiling of P. vivax under various conditions has the potential to unlock new experimental abilities and aid in elucidating biology and the development of clinical interventions. However, a lack of a robust in vitro culture system for this parasite has restricted transcriptomic studies to researchers with timely access to fresh human isolates from clinics, which often are in resource-poor settings, as well as nearby, well-equipped laboratories for sample processing. This study aimed to gain insight into the differential survival of P. vivax in various culture media from the parasites transcriptional signature in each media. By implementing low-input RNA library preparation strategies, this study obtains robust transcriptomic data at various parasite development stages and in different culture conditions from just 1000 FACS-purified, P. vivax-infected erythrocytes from viable cryopreserved patient isolates. With these data, we find culture media has little effect on transcriptional profile, we characterize invasion ligand expression across intraerythrocytic development and between clinical isolates, and we define the transcriptome of sexual, transmissible stages of the P. vivax parasite. These results highlight the establishment and utility of a powerful platform for studying the transcriptomic biology of this particularly challenging parasite.
