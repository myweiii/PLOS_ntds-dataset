Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease, infecting an estimated one million people yearly. Acute lung injury is a dangerous clinical development in severe cases; however, its pathogenic biomarkers and mechanisms of progression remain unknown. Here, we used a lethal infection mouse model that parallels certain aspects of severe scrub typhus, primary human endothelial cell cultures, and patient sera to define pathogenic biomarkers following Orientia tsutsugamushi infections. We found a significant increase in the levels of endothelial activation/stress markers (angiopoietins and ICAM-1) in infected mouse lungs and patient sera, but a progressive loss of endothelium-specific Tie2 receptor and junction proteins (VE-cadherin), at severe stages of disease. These signs of vasculature disruption positively correlated with the timing and magnitude of recruitment/activation of proinflammatory MΦ subsets in infected lungs. Bacterial growth in vitro was favored in M2-like, but not in M1-like, MΦs. This study, for the first time, reveals endothelial malfunction and dysregulated inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate tissue damage and pathogenesis.
