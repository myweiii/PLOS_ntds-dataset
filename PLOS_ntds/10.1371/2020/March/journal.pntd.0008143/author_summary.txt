Rift Valley fever virus represents an acute viral disease affecting animals especially livestock and humans and is responsible for widespread outbreaks throughout Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. The virus causes abortions and high mortality especially in young animals, whereas the symptoms in humans range from mild flu-like illness to severe hemorrhagic manifestations that can be lethal. So far, no antiviral therapeutics for animals nor humans were available yet. Therefore, we evaluated two monoclonal antibodies—one neutralizing and one non-neutralizing—in a mouse model for therapeutic treatment against Rift Valley fever. We selected these antibodies since they exhibited cooperative effects in vitro. During Rift Valley fever virus infection in mice, the applied neutralizing antibody alone showed only partial protection. In contrast, a combined application with both antibodies, lead to a complete protection in one treatment group (100% survival). A detailed pathological and molecular analysis clearly indicated a strong reduction of virus replication in target tissues of treated mice. Taken together, these results identified two monoclonal antibodies with strong antiviral effects against Rift Valley fever infection, which are promising candidates for therapeutic interventions against RVFV.
