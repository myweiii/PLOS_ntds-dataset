Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease caused by a Nairovirus of the Nairoviridae family. CCHF-virus (CCHFV) has been considered to be one of the eight priority emergent pathogens for the last 3 years by the World Health Organization (WHO), requiring urgent attention in Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) because of its epidemic potential in the near future In this systematic review, we aimed to describe the epidemiological impact of CCHFV (seroprevalence for IgG antibodies and the associated risk factors) in the WHO European Region (WHO/Europe). In this systematic review suggests the following conclusions. i) The highest values of CCHFV seroprevalence are found in Turkey, the Russian Federation, and Kazakhstan. ii) Greece has a high seroprevalence, though only one death associated with CCHFV has been reported. This fact contrasts with the neighboring countries, such as Balkan countries and Turkey, where the rate of severe infections seems to be higher. iii) Extensive studies should be developed in European countries to establish the actual epidemiological situation and to take additional preventive measures for the future.
