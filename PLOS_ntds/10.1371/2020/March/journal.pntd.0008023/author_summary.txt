Hepatic cystic echinococcosis (HCE) is an endemic and neglected global disease. Many deprived areas in China still lack the knowledge and expertise to successfully treat HCE surgically, which results in high postoperative complication and recurrence rates that further decrease postoperative quality of life. In this study, we aimed to transfer our extensive experience in the development and implementation of effective surgery for HCE to eleven hospitals in the Echinococcus granulosus endemic province of Xinjiang to improve the surgical treatment of HCE. Our results indicate that our training program effectively reduces recurrence and complication rates and will be of use in other endemic areas.
