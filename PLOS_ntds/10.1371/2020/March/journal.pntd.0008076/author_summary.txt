Severe dengue (DHF/DSS) was perceived as one clinical disease entity until the WHO 2009 classification defined three categories: severe vascular leakage, severe bleeding, and severe organ dysfunction. Here we provide new insight about the discriminatory power and the overlap or co-occurrence of the severe dengue categories. We also respond to the need to validate standard clinical endpoints for severe dengue in well-characterized data sets. In addition, we respond to the need for moderate disease endpoints, which are recorded more frequently than the severe ones. Severe vascular leakage alone constitutes the largest group among the severe dengue categories and may be useful as endpoint for intervention or pathophysiology research. Other severe dengue categories as for example severe bleeding can also sometimes occur aloneâ€“however, this might be associated with the presence of comorbidities or individual predisposition and should be studied in more detail. Moderate disease endpoints were suggested and explored here, but need to be further investigated.
