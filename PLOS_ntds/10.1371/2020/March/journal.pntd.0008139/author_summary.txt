Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected disease endemic in the Mediterranean region, caused by Leishmania infantum. Accurate VL diagnosis is critical for rapid and correct patient management. Various serological tests are used, including commercial kits that require qualifications with specific information about their performance. In this study, we compared the performance of six commercial kits, two immunochromatographic tests (ICT; IT LEISH and TruQuick LEISH IgG/IgM Meridian) and four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; NovaLisa Leishmania infantum IgG, Bordier Leishmania infantum, Ridascreen Leishmania IgG, and Vircell Leishmania), available in France and used as screening tests. The Bordier and Vircell ELISA reagents displayed the highest analytic performance compared with all the other kits. However, no test displayed 95% sensitivity at the thresholds recommended by the manufacturers. To reach this sensitivity value with the highest possible specificity, new thresholds are proposed for the Bordier, Vircell and NovaLisa ELISA reagents. Positive and negative results obtained with the six screening tests were confirmed by Western blot (100% sensitivity). Overall, this study presents a comparative analysis of commercially available kits for the serodiagnosis of human VL and provides additional information on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in the Mediterranean basin.
