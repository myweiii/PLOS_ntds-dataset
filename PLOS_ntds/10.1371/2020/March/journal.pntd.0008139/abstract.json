    "Background": "Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. However, large-scale comparative analyses of the commercial kits for the serological diagnosis of this neglected disease are lacking. This study compared the performances of four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and two immunochromatographic tests (ICT) as screening tests for the serodiagnosis of human VL in the Mediterranean region.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Serum samples from 319 patients living in France, Tunisia or Morocco were tested using two ICT (IT LEISH and TruQuick LEISH IgG/IgM Meridian) and four ELISA reagents (NovaLisa Leishmania infantum IgG, Bordier Leishmania infantum, Ridascreen Leishmania IgG, and Vircell Leishmania). The population with proven VL (n = 181) included 65 immunocompromised patients. Significantly higher percentages of false-negative results were obtained with all assays in immunocompromised patients, compared with the immunocompetent population. In the whole population, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 80.7% to 93.9% and from 95.7% to 100%, respectively. The maximum accuracy was observed with the Bordier and Vircell ELISA kits (96.2%), and the lowest accuracy with Ridascreen reagent (88.7%). New thresholds of positivity are proposed for the Bordier, Vircell and NovaLisa ELISA kits to achieve 95% sensitivity with the highest possible specificity. Western blot (WB), used as a confirmation method, showed 100% sensitivity and identified 10.1% of asymptomatic carriers among the control population from the South of France.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This is the first study that compared commercially available kits for VL serodiagnosis in the endemic region of the Mediterranean basin. It provides specific information about the testsâ€™ performance to help clinicians and biologists to select the right assay for VL screening."
