    "Abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Nepal is found in 61 out of 75 districts including areas previously listed as non- endemic. This study focused on the role of housing conditions and its immediate environment in VL transmission, to limit future transmissions, ensure sustainable vector control and support the VL elimination program. The objective was to explore the risk factors in rural housing-and land lot typologies contributing to clinical VL occurrence and transmission. Housing structures and land lots were examined based on characteristics as risk factors of VL transmission in a case-control analysis. VL cases from 2013–2017 were identified based on the existing database from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division and District Public Health Office from the plain Terai area (Morang, and Saptari districts) and hilly area (Palpa district) of Nepal. Two hundred and three built environments were analyzed (66 cases and 137 controls). Inferential statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the association of risk factors with VL. The risk factors with the highest odds of VL were: bamboo walls (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)- 8.1, 95% CI 2.40–27.63, p = 0.001), walls made of leaves/branches (AOR- 3.0, 95% CI 0.84–10.93, p = 0.090), cracks in bedroom walls (AOR- 2.9, 95% CI 0.93–9.19, p = 0.065), and placing sacks near sleeping areas (AOR- 19.2, 95% CI 4.06–90.46, p <0.001). Significant outdoor factors were: lots with Kadam trees (AOR- 12.7, 95% CI 3.28–49.09, p <0.001), open ground-outdoor toilets (AOR- 9.3, 95% CI 2.14–369.85, p = 0.003), moisture in outdoor toilet sheds (AOR- 18.09, 95% CI 7.25–451.01, p = 0.002), nearby- open land (AOR- 36.8, 95% CI 3.14–430.98, p = 0.004), moisture inside animal sheds (AOR- 6.9, 95% CI 1.82–26.66, p = 0.005), and surrounding animals/animals wastes particularly goats (AOR- 3.5, 95% CI 1.09–10.94, p = 0.036). Certain housing and surrounding environmental conditions and characteristics are risk factors for VL. Hence, elimination and educational programs should include the focus on housing improvement and avoidance of risk factors. Longitudinal interventional studies are required to document temporal relationships and whether interventions on these factors will have an impact on Leishmania transmission or burden."
