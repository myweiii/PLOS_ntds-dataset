Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is of utmost importance during pregnancy since it can pass through the placental barrier and infect the embryoâ€™s tissues. Consequences of passing the placental barrier and infecting the fetus is abortion, fetal death or severe congenital defects, such as hydrocephaly and chorioretinitis. Although extensive studies have been conducted on the seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in women and its role in abortion, the diversity of studies design, sample size, and the various quality of studies pose daunting challenges to the available information. Therefore, it is essential that this information be updated and synthesized to help physicians and healthcare providers. The results of the current study revealed the high seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in women who had spontaneous abortion and the positive relationship between seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies and abortion.
