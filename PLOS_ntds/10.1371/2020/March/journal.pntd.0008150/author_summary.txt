Parasitic diseases are a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a significant economic drain in developing countries. Many parasites have limited treatment options with low efficacy and significant side effects, however research into new therapeutics suffers from a lack of investment. In this study, we characterize four potential anti-parasitic drugs: anisomycin, nithiamide, prodigiosin and obatoclax. These drugs were previously shown to effectively inhibit Entamoeba histolytica, the parasite that causes amebic dysentery. Here, we demonstrate that these drugs have activity against a wide variety of parasites from different taxonomic groups. Additionally, we assessed the speed of killing of these compounds against E. histolytica and the brain pathogen Balamuthia mandrillaris, and show that several are faster acting than current drugs. Two of these drugs (prodigiosin and obatoclax) had broad-spectrum activity, including against life stages not treated by current drugs such as juvenile schistosome worms, and three (obatoclax, nithiamide and anisomycin) have been used previously in humans. Although more study will be needed to adapt these drugs to the varying requirements for treatment of each parasitic disease, this work is a promising beginning towards identifying drugs against multiple parasites that are human pathogens.
