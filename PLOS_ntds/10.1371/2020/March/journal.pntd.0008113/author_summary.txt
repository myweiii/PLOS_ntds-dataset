Distinct variants of rabies virus are harbored by several wildlife species across North America. The variant associated with the raccoon host is especially problematic given its rapid spread throughout the eastern seaboard of the United States over the second half of the 20th century and the high population density of this species in urban habitats that raises the potential for disease spread to both companion animals and their owners. Accordingly, extensive efforts to control raccoon rabies have been undertaken at many jurisdictional levels. This study uses current methods of genome analysis to explore the origins of a raccoon rabies outbreak in and around the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, located close to the border with western New York state. In contrast to previous Canadian outbreaks of raccoon rabies, which were due to cross-border spread of the virus, this study demonstrates that the incursion into the Hamilton area was the result of a long-distance animal translocation from south-eastern New York. The implications of this event for strategies to control raccoon rabies are discussed.
