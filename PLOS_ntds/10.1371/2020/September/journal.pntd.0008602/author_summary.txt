Ebola virus (EBOV) utilizes the complement component C1q for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. We found that an ADE antibody increased viral attachment in the presence of C1q and that there was no significant difference in the efficiency of viral uptake into endosomes between the C1q-mediated ADE and non-ADE entry. Accordingly, both ADE and non-ADE infection were similarly decreased by inhibitors of the signaling pathways for endocytosis. These results suggest that C1q-mediated ADE of EBOV infection is simply caused by increased viral attachment to the cell surface, most likely via cross-linking of virus-antibody-C1q complexes to cellular C1q receptors.
