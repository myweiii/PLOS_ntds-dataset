Buruli ulcer is a destructive skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Although the disease is not fatal, the infection can often leave patients with significant cosmetic and functional damage to limbs. Currently, one of the major hurdles facing Buruli ulcer control is our incomplete understanding of the factors leading to the emergence of disease in a particular region. In this report we investigate an anecdotal link between the damming of the Mapé River in Cameroon and the emergence of Buruli ulcer in the Health Districts bordering the impoundment created by the Mapé dam. We compare the genome sequences of M. ulcerans isolates recovered from regional Buruli ulcer patients that were identified in a previous molecular epidemiology study. Additionally, we investigate historic satellite imagery to quantify changes in land cover use that followed damming the river. The appearance of Buruli ulcer in the region was found to follow about ten years after the 1988 damming of the Mapé River, supporting the idea that alterations to landscape hydrology can increase BU incidence. While this temporal association does not infer causation, this research helps define the ecological risk factors linked to the spread of BU.
