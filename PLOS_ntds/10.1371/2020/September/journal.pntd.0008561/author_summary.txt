Combining the incompatible insect technique (IIT) and sterile insect technique (SIT) is considered to be a promising approach to control Aedes albopictus, the world’s most invasive mosquito species which can transmit dengue and zika. The combined IIT-SIT technique depends on the release of overflooding numbers of mass-reared male mosquitoes to sterilize female mosquitoes through mating, resulting in the reduction of the wild mosquito population. In existing SIT programs against agricultural pests, male insects are often immobilized by chilling to pack, transport and release them and thereby increase handling efficacy. Chilling for the immobilization of male mosquitoes may also improve program efficiency in the IIT-SIT against mosquitoes. Thus, it is essential to ascertain the optimal chilling conditions for handling Ae. albopictus male mosquitoes. In this study, we found that Ae. albopictus males could be chilled at 10°C for 3 h without negative impacts on the biological qualities such as survival, longevity and mating competitiveness. Our results show that male mosquitoes could preserve a high level of quality under optimal chilling conditions, which indicates that immobilization by chilling is an important element for the combined IIT-SIT for mosquito control.
