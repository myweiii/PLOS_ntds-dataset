Chagas disease is caused by the etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi and is mainly transmitted through the excreta of triatomine vectors. It is endemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, affecting ~8 million people. Control programs are based on the elimination of domestic vectors through insecticide-spraying indoors, since there is no vaccine or efficient treatment for chronic patients. However, this strategy is not sustainable where native triatomine species are capable of colonizing peridomestic structures and reinvading human dwellings. Since the ‘virtual’ elimination of Triatoma infestans in Brazil (residual foci remain in Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia), specimens of the native Triatoma rubrovaria have been constantly collected inside human dwellings and peridomiciliary ecotopes in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, which might represent a real risk for human infections. Here we analyzed a unique and large dataset through classical and modern statistical methods to evaluate T. cruzi infection in T. rubrovaria and to identify host-seeking, and also feeding/excretion behavioral traits that could be influenced by the parasite. Our results indicated that the parasite infection caused changes in T. rubrovaria feeding behavior that could increase T. cruzi TcVI transmission. Moreover, this vector species had similar infection rate to one of the main important Chagas disease vectors in South America, T. infestans. Therefore, T. rubrovaria must be kept under constant entomological surveillance in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
