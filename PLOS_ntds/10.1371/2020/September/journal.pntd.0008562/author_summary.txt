The vast majority of symptomatic dengue infections will result in an uncomplicated disease course. A small proportion will develop severe dengue late in the course of disease, on about day 4 or 5 of illness. In the absence of early prognostic markers to triage dengue patients for early supportive intervention, all suspected dengue cases are followed up for daily assessment, which includes an assessment of dehydration. While the clinical assessment of dehydration is subjective, the passing of dark-coloured urine is an accepted indicator of dehydration. However, visual assessment of urine colour is limited by the varied perception of colour and ambient lighting. An objective method to assess urine colour is to encode it in the RGB model. We used a mobile phone to capture an image of urine samples under standardised conditions and computed the RGB value of each image. Our study demonstrated that RGB urine colourimetry using mobile phones is highly correlated with the hydration status of dengue patients, making it a hydration status tool of great potential.
