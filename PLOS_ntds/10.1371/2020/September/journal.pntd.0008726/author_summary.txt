Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that can be incapacitating, leading to heart failure with risk of sudden death. Currently, only one drug treatment is available, Benznidazole, but it demands a long period of treatment, has variable efficacy and leads to serious side effects that can lead to discontinuation of the treatment. An alternative therapy, the anti-fungal drug, Posaconazole, was repurposed for treatment of Chagas disease, but its use has been controversial with conflicting results in studies from different groups. In our approach, we followed the parasitic infection, disease symptoms and persistence of the pathogen in mice for a full year after treatment with Benznidazole or Posaconazole. Posaconazole treatment was more effective in the early infection (acute disease) whereas only Benznidazole had efficacy in the chronic model. This information can have important implications for the design and analysis of human clinical trials, and the use of specific drugs in specific clinical settings.
