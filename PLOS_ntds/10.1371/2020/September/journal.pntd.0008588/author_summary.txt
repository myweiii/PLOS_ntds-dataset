Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei that is transmitted by tsetse flies. In 2012, HAT was included in the World Health Organization roadmap for the control of neglected tropical diseases with the objective of elimination as a public health problem by 2020. In Côte d’Ivoire, HAT prevalence has dropped sharply the last decade. A passive HAT surveillance was therefore integrated in the national health system, which allowed to detect a first patient in 2017. This article describes the complex health seeking pathway and suffering before diagnosis of this patient, an 11 years old girl, and illustrates the challenge when health agents and population no longer consider HAT as a threat in an elimination context. Our results show the need to install a solid surveillance system, in combination with continued sensitization and repeated health staff training.
