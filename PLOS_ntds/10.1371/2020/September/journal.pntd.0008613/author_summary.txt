Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) has been implicated as a common cause of diarrhea in multiple settings and associated with linear growth faltering among children in low-income countries. Unlike other E. coli pathotypes EAEC stands alone in employing a phenotypic, rather than genotypic, definition. Therefore, the lack of a formally recognized genetic definition for EAEC serves to complicate its epidemiologic investigation. In an effort to improve the definition of this pathotype, we generated the most definitive characterization of the pan-genome of EAEC by performing whole genome sequencing on a collection of strains isolated from different geographic settings. We identified a genetic signature of EAEC which could comprise of E. coli strains harboring the EAEC transcriptional activator and its adhesin dependent factors. Further, we found that EAEC strains harbor additional putative virulence genes previously reported in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and, therefore, strains meeting the re-definition could be both enteric bacteria and urinary/systemic pathogens.
