The Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite is a major public health burden in many parts of the Asia-Pacific and Americas. Primaquine-based radical cure is the only available treatment that effectively removes P. vivax from the human host but can cause severe side effects in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The WHO recommends testing for G6PD deficiency to guide treatment, but this is not done on a routine basis in many countries. The aim of this study was to determine the importance of routine testing in multi-ethnic populations. The study was conducted in a multi-ethnic population in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Bangladesh), which carries the highest burden of malaria within the country. We enrolled 1002 participants from 11 major ethnicities within the area and assessed the prevalence of G6PD deficiency by phenotype and genotype. Based on phenotype 9.0% of the population were not eligible for standard primaquine based radical cure, however numbers varied significantly between ethnicities, ranging from 2% to 26%. In 93% of cases where a genotype was identified, the severe Mahidol G6PD variant was found. Our findings highlight the importance of routine G6PD testing prior to primaquine based radical cure in multi-ethnic populations.
