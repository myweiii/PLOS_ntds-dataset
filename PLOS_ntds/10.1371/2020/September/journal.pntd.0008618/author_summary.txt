Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the genus Schistosoma and affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Previously, we and other groups found that Schistosoma japonicum can secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are taken up by mammalian cells. Here, we characterized EVs isolated from adult male and female S. japonicum and found that some proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) were significantly enriched in male or female EVs. More importantly, the inhibition of miR-750, which is specifically enriched in female EVs, resulted in decreased egg production. Overall, our study suggests that female EV miRNA cargo may play important roles in regulating female ovary development and egg production during male-female pairing in S. japonicum.
