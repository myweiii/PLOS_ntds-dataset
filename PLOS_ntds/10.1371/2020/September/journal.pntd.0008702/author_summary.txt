To show a complete picture of disability, combining different disability assessment tools is recommended. For the first time in Ethiopia, we described the degree of activity and social participation limitation of adults with leprosy attending one of the leprosy centers. We used internationally validated measurement tools, the Screening Activity Limitation Safety Awareness score (SALSA score) for activity limitation and the participation scale (P-scale) for assessment of social participation. Twenty years after elimination of leprosy as a public health problem, leprosy patients continue to suffer from different forms of disabilities. Most patients suffered from activity limitation and social participation restriction. Our finding indicates the unmet need of disability prevention and management. We stress here the importance of public health efforts to diagnose and manage the disease early and to work on rehabilitation of leprosy patients. The old and centralized leprosy rehabilitation services need to be decentralized and backed with modern equipment and trained staffs.
