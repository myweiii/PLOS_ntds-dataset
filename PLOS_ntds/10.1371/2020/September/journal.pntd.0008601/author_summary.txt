The immune response to Sarcoptes scabiei infestation is poorly defined. There have been few studies of crusted scabies, a debilitating clinical variant of the disease characterised by extremely high mite numbers. In this study, we used a pig model to explore differences in gene expression between clinical variants of scabies, including a focus on immune events occurring prior to the development of clinical signs. In early infestation, genes relating to inflammation, immune recognition and cell migration were potently suppressed in pigs with crusted scabies. This suggests that these pigs lacked the ability to mount a timely, effective immune response, allowing mites to proliferate unchecked. In later infestation, the large numbers of mites then triggered a strong inflammatory response leading to severe skin pathology. Gene expression profiles in crusted scabies shared similarities with other inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. This is the first study to compare immune responses in crusted and ordinary scabies in early infestation and reveals new insights into the progression of disease. Findings may lead to the development of new approaches to diagnose and treat this important, but neglected disease.
