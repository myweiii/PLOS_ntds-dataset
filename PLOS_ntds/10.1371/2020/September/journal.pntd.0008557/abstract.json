    "Abstract": "Novel diagnostic tools are a major challenge for brucellosis research, especially in developing countries. Herein, we established a handheld quantum dot (QD) immunochromatographic device for the fast detection of brucellosis antibodies in the field. Total bacterial protein extracted from Brucella 104M served as labelling and coating antigen. QD labelling and immunochromatography methods were used to optimise reaction conditions, labelling conditions, reaction temperature and storage temperature. QD test strips were employed to test brucellosis serum to determine their sensitivity, specificity and stability. Test strips were compared with Rose Bengal test, standard agglutination test and colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay. Labelled Brucella total protein displayed good specificity and no cross-reactivity. The concentration of labelled total bacterial protein was 3.9 mg/ml, the coating concentration was 2.0 mg/ ml, and the serum titre with the lowest detection sensitivity was 1:25. The optimal reaction temperature for the test strip was 25−30°C. The test strip was stable after storage at room temperature and the repeatability was high, with a coefficient of variation of 4.0%. After testing 199 serum samples, the sensitivity of the QD test strip was 98.53%, the specificity was 93.57%, and the coincidence rate with the standard agglutination test was 96.98%. The developed QD immunochromatographic method can be used for rapid detection and preliminary screening of brucellosis in the field."
