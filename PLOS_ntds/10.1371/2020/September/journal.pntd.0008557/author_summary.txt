Brucellosis is a neglected infection that has a widespread geographic distribution. Based on an evaluation from the World Health Organization (WHO), brucellosis cases have been reported in more than 170 countries with about 500,000 new cases being reported each year. However, the actual number of brucellosis patients is much higher, and it is believed to be approximately 10â€“25 times the number of reported cases. This big discrepancy between the reported rate and the actual incidence rate is largely due to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, especially in endemic areas. In recent years, considerable effort has been mobilized toward the development of rapid, reliable field diagnostic assays and molecular diagnostic approaches. In this study, we established a handheld quantum dot (QD) immunochromatographic device for the fast detection of brucellosis antibodies in the field. This QD test strip does not require extensive laboratory infrastructure or technical expertise, and has high sensitivity (98.53%) and specificity (93.57%), as well as a high coincidence rate (96.98%) with SAT. This new tool is expected to provide fast and simple point-of-care testing at county-level clinics and CDC labs.
