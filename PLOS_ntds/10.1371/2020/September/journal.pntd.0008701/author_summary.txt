For a long time, many scientists have made efforts to develop more effective antivenoms or to expand the limits of existing antivenoms. Such endeavors are challenging but worth the effort in the long run. However, to use precious antivenom more effectively, a snake species discrimination tool might be helpful for treatment by ensuring accurate antivenom usage and dosage. In this study, we revealed that avian IgY might be an economical alternative for collocation with the equine F(ab’)2 fragment in the development of a diagnostic device with improved performance. Only a few avian eggs (about 10–15) would be necessary to produce 10,000 kits. Immunochromatographic test (ICT) is a simple, easy, fast, and low-cost point-of-care lateral flow assay device, and especially adapted to perform in resource-deficient areas. Such an antibody collocation strategy might be beneficial to overcome the urgent need for snakebite diagnosis as soon as possible. More cooperative investigations across Asia continent might be initiated in the future to face the challenge of snakebites together.
