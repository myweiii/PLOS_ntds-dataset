In 2017, Aedes albopictus was reported for the first time in Portugal at two distinct locations, in the premises of a tire company in Penafiel, in the North, and nearby a golf course in Algarve, a tourism destination in the southernmost country region. The geographical spread of this species is promoted by egg and larvae transport in aquatic trade goods, as tires and aquatic plants, and adult anthropophilic behavior that favors passive land transportation. In Portugal, especially in the Southern region, temperate climate conditions are adequate for adult mosquitoes to survive most of the year. In a way to understand the genetic variability of Ae. albopictus populations introduced in Portugal, we analyzed 31 cytochrome C oxidase I gene (COI) partial sequences and 17 mitogenome sequences, integrating them in the context of the global Ae. albopictus phylogeographic diversity (i.e., 183 COI and 26 mitogenome sequences previously reported at worldwide level). Although COI haplotype 1 predominated, four additional haplotypes (2 to 5) were detected in Portugal. Subsequent in-depth mitogenome analysis revealed considerable genetic diversity, including not only sequences relating to mitogenomes reported mainly from Italy, Japan and China, but also two novel mitogenome mutational signatures.
Our study indicates that Ae. albopictus is locally established in Portugal and intra-country dispersal may have already happened, highlighting the challenges for vector surveillance and control programs aiming at restraining arbovirus disease burden in the future.
