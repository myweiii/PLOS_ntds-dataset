Parasite-released extracellular vesicles (EVs) deliver signals to the host immune system that are critical to maintaining the long-term relationship between parasite and host. This study isolated total EVs (FhEVs) released in vitro by the adult stages of the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica using a gravity flow method that protects the structural integrity of the vesicles. Proteomic analysis identified 618 proteins, 121 of which contained putative N-linked glycosylation sites while 132 proteins contained putative O-linked glycosylation sites while glycan arrays revealed surface-exposed glycans were predominantly oligo mannose-rich glycoproteins, and glycans with a high affinity for complex-type N-glycans. Since the EV molecular cargo can influence host immune cells, FhEVs were added to bone-marrow derived dendritic cells, inducing a novel cell phenotype that when adoptive transferred into OT-II mice inhibited IL-2 secretion from skin draining lymph nodes and spleen cells. Immunisation of mice with FhEV did not elicit significant immune responses; however, in the presence of alum, FhEVs induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response with high antigen specific antibody titres. This studied sheds like on the biological activity of FhEVs and added to the growing immuno-proteomic database that will be an important source for the discovery of future therapeutics.
