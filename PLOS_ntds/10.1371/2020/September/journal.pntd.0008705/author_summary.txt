Because of global trade of used tyres and ornamental plants, invasive mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are spreading passively between continents. Within continents, adults are frequently travelling along roads as hitchhikers in motorised vehicles and may then colonise new areas. Because some Aedes mosquitoes are competent to transmit diseases they threaten public and veterinary health. In Europe, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus is of particular concern as it is a vector of chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus. While its distribution in southern Europe is well documented, its dispersal modes across the Alps remain poorly investigated, preventing a projection of future scenarios beyond its current range in order to target mosquito control. To monitor the introduction of invasive Aedes mosquitoes beyond the Alps we placed traps at motorway service areas across Switzerland. Between 2013 and 2018 we identified three invasive Aedes species, including Ae. albopictus, Ae. koreicus (Korean bush mosquito) and Ae. japonicus (Japanese bush mosquito). Based on the frequency and distribution patterns we conclude that Ae. albopictus and Ae. koreicus are being passively spread primarily along the European route E35 from Italy to Germany, while Ae. japonicus has been expanding its range across Switzerland mainly through active dispersal.
