This work would have not been possible without the support of many pairs of hands both in the field and the laboratory. For the hard work in collecting and replacing traps, enduring traffic jams, measuring mass spectra or spending endless hours in counting eggs we are extremely grateful to Valentina Alesi, Nikoleta Anicic, Leandro Balzarini, Anna-Paola Caminada, Alissa Cereghetti, Alison Crenna, Luca Davino, Sophie DeRespinis, Begoña Feijoó Fariña, Attila Giezendanner, Riccardo Hefti, Alida Kropf, Elian Kuhn, Diego Parrondo Montón, Natalia Rava, Laura Rieder, Andrea Tavasci and Seraina Vonzun. It was also a pleasure to work with Valentin Pflüger and Roxane Mouchet from Mabritec AG for the MALDI-TOF MS analysis. We would also like to thank Peter Lüthy for his initial encouragement to set-up a national surveillance programme for invasive mosquitoes in Switzerland. Last but not least, a big thank you to Basil Gerber and Thomas Probst from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment for their continuous support and encouragement throughout the project.
