The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently emerged as a global threat. It is important to understanding workersâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a large cross-sectional online survey base on a large labor-intensive factory to determine the status of COVID-19-related KAP during the outbreak among workers in China. We found that Chinese workers had strong awareness of COVID-19 but also had some misconceptions. Moreover, this study indicated that lower levels of knowledge and practices related to COVID-19 among older and less-educated workers. The results suggested that health authorities still need to ensure correct information on COVID-19 prevention and strengthen health interventions, particularly for older and less-educated workers.
