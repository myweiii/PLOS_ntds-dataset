Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic infection transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly vector. Members of the Leishmania tropica complex are one of the main causative agents of CL in the Old World. Despite having varying phenotypical manifestations and degrees of severity, the genomic differences underlying the observed phenotypic diversity are not well understood. CL outbreaks in Lebanon, Syria and in Azerbaijan and neighbouring countries are evidence that leishmaniasis is still an important public health concern. Here, we explored unique genetic features in L. tropica genomes by comparing the gene variants and gene copy number variations, as well as chromosome ploidy, of two recent isolates collected during a CL outbreak in Lebanon and one historical isolate from Azerbaijan with 16 published L. tropica genomes. In silico MLMT was also performed to integrate the current diversity of genome sequence data in the wider geography-related genetic populations. This study further highlights the distinct population structure and genomic heterogeneity of the L. tropica species complex in the context of the parasite broad geographic distribution. Unique sequence features identified in distinct populations could be exploited for the development of more accurate typing schemes and highlight proteins of potential functional importance to gain new insights into L. tropica specific biology.
