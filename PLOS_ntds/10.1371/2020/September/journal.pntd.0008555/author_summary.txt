The continual development of safe, effective vaccines against emerging diseases is one of the greatest challenges facing the scientific community. The New World group of mammarenaviruses contains multiple human pathogens, each capable of causing severe hemorrhagic disease. Among these, only Junin virus has a distributed vaccine. By utilizing this vaccine, we are able to determine vaccine development strategies for related New World viruses that represent an emerging threat. Here we demonstrate that manipulation of the viral Z protein is able to produce an incompatibility that ultimately attenuates the virus. This provides yet another tool for future vaccine development to further global public health.
