Population-based trachoma surveys are necessary to determine the impact of interventions and to build the case for the validation of elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. Many trachoma-endemic areas are currently receiving mass drug administration, which will require trachoma impact surveys (TIS) and trachoma surveillance surveys (TSS). We analyzed the costs accrued by the implementing non-governmental organization during 8 rounds of trachoma surveys in Amhara, Ethiopia, that included 187 districts surveyed over four years. The costs were sorted by activity (i.e. training and field work) and input category (i.e. transportation, personnel, venue rental, supplies, and other). Field work was the most expensive activity for trachoma surveys, with transportation and personnel as the most significant drivers of cost. As the global trachoma program matures, these surveys must be executed given the financial resources, personnel, and time available. Program managers can use these findings to improve total cost estimates of trachoma surveys and survey components to ensure that sufficient resources are being budgeted accordingly. Additionally, managers in hyperendemic settings can use these findings to better understand the drivers in cost of repeated surveys in a single geography.
