Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, during the chronic phase of infection 2–27% of patients develop digestive form of the disease (megaesophagus and megacolon) that contributes to patient morbidity and mortality, generating costs for public health services, and especially affecting significantly the life quality of the patients. Although is known that many factors inherent of the parasite (tropism, genetics, virulence and antigenicity), host (age, gender, nutritional status, genetics and immune response) and geographical distribution may influence the development of the different clinical forms of Chagas disease, the exact mechanism that leads to megacolon and megaesophagus development are unknown. Here we showed that patients with digestive form of Chagas’ disease do not express the innate immune receptor NOD2. By isolating a parasite from a digestive patient and infecting NOD2-deficient mice we observed a reduced intestinal motility, chronic development of colon and jejunum wall thickness associated with increased inflammatory mediators in the organ, when compared to wild type animals. Our results indicate that the NOD2 receptor protects against the development of the digestive form of Chagas disease and could be used as a biomarker for the development of gastrointestinal changes during T. cruzi infection in patients.
