Elephantiasis is targeted for elimination according to World Health Assembly resolution of 1997. There is need to determine if spread of infection has been stopped by conducting evaluations in areas that have received at least 5 rounds of treatment at minimum levels of 65% coverage. There are areas that cannot qualify for evaluations due to their achievement of low coverage. We conducted a study in Kaloleni sub-county to identify barriers of community participation in the campaign, develop and test strategies for improved treatment uptake for recommendation to the Programme Implementers. The study involved collecting quantitative data from systematically randomly sampled household heads and qualitative data from purposively selected key stakeholders. The identified strategies were tested in experimental sites while the usual treatment strategies were applied in control sites. The results showed an increase in community participation in MDA and in persons who considered the treatment as necessary. The strategies may have contributed to decreased proportions of persons who expressed problems with drugs swallowing due to size, number and taste, to positive perceptions of the drugs and should be applied for improved treatment uptake. The communities need robust health education on elephantiasis and importance of consistency in drug uptake.
