By combining a reference-independent SNP analysis and ANI (average nucleotide identity) with affinity propagation clustering (APC), we tested a methodology allowing resolving phylogenetic relationships, based on objective criteria. These bioinformatics tools can be used as a general ruler to determine phylogenetic relationships and clustering of bacteria, exemplary done with Francisella tularensis. Francisella tularensis causes the zoonosis tularemia. We analyzed the relationships between Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from Germany using whole-genome sequences. We chose open source, reference independent methods to optimize the level of discrimination. Using a recently described clustering algorithm, we exploit a novel approach to the clustering of bacteria. APC can be used for assigning clades and can be used for rapidly typing strains when they arise. Additionally, we detected two sub-clusters. The data provide evidence that Germany is the collision zone where the clade B.12, also known as the East European clade, overlaps with the clade B.6, also known as the Iberian clade.
