Rabies still remains a neglected zoonosis after a long history of vaccination. Considering the severity of the disease and its continued high incidence in low-income countries, the development of a next generation vaccine is warranted. We utilized a group C, replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus vector to develop a novel vaccine against rabies. Mice vaccinated with ChAd155-RG survived after rabies infection and non-human primates injected with a single dose of this vaccine developed strong and durable neutralizing antibody responses which could be effectively boosted with a licensed vaccine, demonstrating the compatibility of the novel vectored vaccine with the current post-exposure prophylaxis in the event of rabies virus exposure. Importantly, we show that ChAd155-RG induced neutralizing antibodies can neutralize also lyssavirus species (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) found in bat reservoirs. These studies paved the way to the clinical testing of the ChAd155-RG based rabies vaccine as a single-dose, low cost, preventative rabies vaccine candidate.
