    "Abstract": "Eumycetoma (mycotic mycetoma) is the fungal form of mycetoma, a subcutaneous infection occurring in individuals living in endemic areas of the disease. The Sudan is hyperendemic for mycetoma, with the highest incidence being reported from Gezira State, Central Sudan. The present study was conducted at the Gezira Mycetoma Center and aimed to determine the cause of black-grain eumycetoma in the state and describe its epidemiology. Black-grain specimens were collected during the surgical operation and direct detection of the causative agent was performed using M. mycetomatis species-specific PCR and ITS PCR followed by sequencing. Black-grain was reported from 93.3% of all confirmed mycetoma cases (n = 111/119), with a prevalence in young males. Of the 91 samples subjected to direct PCR, 90.1% (n = 82) gave positive results. The predominant species (88.2%) was Madurella mycetomatis. One sample was identified as M. fahalii, one as M. tropicana, and one matched the phytopathogenic species Sphaerulina rhododendricola. The highest endemic zones were Southern Gezira (76.6%) and Northern Sinnar (23.4%). The study confirmed that direct molecular detection on grains provides rapid and specific diagnosis of agents of eumycetoma."
