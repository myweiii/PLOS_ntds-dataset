Diarrhoea is a common cause of death among children younger than 5 years. Treatment is based on oral rehydration and sometimes the administration of antibiotics. Several pathogens are responsible for diarrhoea in small children. Cryptosporidium species are one of the common pathogens causing prolonged and persistent diarrhoea, malnutrition and growth deficits among immunocompetent children and of severe diarrhoea in immunocompromised persons.
Laboratory diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is usually achieved by microscopic detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in stool specimens; staining techniques include acid-fast stains and immunofluorescence. Given that appropriate treatment is impeded by the lack of timely and accurate standard diagnostics in middle and low-income countries, rapid diagnostic tests at the point of care potentially offer a shorter time to adequate care. We evaluated a new RDT targeting Cryptosporidium species. This new RDT showed variable and insufficient sensitivity among children admitted to a hospital with diarrhea at four different study sites in Gabon, Ghana, Madagascar, and Tanzania.
However, this new RDT could not be used as an appropriate tool for a reliable diagnosis of Cryptosporidiosis to guide community-based screening programs.
