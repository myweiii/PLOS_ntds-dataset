In Indonesia, more than 80 species of Anopheles have been documented, of which approximately 24 species are regarded as malaria vectors. Many of these mosquitoes are members of species complexes, being morphologically indistinguishable from other member sibling species. The Anopheles sundaicus complex (s.l.) has a wide geographical distribution in South and Southeast Asia, and exhibits ecological and behavioural variability over its range. Anopheles sundaicus s.l. is an important malaria vector present primarily in coastal areas of western and central Indonesia. Cytologic, isozyme, and molecular methods have been used to distinguish members of the complex in Indonesia, with several species being reported in different localities. This study aims to explore the distribution of the An. sundaicus complex in Indonesia using molecular methods. Female Anopheles sundaicus s.l. were collected from 12 localities within seven provinces in western to south-central Indonesia. The findings indicate the presence of An. epiroticus in North Sumatra and Bangka-Belitung archipelago off the eastern coast of central Sumatra. Further studies are required to determine the full distributional extent of the An. sundaicus complex in Indonesia and investigate the role of each species in malaria transmission.
