Schistosomiasis mansoni is a chronic and debilitating tropical disease caused by the helminth Schistosoma mansoni. The control and treatment of the disease rely almost exclusively on praziquantel (PZQ). Thus, there is an urgent need to search for promising protein targets to develop new drugs. Drugs that inhibit enzymes that modify the chromatin structure have been developed for a number of diseases. We and others have shown that S. mansoni epigenetic enzymes are also potential therapeutic targets. Here we evaluated the potential of the S. mansoni histone demethylase LSD1 (SmLSD1) as a drug target. We reported the synthesis of a novel and potent LSD1 inhibitor, MC3935, and show that it selectively inhibited the enzymatic activity of SmLSD1. Treatment of juvenile or adult worms with MC3935 caused severe damage to the tegument of the parasites and compromised egg production. Importantly, MC3935 proved to be highly toxic to S. mansoni, culminating in the death of juvenile or adult worms within 96 h. Transcriptomic analysis of MC3935-treated parasites revealed changes in the gene expression of hundreds of genes involved in key biological processes. Importantly, SmLSD1 contains unique sequences within its polypeptide chain that could be explored to develop a S. mansoni selective drug.
