The nematode Anisakis simplex is a parasite of marine mammals that can parasitize humans when a raw or undercooked fish containing live A. simplex larvae is consumed. As a result, gastrointestinal and/or allergic symptoms are reported. There has been evidence of increased intestinal permeability in A. simplex-sensitized subjects and serum levels of the specific immunoglobulin involved in allergic reactions (IgE) in some allergic patients when fishery products are re-introduced into their diet. These results suggest that A. simplex material present in fishery products could alter the normal gut function. We have analysed the effects of a cellular model of epithelial barrier exposed to A. simplex products. We have found that A. simplex induces an early and reversible alteration of integrity and permeability of epithelial cell monolayer and that an underlying mechanism of this effect would involve the oxidative stress and disruption of the proteins maintaining the barrier function. Additionally, it has been shown that Ani s 4, an A. simplex allergen, is able to cross the epithelial barrier. These findings could explain the increased intestinal permeability observed in Anisakis-sensitized patients, and the changes in specific IgE to A. simplex allergens when fishery products are re-introduced into their diet.
