Schistosomiasis, the infection caused by parasites of the genus Schistosoma, is still a significant health problem in many countries, despite some successful control efforts. In areas where parasite load is low and few eggs are released in feces, most diagnostic tests fail to detect the infections. Helmintex is a very sensitive, but time consuming, egg-detection method, with most time being consumed in observations of samples at the microscope. Here we report standardization of an innovative luminol-H2O2 chemiluminescence reaction triggered by Schistosoma mansoni eggs that may improve their detection in feces. Improved diagnostic tests are urgently required as part of the schistosomiasis elimination efforts.
