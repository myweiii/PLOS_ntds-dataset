Efforts to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Indian subcontinent have had an unprecedented impact on the number of cases over the past decade, however, the disease is known to be cyclical and previous periods of low incidence have been followed by a major resurgence. The disease is thought to be maintained between epidemics as post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a skin disease affecting 5 to 15% of apparently cured VL patients in the Indian subcontinent. PKDL is difficult to cure and since PKDL patients are not systemically ill, they seldom seek treatment, meaning that PKDL is likely to be a major obstacle to elimination. A key question is how different VL treatment regimens affect the risk of subsequent PKDL. We followed-up a cohort of more than 1700 patients treated with three different drug regimens in an effectiveness trial in Bihar and found that patients treated with miltefosine-paromomycin had a lower risk of relapse but higher PKDL incidence, while AmBisome treated patients had the reverse pattern. In order to sustain the gains already made, active surveillance for PKDL and relapse is essential, along with timely treatment, and new VL treatment regimens that avoid future PKDL are needed.
