The results demonstrate the ecological potential of Triatoma brasiliensis in the northeastern caatinga and how this species uses the resources available in nature or in the modified environment by man. Triatomines were collected in peridomestic, sylvatic, and intradomicile habitats. House infestations were evaluated on five occasions, with spraying of infested houses. T. brasiliensis was responsible for the high rates of dispersal, infestation, colonization and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in all catches and environments studied here. Spraying strongly reduced the infestation, but the number of triatomines rapidly returned to previous levels. Peridomicile represents a complex set of overlapping infested sites forming a network of shelters that favor the establishment and proliferation of triatomine colonies. Molecular characterization of T. cruzi isolated from triatomines and identification of their food sources emphasize the overlap of habitats and interaction among triatomines, synanthropic reservoirs and humans, increasing the risk of parasite transmission. Therefore, it is clear the need for maintenance of vector control fully and systematically with the use of appropriate strategies where interventions should consider regional ecoepidemiologic differences and the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors in T. cruzy transmission process into domicile environment.
