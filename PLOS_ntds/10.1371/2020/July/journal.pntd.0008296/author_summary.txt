The prevalence of moderate-to-heavy intensity (M&HI) infections is a key indicator for measuring the success of large-scale deworming programs for intestinal worms because they account for the majority of the worm-attributable morbidity. Currently, intestinal worm infections are classified as M&HI when the number of worm eggs that are microscopically detected in stool using a standard diagnostic method exceeds a threshold set by the World Health Organization. Over the years, a variety of new promising diagnostic methods have been introduced for the diagnosis of intestinal worms. Although they have some important advantages over the current standard method, it is not clear whether they can reliably classify M&HI infections. This is because their test results either systematically indicate lower egg counts or are expressed in a unit other than eggs per gram of stool (e.g, concentration of worm DNA), warranting the need for method-specific thresholds. We defined method-specific thresholds and verified whether they increased the correct classification of M&HI infections. Overall, our results indicate that method-specific thresholds improved the classification of M&HI infections, but that further validation is required before they can be recommended for evaluating the occurrence M&HI infections in large-scale deworming programs.
