Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is integrated as a provirus in the genomic DNA mainly of CD4+ T cell population in the infected people. HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells are transmitted via breast milk, semen, and blood transfusions. HTLV-1 is endemic in Japan, the Middle East, Africa, Caribbean islands, and Central and South America. A small proportion of infected people develop adult T-cell leukemia, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and other diseases. HAM/TSP, a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder, is characterized by spastic paraparesis and urinary disturbance. HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells infiltrate the spinal cord and cause inflammation, which results in such neurological symptoms. We have identified the tyrosine kinase gene ABL1 as a gene frequently found in the signal transduction pathways in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Therefore, ABL1 appears to be important in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Inhibiting ABL1 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), reduced the proviral load (PVL) in vitro. We found a rare case of a patient with HAM/TSP and CML by our clinical records, who showed a decrease in PVL after TKI treatment for CML. Hence, TKIs are potential therapeutic agents for HAM/TSP.
