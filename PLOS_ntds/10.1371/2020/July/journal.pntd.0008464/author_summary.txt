Infection with parasitic helminths has been reported to be beneficial for metabolic homeostasis by improving insulin sensitivity and lowering the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Elevated circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels associated with obesity are also risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. In the framework of a cross-sectional study conducted in an endemic rural area, we have investigated the impact of infection with Schistosoma hematobium on serum lipid homeostasis in adult individuals with a broad range of body weight. We found that helminth infection is associated with a lower serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C and triglyceride (TG) levels, especially in overweight/obese individuals. Furthermore, significant negative correlations between the intensity of infection and TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG levels were also found in overweight/obese individuals but not in lean subjects. Altogether our study show for the first time that infection with Schistosoma hematobium is associated with an improved serum lipid profile in overweight/obese humans, a feature that may contribute to protection against cardiometabolic diseases in such population. Further investigation is however required to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
