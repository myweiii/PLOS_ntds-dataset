The mosquitoes Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are highly invasive and transmit dengue and other arboviruses. This study investigates the genetics of these mosquitoes in the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs and where both species have established widespread invasions by hitch-hiking on human transport vessels. We compared patterns of genetic differentiation to determine the pathways these species have taken while spreading through the Indo-Pacific, and to better understand how they disperse. We sequenced DNA from 480 mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific, and found many genetic differences between the two species. Populations of Ae. aegypti, which is not native to the region, tended to be genetically different from each other, and populations in the Pacific Ocean were particularly divergent. Aedes albopictus populations were generally more similar to each other, though genetically different populations in Sri Lanka and Indonesia point to these having a different history to other populations. Genetic differences between Ae. aegypti populations were larger when populations were geographically distant, while differences between Ae. albopictus populations were larger when populations likely had limited access to human transportation. These results will help improve strategies for controlling these species and stopping their spread around the world.
