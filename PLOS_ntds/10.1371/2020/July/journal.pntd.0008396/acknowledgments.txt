We are grateful to Dr E. Prina (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) for the generous gift of the anti-Leishmania antibody 2A3-26. We would like to thank Pr. A. Schurmann (German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke, Nuthetal, Germany) and Pr. R. Abele (Institute of Biochemistry, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) for providing us with the anti-GLUT8 and anti-TAPL antibodies, respectively. UMR-S 996 and UMR 8076 are members of LabEx LERMIT (Laboratoire d'Excellence en Recherche sur le Médicament et Innovation Thérapeutique), supported by a grant from the ANR (ANR-10-LABX-33). The technical feasibility of the imaging study was preliminarily validated with the support of the RetroLeishma project R3 (Recipient D. Gillet), funded by LabEx LERMIT.
