ZIKV is more likely to cause fetal demise and brain malformations when the mother is infected at an early stage of pregnancy, which is the critical time window when a special type of immune cells called microglia appear in the YS and migrate to the fetal brain. YS-derived microglia are susceptible to ZIKV infection and can act as “Trojan horses” to bring ZIKV from the mother to the fetal brain.
