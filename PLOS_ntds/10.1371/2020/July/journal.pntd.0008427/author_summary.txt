Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis represent two debilitating filarial diseases that belong to the neglected tropical diseases. The current efforts to eliminate those diseases is hampered by the lack of short-course macrofilaricidal drugs, i.e. drugs that kill the adult worms, or regimens that are proven to be safe for both diseases. In the present study we demonstrate that the anthelmintic drug oxfendazole, currently used in veterinary medicine against intestinal helminths, has excellent efficacy in the Litomosoides sigmodontis rodent model of filariasis. Oxfendazole caused complete clearance of adult filariae after a short oral regimen in vivo. Oxfendazole was not directly active against the circulating filarial progeny, the microfilariae, suggesting that drug-induced serious adverse events due to the clearance of microfilariae are unlikely. Human dose was predicted based on the efficacy in the rodent model, the calculation estimated a low efficacious dose, which has already been shown to be safe in phase 1 clinical trials. Thus, oxfendazole represents a promising drug candidate for the treatment of human filarial diseases such as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.
