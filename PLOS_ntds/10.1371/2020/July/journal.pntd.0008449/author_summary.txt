Trachoma elimination efforts are hampered by limited understanding of Ct transmission routes. We have recently demonstrated the presence of Ct DNA at non-ocular sites in individuals living in households in Ethiopia where at least one resident had an ocular Ct infection detectable by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ct DNA was most frequently detected on faces, hands and clothing, being found in such locations in 10â€“16% of samples tested. However, qPCR cannot discriminate between DNA from viable and non-viable organisms, and potentially misinform our understanding of Ct transmission routes. In this study, we used a propidium monoazide based viability PCR to investigate how long Ct remains viable on non-ocular sites by spiking different surfaces including pig skin, plastic and cotton cloth. These surfaces mimic non-ocular sites previously found to be positive for Ct DNA using standard qPCR. The results of our study show that viable Ct DNA could be recovered from plastic, cotton cloth and skin surfaces for up to 24 hours suggesting that these surfaces a role in ocular Ct transmission.
