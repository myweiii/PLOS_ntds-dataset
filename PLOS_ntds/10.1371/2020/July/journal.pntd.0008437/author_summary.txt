Leptospirosis is a widespread bacterial zoonosis with increasing importance due to its vast range of reservoir hosts. Early symptoms are shared by other infectious diseases common in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where the real burden and risk factors need to be known. In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is mostly an occupational disease associated with freshwater or animal exposure in agriculture communities. Thus, there is a need for understanding the epidemiology of leptospirosis in agrarian regions of the country for developing better prevention and intervention strategies. In this study, we applied an environmental DNA metabarcoding methodology to understand the environmental microbiome, potential reservoir animals and the Leptospira species circulating in two different agro-ecological regions of Sri Lanka: Kandy (wet region mid-country region 2) and Girandurukotte (intermediate region low-country region 2). It is known that pathogenic Leptospira are excreted through the urine of reservoir animals in the environment, where they can persist in humid conditions. Congruently, this study showed a higher detection of pathogenic Leptospira in the environment of Kandy where the environmental microbiome showed a higher diversity than Girandurukotte. Potential animal reservoirs were also detected in samples positive for pathogenic Leptospira, suggesting that environmental DNA metabarcoding can provide important information for management and intervention strategies to control leptospirosis.
