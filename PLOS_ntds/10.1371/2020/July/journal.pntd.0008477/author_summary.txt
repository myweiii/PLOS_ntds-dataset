Dengue, a viral illness occurring following the bite of an infected mosquito, is common in tropical urban areas of the globe. Using a survey that enquires about not only physical health but also psychological health, self-care, mobility and usual social activities, this study assesses the overall impact of dengue on the well-being of those with the disease. Of the estimated 390 million annual infections, approximately 75 percent do not cause individuals to attend medical facilities, possibly because many infections do not result in significant symptoms or because access to healthcare is limited. Unlike previous studies, this study recruited those who would have been unlikely to seek healthcare as well as individuals who attended health facilities. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that healthcare professionals should regard dengue as a disease that affects not only physical, but also psychological health and aspects of social functioning. Furthermore, it suggests that those not seeking treatment may also have a substantial reduction in quality of life during their infection. Given the millions of dengue infected people who do not attend healthcare facilities annually this could amount to a very meaningful societal impact.
