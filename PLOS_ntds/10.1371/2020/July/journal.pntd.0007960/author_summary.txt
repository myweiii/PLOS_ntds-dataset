Traditionally, spontaneous intracerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) were defined as small foci of intracerebral hemorrhages. Such atraumatic CMHs are due to the rupture of a weak blood vessel wall. Infections complicating cerebrovascular accidents have been extensively investigated. However, the role of CMHs complicating infections, in particularly acute systemic infections, has been poorly explored. Population-based retrospective cohort studies suggest there are potentially more undiscovered cases of CMHs accompanying acute systemic infections. Given both the lack of an animal model and cellular/molecular pathophysiology of CMHs following acute systemic infections, there is an urgent need to increase our comprehensive understanding of acute infection-induced CMHs. Overall, our study revealed a novel role of annexin a2 (ANXA2) in the formation of CMHs during R. australis and Ebola virus infections; and the underlying mechanism is relevant to the role of ANXA2-regulated endothelial tight junctions and its role in stabilizing the blood-brain barrier in these deadly infections.
