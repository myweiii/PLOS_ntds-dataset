High levels of Leishmania spp. infections affecting both humans and animals are recognized among Italian regions; in particular, Sicily is an endemic area for Leishmania infantum. In this study 78 Sicilian L. infantum strains isolated from humans and dogs were assessed to investigate their biodiversity by genetic tools. Results were compared with 6 L. infantum reference strains included in the analysis. The evaluation of K26 genetic markers identified 91% of samples as belonging to the MON-1 zymodeme, confirming it as the predominant strain in the Mediterranean area and 9% of the samples–all isolated from humans–as non-MON-1. Multilocus microsatellite typing has proven to be a powerful tool to discriminate strains showing all the isolated strains clustered in two genetically distinct populations, corresponding to human and canine isolates, respectively. A further subdivision was observed between the two main groups, giving in the human population a correlation between microsatellite profile and geographical origin. Our results demonstrate that genetic tools are able to discriminate Leishmania strains and to give useful insights into the epidemiology of leishmaniasis, raising questions on the role of dogs as main reservoirs for human leishmaniasis in the Sicily region.
