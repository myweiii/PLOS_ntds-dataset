Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease discovered in rural areas of China in 2009, caused by a novel tick-borne phlebovirus, the SFTS virus (SFTSV). At present, SFTS reported cases are increasing, and the epidemic area of SFTSV is expanding. SFTSV is currently endemic in China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, and has 12â€“30% fatality rates. This study demonstrated that SFTSV is vertically transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier of immunocompetent mice, and can result in fetal damage. This study highlights the possible potential impact of SFTSV on pregnant women and livestock. The results suggested that we should actively monitor the pregnancy outcomes of women and livestock infected with SFTSV, and strengthen the study of the pathogenesis of fetal damage caused by SFTSV.
