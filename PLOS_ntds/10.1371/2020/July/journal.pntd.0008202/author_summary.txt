When developing a malaria vaccine, it is essential to consider natural polymorphisms of the candidate antigen to ensure high efficacy. As a novel member of EBL protein family in P. vivax, PvEBP showed preference for reticulocyte binding, with its specific antibody exhibiting binding inhibition activity. This study presents PvEBP as a suitable target for an asexual erythrocytic stage vaccine. Here, we discuss genetic polymorphisms and neutral selection of PvEBP gene in eight different P. vivax-endemic countries, and how these affect the prevalence of naturally-acquired anti-PvEBP antibodies from vivax patients. This study highlights a number of challenges associated with the PvEBP base vaccine development strategy.
