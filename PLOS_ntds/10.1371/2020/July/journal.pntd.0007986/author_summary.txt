American visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum. This parasite can infect humans and animals and is transmitted by sand flies. Domestic dogs are considered an important host, and like humans, they can manifest the disease or present asymptomatic infections. Studies have identified genetic variations among L. infantum parasites from different endemic regions in the American continent. For other parasitic diseases (e.g., malaria), studies have suggested that multigenetic infection predicts the development of symptoms and can lead to a high level of transmission. However, the effects of the genetic composition of Leishmania parasites on VL need to be ascertained. This study used highly variable microsatellite markers to investigate multigenotype L. infantum populations among naturally infected dogs living in an area in which VL is highly prevalent. Samples obtained from different tissues were examined to identify the occurrence of multiple genotypes in the same animal and even within the same tissue.
