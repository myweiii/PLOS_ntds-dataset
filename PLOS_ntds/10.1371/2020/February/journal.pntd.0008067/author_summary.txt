Chagas disease has become a public health concern for health services in Spain, provided that the destination is the primary choice for Latin American migrants in Europe. Chronic phase is the most frequent clinical form of the disease outside of endemic areas. Most of these patients usually undergo treatment with Benznidazole, primarily childbearing women. Monitoring response to antiparasitic treatment without the presence of an early cure biomarker poses as one of the greatest challenges in managing this disease. In this study, almost 400 chronic Chagas disease patients treated with Benznidazole in two referral centers in Barcelona were included. Real-time PCR and serology were performed in all clinical visits after treatment; real-time PCR has been used as a surrogate biomarker to assess response to treatment. The failure rate of Benznidazole was very low in our cohort, with treatment discontinuation being a risk factor for such failure. In summary, our data supports that regular testing by real- time PCR for monitoring treatment response in chronic Chagas disease patients could be a useful surrogate marker for failure in such individuals.
