Human sparganosis has increased in recent years in China. Frogs play an important role in the spread of sparganosis. However, our knowledge about the prevalence of sparganum infection in frogs remains incomplete, and the taxonomic identification of sparganum is still controversial. In this study, the prevalence of sparganum infection in frogs was surveyed at 145 geographical locations in China. In addition, 72 spargana representing 72 distinct geographical isolates were selected for molecular identification. Frogs that tested positive for sparganum infection were found in 80 of the 145 surveyed locations, and the average infection rate was 10.96% (447/4078), with most of the spargana present in the thigh muscles of the infected frogs. The levels of sparganum infections in wild frogs in South and Southwest China were higher than those in the central and eastern regions. In the molecular identification analysis, all of the isolates revealed two specific bands in the multiplex PCR assay; the further clustering analysis of the sequenced PCR products showed that the Chinese isolates had a close relationship with Spirometra erinaceieuropaei.
