Leishmaniasis is a group of neglected diseases, with more than 350 million people at risk and 2 million new cases every year. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. Algeria is one of most affected countries, with thousands of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases registered every year. However, in spite of the scientific knowledge gained over the last decades, the understanding of the biology and the ecology of sand flies in some areas of Algeria is still fragmentary. The present study was conducted from 2016 to 2017 to assess the sand fly population in Setif and also the Leishmania spp. circulating in this province. Our data suggest a complex epidemiological picture of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Setif, with the involvement of different etiological agents and possibly with different reservoir hosts and vectors.
