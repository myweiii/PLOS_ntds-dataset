Buruli ulcer and leprosy are disfiguring diseases of the skin that lead to disability and stigma. Although they are both present in overlapping population groups in West Africa, efforts to care for people affected have usually had a single disease focus. Since both conditions require wound care and long courses of medications, and the risk for transmission is minimal, it has been recommended that they could be managed together. However, there are few reports on how people affected by these diseases experience being brought together.At the border between Liberia and Guinea, a rehabilitation centre has recently integrated care for Buruli ulcer with leprosy care. We conducted a qualitative study in this facility to explore experiences of integrated care for these two diseases. We found that people experience these diseases in a similar way, to the extent that some considered both diseases to be related, and perceive receiving their medications and wound care together favourably.We identified some negative experiences including unjustified fear of acquiring the other disease, intense pain during the process of wound cleaning, and permanent disability due to lack of physiotherapy. In the future, programmes that implement integrated care should anticipate and address these negative experiences to mitigate the burden of these diseases.
