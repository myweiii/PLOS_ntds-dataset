    "Background": "Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) comprise a group of helminth parasites that are included in the list of Neglected Tropical Diseases and require a passage through the soil to become infective. Several studies have detected that infection with STHs are associated with certain socioeconomic, environmental and soil characteristics. In Argentina, the presence of these parasites has been detected through a few point studies conducted in localities from 11 of the 23 provinces that comprise the country.",
    "Methods/Principal findings": "The most important characteristics previously associated with the presence of STHs were identified and ranked through the use of an expert survey and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in order to construct a risk map of STHs specific for Argentina. Prevalence data from previous studies was used to validate the generated risk map. The map shows that half of Argentina, from the Central provinces to the North, contains localities with the characteristics necessary for the development of these parasites.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The predicted map should serve as a useful tool for guiding the identification of survey areas for the generation of baseline data, detecting hotspots of infection, planning and prioritizing areas for control interventions, and eventually performing post-implementation surveillance activities."
