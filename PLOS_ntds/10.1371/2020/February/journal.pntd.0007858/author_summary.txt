Human myiasis is a neglected disease caused by ectoparasitic infestations of the skin, cavities and wounds by larvae of a wide variety of dipteran flies. Here, we review available data on human myiasis in Ecuador using a national registry of 2,187 cases and other information sources (39 clinical cases). We conclude that myiasis is endemic in both temperate and tropical regions of the country with greatest endemicity in the tropical lowlands of the Amazon (estimated annual incidence of 23 cases/100,000 population). Almost half clinical cases were cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by Dermatobia hominis, which produced single lesions that were treated successfully with oral ivermectin followed by manual extraction. Also relatively common were infestations by Cochliomyia hominivorax, found in tropical and temperate regions in the Andean highlands, which infested wounds and cavities, occasionally involving hundreds of larvae and causing severe tissue damage when unrecognized. Our data shows that myiasis is a significant and unrecognized health problem in Ecuador, is likely to be significantly under-reported, and requires improved awareness among affected populations and improved education among health professionals for its diagnosis, treatment, and recognition of fly species.
