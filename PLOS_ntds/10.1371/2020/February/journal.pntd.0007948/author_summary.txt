A number of receptors for Bt Cry toxins, have been identified and characterized, including cadherin proteins. However, the role of these proteins in the insect is unknown and there have been few efforts to elucidate their function. First, in this study we show that in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, the cadherin protein is essential for development. Secondly, we provide evidence that AaeCad plays a role in the apical membrane and the maintenance of midgut integrity by gene tagging using CRISPR/Cas9, which overcomes the limitation of receptor localization using antibodies in previous studies. These investigations are helpful to further investigate the physiological function of AaeCad. Moreover, this study demonstrated successful tagging of an essential gene with fluorescence protein in a non-model insect. In addition, this study showed that epithelium thinning is possibly a conserved mechanism for host defense against pore-forming toxins, like Cry11A.
