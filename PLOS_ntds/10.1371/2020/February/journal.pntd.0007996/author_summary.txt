Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand fly vectors causing lesions and potentially life-long scars. Trials for CL treatments so far have not included patientsâ€™ input, such as their preferences on outcomes. This study reports treatment outcomes seen as important by patients that were explored through semi-structured interviews conducted in CL-endemic regions in Brazil, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Iran, Morocco, Peru and Tunisia. In addition to outcomes mostly considered in trials centered on lesion evolution and adverse events, patients reported a wide range of further outcomes and concerns. These are related to their quality of life, but also parasitological cure, potential for recurrence and sequelae of the disease. We suggest possibilities on how to include and measure a number of these patient-preferred outcomes into trials, and discuss ways of considering others in the context of treatment and clinical trials, e.g. via information provided to patients.
