Ascaris infection is the most common infection of humans living in poverty worldwide and can result in malnutrition and stunted physical and mental development in children. A preventive vaccine is urgently needed as a complementary approach to anthelmintic deworming to increase the efficiency of STH infection control. To develop a vaccine against Ascaris infection, an immunodominant antigen, As37 of A. suum, was cloned and expressed as a soluble recombinant protein in E. coli. The recombinant As37 protein (rAs37) was highly recognized by protective immune sera from A. suum infected mice. Balb/c mice immunized with 25 μg rAs37 formulated with the adjuvant AddaVax™ showed significant larval worm reduction against challenge with A. suum infective eggs when compared to a PBS (49.7%) or adjuvant control (48.7%). Protection was associated with a mixed Th1/2-type immune response characterized by high titers of serological IgG1 and IgG2a and stimulation of the production of cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. The AddaVax™ adjuvant induced better protection than the Th1-type adjuvant MPLA (38.9%) and the Th2-type adjuvant Alhydrogel (40.7%). Sequence analysis revealed that As37 was a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and highly conserved in other human STHs. Anti-As37 antibodies strongly recognized homologs in hookworms (Necator americanus, A. ceylanicum, A. caninum) and in the whipworm T. muris, but there was no cross-reaction with human spleen tissue extracts. These results indicate that the nematode-conserved As37 protein could be developed as a pan-helminth vaccine antigen to prevent all STH infections without reacting with human IgSF molecules.
