Dengue virus is a human pathogen that causes millions of infections each year. It can be found in nearly all tropical areas, and people living in those regions and travelers who visit them are at risk of disease. The symptoms may vary from a mild flu-like disease to severe hemorrhagic symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of dengue is important for a better management of the disease and for epidemiological surveillance. Detection of DENV antigen is a useful tool to diagnose DENV infections. However, currently available techniques are not rapid (ELISA assays) or not accurate enough (immunochromatographic tests). Here, we evaluate a new antigen detection technique based on aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles. The method combines a short time to results (12 minutes) with a high diagnostic performance. We therefore conclude that this new technique could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of dengue.
