Child stunting remains a global health challenge rooted in an intergenerational cycle of poor health, reduced neurodevelopment and poverty. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an acquired condition of the small intestine likely resulting from frequent faecal-oral microbial exposure, which is hypothesized to underlie stunting. We found dynamic changes in EED biomarkers between 1 and 18 months of age in a cohort of rural Zimbabwean infants, suggesting a complex developmental period of intestinal maturation, adaptation and response to environmental insults. Randomized improved infant and young child feeding, and improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions had no meaningful impact on EED. Greater investment in transformative WASH is needed to prevent EED in low-income countries.
