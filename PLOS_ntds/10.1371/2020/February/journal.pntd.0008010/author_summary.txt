Although Africa has the highest per capita death rate from rabies, the incidence of canine rabies on the continent remains a matter that needs to be further investigated; in addition, the lack of accurate information impairs the establishment of long-term actions to progress towards a rabies free status. In this scenario, creating efficient diagnostic facilities is of utmost importance for eradicating the disease and implementing effective surveillance programs in endemic areas. With the final objective of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies globally by 2030, sample submission to African veterinary laboratories for rabies diagnostic testing is expected to increase. Furthermore, in compliance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard, participating to proficiency testing (PT) exercises becomes mandatory not only to regularly assess the validity of the in-house protocols but also to harmonize the techniques. Thirteen veterinary laboratories and one public health laboratory in Africa were invited to take part in the exercise in response to an invitation from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), Italy, which hosts the FAO rabies Reference Center. This study presents the results obtained by applying the DFA test and the conventional RT-PCR method to the PT panel, which show that even if laboratories preferably apply the DFA test to detect the presence of rabies in animal samples, the overall concordance of results was higher through molecular testing. Importantly, the organization of the exercise proved to be a good opportunity to update the vaccine cover status of laboratory staff.
