Rubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can affect the fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or an infant born with a combination of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Government of India is committed to eliminate measles and control rubella/CRS and has completed nationwide immunization campaigns using measles-rubella vaccine targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years. A case-based surveillance for CRS is one of the strategies for achieving elimination. The Indian Council of Medical Research and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initiated surveillance for CRS in five sentinel sites to estimate the disease burden. During 2016â€“18, the surveillance sites enrolled 645 suspected CRS patients, 137 (21.2%) were classified as laboratory confirmed CRS and 8 (1.2%) as congenital rubella infection. Common clinical features among laboratory confirmed CRS patients included structural heart defects (78.8%), one or more eye signs (cataract, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy (59.9%)) and hearing impairment (38.6%). Thirty-three (24.1%) laboratory confirmed CRS patients died over a period of 2 years. The surveillance data indicated significance of rubella as persistent public health problem in India.
