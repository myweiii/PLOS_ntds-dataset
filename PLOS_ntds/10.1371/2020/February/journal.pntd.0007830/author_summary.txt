Onchocerciasis is a vector-borne tropical disease caused by the parasitc worm, Onchocerca volvulus. The vector is Simulium flies that breed in fast flowing rivers and streams. The infection can cause skin disease and loss of vision, giving risk to the common name of ‘river blindness’ for the condition. Ivermectin (Mectizan) mass drug administration (MDA) given at high coverage for many years can interrupt transmission such that MDA can eventually be stopped. The present paper provides highlights of onchocerciasis transmission interruption in the first known coordinated international cross border focus with ivermectin MDA program in Africa, where 99% of the global onchocerciasis burden exists. This focus known as Galabat-Metema is shared between Ethiopia and Sudan, both of which have established a nationwide policy for elimination of onchocerciasis. The paper provides the history of MDA in the border area and the results leading a coordinated end to MDA in the focus in 2017.
