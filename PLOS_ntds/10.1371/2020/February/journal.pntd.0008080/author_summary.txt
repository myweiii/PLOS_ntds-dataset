Schistosomiasis mansoni is a millennial disease and covers mainly tropical and economically disadvantaged regions. The disease mostly affects the liver, causing necrosis and fibrosis. Our study evaluated the effect of the immune system in modulating the oviposition of worms and the expression of genes mainly related to epigenetic regulation in worms. We also examined how methylation of liver DNA and the expression of related genes are influenced during Schistosoma mansoni infection depending on the type of immune response presented by the host. Our results revealed increased DNA demethylation during infection of EBi3-/- mice, while wild-type mice do not altered the methylation during infection. S. mansoni oviposition was decreased in infected EBi3-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, proving adaptation of the parasites to the type of host response. The livers of infected EBi3-/- mice presented less damage than those of wild-type mice, suggesting a protective hepatic effect conferred by the decrease in Th1 caused by IL27 and IL35 pathway knockout.
