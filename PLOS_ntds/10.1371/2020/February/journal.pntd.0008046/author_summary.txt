Non-toxigenic Vibrio cholerae isolates are associated with diarrheal disease globally. Among them, ctxAB negative, tcpA positive (CNTP) isolates have the highest risk of disease because they may be able to colonize the human intestine. By population genomic analysis of 850 previously published genomes and 119 newly sequenced genomes in this study, we found that most of CNTP isolates can be attributed into two distinctive lineages, L3b and L9. Both lineages are not only circulating in local regions causing endemic disease, but have been spreading worldwide over the past 100 years. Central Asia is the most likely origin of the L3b lineage, and the strains spread to China on at least three occasions. The L3b strains were also exported from China to other parts of the world, and one of the migrations are related to the groups that circulated in Latin America. Within Hangzhou, a modernized city in China, aquatic food products are the most likely medium of CNTP strains, and a spread pattern from rural aquafarms to the urban areas was observed. This work filled the missing links in the global spread of two non-toxigenic serogroup O1 V. cholerae lineages that can cause human infection. The results suggest that in future disease control efforts, the sampling of V. cholerae should not be limited to the apparently toxic isolates, and that a more thorough and unbiased sampling framework is needed.
