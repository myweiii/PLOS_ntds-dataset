Human pathogenic filariae are responsible for several devastating diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Neutrophils are essentially involved in protective immune responses against invading infective L3 larvae of filarial nematodes. The S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer, also known as calprotectin, is abundantly expressed by neutrophils and markedly increased during infection, tissue damage, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) and cellular necrosis. However, calprotectin is also known to have an anti-inflammatory or protective role during infection and inflammation and there is an ongoing controversy on whether S100A8/A9 is pathogenic or rather protective. The present study investigated the impact of calprotectin on protective immune responses against the rodent filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. Investigations in L. sigmodontis-infected mice deficient in S100A8/S100A9 and wild-type controls demonstrate that the lack of S100A8/S100A9 promotes protective responses that trigger L3-induced inflammation by increasing chemokine production, granulocyte recruitment and neutrophil activation, triggering transient inflammatory responses and therefore impairing larval migration and worm recovery.
