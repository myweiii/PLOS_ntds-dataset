Molecular xenomonitoring of parasites or viruses using mosquitoes as “flying syringes” is a promising and non-invasive tool for early detection and surveillance of various pathogens, particularly in low prevalence settings, but there is a need for cost-effective and higher throughput alternatives. We recently developed a novel approach based on the collection of mosquito excreta/feces (E/F) using a superhydrophobic cone that directs the sample into a tube at the bottom of the collection cup. We tested this method’s ability to detect the presence of filarial and malaria parasite DNA from households in two endemic rural communities of Ghana and compared it to the molecular detection from blood and mosquito carcass samples from corresponding households. The detection of parasite DNA in mosquito E/F was successful for all three pathogens, and it showed good concordance with the detection in the insects’ whole carcasses. Given the successful detection of Mansonella perstans, which is not transmitted by mosquitoes, our tool shows promise for use as an alternative method for the early and non-invasive detection and surveillance of various pathogens in human blood, including those not strictly mosquito-borne, in endemic settings.
