    "Abstract": "We recently developed a superhydrophobic cone-based method for the collection of mosquito excreta/feces (E/F) for the molecular xenomonitoring of vector-borne parasites showing higher throughput compared to the traditional approach. To test its field applicability, we used this platform to detect the presence of filarial and malaria parasites in two villages of Ghana and compared results to those for detection in mosquito carcasses and human blood. We compared the molecular detection of three parasites (Wuchereria bancrofti, Plasmodium falciparum and Mansonella perstans) in mosquito E/F, mosquito carcasses and human blood collected from the same households in two villages in the Savannah Region of the country. We successfully detected the parasite DNA in mosquito E/F from indoor resting mosquitoes, including W. bancrofti which had a very low community prevalence (2.5â€“3.8%). Detection in the E/F samples was concordant with detection in insect whole carcasses and human blood, and a parasite not vectored by mosquitoes was detected as well.Our approach to collect and test mosquito E/F successfully detected a variety of parasites at varying prevalence in the human population under field conditions, including a pathogen (M. perstans) which is not transmitted by mosquitoes. The method shows promise for further development and applicability for the early detection and surveillance of a variety of pathogens carried in human blood."
