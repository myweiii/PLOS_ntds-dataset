Zambia has experienced cholera outbreaks since 1977. It is a landlocked country bordered by the DRC and Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the south; all of which experience regular cholera outbreaks. The Zambian Ministry of Health included cholera vaccination, in addition to standard cholera control measures, e.g., clean water, improving sanitation and promoting hygiene to counter a cholera outbreak in 2016. The implementation of these control measures is in line with Zambia’s National Cholera Eliminating Plan (NCEP) by 2025 and is also consistent with guidance by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control’s (GTFCC) global roadmap to end cholera by 2030. In both plans, the identification of high risk areas known as cholera “hotspots” is necessary to prioritize OCV deployment while also key in identifying areas where improvements are needed including surveillance systems and effective WASH improvements. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed district-level cholera data from 2008 to 2017. Sixteen of 72 districts were identified to have an increased risk of cholera using a geostatistical model. Outside of Lusaka district, which is a primary hotspot, the additional hotspot districts share borders with Zambia’s neighboring countries. To achieve cholera elimination in Zambia by 2025, a regional strategy involving each of the countries bordering will be needed.
