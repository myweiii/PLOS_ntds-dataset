Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important disease of cattle and humans, highly prevalent in middle- and low-income countries worldwide. Determining the prevalent B. abortus lineages as well as the sources and timing of strain introductions into a country, is necessary for understanding the epidemiology and the natural history of the disease. Our results, derived from 188 B. abortus isolates from Costa Rica and 221 genomes from the same species worldwide, showed that in spite of being a small country (~51,100 km2), there are at least five B. abortus lineages circulating in its territory. Furthermore, regardless of control measures, the lineages introduced more than 100 years ago are still present and widespread throughout the country, in contrast to more recent introductions that seemed to be geographically restricted. By means of our analysis, we constructed a road map based on an integrative approach that may improve the understanding of the disease dynamics. Following the brucellosis prevalence and the farming practices of several middle- and low-income countries, similar scenarios could be found in other regions worldwide, where our methods could be useful and similarly applied.
