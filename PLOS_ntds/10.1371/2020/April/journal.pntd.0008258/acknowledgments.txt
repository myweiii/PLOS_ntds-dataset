We would like to thank a number of key people for their valued input: Stefan Witek-McManus for input into development of the codebook and analysis plan; Janet Masaku and Rosemary Musuva for data coordination; and all the field officers, especially Hemed Mwakuzimui, Kennedy Kasbai, Naima Kamole and Dickson Muluu who conducted the transcription of the audio recordings. We appreciate the administrative and logistic support from Carlos Mcharo. We are very grateful to the Ministry of Health at the National level, particularly Sultani H Matendechero, Kefa Bota, Wycliffe Omondi, and Cecelia Wandera for oversight of the implementation of the MDA. We also gratefully acknowledge Athuman Chiguzo, Hajara El-Busaidy, and Redempta Muendo at from the Ministry of Health in Kwale for their leadership during the implementation as well as the tireless work from the health teams at the County, Sub-county, health facility and village level teams. Furthermore, the MDA would not have been possible without the support of the Ministry of Interior and National Coordination of Government and the Public Service Office at the County, Sub-county, ward and village level. Finally, we thank the participantsâ€”CHAs, CHVs, and community members who took the time to provide valuable insights for this study.
