The Ebola-Tx trial tested the efficacy of Convalescent Plasma (CP) as a treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea during the 2014–2016 West African outbreak. As part of the trial, a bus equipped with plasmapheresis and pathogen inactivation technologies, referred to as the ‘Plasma Mobile’, was used to collect plasma from Ebola survivors, hence recruited as CP donors. Previous studies on clinical trials during the EVD outbreak in West Africa showed positive impact triggered by the introduction of technologies such as improvements in work conditions and care. In our ethnographic research on the Plasma Mobile as transferred technology, we show that technologies contributed to bringing less stress and mistrust in the (highly sensitive issue of the) use of blood products. The organization of the technology in the Plasma Mobile aimed at avoiding mistakes and improving staff performance. In sum, we describe the effects of technologies in staff and CP donors, including the hope for new and improved futures for donors and EVD patients. These results may shed light upon epidemic preparedness, for instance on the need for providing cultural meaning and social understandings to the transfer of technologies.
