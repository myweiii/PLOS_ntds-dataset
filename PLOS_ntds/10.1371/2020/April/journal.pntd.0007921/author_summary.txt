The causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, is capable of repeat infections in people, suggesting that the human immune response does not develop sufficiently broad or long-lasting immunity to cover treponemal diversity. Here, we examined the genomes from two blood-derived isolates of T. pallidum derived 6 years apart from a patient who had syphilis four times during the same period to understand the genetic basis of reinfection. We found a paucity of coding changes across the genome outside of the highly variable tprK gene. Using deep profiling of the full-length tprK gene, we found surprisingly that the two isolates did not share any full-length TprK sequences.
