Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is an endemic disease of Latin-American countries, affecting 10 million people are estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and more than 120 million inhabitants are at risk of infection. The parasite is transmitted to humans in a vectorial way by infected triatomines and through other non-vector mechanisms such as the oral route, congenital transmission, organ transplants or blood transfusions. Due to immigration towards non-endemic regions, the disease can spread and affect people around the world via blood transfusions. The pathogenesis of this disease is still unwell understood; we previously demonstrated that cardiomyocytes isolated from Chagas patients have an intracellular Ca2+ overload, which appears to be associated with changes in the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway. This study corroborates that human cardiomyocytes isolated from Chagas’ patients have an increase in [Ca2+]d and a partial membrane potential depolarization, which corresponds with the degree of cardiac dysfunction determined by the NYHA classification (23). In this report, we showed, for the first time, that IP3R activators, e.g., IP3BM, ET-1, and BK-induced a more significant elevation of [Ca2+]d in Chagas’ compared to non-Chagas’ human cardiomyocytes, which was not modified by the removal of [Ca2+]e. Additionally, these findings open the door for novel therapeutic strategies oriented to improve cardiac function and quality of life of individuals suffering from chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC).
