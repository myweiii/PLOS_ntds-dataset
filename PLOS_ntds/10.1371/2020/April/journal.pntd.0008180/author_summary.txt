Despite clear linkages between poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and risk of enteric diseases, there is mixed evidence of the ability of WASH interventions to mitigate these diseases based on findings from the “gold standard” randomized controlled trials. This study examines drivers of enteric diseases by exploring associations between household- and community-level WASH access and enteropathogen infections. We found that enteropathogen infections were nearly universal across age groups, with 98.3% of subjects having at least one infection. Few household or village-level WASH covariates were statistically associated with enteropathogen infection; WASH access generally trended towards lower infection, though trends varied by transmission pathway. Factors other than WASH access, such as intra-household transmission, animal feces exposure, and environmental contamination may be important risk factors for enteric infections. These results highlight the challenges of addressing enteric infections using many of the existing WASH intervention approaches.
