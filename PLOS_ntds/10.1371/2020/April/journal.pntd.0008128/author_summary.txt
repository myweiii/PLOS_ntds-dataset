Cholera remains to be a major public health burden in the developing countries. Toxigenic strains of the Gram-negative organism Vibrio cholerae belonging to serogroups O1 and O139 are the etiological agents for this dreadful disease. These strains secrete CT into the extracellular milieu which upon ingestion of contaminated food or water, results in severe loss of water and electrolytes. In the recent past, V. cholerae O1 strains with the signature ctxB7 allele have propagated through many of the cholera endemic regions in Africa and Asia. These strains were also identified as the cause for the devastating cholera epidemic in Haiti that killed around 8000 victims. It was demonstrated that the Haitian isolate had been associated with hypertoxigenic phenotype and increased virulence. However, whether the ctxB7 allele may have any role to play in increased CT production phenotype of the Haitian variants remains obscure. We observed that the ctxB7 allele plays a pivotal role in heightened CT production, although any link between increased CT production and hypervirulence phenotypes remains undefined.
