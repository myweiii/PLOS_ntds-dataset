Giardia lamblia and other protozoan parasites annually infect hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide and are major causes of clinically important diseases. Vaccines against giardiasis are not available, making treatment with antimicrobial drugs critical for the management of the infection. Resistance to all major drugs against G. lamblia has been reported and threatens their future utility, yet development of new and improved drugs remains a major scientific and economic challenge. Here we report a strategy for identifying new drug targets by exploring the targets of a successful class of existing antimicrobial drugs with multiple targets. Comprehensive identification of these targets revealed possibilities for alternative drugs that can overcome existing forms of resistance. This strategy has the potential to accelerate identification of promising novel drug targets as key rate-limiting step in the development of alternative antimicrobial drugs.
