Bartonella are bacteria that infect the circulatory system and, unlike other bacteria, cause blood vessels to grow uncontrollably in the skin, spleen and liver of humans. In many respects, the process resembles the aberrant blood vessel formation that occurs during tumor formation. This study found that when Bartonella bacilliformis (Bb) infects vascular endothelial cells (VECs) that line the circulatory system, it causes them to overproduce a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF) which, in turn, causes the cells to multiply more rapidly than usual. We also found that VECs migrate towards the bacterium and form capillary-like tubes; processes that occur during an actual infection. This cause-effect has not been previously reported, and it may help to explain the pathology observed in humans infected by Bb.
