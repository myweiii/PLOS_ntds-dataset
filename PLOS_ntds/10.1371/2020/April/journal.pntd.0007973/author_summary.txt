In this manuscript we detail the baseline results of a broader study investigating the feasibility of expanding access of albendazole and praziquantel to additional at-risk groups in three communities (Tomefa, Maheam and Torgahkope-Adakope) located around the Weija reservoir in the Greater Accra district of Ghana. Our results show that intestinal schistosomiasis was the most common form of disease across all three sites (44.2%) with Tomefa possessing the highest prevalence at 78.3%. The prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis was found to be 11.9% with the highest prevalence found in Torgahkope-Adakope (19%). STH was found to have a very low prevalence across the three communities with only 1.3% of participants found to be positive. No significant difference in STH prevalence was observed between males (0.92%; 95% CI = 0.4–1.81) and females (1.07%; 95% CI = 0.51–1.95). Statistical analysis revealed that males were more likely to be infected and to have high intensity infections of both forms of schistosomiasis. Pre-school age children (PSAC) were found to be less likely to be infected for either form of schistosomiasis in communities with low to medium prevalence of disease, however in Tomefa, where prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis is high, there was little difference in the prevalence of disease between PSAC, school-age children (SAC) and adults. Our study shows that there is a need to treat the wider community outside of the current morbidity control strategy of mass-drug administration to SAC.
