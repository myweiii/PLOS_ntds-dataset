The present study demonstrated that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes can be competent laboratory vectors for MAYV. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were refractory to MAYV. Regarding the viral dilution and nanoinjection, a higher detection sensitivity was observed after virus nanoinjection into na√Øve mosquitoes, indicating that only a few viral particles are required to infect mosquitoes, and these particles may not be detected by RT-qPCR before the nanoinjection procedure.
