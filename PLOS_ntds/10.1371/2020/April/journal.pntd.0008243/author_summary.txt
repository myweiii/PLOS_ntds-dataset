Infection with H. pylori, a substantial public health burden in the tropical countries, follows the similar mode of transmission analogous to Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED). There can be a complex interplay between H. pylori infection and EED–both of which can influence childhood growth–but the definite role of H. pylori infection contributing to EED and subsequent growth failure is poorly understood. In this study, the authors present data from an ongoing community-based nutrition intervention study and investigated the factors associated with H. pylori infection and identify its relationship with fecal biomarkers of EED and indicators of the nutritional status of the children hailing from a resource-poor urban settlement. They demonstrated the acquisition and persistence of H. pylori infection during early childhood. The study results also corroborate that infection with H. pylori had significant positive association with fecal Alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations and an inverse relationship with Reg1B concentrations measured in stool samples of the children. The findings revealed in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the role of H. pylori infection in contributing to EED as well as alteration of gut function in the early years of life.
