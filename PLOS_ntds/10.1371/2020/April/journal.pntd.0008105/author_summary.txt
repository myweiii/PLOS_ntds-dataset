Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is an understudied tick-borne virus that can cause a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from moderate to severe, and can be fatal. Cases have been reported in Asia, Africa and Europe, but the range of the vector continues to expand. Currently, our understanding of the host innate immune response to the virus remains limited. Our aim was to use RNA-seq, a type of next generation sequencing technology, to characterize the host immune response in liver cells as well as sequence the genome of the virus. Results identified numerous genes and pathways that were altered and served as proof of principle that the viral identification and evolution could be investigated from the same sample simultaneously. This study highlights the potential for this technique for both characterization of the virus as well as identification of host biomarkers that could be potential predictors of patient outcome. Additionally it may provide important information about pathogenesis prior to performing animal infection studies.
