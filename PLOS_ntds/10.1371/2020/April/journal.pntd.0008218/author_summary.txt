Haemonchus contortus is one of the most pathogenic nematodes of small ruminants in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. This parasite is responsible for anemia, edema, and death in young animal which can lead to billions of economic losses globally. Excretory and secretory products (ESPs) are produced by the parasite to modulate the immune response and to protect both parasite and the host. Th9 cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells producing IL-9 cytokine. Th9 cells were increasingly recognized for being important in immunity to intestinal infection with helminths. In this study, immunomodulatory effects of ESPs on PBMCs derived Th9 cells, IL-9 cytokine and TGF-β/Smad signalling were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Th9 cells production was significantly enhanced on 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, and 28 Days Post Infection (DPI), while no effect was observed at 0 and 3 DPI in vivo. Moreover, the production of IL-9 and TGF-β/Smad Pathway key genes increased gradually from 7 to 28 DPI in vivo. After deworming, production of Th9 cells was gradually decreased in each group.
