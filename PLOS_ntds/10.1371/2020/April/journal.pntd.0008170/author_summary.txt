Guinea worm is a parasite that causes profoundly debilitating disease in humans. An eradication program has been successful in nearly eliminating the disease from people. However, the same worm has now been found in domestic dogs and the frequency of detecting Guinea worm in dogs has been increasing. This means that to eradicate Guinea worm, the infection must be eliminated in dogs as well as in people. However, not much is known about the disease in dogs. This study is the first to investigate dog ecology in relation to Guinea worm infection. We worked in the worst-affected country, Chad. We attached GPS collars to dogs to track their ranging and use of water bodies and analysed their diets using a forensic technique, based on analysing stable isotope compostion of their whiskers and potential food items. We showed that dogs living in households that provided water to their animals had a lower risk of having had Guinea worm and that dogs that ate more fish had an increased risk. These findings suggest there is a classical route for worm transmission in dogs, via drinking contaminated water, as well as a novel route, potentially by eating fish carrying a source of infection.
