Buruli ulcer (BU) is a debilitating skin infection caused by M. ulcerans. It is the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy. BU is mainly restricted to the tropical and subtropical countries of the world, though temperate regions report sporadic cases. Polymerase chain reaction targeting IS2404 is the gold standard for M. ulcerans disease diagnosis and other methods such as histopathology, acid fast staining and microscopy are used for validity checks. The currently approved diagnostic tools lack sensitivity and specificity and there are many resource challenges in underdeveloped regions. Isolation and culture of the bacillus from tissue biopsies is the only method that detects viable cells. However, the long incubation period of the pathogen makes it not ideal and rapid enough for point-of-care diagnosis. Cell-mediated immunity and serology-based methods have been suggested as appropriate tools for accurate and rapid testing for the disease within “at-risk-communities”. This study systematically reviewed and conducted a meta-analysis on all research aimed at developing cell-mediated immunity and/or serology-based tests for M. ulcerans disease.
