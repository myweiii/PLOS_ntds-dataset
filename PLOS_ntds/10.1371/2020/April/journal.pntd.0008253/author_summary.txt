Leishmaniasis is a set of diseases caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted through the bites of infected phlebotomine sand fly females during blood ingestion. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean region and dog is the primary domestic reservoir, although we can not ignore the role that wild reservoirs can have under certain conditions. As for the role of the human host in the transmission of the disease is not fully understood. The present work explores this important epidemiological aspect to try to clarify it. The study concludes that asymptomatic infected individuals and the immunocompetent patients treated for VL have no epidemiological impact in the transmission of L. infantum. As for the immunocompetent patients with untreated active VL its impact is limited, whilst immunosupressed patients are the most infectious towards sand flies. Thus, the screening for latent Leishmania infection in HIV-infected patients is recommended in scenarios where transmission occurs.
