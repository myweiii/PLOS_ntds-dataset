Leishmaniasis is a spectrum of diseases caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. It is transmitted by sand fly insect vectors and is responsible for an enormous burden of human suffering. In this manuscript we examine Leishmania isolates from Ethiopia that cause the most serious form of the disease, namely visceral leishmaniasis, which is usually fatal without treatment. Historically the general view was that such parasites reproduce clonally, so that their progeny are genetically identical to the founding cells. This view has changed over time and it is increasingly clear that recombination between genetically different Leishmania parasites occurs. The implication is that new biological traits such as virulence, resistance to drug treatments or the ability to infect new species of sand fly could emerge. The frequency and underlying mechanism of such recombination in natural isolates is poorly understood. Here we perform a detailed whole genome analysis on a cohort of hybrid isolates from Ethiopia together with their potential parents to assess the genetic nature of hybrids in more detail. Results reveal a complex pattern of mating and inbreeding indicative of multiple mating events that has likely shaped the epidemiology of the disease agent. We also show that some hybrids have very different relative amounts of DNA (polysomy) the implications of which are discussed. Together the results contribute to a fuller understanding of the nature of genetic recombination in natural populations of Leishmania.
