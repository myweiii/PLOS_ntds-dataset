Mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being deployed into the field where they can suppress mosquito populations and reduce dengue transmission. These programs rely on the use of Wolbachia strains that have desirable phenotypes, which can include deleterious fitness effects, reproductive manipulation and virus blocking. However, theory predicts that Wolbachia will evolve to become less costly to their hosts, reducing the effectiveness of these programs. We investigate the potential for evolutionary changes by performing a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of a deleterious Wolbachia strain, wMelPop-PGYP, that was introduced to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from Drosophila over ten years ago. In contrast to theoretical expectations and research from Drosophila, our results suggest that Wolbachia strains with deleterious effects may have stable phenotypes, ensuring their long-term effectiveness if released into natural populations.
