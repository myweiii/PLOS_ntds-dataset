The annual number of reported cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness (SS), is currently below 1,000 cases worldwide. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the most affected country, and Uganda, which shares a border with DRC, are both endemic for gambiense HAT (gHAT). The main strategy to control gHAT is screening of at-risk individuals, followed by diagnosis and treatment of confirmed cases. However, this strategy and even the passive screening as currently implemented become less efficient with declining incidence, justifying innovative strategies to efficiently detect the remaining cases. All areas where gHAT occurs are also endemic for malaria, presenting an opportunity to integrate gHAT screening activities within malaria control activities. This integration is warranted by the fact that in early disease stage, gHAT patients present with signs and symptoms strikingly similar to those of malaria. In order to use malaria diagnosis as an entry point to screen for gHAT, Standard Diagnostics (SD), Republic of Korea (now Abbott Diagnostics, Korea Incâ€“ADK) made a Combined prototype RDT for both malaria and gHAT, expected to be as accurate as the individual gHAT and malaria RDTs. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the Combined prototype RDT using whole blood samples collected in Uganda and DRC, and archived plasma samples collected in DRC, Angola and Central African Republic. We found that the Combined prototype performs just as well as individual RDTs.
