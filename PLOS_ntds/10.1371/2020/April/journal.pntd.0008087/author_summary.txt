Soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH) (e.g., Ascaris, hookworm, Trichuris) contribute to a large burden of disease among children in low- and middle-income countries. There is increasing interest in implementing large-scale deworming programs to eliminate STH in certain settings. Efforts to monitor whether local elimination has occurred require sensitive diagnostic tests that will not miss positive cases. Kato-Katz, a microscopy-based diagnostic test, has commonly been used to identify STH eggs in stool, but in settings where infection intensity is low, this method frequently misses positive samples because it requires visual identification of small numbers of eggs, and hookworm eggs may degrade prior to visualization. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a molecular diagnostic method for detecting STH. It may detect more low intensity infections than Kato-Katz because it identifies STH DNA in stool; DNA can be detected in very small quantities and is less likely to degrade than STH ova. Thus, qPCR is likely to be more accurate than Kato-Katz. This study compared the performance of double-slide Kato-Katz and qPCR using 2,799 stool samples from children aged 2â€“12 years in a setting in rural Bangladesh with predominantly low STH infection intensity. qPCR was more sensitive than Kato-Katz for hookworm and Trichuris infections. 26% of samples were classified as Ascaris positive by Kato-Katz and negative by qPCR. DNA sequencing of 10 samples confirmed that Ascaris was absent in samples classified as positive by Kato-Katz and negative by qPCR. We conclude that Kato-Katz likely produced false positive results for Ascaris and that qPCR had a higher sensitivity than double-slide Kato-Katz in this low infection intensity setting.
