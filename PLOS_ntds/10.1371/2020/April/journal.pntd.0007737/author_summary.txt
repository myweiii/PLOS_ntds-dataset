The decline of annual cases of West-African sleeping sickness in Uganda raises the prospect that elimination of the disease is achievable for the country. However, with the decrease in incidence and the likely subsequent change in priorities there is a need to confirm that the disease is truly eliminated. One unanswered question is the role that domestic animals play in maintaining transmission of the disease. The potential of cryptic-animal reservoirs is a serious threat to successful and sustained elimination of the disease. It is with the intent of resolving this question that we have carried out this study whereby we examined 2088 cattle, 400 pigs and 2184 tsetse for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the parasite responsible for the disease. Our study found T. brucei s.l. in local cattle, pigs and tsetse flies, with their respective prevalences as follows, 1.9%, 6.3% and 1.8%. Further analysis to establish identity of these positives to the sub-species level found that no cattle, pigs or tsetse were carrying the pathogen responsible for Gambian sleeping sickness. Our work highlights the difficulty of establishing the absence of a disease, especially in an extremely low endemic setting, and the limitations of some of the most commonly used methods.
