    "Abstract": "Leishmaniasis is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) which is closely associated with poverty and has gained much relevance recently due to its opportunistic coinfection with HIV. It is a protozoan zoonotic disease transmitted by a dipteran Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia/ Sergentomyia sandfly; during blood meals on its vertebrate intermediate hosts. It is a four-faceted disease with its visceral form being more deadly if left untreated. It is endemic across the tropics and sub-tropical regions of the world. It can be considered the third most important NTD after malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Currently, there are numerous drawbacks on the fight against leishmaniasis which includes: non-availability of vaccines, limited availability of drugs, high cost of mainstay drugs and parasite resistance to current treatments. In this study, we screened the antileishmanial activity, selectivity, morphological alterations, cell cycle progression and apoptotic potentials of six Pathogen box compounds from Medicine for Malaria Venture (MMV) against Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes. From this study, five of the compounds showed great promise as lead chemotherapeutics based on their high selectivity against the Leishmania donovani parasite when tested against the murine mammalian macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line (with a therapeutic index ranging between 19–914 (promastigotes) and 1–453 (amastigotes)). The cell cycle progression showed growth arrest at the G0-G1 phase of mitotic division, with an indication of apoptosis induced by two (2) of the pathogen box compounds tested. Our findings present useful information on the therapeutic potential of these compounds in leishmaniasis. We recommend further in vivo studies on these compounds to substantiate observations made in the in vitro study."
