Buruli ulcer (BU) is a devastating neglected tropical disease, whose worldwide notification to the WHO is currently on the rise. However, evidence has been so far conflicting as to the individual and clinical risk factors underlying the acquisition of the disease. Thus, considering the increasing body of literature made available in the last decade, it becomes essential to revisit this subject. To this aim, a temporal-unrestricted systematic review of published literature was undertaken in eight different online databases and meta-analysis conducted with clinical data. The randomized controlled trials and cohort studies reviewed supported the idea that male children or older adults are more susceptible to BU, BCG vaccination is insufficient to prevent BU in the mid-long term, and the prevalence of the disease is higher among HIV-infected individuals or carriers of genetic polymorphisms in SLC11A1. This knowledge, together with recommendations to tackle some drawbacks found within the reviewed studies, not only underlines the importance of searching for better vaccination alternatives, but also provides guidance for current and future screening and prevention programs.
