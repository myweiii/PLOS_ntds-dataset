SFTS is listed as one of the nine most infectious diseases on the WHO priority list. The transmission route and the factors driving the epidemic were complex. Ninety percent of worldwide cases have been reported from China, and Zhejiang Province in China has a high case fatality rate and a high incidence of SFTS. In our study, we found that the numbers of affected counties increased year by year, and the interval from illness onset to confirmation in SFTS was still too long. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity in the risk factors driving the transmission of SFTS was detected. In addition, the range of suitable weather values for the transmission of SFTS was identified. This suggests that targeted preventive efforts should be made in different areas based on the main factor contributing to the epidemic. In particular, early measures several months ahead of the suitable season for the occurrence of SFTS should be implemented. Enhancement of the level of reporting and diagnosis of this disease should strengthen ongoing research with the incorporation of more risk factors.
