Insecticide resistance is a global threat for the control of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of aboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (NaV), known as kdr, are one of the principal mechanisms related to resistance to pyrethroids, the class of insecticide most employed worldwide inside and around residences. We investigate whether the same kdr mutations found in Ae. aegypti populations from distinct regions of the world have a common origin and subsequently dispersed or if they emerged in unrelated populations at distinct moments. By evaluating the sequences of two fragments of the NaV gene, obtained from DNA collections of Ae. aegypti from several countries, we found at least two independent origins for the F1534C kdr mutation in American, African and Asian populations. There was no evidence for multiple origins of the common kdr mutations V1016I and P989S + V1016G, which were exclusive to American and Asian populations. Our results increase our knowledge of insecticide resistance evolution in one of the main arboviral mosquito vectors of major global diseases.
