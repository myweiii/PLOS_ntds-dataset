Number of emerging arboviruses involved in human infections has increased considerably in the past years. Among them, Usutu virus (USUV) is an African mosquito-borne virus first isolated in South Africa that recently emerged. USUV infection in humans is considered to be most often asymptomatic or to cause mild clinical signs. Nonetheless, increased cases of neurological complications such as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis have been reported in Europe but the mechanisms behind this neuropathogenesis remain largely unclear. In this study we showed that USUV can infect efficiently several organs and cells of the central nervous system associated with a drastic inflammation and various deleterious effects. Our results contribute to the characterization of the neurotropism related to USUV infection.
