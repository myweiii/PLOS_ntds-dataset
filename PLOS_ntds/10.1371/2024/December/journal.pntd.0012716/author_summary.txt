Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus, and treatments often rely on drugs like Amphotericin B (AmB). This study focuses on Leishmania orientalis, a newly recognized species, to better understand its molecular responses to AmB, which could shed light on drug resistance mechanisms. Using advanced genomic and transcriptomic techniques, the authors analyzed how L. orientalis responds to AmB treatment over 72 hours. Interestingly, while there were no significant changes in chromosomal structure, the authors observed differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression patterns. The control group showed more genetic variability than the treated group, and several key genes involved in critical cellular functions were downregulated after treatment. These findings suggest that L. orientalis might regulate its genetic and molecular machinery in complex ways to survive drug exposure. By unraveling these mechanisms, this research contributes to understanding Leishmania biology and supports the development of more effective treatments for this neglected disease.
