    "Introduction": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine multi-drug therapy (MDT) for the treatment of leprosy. Severe adverse effects include dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome, skin pigmentation, haemolytic anaemia, and hepatitis. At the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), London, United Kingdom monthly rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline (mROM) is used as first line treatment for leprosy.",
    "Objectives": "To determine the clinical outcomes and experiences of individuals treated with mROM.",
    "Methods": "A retrospective study of individuals with leprosy who were prescribed mROM at HTD was conducted. Demographic and clinical data were collected on outcomes including relapses, leprosy reactions, bacterial index (BI) and adverse effects. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to understand their experiences of mROM.",
    "Results": "29 individuals were identified and 20 interviewed. 26 (89.7%) individuals completed monthly mROM. 9 (31%) had switched from WHO MDT to mROM (five of whom (55.6%) were interviewed). BI reduced significantly following mROM treatment (p = 0.04). 17 individuals (58.6%) experienced a leprosy reaction. One of the 29 (3.4%) relapsed. The relapse rate was 9.5/1000 person years. 49 reports of adverse effects were either mild or moderate. The most frequent adverse effect (14/49) reported was orange discolouration of urine. No adverse effect required hospitalisation or discontinuation of mROM. Most individuals reported that skin lesions improved by the time they had completed mROM.",
    "Conclusions": "In this small study in a non-endemic setting mROM was safe, effective and acceptable. mROM therapy is associated with improvement in skin lesions, decline in bacterial index and acceptable adverse effects. Larger, prospective, randomised studies are needed to determine whether relapse rates with mROM are equivalent or better than WHO MDT and to provide robust data on the seemingly better adverse effect profile of mROM."
