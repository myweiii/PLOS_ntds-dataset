Leprosy is a chronic disabling infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Anti-bacterial treatment with rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is effective but associated with significant adverse effects.
We report the effectiveness of monthly rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline in 29 individuals which was not associated with severe adverse effects. The monthly antimicrobial regime can be directly observed during routine clinical assessment reducing issues of adherence.
Alternative antibacterial regimes for leprosy, including newer anti-mycobacterial agents and monthly dosing, should be compared to the WHO recommended standard of care in well-designed randomised controlled trials to assess efficacy and safety.
