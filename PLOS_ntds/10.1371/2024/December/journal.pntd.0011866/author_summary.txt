The prevention and clinical management of type 1 reactions (T1R) remain an important unmet need to reduce nerve damage in leprosy patients. It is not known why 30â€“50% of leprosy patients will develop T1R. This knowledge gap underlies the need for a better mechanistic understanding of T1R that could lead to biomarker candidates to identify leprosy patients who are at high risk of developing T1R. Here, we used a prospective design in which leprosy patients were enrolled before the onset of T1R.Whole blood samples were obtained at enrollment, aliquots were left unstimulated or were stimulated M. leprae antigens and total RNA was extracted. Patients were followed for three years at which time 10 out of 32 participants had developed T1R. Subsequent transcript expression and usage analyses revealed that groups differed little in their isoform landscape at baseline. Following stimulation, transcriptomic response differences became pronounced. Transcripts with higher response in T1R group preferentially involved genes of intracellular defense and inflammatory pathways. Among these transcripts, non-coding ones had higher frequency in T1R. Our study provided new insights into the T1R pathogenesis by suggesting a role for non-coding transcripts into the immune dysregulations of T1R and providing additional candidate genes and their isoforms to be further investigated.
