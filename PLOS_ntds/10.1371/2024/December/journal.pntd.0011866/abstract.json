    "Abstract": "Leprosy is a chronic disease of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae. A major public health and clinical problem are leprosy reactions, which are inflammatory episodes that often contribute to nerve damage and disability. Type I reversal reactions (T1R) can occur after microbiological cure of leprosy and affect up to 50% of leprosy patients. Early intervention to prevent T1R and, hence, nerve damage, is a major focus of current leprosy control efforts. In a prospective study, we enrolled and collected samples from 32 leprosy patients before the onset of T1R. Whole blood aliquots were challenged with M. leprae sonicate or media and total RNA was extracted. After a three-year follow-up, the transcriptomic response was compared between cells from 22 patients who remained T1R-free and 10 patients who developed T1R during that period. Our analysis focused on differential transcript (i.e. isoform) expression and usage. Results showed that, at baseline, cells from T1R-destined and T1R-free subjects had no main difference in their transcripts expression and usage. However, the cells of T1R patients displayed a transcriptomic immune response to M. leprae antigens that was significantly different from the one of cells from leprosy patients who remained T1R-free. Transcripts with significantly higher upregulation in the T1R-destined group, compared to the cells from T1R-free patients, were enriched for pathways and GO terms involved in response to intracellular pathogens, apoptosis regulation and inflammatory processes. Similarly, transcript usage analysis pinpointed different transcript proportions in response to the in-vitro challenge of cells from T1R-destined patients. Hence, transcript usage in concert with transcript expression suggested a dysregulated inflammatory response including increased apoptosis regulation in the peripheral blood cells of T1R-destined patients before the onset of T1R symptoms. Combined, these results provided detailed insight into the pathogenesis of T1R."
