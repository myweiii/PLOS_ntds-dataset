Sylvatic yellow fever virus (YFV) is endemic in the Amazon Basin, where it is transmitted between non-human primates (NHP) by arboreal mosquitoes. Due to their high susceptibility to YFV, neotropical NHP are sentinels for YF. One of the arms of the yellow fever surveillance program in Brazil is passive monitoring of ill or deceased NHPs. Although samples from NHP carcasses are usually suitable for molecular tests, they are not suitable for serological assays limiting epidemiological investigations. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the use of liver homogenates as alternative sample for the investigation of antibodies against arboviruses. Using liver homogenates from experimentally infected mice, we observed neutralizing activity against YFV, Mayaro virus (MAYV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), by plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT), indicating the presence of antibodies against these viruses. Next, we produced liver homogenates from NHP carcasses collected during YF outbreaks in Brazil and investigated the presence of antibodies against YFV using the adapted PRNT and rapid lateral flow tests for anti-YFV IgM. We detected neutralizing activity and IgM against YFV using liver homogenates from NHP carcasses previously confirmed to be infected with YFV. The results indicate that the use of liver homogenates can potentially contribute to serological surveillance endeavors, particularly when sera are not available.
