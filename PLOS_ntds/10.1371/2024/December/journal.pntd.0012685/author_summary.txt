Food-borne trematodiases constitute an important group of the neglected tropical diseases caused by Opisthorchis felineus, O. viverrini, and Clonorchis sinensis liver fluke infections. These parasites affect the hepatobiliary system of mammals, including humans, by inducing cholangitis, bile duct neoplasia, and even cholangiocarcinoma in chronically infected individuals. Two species, O. viverrini and C. sinensis, are recognized group 1A biological carcinogens to humans, whereas O. felineus is classified as a noncarcinogen. Mechanisms of formation of the cholangiocarcinoma associated with helminth infection remain unknown. We focused on the research into early events that lead to precancerous changes. Here we examined differences in genome-wide profiles of liver gene expression and activation of cellular pathways in Mesocricetus auratus hamsters infected with C. sinensis (South Korea), O. viverrini (Thailand), or O. felineus (Russia) at 1 and 3 months after infection initiation. Infections with C. sinensis and O. felineus mostly featured development of periductal fibrosis accompanied by a huge inflammatory response in the liver. O. viverrini infection, however, showed severer hyperplasia and biliary-intraepithelial-neoplasia lesions. Thus, these related food-borne trematodes have species-specific effects on the liver during infection, which likely contribute to the differences in carcinogenic potential among these trematodes.
