Hepatitis E virus spreads through fecal to oral transmission, primarily via contaminated water. The virus can impair liver function and causes frequent outbreaks of acute jaundice in Nepal. Diagnostic tests are often not accessible, meaning many cases of hepatitis E go undetected and it is difficult to know how many people are affected or where to target interventions to protect those most at risk. However, infections can be detected retrospectively by looking for long-lasting antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus. We looked for these antibodies in blood specimens collected from a population representative sample of individuals across Nepal and found that, overall, around 1 in 5 people had likely been infected previously. Risk of past infection varied across the three ecological regions of Nepal and was higher in Hilly and Mountain regions than in the southern Terai. We fitted a geospatial model to our data to map the predicted risk across the country and found it to be highest in Kathmandu, with up to half the population previously infected. This research demonstrates the scale of hepatitis E virus infections in Nepal and identified parts of the Hilly region–particularly Kathmandu–as areas where people are most at risk.
