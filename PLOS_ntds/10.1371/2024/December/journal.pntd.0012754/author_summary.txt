We described the emergence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in a new region of France and its co-circulation with Usutu Virus (USUV), another zoonotic mosquito-borne virus. Although infections with both viruses can often be asymptomatic, they have the potential to cause severe and potentially fatal illnesses affecting the central nervous system, especially in vulnerable human populations. Our goal was to address the challenges of early detection and efficient surveillance of these viruses. We used an efficient and cost-effective method (ie. Molecular Xenomonitoring (MX)) that tests excreta shed by a community of trapped mosquito for viral RNA to reveal the presence of a new focus of arbovirus circulation. Traditional surveillance methods, which rely heavily on monitoring human and animal infections, provide late indicators of viral presence. Early detection is crucial for enabling timely public health interventions to protect vulnerable groups, such as implementing systematic viral RNA screening of blood and organ donors. MX simplifies logistics, requires no specialized skills, and enables early detection of virus circulation, facilitating timely public health interventions. Our findings demonstrated MXâ€™s effectiveness in identifying significant WNV and USUV circulation in a newly affected area of France, providing crucial genomic data and improving virus monitoring efforts.
