Onchocerciasis is a disease called River Blindness and transmitted by the bites of infected blackflies that reproduction is in high-flow streams. This disease affects the skin (itching and nodules) and eyes (redness and even blindness). An effective treatment is ivermectin. Human activities near rivers contribute to the disease. Also, good coverage of ivermectin intake by the population considerably reduces the number of people affected. The question we asked ourselves was: why, after more than 20 years of community-based distribution of ivermectin in the Central African Republic, is onchocerciasis still being transmitted? The study showed that in both the savannah and the forest, men are particularly at risk, not only because of their activities near rivers, but also because they do not protect their bodies as women do. We found a higher number of people affected in rural areas than in urban areas. In the community that adheres to ivermectin use, the number of people affected decreases. We recommended that the national onchocerciasis control programme take into account the habits of the population in order to plan and monitor their control activities (for example: increase the number of days ivermectin is distributed, and the number of days community awareness is raised).
