As cases of Hansen’s disease decrease globally, areas with high endemicity still struggle to control infections. In Brazil, which has the second highest burden of disease globally, new measures are necessary to reach elimination. Not only are geographic information systems (GIS) important tools to describe the heterogeneity of infectious diseases on a finer scale, it can also be used to study the overlap of two different endemic infections. Due to several studies showing potential associations between helminth infection and Hansen’s disease, this study explores a co-endemic helminth infection (Schistosoma mansoni) as a potential factor in the continued transmission of leprosy. Our objective was to spatially analyze these two diseases and identify potential epidemiologic associations in 41 municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our study found the risk of MB disease was over 1.5 time greater in census tracts with reported schistosomiasis than in tracts without, adjusted for socioeconomic and environmental factors. We also identified several clusters of schistosomiasis and MB disease. While these findings can provide immediate data for control programs to utilize, it also calls for further studies on the interplay of co-infections in the manifestations of HD that may shed light on ongoing transmission in highly endemic areas.
