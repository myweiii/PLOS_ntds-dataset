Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is one of the twenty neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect more than one billion people worldwide. Aligned with global initiatives to eliminate LF, India initiated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) trials in limited population groups in the 1980s. Since 2004, the Indian government has implemented repeated MDA campaigns to further this goal. Despite these efforts, LF has not yet been eliminated. Although vector control (VC) is proposed to augment regular MDA to help eliminate LF, little is known about the increased impact or costs. Our study compares the costs of MDA alone to the combination of MDA with alternative VC interventions. For each intervention, we calculated both program operating costs and costs to communities. We found MDA to be very effective (better than initially expected) and cost-effective for eliminating LF. However, against the low endemicity at the study site in the study’s final year from MDA alone, the study had limited ability to detect any possible further reductions in MfP or AgP. We found no significant incremental improvements from VC in our study’s setting compared to MDA.
