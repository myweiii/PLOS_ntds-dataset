Leprosy is a bacterial infection caused by the Mycobacterium leprae. It mainly affects the skin, nerves and eyes leading to loss of sensation and dryness of the skin, blindness and deformity of fingers of the hands and feet. These visible physical health problems on affected individuals limits their daily activities and impedes their social interaction due to associated stigma and discrimination. The authors of this study examined a five-year data of newly diagnosed leprosy patients at ALERT Hospital in Ethiopia between 2016 and 2020.Disability caused by leprosy in Ethiopia, regionally and globally was assessed. In addition, interview was conducted with health professionals and leprosy experts. The number of patients with Grade 2 Disability, the highest level of leprosy disability, is not decreasing worldwide. At ALERT Hospital, 33% of diagnosed patients had Grade 2 Disability. The interviews also revealed gaps in disability counting and reporting. This study highlights that disability among newly diagnosed leprosy patients is not decreasing globally and even increasing in countries like Ethiopia where the disease is common. Therefore, more emphasis should be given in equipping health professionals in properly evaluating disability and standard definitions in assessing and counting disability should be used across leprosy programmes.
