Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness globally and is caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma programs use the indicator trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular (TF) to monitor the progress of trachoma control efforts in endemic regions. However, TF is an imperfect indicator of trachoma transmission, and alternative indicators may be useful for monitoring trachoma. We evaluated the prevalence of TF, C. trachomatis as measured by PCR, and serologic markers of trachoma in an area of Niger with low prevalence of TF. We found little evidence of ongoing transmission of C. trachomatis, as evidenced by low prevalence of C. trachomatis and low seroprevalence of trachoma markers, suggesting that ongoing antibiotic distribution for trachoma may not be required in this region.
