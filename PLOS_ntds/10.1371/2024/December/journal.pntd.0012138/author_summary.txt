Aedes aegypti transmits diseases including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. This vector has developed resistance to several insecticides used in vector control interventions. Resistance data for Ae. aegypti in Africa remain sparse, and the evolution of insecticide resistance is still under-investigated. We undertook three-years of monitoring of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti and the associated kdr mutations in two localities of Burkina Faso. Larvae were collected from two different breeding sites, tyres and drums, from both localities. Insecticide bioassay susceptibility tests to commonly used insecticides were performed in the laboratory. The results revealed escalating resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, supported by increasing frequencies of the 1016I and 410L kdr mutations, while the 1534C mutation is fixed. Interestingly, Ae. aegypti populations in both areas remained susceptible to bendiocarb, fenitrothion, and malathion, providing a conservative option of organophosphates for Ae. aegypti control in Burkina Faso. These data provide important results to support decisions on dengue vector control.
