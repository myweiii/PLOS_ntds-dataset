In the present study, we obtained isolates of Toxoplasma gondii from chickens from the Amazon region. Adult free-range chickens were acquired from 29 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon region including Acre (n = 9), Amapá (n = 6), Amazonas (n = 6), Pará (n = 6), and Roraima (n = 2) states and from two municipalities in Peru, three in Bolivia, one in Guyana, and one in Venezuela. Heart, brain, and blood samples were collected from 401 chickens. We detected anti-T. gondii serum antibodies in 273 (68.1%) chickens using the Modified Agglutination Test (MAT ≥ 5), and bioassays in mice were performed using 220 birds. We obtained 116 (52.7%) isolates from chickens with antibody titers ≥ 20. Of these isolates, 93 (84.5%) were considered virulent to mice. We genetically analyzed the 116 isolates using multilocus nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (Mn-nPCR-RFLP) and microsatellites (MS). PCR-RFLP analysis revealed 42 genetic types and MS analysis revealed 83 genetic types. When we analyzed and compared T. gondii from current and previously reported isolates, using PCR-RFLP data, we observed a clear indication of geographical separation of T. gondii population in the Amazon region versus the Southeastern region of Brazil. This study emphasizes the importance of genetic diversity and high mouse-virulence of the parasite in the Amazon region.
