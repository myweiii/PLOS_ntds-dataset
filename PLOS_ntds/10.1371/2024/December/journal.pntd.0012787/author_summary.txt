The way insects respond to host odours is a key aspect for understanding how they interact with their hosts and associated pathogens. Such studies are mainly performed by assessing the attraction or repellence of these arthropods towards host emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, we investigated how Phlebotomus perniciosus reacts to host odours. For this, 28 compounds isolated from humans and dogs were assessed by antennal stimulus and odour choice by sand flies. Fourteen compounds elicited high antennal responses in female sand flies, being those VOCs selected for the behavioural assays. From the 14 compounds tested in the Y-tube olfactometer, nonanal was significantly attractive for P. perniciosus females, whereas myrcene and p-cymene acted as repellents (p < 0.05). Data herein obtained highlight the role of olfactory cues routing host seeking behaviour in P. perniciosus, with implications to develop sustainable sand fly monitoring and control, in leishmaniasis endemic areas.
