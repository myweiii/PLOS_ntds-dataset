Parasites of the genus Leishmania cause a series of neglected tropical diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis. Many isolates of these parasites possess Leishmania RNA viruses (LRVs) of the family Pseudototiviridae that increase a chance of developing more severe mucocutaneous leishmaniasis over the cutaneous form, facilitate the spread of leishamaniae, and make these flagellates more resistant to treatments. In this work, we demonstrate that pseudototiviruses are not the only infecting agents and some isolates of Leishmania may harbor other viruses, exemplified by the leishbuvirus LbrLBV1 of L. braziliensis. Because they may also be considered as potential factors of virulence, we advocate for routine testing of leishmanial strains for the presence of not only LRVs, but also other RNA viruses.
