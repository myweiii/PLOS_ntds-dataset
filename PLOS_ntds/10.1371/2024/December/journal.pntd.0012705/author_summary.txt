Advancements in molecular parasitology have led to the discovery of novel Babesia species/genotypes, including Babesia aktasi, identified in goats in the Mediterranean region of TÃ¼rkiye. Host resistance against blood protozoa such as Babesia and Theileria exhibits different behaviors, but there is a lack of information about host resistance against Babesia spp. in goats and sheep. The pathogenicity of B. aktasi in local breeds has been revealed in previous studies. There may be differences in susceptibility to Babesia parasites between different breeds of the same host species. To better understand the biology of B. aktasi, its pathogenesis and virulence were revealed by experimental infection in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent purebred Saanen goats. Saanen goats in both groups were infected with fresh blood infected with B. aktasi and a rapid increase in parasitemia was observed. Both groups experienced severe clinical infection, resulting in mortality. Significant changes in hematological and biochemical parameters compared to pre-infection levels were noted in both groups, revealing that B. aktasi is highly pathogenic for purebred Saanen goats. It is a step forward in elucidating the biology of B. aktasi and provides a basis for future studies to develop effective control strategies against caprine babesiosis.
