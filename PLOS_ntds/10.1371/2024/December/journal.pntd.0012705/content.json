    "Introduction": "Babesia is a genus of intra-erythrocytic protozoan parasites in various parts of the world, where the responsible vector ticks are prevalent [1\u20133]. Since the first discovery of Babesia in 1888, many species, subspecies or genotypes have been described that infect domestic and wild mammals, some of which also have zoonotic character [4]. Typically, Babesia parasites cause serious clinical signs characterized by high fever, hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), icterus, hemoglobinuria, and in severe cases, death [5]. Babesia ovis, B. motasi and B. crassa are the main Babesia spp. responsible for small ruminant babesiosis [3,6,7]. Of these, B. ovis is one of the first identified Babesia spp. caused by clinical infection with high mortality in tropical and subtropical countries [8\u201310].\nIn light of advances in molecular parasitology in recent years, novel species or genotypes have been added to the blood protozoans belonging to the Babesia genus. In this context, Babesia lengau-like, Babesia sp. Xinjiang and B. motasi-like complex have been reported to cause babesiosis in small ruminants [6,11\u201313]. Studies based on apicoplast and mitochondrial genome analyses revealed that the parasites in the B. motasi-like group were divided into two different branches, one branch includes Babesia sp. Lintan and Babesia sp. Tianzhu, while the other includes Babesia sp. Hebei and Babesia sp. Ningxian [14,15]. In a recent study based on molecular methods, we have identified a novel Babesia sp. that is distinct from other Babesia pathogens [16]. According to Robert Koch\u2019s postulates [17], then, in vivo isolation of the newly identified Babesia sp. was made from a naturally infected goat, and named Babesia aktasi [18]. In our large molecular survey carried out in the Mediterranean region of T\u00fcrkiye, it was detected that 22.5% of the goats (113/503) were infected with the parasite [19]. Then, an experimental study performed on the immunocompetent goats revealed that B. aktasi did not cause typical clinical findings of babesiosis (anemia, icterus, hemoglobinuria) except for increased body temperature [20].\nT\u00fcrkiye serves as a vast land bridge between European and Asian countries, where ovine babesiosis is significant due to the favorable geographical and climatic conditions that support the maintenance of vector ticks [21]. This disease is the most common parasitic infection that seriously affects the health of sheep and goats in T\u00fcrkiye, leading to substantial economic losses because of the costs associated with control and treatment [7,9]. The recent nationwide epidemiological study conducted in T\u00fcrkiye indicates that the distribution and prevalence of ovine babesiosis can vary regionally [22]. In particular, the disease is reported to be more prevalent in the Central and Southeastern Anatolia regions of T\u00fcrkiye [22]. Babesia ovis, B. crassa, and B. motasi have been molecularly identified in small ruminant and ixodid ticks in T\u00fcrkiye [19,23\u201326].\nHost resistance to blood protozoans such as Babesia and Theileria involves a complex interplay of various immune responses [27,28]. The host resistance to these parasites can vary among different host species and even among individuals within a species [29]. The pathogenicity of these parasites is expected to be higher in purebred breeds than in native breeds. It has been reported that purebred Bos indicus cattle show higher levels of resistance to babesiosis than Bos taurus [30]. The pathogenicity of B. aktasi in purebred Saanen goats is unknown. It is important to conduct pathogenicity studies to comprehensively understand the ability of B. aktasi to cause clinical disease in purebred goats. Therefore, an experimental study using fresh B. aktasi-infected blood was performed to assess pathogenicity and virulence of the parasite in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent purebred Saanen goats.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nThis study was approved by the F\u0131rat University Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (session number: 2021/12).\n\n\nResearch material\nThe stabilate of B. aktasi, as previously described by Ozubek et al. [20], was used in this study. An indigenous goat was experimentally infected with the stabilate. When parasitemia (PPE) reached 9.2\u201311.5%, jugular venous blood was collected into vacutainer tubes coated with EDTA. Infected red blood cells were cryopreserved with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 5 mL aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen. In this study, these batches of stabilates were used for the experimental infection of indigenous donors to obtain fresh blood infected with B. aktasi.\n\n\nSelection of purebred Saanen goats for experimental infection\nThe sample size required to detect a significant difference between two independent groups was determined through a priori power analysis using the G*Power program (Version 3.1.9.3) before starting the experiments [31]. A one-tailed t-test was selected with an effect size (d) of 1.5 and a significance level (\u03b1) of 0.05. The required sample size was determined to be 7 animals per group, for a total of 14 animals. The actual power achieved with this sample size was 0.841.\nThe representative design of the experimental infection conducted in this study is shown in Fig 1.\na) Selection of tick-borne pathogen-free (Babesia spp. Theileria spp., Anaplasma spp.) purebred Saanen and indigenous goats; b) Infection of the immunosuppressed indigenous donors with B. aktasi stabilates (PPE 9.2\u201311.5%) to obtain the fresh infected blood for the infection of immunosuppressed and immunocompetent Saanen goats. Fig 1 was created with BioRender.com (www.biorender.com).\nPrior to experimental infection, 5 mL of whole blood were collected in vacutainer tubes containing EDTA from 5-month-old purebred Saanen (n = 22) and indigenous male goats (n = 15) from B. aktasi-free breeding farms in Elazig province. A small amount of peripheral blood was taken from the ear vein of each goat using a sterile needle to prepare thin blood smears. The samples were brought to the laboratory at the F\u0131rat University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Parasitology. Thin blood smears and DNA isolated from EDTA blood samples were screened for the presence of Babesia spp., Theileria spp., and Anaplasma spp. using microscopy and nested PCR [19,24]. Seventeen male goats (14 purebred Saanen, 3 indigenous goats) that tested negative for the selected pathogens were purchased and maintained at the Ministry of Agriculture, Elaz\u0131\u011f Veterinary Control Institute, small ruminant unit. It was ensured that the goats were of similar age, weight, and sex to minimize variables affecting on the results of experimental study. Each of the goats maintained at the unit were raised in a separate tick-free pen, and kept in quarantine for 3 weeks. In order to eliminate tick exposure, the goats were treated with Flumethrin 1% pour-on (Ba-tick, BaVET, 10 mg Flumetrin, 100 mL, T\u00fcrkiye) every 21 days during the study. Following the quarantine period, microscopy and nested PCR were repeated, and it was confirmed that they were free of Babesia spp., Theileria spp., and Anaplasma spp.\n\n\nSplenectomy and post-operative care\nIn this study, a randomized controlled experimental infections were performed with two groups of purebred Saanen goats, one consisting of immunosuppressed (splenectomy + dexamethasone administered) goats (n = 7) and the other consisting of immunocompetent (spleen-intact + not dexamethasone applied) individuals (n = 7). The goats in the immunosuppressed group underwent splenectomy using standard anesthesia, analgesic and surgical techniques at F\u0131rat University Animal Hospital before the experimental infection [20,32]. Splenectomized goats were maintained in separate pens throughout the experiment. As post-operative care, the goats were stabilized by administering intravenous 0.9% physiological saline (250 mL) and 5% dextrose (250 mL) once a day for 2 days. In order to prevent possible bacterial infections, a 5-day course of intramuscular antibiotic treatment was administered after splenectomy. Additionally, antibiotic spray (Neocaf, MSD, Oxytetracycline, aerosol spray suspension, 200 mL, USA) was applied to the surgical wound every day for a week. The rectal temperature and clinical symptoms were monitored every two days. The goats were also examined by microscopy and nested PCR for the presence of Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Anaplasma spp. twice a week.\n\n\nExperimental infection of immunosuppressed indigenous goats with B. aktasi stabilate\nIn our previous study, we demonstrated that the parasite has a high level of pathogenic effect in immunosuppressed indigenous goats [20]. Therefore, an immunosuppressed indigenous goats were used as donors to obtain a source of fresh blood infected with the parasite in this study. As seen in Fig 1, the B. aktasi stabilates with 9.2\u201311.5% PPE kept in the liquid nitrogen was thawed at 37\u00b0C, and 15 mL was intravenously inoculated to the donor goats (#Donor-1, #Donor-2, and #Donor-3). Following the parasite inoculation, dexamethasone was also intramuscularly injected to the donors as previously described [11,20]. Subsequent, the donors were monitored daily for the clinical and parasitological findings. When the PPE reached approximately 9.2% and 13.5% on the 12th day post-infection (DPI) in #Donor-1 and #Donor-2, respectively, and 12.3% on the 8th DPI in #Donor-3, venous blood was collected from the donors, and utilized for the experimental infection of the Saanen goats. Then, the donors received treatment with imidocarb dipropionate (0.1 mg/kg body weight IM, \u0130micarp, Teknovet, T\u00fcrkiye) and oxytetracycline (10 mg/kg bodyweight IM once daily for 5 days, Primamycin/LA, Zoetis, USA).\n\n\nExperimental infection of purebred Saanen goats with fresh blood infected with B. aktasi\nThree immunosuppressed Saanen goats (#Saanen-1, #Saanen-6 and #Saanen-7), and two immunocompetent (#Saanen-2, and #Saanen-3) were injected intravenously with 15 mL and 30 mL, respectively, of fresh blood infected with B. aktasi from the indigenous #Donor-1 (PPE 9.2%). Two immunocompetent Saanen goats (#Saanen-4, #Saanen-5) were each injected with 30 mL of fresh infected blood from the #Donor-2 (PPE 13.5%) (Fig 1). Similarly, two immunosuppressed Saanen goats (#Saanen-8 and #Saanen-9) and three immunocompetent Saanen goats (#Saanen-10, #Saanen-11, and #Saanen-12) were injected with 15 mL and 30 mL, respectively, of fresh blood infected with B. aktasi from #Donor-3 (PPE 12.3%) (Fig 1). Post-injection of the infected blood, rectal temperature, general physical condition and the presence of specific clinical signs of babesiosis (anemia, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria) were assessed daily for the duration of the experimental infections. Additionally, peripheral blood smears from the goats were daily prepared for microscopic examination. Blood samples from the jugular venous of each goat were also collected in EDTA and clot activator vacutainer tubes. The anticoagulated blood samples were utilized for hematological analysis and DNA extraction, while the sera were used for serum biochemical profiles.\n\n\nMicroscopic examination of peripheral blood smears\nThin blood smears from the peripheral blood were fixed with absolute methanol (Scharlau, Spain) for 5 minutes, then allowed to dry and stained with 10% Giemsa solution (Carlo Erba Reagents, France) for 30 minutes. The stained blood smears prepared from the goats were examined for the presence of intra-erythrocytic stages of Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Anaplasma spp. under BX43 light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 100X objective (x1000 magnification). Twenty microscope fields randomly selected from each of blood smear were scanned, and PPE was calculated as previously reported [20,32].\n\n\nDNA isolation and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nGenomic DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl whole-blood samples using a commercial DNA isolation kit (PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The DNA was stored at -20\u00b0C until PCR amplification. Babesia/Theileria [33,34], and Anaplasma [35,36] genus specific nested PCR protocols were used to amplify 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes, respectively. The PCR reaction and thermal cycling conditions were as described by Ozubek et al. [20]. In each PCR mixture, reference positive control DNAs for B. aktasi (OQ120434), T. ovis (EF092452), B. ovis (EF092454) and A. ovis (MG693754) available in our laboratory stocks and previously confirmed by sequencing were used. Distilled water and genomic DNA isolated from Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Anaplasma spp. free 1-month-old goat was used as negative controls. Ten \u03bcl of the PCR products were run on 1.4% agarose gel for 30 minutes. After electrophoresis, the agarose gel was stained with Ethidium Bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 minutes and examined on the Quantum Vilber Lourmat (France) gel imaging system.\n\n\nHematology and serum biochemistry\nHemogram and serum biochemistry analyzes were performed at before the experiment and from appearance to disappearance of intracellular parasites in blood smears. The following parameters were examined for hematological analysis: Red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin level (Hb), hematocrit level (HCT), white blood cell count (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and red cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD). The separated serum samples were analysed for estimation of biochemical parameters of Creatinine, Total protein, Albumin, Total bilirubin, Glucose, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and Gamma glutamyl aminotransferase (GGT). The hematology and serum biochemistry analyses were conducted at F\u0131rat University Animal Hospital using Mindray BC-5000 Vet and NX500 Auto Haematology Serum Biyochemistry Analysers (Bio-Medical Electronics Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China), respectively. Hematobiochemical changes in the experimentally infected goats were compared with pre-infection levels.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nA comparison of hemogram and serum biochemistry values was conducted between the immunosuppressed and immunocompetent Saanen goats. The SPSS package program (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21) was used for statistical analyses. The appropriateness of the data for parametric or non-parametric tests was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, while the homogeneity of variances was evaluated using the Bartlett test. For parameters subjected to pairwise comparisons and exhibiting a normal distribution, independent samples Student t-test was employed, whereas dependent samples t-test was used for dependent variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for samples not conforming to normal distribution. Data were presented as mean and standard error. The statistical significance level was set at p<0.05.",
    "Results": "Pathogenicity of B. aktasi in immunosuppressed Saanen goats\nAfter the injection of fresh blood infected with B. aktasi, all immunosuppressed goats developed severe clinical infection. Correlated with the appearance of intracellular parasites, an increase in rectal temperature up to 42.2\u00b0C was measured in the goats. Characteristic signs of clinical disease (anemia, jaundice and evident hemoglobinuria) were detected in all Saanen goats, however, it is noteworthy that the signs of anemia and jaundice were mild. In addition to these specific findings, the Saanen goats also exhibited general clinical signs such as lethargy, loss of appetite, teeth grinding, trembling, moaning, rapid breathing, immobility, and leaning their heads on the ground. The infection progressed rapidly, and all immunosuppressed Saanen goats died on the 4th day post-inoculation, except for one (#Saanen-9) that died on the 7th day. High PPE levels, ranging from 4.3% to 33.5%, were detected in the blood smears (Fig 2). Seven Saanen goats were initially selected for the immunosuppressed group. However, four goats (#Saanen-1, #Saanen-6, #Saanen-7, and #Saanen-8) died on the 4th day post-infection (DPI), and one goat (#Saanen-9) died on the 7th DPI due to severe clinical signs of babesiosis (Table 1). Following the deaths of these five animals, the remaining two goats were not experimentally infected for ethical reasons. This decision was made to minimize the number of animals used in accordance with ethical guidelines, while ensuring that sufficient data were obtained to address the study objectives.\n\n\nHigh Virulence of B. aktasi to immunocompetent Saanen goats\nAfter the inoculation, serious clinical infections resulting in death occurred in the immunocompetent Saanen goats. With the appearance of the intracellular parasite, an increase in rectal temperature up to 41.8\u00b0C was measured (Table 1). Specific clinical signs of babesiosis (anemia, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria) were observed in all the immunocompetent Saanen goats. Additionally, symptoms such as lethargy, loss of appetite, teeth grinding, tremors, rapid breathing, and inability to stand were observed in the goats. In the #Saanen-2, #Saanen-3, and #Saanen-12, improvement in clinical symptoms was observed along with the disappearance of parasites from peripheral blood on the 6th and 7th DPI, and the goats survived the acute disease. However, #Saanen-10 died on the 6th post-infection, followed by #Saanen-11 on the 7th, and both #Saanen-4 and #Saanen-5 on the 8th day, due to severe clinical infection. Peak PPE, ranging from 2.1% to 7.6%, was detected on the 3th DPI (Table 1).\n\n\nHematological and serum biochemical findings\nThe pre-infection and post-infection hematological and serum biochemical values in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent Saanen goats are summarized in Table 2.\nStatistical significance is indicated as follows: **** p<0.0001, *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05.\nSignificant changes in hematological parameters were observed in both experimental groups compared to pre-infection levels (Table 2 and Fig 3). The increase or decrease in hematological values was associated with the rise in PPE. A statistically significant decrease in RBC, WBC, HCT, and Hb values was observed in the both Saanen groups. An increase in MCV value was not statistically significant in immunosuppressed goats, whereas in the immunocompetent group was found to be significant. MCH value showed non-significant increase in the both groups. In the immunosuppressed group, a non-significant changes in MCHC and RDW-CV values was detected while significant increase was found in the immunocompetent goats. RDV-SD value showed significant increase in the both groups (Table 2 and Fig 3).\nComparison of hematological values between pre-infection and post-infection in immunosuppressed (A) and immunocompetent (B) Saanen goats. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: **** p<0.0001, *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, ns: not significant.\nIntra-erythrocytic stages of the parasite were first detected from the 1st DPI in all experimentally infected Saanen goats (Table 1 and Figs 4 and 5). An increase in rectal temperature ranging from 41.2\u00b0C to 42.2\u00b0C was observed in correlation with the appearance of the parasites. In all of the immunosuppressed Saanen goats, the peak PPE was observed on the day of death, while it was observed within 4 days following parasite inoculation in the immunocompetent goats. In both groups, a decrease in HCT, RBC, and Hb values was observed as PPE increased. However, as the infection duration was longer in immunocompetent goats, the decrease in HCT, RBC, and Hb values reached their lowest levels when PPE decreased to a level almost undetectable by light microscopy (Fig 5). In the goats that survived the acute disease (#Saanen-2, #Saanen-3, and #Saanen-12), an increase in HCT, RBC, and Hb values began from the 8th and 9th days after parasite inoculation. Due to the death of other goats, an increases in these values (HCT, RBC, Hb) could not be determined. (Figs 4 and 5).\nThere was a statistically significant increase in AST, ALT, GGT and total bilirubin values in the both infected groups compared to their pre-infection levels. However, albumin value exhibited a statistically significant reduction in the both infected groups. The decrease in total protein value and the increase in creatinine value were not significant in the immunosuppressed group, whereas but these changes were statistically significant in the immunocompetent group. The differences in glucose was not significant for any group (Table 2 and Fig 6).\nStatistical significance is indicated as follows: **** p<0.0001, *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, ns: not significant).\n\n\nNecropsy\nThree out of 5 dead goats (#Saanen-1, #Saanen-4, and #Saanen-5) were submitted for necropsy. During necropsy, severe pneumonia associated with edema in the lungs, accumulations of frothy exudate in the trachea, jaundice in subcutaneous and mesenteric adipose tissue and dark red urine (hemoglobinuria) in the urinary bladder were detected in the dead goats (Fig 7A, 7B and 7C).\nA, pulmonary edema, frothy fluid in the lung and trachea; B, jaundice in subcutaneous and mesenteric adipose tissue; C, dark red urine in the bladder (hemoglobinuria).",
    "Discussion": "Small ruminant babesiosis causes substantial economic losses in sheep and goat herds worldwide and remains classified as a neglected disease [3,32,33]. The primary causative agents of small ruminant babesiosis include B. ovis, B. motasi, and B. crassa [4]. One of the initially identified Babesia spp., B. ovis has been reported to cause clinical infections with high mortality in sheep under field conditions in the Southern Europe, Middle East, African and Asian countries [9,37\u201339]. Babesia crassa is non-pathogenic in sheep and goats, whereas B. motasi is considered moderately pathogenic [40]. The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of ovine babesiosis caused by B ovis are well-known, but there is a lack of information on caprine babesiosis [3,39,41,42]. In here, clinical, parasitological, hemotological and serum biochemical data from immunosuppressed and immunocompetent purebred Saanen goats were assessed to create a clear picture of the pathogenicity and virulence of newly identified B. aktasi. Our findings indicated that the novel B. aktasi was highly pathogenic to both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent purebred Saanen goats.\nStudies on host resistance against bovine Babesia spp. have shown that host genotype plays a significant role [27,28]. However, detailed information regarding genetic resistance to ovine Babesia spp. is not available [29]. In a previous study carried out by Malandrin et al. [43], B. divergens infection model in sheep was established. The study indicated that the sensitivity of sheep erythrocytes to B. divergens varied among different sheep breeds, and concluded that if erythrocytes were resistant to this parasite in vitro, it was difficult for sheep to become infected with B. divergens. An in vitro study conducted in China demonstrated that the Chinese Tan mutton breed sheep erythrocytes were highly sensitive to Babesia sp. BQ1 (Lintan), while French Vend\u00e9en breed sheep were not susceptible to the parasite [29]. These findings suggest that different breeds of the same host species may vary in their susceptibility to Babesia parasites. In our previous study investigating the pathogenicity of B. aktasi in indigenous goats [20], the parasite caused mild fever but did not induce clinical infection in immunocompetent goats. However, it is not known whether B. aktasi will exhibit different behavior in terms of pathogenicity and virulence in purebred Saanen goats. In the current experimental study using fresh blood infected with B. aktasi, this question was addressed in purebred Saanen goats. The findings obtained in this experiment indicated that B. aktasi exhibited variable pathogenic effect among different breeds of the same host species, and induced severe clinical infections resulting in death in purebred Saanen goats.\nExperimental studies indicated that the spleen plays a significant role in host defense against Babesia spp. After recovering of acute babesiosis, PPE rapidly decreases, but the parasite persists in the host for an extended period (even at levels undetectable under the microscope). When the spleen is removed in these carrier hosts, PPE increases, and clinical infection occurs, leading to the death of the host [11,19,44]. This situation allows for the in vivo isolation of Babesia parasites and facilitates its pathogenicity studies. It has been reported that ovine Babesia spp. have different pathogenicity and exhibit variations in their response to splenectomy. Experimental studies with B. ovis demonstrated that all splenectomized sheep died due to severe clinical infection [45,46]. On the other hand, experimental studies with B. motasi and B. crassa demonstrated that splenectomized sheep did not develop clinical infection resulting in mortality [47\u201348]. When blood obtained from a naturally infected sheep with Babesia sp. BQ1 (Ningxian) was inoculated into two sheep, one with splenectomized and the other with spleen-intact, the splenectomized sheep exhibited severe clinical symptoms resulting in death including an increase temperature to 41.5\u00b0C. In the same study, similar findings were observed in the spleen-intact sheep, but the sheep recovered from the disease [49]. In our previous study, serious clinical infection resulting in death was observed in immunosuppressed indigenous breed goats infected with B. aktasi [20]. Furthermore, it has been reported that in experimental infections conducted on immunosuppressed sheeps, both clinical and microscopic, as well as molecular examinations, indicated that it did not cause infection [50]. In the current study, serious clinical infection was also occurred in immunosuppressed Saanen goats, and four out of five goats died on the 4th day post-fresh infected blood injection due to severe clinical symptoms, while one goat died on the 7th day.\nIt has been reported that splenectomy and dexamethasone are the most suitable approaches for the experimental studies conducted on Babesia ovata, Babesia bigemina and Babesia sp. Xinjiang to suppress the immune system [11,51,52]. In an experimental study conducted in China, splenectomized sheep infected with Babesia sp. Xinjiang survived acute infection, but death occurred in the sheep that received splenectomy combined with dexamethasone [11]. In an experimental study with Babesia sp. BQ1 (Lintan), it was reported that clinical infection did not develop in splenectomized goats. However, when dexamethasone was injected to the same goats, clinical signs of the disease and a high PPE reaching up to 85% were observed [53]. In a subsequent experimental study using the same isolate, Babesia sp. BQ1 (Lintan) did not induce clinical infection in spleen-intact sheep and goats [54]. In our previous study, dexamethasone was injected to the splenectomized indigenous goats to fully reveal the effects of B. aktasi, and this combined approach increased the occurrence of clinical signs of babesiosis [20]. It is not known whether B. aktasi has a pathogenic effect on purebred Saanen goats. Therefore, in the current study, dexamethasone was injected to the splenectomized goats to achieve complete suppression of the immune system, consistent with previous studies [11,20,51,52,54]. Thus, we obtained more convincing data regarding the pathogenicity and virulence of B. aktasi on purebred Saanen goats.\nIn this study, both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent Saanen goats exhibited severe clinical findings such as high fever, anemia, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria. In both groups, the severe clinical infection led to the death of the goats. These findings are consistent with previous experimental studies conducted on lambs infected with B. ovis [45,46]. Babesia motasi Ameland strain did not cause PPE or clinical symptoms in splenectomized goats [48], on the contrary, B. crassa induced a mild fever and PPE [55]. In our previous study conducted on indigenous goats, B. aktasi induced severe clinical symptoms in the immune suppressed goats [20]. These findings indicate that different Babesia spp. may cause varying clinical symptoms depending on the presence or absence of the spleen [56\u201359]. It is well-known that distinct Babesia spp. can lead to different clinical signs. For instance, B. motasi Wales strain caused mild fever, anemia, and PPE up to 1% in spleen-intact goats [48]. In our previous study [20], we determined that B. aktasi has a non-pathogenic effect on the immunocompetent indigenous goats. Interestingly, in the current study, B. aktasi induced serious clinical babesiosis leading to death in purebred immunocompetent Saanen goats. These results indicated that goat breed plays a vital role in the severity of B. aktasi infection, and the parasite poses a significant health risk for purebred Saanen goats.\nThe main hematological measurements considered in the determination of anemia are total RBC, HCT and Hb values. In our study, a statistically significant decrease in HCT, RBC, WBC, and Hb values was observed (Table 2 and Fig 3), and the decrease of HCT, RBC and Hb were inversely associated with the increase in PPE (Figs 4 and 5). Similar results have been obtained in previous studies, suggesting that this decline in the aforementioned blood parameters may be attributed to the destruction of erythrocytes [9,20,60\u201363]. Our previous experimental study conducted on indigenous goats using B. aktasi revealed that MCV was normal in both the immunosuppressed and immunocompetent groups, while there was a statistically significant decrease in MCHC value in the immunosuppressed group, indicating a decrease in hemoglobin concentration within RBCs [20]. In contrast to our previous findings [20], the current study observed a significant increase in MCV values and a decrease in MCHC values in the immunocompetent group. Additionally, it was determined that these values remained within the normal range in the immunosuppressed group. These findings indicated that the anemia was macrocytic-hypochromic character in the immunocompetent goats. These findings showed differences from the results obtained in previous studies on B. bovis and B. bigemina in cattle [64,65]. A recent study conducted on sheep infected with B. ovis reported that the RDW (red cell distribution width) value was within the reference range before and after treatment [9]. In the current study, no significant change in RDW-CD and RDW-SD values was detected in the immunosuppressed group, but a significant increase was observed in the spleen intact group (Table 2 and Fig 3). This result indicates a significant reticulocytosis (an increase in young red blood cells) in the spleen intact group, suggesting that the infection lasted longer in this group. Also this finding suggests that spleen function may play an important role in controlling Babesia infection [66].\nIt has been reported that Babesia parasites cause cellular destruction resulting in hemolysis in the vascular system, inflammatory lesions and anoxia, particularly in certain organs such as liver and kidneys inducing nephrotoxic effects causing to an elevated AST, ALT, BUN and creatinine levels [9,67]. In this study, along with the increase in PPE, a statistical significant increase in ALT and AST levels was observed in both experimental groups compared to pre-infection levels. Our results agree with the previous studies conducted on indigenous goats experimentally infected with B. aktasi [20] and sheep naturally infected with B. ovis [9]. An increase in ALT and AST values indicating hepatic dysfunction has also been observed in cattle infected with B. bovis [68]. ALT elevation has been previously reported in animals with babesiosis, suggesting that this increase may be due to alterations in liver function associated with the disease [9,69]. Recent studies indicated that certain Babesia spp. can cause damage to liver tissue, potentially suppressing the overall liver function [9,69,70].\nThe pathology of babesiosis is related to the haemolytic anaemia, as a consequence of the intravascular destruction of erythrocytes either by the immune system or by the direct damage caused by the parasite itself [67]. In this study, postmortem changes observed in the goats subjected to necropsy were similar to those previously observed in sheep experimentally infected with B. ovis [71,72]. Serious pulmonary edema suggest that emphysema may lead to a respiratory failure and could provide direct evidence for death [47,72,73]. Therefore, it can be argued that babesiosis is a respiratory tract disease.\nExperimental studies conducted on different goat breeds will allow for a better understanding of the pathogenicity and virulence of B. aktasi. In contrast, purebred Saanen goats, which have been selectively bred for traits such as milk production, may be more susceptible to infections like B. aktasi. Studies have shown that while purebred Saanen goats are highly susceptible to trypanosome infections, Saanen crossbreeds exhibit greater resilience [74]. This breed-specific susceptibility underscores the importance of considering breed-specific responses when evaluating the pathogenicity of infectious agents.\nIn conclusion, in both groups, besides specific signs of acute clinical babesiosis (high fever, anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria), general symptoms such as lethargy, anorexia, teeth grinding, trembling, groaning, rapid respiration, lying down with the head on the ground, and immobility were also observed. Shortly after parasite inoculation, PPE was detected at rates ranging from 4.3% to 33.5% in the immunosuppressed group, while it was determined to be 2.1% to 7.6% in the immunocompetent individuals. In the dead goats due to severe clinical babesiosis, edema in the lungs, frothy fluid in the lung and trachea, jaundice in the subcutaneous fat tissue and mesenteric fat, and dark red urine in the urinary bladder were observed. These findings suggest that B. aktasi is a pathogenic species causing acute infections that result in mortality in purebred Saanen goats. Additionally, considering the abundance of wild goats in the region where the parasite is prevalent, further research is needed to identify the natural reservoirs of B. aktasi. These further studies will provide valuable information regarding the biology, epidemiology, and ecology of the parasite."
