Schistosomiasis is one of the most common parasitic diseases in the world, mainly affecting people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Mozambique is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. Chronic urinary schistosomiasis in the adult population can lead to hematuria, anemia, urinary tract lesions and eventually death from renal failure and bladder cancer. The characteristics of the chronic form of disease in the adult population of Mozambique is unknown. A cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted to assess current morbidity and the risk factors for schistosomiasis among the adult population of Chókwè district, Mozambique. The prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis was 11.3%, intestinal schistosomiasis was 5.7% and urinary tract ultrasound abnormalities were 37.9%. Of the 37.9% with ultrasound abnormalities, 14.5% were positive for Schistosoma haematobium. In this study, reporting hematuria in the last month and blood in the urine were found to be diagnostic markers of urinary schistosomiasis, and reporting lower abdominal pain was associated with ultrasound abnormalities. The high prevalence of anatomical urinary tract ultrasound abnormalities suggests that the disease has an important impact on the long-term health of the adult population.
