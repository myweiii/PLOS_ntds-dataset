Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease. It is a growing, substantial threat to global public health as rising climatic variability drives the expansion and increase in incidence of the disease. In the northern coastal regions of Peru, dengue is a substantial public health burden with major crises instigated by severe, recent dengue outbreaks. Here, focusing on three Peruvian departments of Piura, Tumbes, and Lambayeque, we describe the extent to which current and past recent climatic conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperatures, shape the patterns in reported dengue cases. Furthermore, we display how understanding such relationships with climatic conditions can be used to model historical trends in dengue cases, which can be helpful for addressing incomplete dengue surveillance. Finally, the study demonstrates how climate-model-based forecasting of dengue cases can be employed for reliable prediction of potential future outbreaks up to one month ahead of time. The insights can be used by public health authorities before and during dengue outbreaks to potentially reduce the morbidity, mortality, and strains on health services by informing public health policies such as information campaigns, early warning systems, and targeted mosquito control interventions.
