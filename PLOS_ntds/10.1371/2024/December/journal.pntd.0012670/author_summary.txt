Pregnant women constitute a vulnerable population occasionally affected by cats with sporotrichosis. Treatment is challenging due to oral medications that can potentially harm the baby or lack of clinical experience during pregnancy. This study consists of an analysis of 58 cases of pregnant women with sporotrichosis attended in a reference center. The median age was 27 years old and the majority were black (64.4%). The lymphocutaneous form (63.8%), fixed form (19%) and disseminated cutaneous form (12%) of sporotrichosis were treated with thermotherapy and cryosurgery (n = 22, 37.9%). For extracutaneous/disseminated forms (5.2%) (external ocular sporotrichosis and bone sporotrichosis), amphotericin B was indicated. Cure occurred in 100% of those followed (n = 44) with the remainder lost to follow-up (n = 14). For pregnant women with cutaneous sporotrichosis, the physical therapies used were effective. In cases of extracutaneous and disseminated forms, amphotericin B was indicated due to its safety profile in this population.
