    "Background": "Pregnant women constitute a vulnerable population occasionally affected by zoonotic sporotrichosis. Treatment is challenging due to potentially teratogenic oral medications (itraconazole and saturated potassium iodide solution) or lack of clinical experience during pregnancy (terbinafine). Literature is scarce on sporotrichosis and pregnancy, mainly consisting of case reports.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "This study consists of a cohort of 58 cases of pregnant women with sporotrichosis attended in a reference center in Rio de Janeiro from 1998 to 2023. The median age was 27 years old; the majority were black (64.4%); comorbidities prior to pregnancy were reported by 20.7% (including two people living with HIV/AIDSâ€“PLHIV) and 6.8% developed conditions that are unique to pregnancy. In 75.9% of patients, they were pregnant when they acquired sporotrichosis, with a median gestational age of 17 weeks, and 24.1% became pregnant during treatment for sporotrichosis. The lymphocutaneous form occurred in 63.8% of patients, followed by the fixed form (19%), disseminated cutaneous form (12%) and extracutaneous/disseminated forms (5.2%). Thermotherapy was indicated for all (except 2) patients and cryosurgery was performed in 22 (37.9%). Amphotericin B was indicated for a patient with external ocular sporotrichosis and for the PLHIV with osteomyelitis in the right tibia. Cure occurred in 100% of those followed (n = 44) with the remainder lost to follow-up (n = 14)",
    "Conclusions": "Pregnant women with cutaneous sporotrichosis in this study recovered following physical therapies, suggesting these therapies may be effective. In cases of extracutaneous and disseminated forms, amphotericin B was indicated due to its safety profile in this population. Management of sporotrichosis during pregnancy requires a delicate assessment of the balance between maternal benefit and fetal risks."
