The leishmaniases are a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by protozoa that affect humans and other animals, whose world distribution areas are currently expanding due to climate change and globalization, among other factors. As dogs are the main reservoir of infection by the parasite, controlling the disease in this species should help minimize infection spread and reduce the prevalence of leishmaniasis in humans. Unfortunately, current treatment for sick dogs is not fully effective and there are reports of associated side effects and drug resistance. The results of this clinical trial in sick dogs indicate that adding an oral supplement (Impromune, Bioiberica S.A.U., Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain) containing nucleotides and AHCC to the standard treatment regimen for canine leishmaniosis serves to reduce the parasite load and improve kidney function. Accordingly, we would recommend this new immunomodulatory treatment protocol as a tool to optimize the global management of leishmaniasis in a One Health approach.
