Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) affecting more than 250 million people worldwide, the biggest burden being in Africa. In Rwanda, a national control program was established in 2008 and since then, regular mass deworming campaigns target populations at risk. However, quinquennial mapping surveys and epidemiological studies reveal areas with persistent infection and new foci of transmission. Since these foci often coincide with water bodies used for agricultural activities, this study aimed to investigate how agrochemical compounds and physical properties of water bodies influence the distribution and abundance of snails that are intermediate hosts for Schistosoma parasites. We used in comparison two machine learning approaches to analyze a wide range of physico-chemical parameters of water bodies in relation to snail abundance throughout the country. Findings indicate that water acidity and chemicals like those found in fertilizers influence the abundance of snails, confirming that agricultural expansion may carry the unwanted burden of schistosomiasis transmission. As the country aims to move towards schistosomiasis elimination as a public health problem, it is imperative to integrate infection control such as public health education, snail control (improved agricultural practices), and mass drug administration into efforts to improve agricultural production.
