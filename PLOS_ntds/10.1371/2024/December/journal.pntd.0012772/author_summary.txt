Reactions are complications of leprosy which lead to acute inflammation of the skin and/or nerves. When these inflammations occur in peripheral nerves, they are the main cause of loss of sensitivity, muscle paralysis and permanent deformities. We accompany children who had leprosy reactions observing how evolve and which factors are associated with the worsening of reactions. To this end, we carried out a cohort study in patients under 15 years of age affected by leprosy reactions diagnosed at the Leprosy referral unit in the Amazon region of Brazil. The children were followed for 2 years since diagnosis, with clinical and strength and sensitivity of nerves assessments. Of the 38 children recruited, a large proportion (42.1%) had worsening nerve function. Furthermore children who had repeated episodes of reactions, nerve damage and multiple nerves affected at diagnosis, deterioration of neural function without pain and/or without exacerbation of the skin lesions, and with caregivers with a low level of education, showed worse development of the reaction. Measures for early diagnosis, constant monitoring of nerve functions and information about the disease for caregivers are important to minimize disabilities, especially in childhood.
