Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease affecting people who work closely with animals. In Africa, livestock contact is thought to be a potential source of human Leptospira exposure. This study examined occupational exposure among slaughterhouse workers in Western Bahr El Ghazal, South Sudan. From February 27 to March 30, 2023, blood samples and interviews were collected from 250 slaughterhouse workers. The workers were tested for leptospiral antibodies using the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT).
Results showed that 6.4%, 16/250 of the workers were seropositive for Leptospira, with two individuals showing high antibody levels indicating recent infection. Additionally, 42.4% reported having had a fever in the past one month. Seropositive individuals mostly reacted to L. borgpetersenii Tarassovi and L. interrogans Australis. Factors linked to higher seropositivity included flaying animals, wearing protective clothing, and handling more carcasses per day.
The study concludes that contact with cattle in slaughter facilities is a significant pathway for human leptospiral exposure, underscoring leptospirosis as a public health risk for those frequently in contact with cattle, including farmers and veterinarians. This highlights the need for further investigation into leptospirosis in cases of undifferentiated fever for workers presenting with fever in South Sudan. Subsequent research should involve hospitalized patients to gain a complete understanding of the diseaseâ€™s burden on humans, together with identifying local reservoir hosts. We recommend the inclusion of serogroups Tarassovi and Australis in future vaccine development and serodiagnostic panels for South Sudan.
