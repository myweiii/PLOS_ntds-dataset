Loiasis, a parasitic disease endemic to Central Africa, is caused by Loa loa, a worm that releases embryos called microfilariae into the bloodstream. Although historically considered a benign disease, loiasis can significantly shorten life expectancy in individuals with high microfilarial densities, and may lead to severe complications following treatment with ivermectin, a widely used antiparasitic drug. Several studies suggest that a potential dysregulation of inflammation and blood clotting may contribute to these complications.
In this study, we analyzed blood samples from individuals with varying levels of loiasis infection. We found that those with higher microfilarial densities had elevated eosinophil and platelet counts, indicating immune activation. After ivermectin treatment, we observed significant changes in several biological markers, including eosinophil counts, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers. These changes suggest an increase in inflammation and activation of blood clotting mechanisms following treatment.
This study provides new insights into the biological effects of loiasis and its treatment, and our findings may help explain the severe complications observed in some individuals treated with ivermectin.
