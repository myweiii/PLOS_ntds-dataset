Snakebite envenoming, a severe condition, affects 2.5 million people and causes 81,000â€“138,000 deaths annually, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The World Health Organization aims to reduce this burden by 50% by 2030. However, significant barriers exist to achieving these targets, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. These barriers include limited rigorous research evidence and the lack of investment in effective antivenoms for local snake species. Meeting this goal will require innovative research to gather better data on snakebite incidence and treatment. Artificial intelligence is one promising field that can contribute to this effort. For the first time, we have demonstrated how MaxDiff statistical experiment designs and machine learning algorithms can be explored to predict the barriers to effective snakebite treatment, such as the high cost of antivenoms, increased use of harmful practices, lack of access to effective antivenoms in remote areas, and resorting to unorthodox and harmful practices in addition to hospital treatment. Addressing these barriers through targeted policy interventions, including intensified advocacy, continuous education, community engagement, healthcare worker training, and strategic investments, can enhance the effectiveness of snakebite treatment. Robust regulatory frameworks and increased local antivenom production are also needed to address these barriers.
