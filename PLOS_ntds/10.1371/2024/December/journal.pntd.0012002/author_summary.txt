Over the last two decades, in the Lake Albert region, Uganda, there have been a number of interventions targeted at schistosomiasis by grass root structures, and district and national level actors; but despite this the Lake Albertine districts remain a highly endemic region for schistosomiasis. In recognition of this persistent schistosomiasis, we examined the factors that inhibit or facilitate adherence to mass drug administration (MDA) using an ethnographic approach. Lived experience of improved health through participation and knowledge of the dangers of the disease if not treated, facilitated treatment uptake. Localised social influence was crucial in gaining knowledge that facilitated uptake. Key were positive attitudes to sensitisation conducted by community drug distributors; whilst uptake of treatment by children was reportedly heavily influenced by their mothers’ positive attitudes to treatment. The drug itself, praziquantel, was described as “very strong” and “effective” because of the relief from symptoms. There are, however, a number of people, both children and adults, who fail to adhere to MDA. Therefore, we recommend continuous education and sensitisation, alongside increased number and training of Community drug distributors/village health team members; with continued motivation for them as they are vital in enabling treatment uptake.
