Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is primarily caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum and Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani. Vaccines based on chimeric or multiepitope antigens have demonstrated significant potential for eliciting effective and long-lasting immune responses against these parasites. This review systematically evaluates the efficacy of these antigens and identifies potential immunogenic targets for vaccine development. A comprehensive search across four databases identified 22 studies, including one randomized clinical trial. Most research was conducted with mice, with additional studies with dogs and hamsters. The reduction in parasite load ranged from 14% to 99.6% and from 1.7 to 9.0 log orders. Limiting dilution was the most used method for assessing parasitic load, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), imprint, biopsy culture, and smear. These findings underscore the promising potential of chimeric and multiepitope antigens as vaccine candidates for VL and provide valuable insights for guiding future vaccine development.
