Infection caused by Necator americanus is a major neglected tropical disease with significant associated morbidity. New tools, including vaccines, are needed due to the inadequacy of current control strategies. N. americanus Glutathione-S-Transferase-1 (Na-GST-1) is a leading hookworm vaccine candidate. Antibodies induced by this vaccine are postulated to interfere with the host blood digestion pathway of adult N. americanus worms, thereby impairing their development and survival. We conducted a Phase 1 trial of recombinant Na-GST-1 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel in 24 healthy, hookworm-na√Øve adults living in the metropolitan Washington DC region. Each participant received three intramuscular injections every 2 months of the vaccine administered with or without a Cytosine-phospho-Guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) Toll-like receptor-9 agonist, CpG 10104. Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel was well tolerated in this study, and no vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. Significant levels of antigen-specific IgG antibodies were induced with the highest responses seen 2 to 4 weeks after the third vaccination. The addition of CpG 10104 to the vaccine resulted in significant improvement in the antigen-specific IgG responses. Based on these results, the vaccine has been advanced into a Phase 1 clinical trial in a hookworm-endemic region of Africa as well as a Phase 2 controlled human infection study to test proof of efficacy.
