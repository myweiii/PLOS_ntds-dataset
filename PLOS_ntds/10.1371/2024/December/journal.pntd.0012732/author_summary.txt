Podoconiosis, a non-infectious form of elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease whose immunopathology remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the hematological and immunological aspects of podoconiosis. Our findings revealed significant hematological changes, particularly a reduction in absolute neutrophil counts in podoconiosis cases, which may suggest an autoimmune process. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation activates immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, or monocytes), which may contribute to the destruction of circulating neutrophils. We also found reduced hemoglobin levels in podoconiosis patients, possibly due to mechanisms such as hemolysis, iron sequestration, and cytokine-mediated inhibition of erythropoiesis. However, future mechanistic research is needed to confirm our observations and elucidate the role of reduced neutrophils in the pathogenesis of podoconiosis.
