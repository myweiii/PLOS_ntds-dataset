Ticks are important vectors of zoonotic diseases and play a major role in the circulation and transmission of such diseases. In this study, ticks collected from March 2021 to May 2023 were pooled and subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis to gain insight into the diversity and distribution of tick-borne viruses in Inner Mongolia. Among the identified RNA viruses, 6 are recognized as human pathogens or potential human pathogens; these are Nuomin virus, Yezo virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Alongshan virus, Beiji nairovirus, and Mukawa phlebovirus. This study revealed significant diversity among RNA viruses transported by ticks in Inner Mongolia as well as variations in their geographic distribution. To effectively detect alterations in pathogen distribution, ongoing surveillance is urgently needed.
