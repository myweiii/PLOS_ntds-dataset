Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that poses significant public health challenges, particularly in pastoralist communities where human-animal interactions are frequent. The disease is often underdiagnosed due to its nonspecific symptoms, which mimic other febrile illnesses, leading to prolonged suffering and potential complications. Understanding the sero-prevalence of human brucellosis and identifying associated risk factors are crucial steps in improving diagnostic strategies and guiding public health interventions. This study focuses on febrile patients attending Moyale Primary Hospital in southern Ethiopia, a region predominantly inhabited by pastoralist communities. By examining the prevalence of brucellosis and exploring the socio-demographic and environmental factors linked to the infection, this research provides valuable insights into the burden of the disease in this vulnerable population. The findings highlight the need for targeted awareness programs, improved diagnostic protocols, and strategic public health measures to mitigate the impact of brucellosis in pastoralist settings.
