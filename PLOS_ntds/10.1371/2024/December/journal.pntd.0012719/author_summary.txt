Gut parasites are transmitted through parasite shedding in the faeces of infected individuals. Particularly in resource-limited settings, diagnosis heavily relies on microscopy-based detection of parasites in stool samples. However, faecal parasite shedding is often intermittent, meaning not all samples drawn from infected hosts contain the parasite. Additionally, no diagnostic test has perfect sensitivity, and false-negative test results are common. To understand parasite transmission and diagnostic-test performance, we need to know both (1) how often a parasite is shed (shedding probability) and (2) what are the chances that a diagnostic test will detect the parasite when present in a sample (test sensitivity). Using Giardia infections as a case-study, here we illustrate a statistical-modelling approach that can be used to separately estimate parasite-shedding probability and diagnostic-test sensitivity. We ran duplicate microscopy-based tests on 413 stool samples drawn from 276 children, and found that Giardia shedding probability was ~44%; that single-test sensitivity was ~46–64%; and that, after accounting for intermittent parasite shedding and imperfect test sensitivity, infection frequency estimates (~34–54%) were over twice the observed frequencies (~16–25%). This general framework can help us better understand infection dynamics, epidemiology, and diagnosis whenever pathogen shedding is intermittent and pathogen detection is imperfect.
