Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease. Currently, commonly used drugs such as aminosalicylates and glucocorticosteroids are difficult to treat and have many adverse effects. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing the immunomodulatory abilities of worms to develop new therapies for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases. Hymenolepis nana is a zoonotic parasitic worm that parasitizes the small intestines of humans and rodents and generally does not cause serious pathologic damage to their hosts, making it a potential class of intestinal parasites in helminthic therapy. In this study, we investigated the mitigating effect of Hymenolepis nana antigens (HnAg) on UC in mice from the perspective of maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. The results showed that HnAg alleviated UC in mice by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/IL-22 signaling pathway, promoting the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells, and modulating the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Meanwhile, HnAg attenuated DSS-induced inflammatory damage in mouse small intestinal organoid tissues and promoted intestinal stem cells proliferation. Suggesting that Hymenolepis nana and its related products may become a new option for alleviating UC.
