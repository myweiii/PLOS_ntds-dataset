Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that causes anthrax-like disease in several animal species including non-human primates. It is listed as a select agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In sub-Saharan African rainforests, Bcbva is considered highly virulent with high mortality rates across multiple animal species. Bcbva shares key features with B. anthracis, the classical cause of anthrax, including spore production and environmental transmission. Our study demonstrates that Bcbva can replicate, sporulate, and persist in growth media for several days. We showed that Bcbva produced a greater amount of attached capsule when grown in culture media supplemented with human serum and CO2. Additionally, Bcbva caused higher mortality in laboratory animals infected with an equal number of spores compared to B. anthracis Ames. Nevertheless, Bcbva infection in animal models was prevented with the global standard Sterne anthrax vaccine. Further study should focus on the Bcbva lifecycle and transmission pathways in nature to elucidate new preventative strategies for controlling disease outbreaks.
