Phlebotomine sand flies transmit leishmaniasis to humans and animals, a neglected tropical disease of the (sub-)tropics, currently expanding though in previously non-endemic regions. As leishmaniasis eradication largely relies on vectorsâ€™ insecticidal control, regular monitoring of insecticide resistance (IR) is a core element of integrated vector management. IR data are limited in sand fly populations worldwide though, due to the unavailability of robust molecular diagnostic and phenotyping tools, as well as deficiencies in human resources, appropriate training and capacity building. Here, we aim to characterise the pyrethroid resistance status of populations originating from countries of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East; i.e. Greece, Turkey and Iran. Pyrethroid resistance-associated mutations were detected in all three countries, while the populations from Greece exhibited susceptibility upon exposure to deltamethrin in CDC bioassays. We established an individual bioassay protocol to enable IR monitoring in settings with multi-species population structure, and applied it comparatively among three distinct Phlebotomus species, revealing that they respond differently to insecticide treatment. Our study contributes data for sustainable evidence-based sand fly control, and highlights the importance of systematic IR surveillance programs in leishmaniasis endemic regions.
