Leptospirosis caused by pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp. is one of the most widespread zoonoses of humans and infections in animals. Rodents are considered the main reservoir hosts of Leptospira. The role of cats in the epidemiology of zoonotic Leptospira is not well-understood. Several recent studies confirm that cats can be infected by Leptospira, seroconvert, and shed spirochetes in their urine. Renal carriage and urine shedding can persist in cats even after clearance of the organism from the blood. There are few reports of human leptospirosis in Grenada. However, there are no published reports on Leptospira exposure or infection in Grenadian cat populations, and the role of cats in the epidemiology of the disease is unknown. We hypothesize that Grenadian cat population may be a reservoir host for zoonotic Leptospira on the island. The results show that feral cats are likely to be important reservoirs of pathogenic Leptospira spp. and a source of leptospirosis.
