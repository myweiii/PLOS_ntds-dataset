Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis are widespread neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) which require preventative chemotherapy (PC) for morbidity control among schoolâ€“aged children. A key component of PC for both diseases is the use of large-scale surveys to determine prevalence in order to guide treatment frequency. Given the need for a population estimate, surveys represent a substantial proportion of helminth control program budgets. There is a need to understand costing components of these surveys to make best use of available resources and tie costs to recent innovations in survey design methods, termed Model Based Geostatistics (MBG), which have been shown to deliver more precise results, given the same resources, than traditional design approaches. Detailed bottom up costing is provided for a representative survey of STH and schistosomiasis conducted in Kenya in 2017. Results are analyzed and extrapolated to demonstrate how costs differ depending on numbers of schools surveyed and individuals sampled per school. Extrapolations are coupled with a previous simulation study comparing the precision of traditional and MBG-based design and analysis of the same series of surveys conducted in Kenya. A range of cost-precision estimates are generated to show incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of both traditional and geostatistical survey design under varying budget constraints, represented by survey size. The geostatistical design, under almost all reference case comparisons is cost saving, more precise, or both. Substantial increases in cost-efficiency are possible when geostatistical methods are used to design and analyse large representative surveys of helminths. This is critical for the future of school-based deworming programs as a greater emphasis is placed on maintaining cost-effectiveness in environments where prevalence and morbidity due to STH and schistosomiasis are reducing.
