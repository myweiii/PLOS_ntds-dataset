Our research explores the potential of co-constitutive risk messaging (CCR), a method within our One Health Communication framework, to influence public support for both immediate actions like vaccine uptake and broader policies such as climate change mitigation. While we observed that CCR messaging can effectively enhance pro-vaccine attitudes and behaviors, especially among those with collectivist cultural views, its impact on climate policy support was more nuanced. Notably, CCR messaging appears to resonate with individuals who are skeptical about climate change, suggesting that linking climate change to specific health risks like infectious diseases may make the abstract consequences of climate change more tangible and urgent for this group. Although our findings provide mixed support for our initial hypotheses, they represent a promising first step in evaluating CCR messaging as a strategy to address complex, interlinked issues like climate change and public health. We advocate for further research to refine and expand the application of CCR messaging specifically, and One Health Communication more broadly, potentially incorporating stronger experimental treatments and exploring its effectiveness across different cultural contexts. This approach could offer a valuable tool for strategic communicators aiming to engage diverse audiences on the intertwined challenges of health and environmental risks.
