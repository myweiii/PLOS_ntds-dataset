Nepal continues to see new leprosy patients every year. It is known that close contacts of leprosy patients are at increased risk of developing leprosy and that providing them with a single dose of the antibiotic rifampicin as post-exposure prophylaxis (SDR-PEP) reduces that risk. This study looked at the impact of administrating SDR-PEP to screened contacts of leprosy patients as part of Nepalâ€™s routine leprosy control efforts. The intervention was implemented in two districts, and the results were compared to those of two districts where SDR-PEP was not provided. The findings showed a 72% reduction in leprosy risk among contacts in the districts using SDR-PEP. Importantly, SDR-PEP provided similar protection levels in blood-related as in non-blood-related contacts. These results underscore the role of SDR-PEP as a powerful component of routine leprosy control, contributing to stopping transmission. However, further studies are required to assess the population-wide impact and to optimise its implementation across diverse settings.
