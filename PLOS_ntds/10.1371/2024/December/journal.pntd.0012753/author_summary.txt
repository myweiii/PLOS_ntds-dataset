Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease with global health significance. This impactful parasitic disease, resulting from the ingestion of food and water contaminated with canine feces containing E. granulosus eggs, poses a threat to both livestock and humans. Detection of canine feces contaminated with E. granulosus eggs will guide effective preventative measures for local governments, especially in low-income countries. Various tools have been developed to detect E. granulosus, among which ELISA kits are currently the most used in E. granulosus prevention and control. However, these tests face challenges related to low sensitivity and high cross-reactivity. Conversely, nucleic acid detection methods offer high specificity and stability, but often require skilled technicians and expensive infrastructure, limiting their applicability in low-income countries lacking such resources. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel assay with promising potential for field application, integrating recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) alongside a CRISPR-associated protein 12a (Cas12a) system (RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a). For enhancing field utility, we innovatively propose a straightforward and cost-effective NaOH-Based DNA extraction method integrated into this assay. The newly devised RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay outperforms previous detection tests, offering improved diagnostic sensitivity and enabling point-of-care detection. This diagnostic technique holds promise as a potential point-of-care testing method for nucleic acid detection of E. granulosus, especially in canine feces contaminated with parasite eggs, and is expected to play a crucial role in securing the health of livestock and humans in low-income countries.
