Brugia malayi is a species of thread-like worms that reside in the human lymphatic system, leading to the chronic and socioeconomically devastating disease known as lymphatic filariasis. This filarial disease is characterized by significant damage to the lymphatic endothelium, which can result in lymphatic remodeling, disruption of lymphatic flow, and, in severe cases, the development of elephantiasis. To understand the mechanism behind the pathology of lymphatic filariasis, we focused on small regulatory molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), secreted by the worms and that can interact with lymphatic endothelial cells. We demonstrated that two B. malayi miRNAs unique to nematodes, bma-miR-5864 and bma-miR-86, targeted human genes essential for maintaining the integrity of the lymphatic endothelium. Our findings suggest that these bma-miRNAs increase the permeability of the endothelial barrier, potentially causing lymphedema and contributing to lymphatic filariasis pathology. This research provides new insights into the molecular interactions between parasitic worms and the hostâ€™s lymphatic system, which could inform therapeutic strategies.
