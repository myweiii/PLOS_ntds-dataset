    "Background": "Dengue is hyperendemic in Colombia. It imposes a substantial economic burden on patients, caregivers, society, and the national health system. We intend to identify and synthesize the evidence regarding the economic burden of dengue in Colombia.",
    "Methods": "A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021257985) of economic studies was performed. A comprehensive search was completed in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the LILACS, and SciELO databases. Study selection and data extraction was made by two researchers.",
    "Results": "160 records were identified. Of these, 14 studies were selected for data extraction. Direct medical cost of dengue is mainly represented by hospitalization (USD 823 to 1,754). The annual aggregated cost is near to USD 159.6 million, with ambulatory care (USD 90.1 million) and fatal cases (USD 30.7 million) representing 75% of the total cost. The aggregate indirect cost (due to loss in income while sick or as a caretaker) was USD 92.8 million. Vaccination seems to reduce the economic cost of dengue.",
    "Conclusions": "Dengue financial burden could be challenging for low-income communities as those affected in Colombia. An integrated approach including vector control and the introduction of a vaccine for dengue has the potential to reduce the economic burden of the disease."
