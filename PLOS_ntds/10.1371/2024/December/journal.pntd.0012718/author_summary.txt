Dengue fever is a significant public health concern globally. Colombia, like many other tropical and subtropical countries, faces the challenge of managing and mitigating the burden of dengue. We developed a systematic review of the costs of dengue in Colombia, and we believe our findings have the potential to inform public health policies and resource allocation. By analyzing the direct medical costs associated with dengue cases, including hospitalization, diagnostics, and treatment, policymakers can gain valuable insights into the resource requirements for managing and preventing the disease. We believe this information could be taken as an example for other countries with similar epidemiology and could help to prioritize targeted interventions to reduce the incidence of dengue, such as mosquito control programs, community awareness campaigns, and vaccination strategies. We concluded that: Dengue disproportionately affects the communities with low socioeconomic status, costs related to severe dengue are significantly higher than ambulatory cases, dengue leads to missed work and lost earnings due to death or disability, implementing vector control programs to combat dengue is costly, and introducing a dengue vaccine has the potential to reduce the economic burden.
