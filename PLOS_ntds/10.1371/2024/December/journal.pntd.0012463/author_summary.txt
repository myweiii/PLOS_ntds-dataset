Leptospirosis is a significant public health concern in many tropical regions, but its true burden is often unrecognized due to limited diagnostic capacity and under-reporting. Using a multistage household survey, we assessed human leptospirosis infection across two regions in the Dominican Republic. Our findings revealed a high diversity of Leptospira serogroups, regional differences in transmission, and a marked gap between reported cases and actual infections. Estimated annual infection rates were over 100 times higher than nationally reported cases, underscoring substantial under-ascertainment. We identified key risk factors for infection, including older age, male gender, and rat exposure in the home, with seroprevalence varying across regions. Notably, different Leptospira serogroups demonstrated unique transmission patterns likely linked to distinct animal reservoirs, such as rats, livestock, and dogs. For example, serogroup Australis was more common among farmers, reflecting livestock exposure. This study highlights the value of serological surveys in uncovering hidden burdens of disease and identifying tailored public health interventions, such as rodent control and animal vaccination. By understanding the complex epidemiology of Leptospira infections, our findings contribute to improved surveillance and targeted strategies to control leptospirosis in endemic settings.
