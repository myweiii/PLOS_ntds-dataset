    "Abstract": "Little is known about the epidemiology of leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic, the second most populous country in the Caribbean. We report on findings from a multi-stage household survey across two regions in the country that reveals a previously under-estimated burden of human Leptospira infection. Our findings, based on the reference-standard microscopic agglutination test, indicate a complex picture of serogroup diversity, spatial heterogeneity in infection and risk, and a marked discrepancy between reported cases and serologically estimated infections. Given an overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (95% CI: 10.8\u201313.0%) and a lower estimated force of infection (0.30% per year [0.27%\u20130.35%]) the number of infections may exceed national reported case data by 145-fold or more. Icterohaemorrhagiae, associated with severe Weil\u2019s disease, was the most commonly identified serogroup with a serogroup-specific prevalence of 4.4%. Consistent with other settings, risk factors including age, male sex, and rat exposure were associated with higher seroprevalence. Our study highlights the need for targeted public health interventions informed by serogroup-specific dynamics, detailed spatial analyses, knowledge of local animal reservoirs, and strengthened laboratory surveillance to effectively control this pathogen."
