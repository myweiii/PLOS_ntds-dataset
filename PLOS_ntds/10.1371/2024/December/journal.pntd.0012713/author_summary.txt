Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks, exacerbated by the spread of the Aedes albopictus mosquito and climate change, are a growing public health concern. Our study explores the potential impact of emergency vaccination during a large-scale CHIKV outbreak in Rome, Italy, using a dynamic model that simulates disease transmission among humans and mosquitoes.
We found that emergency vaccination could significantly reduce the number of infections. Without vaccination, an estimated 6.21% of Romeâ€™s population, about 170,762 people, could be infected. However, starting vaccination after detecting ten cases and reaching 40% coverage could decrease infections by 82%, preventing 139,805 cases. Even with lower coverage rates, the benefits are substantial: 10% coverage could prevent 33% of infections, and 20% coverage could prevent 55% (S2 Fig).
Our findings emphasize the importance of quick and effective vaccination strategies during outbreaks. Preparedness, early detection, and flexible responses are crucial for managing emerging infectious diseases in cities. This study supports the need for strategic vaccine stockpiling and rapid deployment to protect public health.
