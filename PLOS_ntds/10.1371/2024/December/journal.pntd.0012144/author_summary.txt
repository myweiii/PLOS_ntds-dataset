Brucellosis is a neglected, bacterial zoonotic disease that is caused by several species of the genus Brucella. Cross-species transmission of Brucella can occur in mixed or integrated farming systems. The disease poses serious public health implications and substantial economic losses particularly in low-income countries including South Sudan.
This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in pastoralists, and their livestock as well as identify potential risk factors associated with Brucella infection. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of brucellosis and risk factors is a prerequisite towards planning an effective mitigation strategy for the disease.
The study revealed high seroprevalence of brucellosis in cattle compared to goats, and the following risk factors were identified; prior history of abortion, age (old) and sex (female) significantly associated with Brucella infection. Surprisingly, sheep were found to be seronegative.
The results of this study showed that brucellosis is prevalent in cattle, goats and people in the pastoral community in CES. Hence, the study suggests the need for implementing control measures such as vaccination and regular screening of cattle and goats to reduce production loses, raising public awareness and knowledge about brucellosis.
