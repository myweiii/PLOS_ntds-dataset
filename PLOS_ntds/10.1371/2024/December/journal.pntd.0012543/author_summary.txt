Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, transmitted by sand flies, and poses a major health risk in the Mediterranean region. Monitoring the spread of infected sand flies is crucial for controlling the disease. This study focused on improving the methods used to detect Leishmania in sand flies by comparing different DNA extraction techniques and assessing the accuracy of these methods across nine reference laboratories. All centers, except one, efficiently detected all Leishmania concentrations, demonstrating proficiency in diagnostic protocols. Moreover, we found that two specific DNA extraction kits, the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit and QIAamp DNA mini-kit, were the most effective for Leishmania detection. We also tested how sample preparation and shipping conditions affected the results, ensuring that our methods would work in real-world settings. Even under these conditions, the detection methods proved reliable. This work helps to standardize the detection of Leishmania, making surveillance more accurate and consistent. Continuous training and calibration are essential to ensure uniform diagnostic performance across laboratories, enhancing epidemiological surveillance and disease control strategies and enabling appropriate treatment.
