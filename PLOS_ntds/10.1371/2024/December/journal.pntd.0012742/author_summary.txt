Schistosomiasis remains a significant global public health concern, with over 230 million people affected. Integrated multicomponent interventions targeting the various aspects of schistosomiasis epidemiology represent promising efforts that may eventually lead to the disease elimination. Rapid and accurate point-of-care diagnostics (POCs) are crucial tools for informing the effective implementation of these elimination efforts. In this study, we developed a latex microsphere (LM)-based lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) by incorporating rSjSAP4 for the rapid diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica. Serum samples collected from subjects living in an area endemic for S. japonicum and non-endemic controls were tested with the established LFIA strips. In the individuals who tested positive by the Kato-Katz method, the LM-based LFIA cassette showed 80.6% sensitivity and 98.0% specificity. When the entire Philippines cohort was tested, the developed LFIA showed a high consistency with the rSjSAP4-ELISA. The schistosomiasis incidence deduced from the developed LFIA and rSjSAP4-ELISA was about 1.8 times higher than that determined with the KK procedure. The findings obtained here further indicate that the rSjSAP4-incorprated LFIA meets most of the ASSURED criteria set by the WHO for POC diagnostics, representing an effective diagnostic tool for the screening of S. japonicum infection in rural endemic areas with limited resources.
