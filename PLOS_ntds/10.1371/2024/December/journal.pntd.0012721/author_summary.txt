Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of major human and veterinary health concern. To ensure its sustainable control, the role of animal reservoirs that could maintain and spread the disease needs a better understanding. We investigated the spatio-temporal variations of Schistosoma infections in small mammal communities around Lake Guiers, northern Senegal. Small mammal species diversity was relatively low at transmission sites. Most infected rodents were found during or just after the rainy season, a time when older individuals dominate in rodent populations. From a spatial perspective, transmission was highly focalized and infection parameters (prevalence, intensity) highly variable, making it challenging to establish clear patterns. Schistosoma mansoni, responsible for human intestinal schistosomiasis, was the most widespread species found. However, sporadic infections with species of human (S. haematobium) and animal significance (S. bovis), including a case of mixed infections (S. mansoni x S. bovis) in rodents raises concerns about hybridization events that may occur in these hosts. Our findings confirm the role of rodents as reservoir or spill-over hosts for Schistosoma in northern Senegal and suggest that fine scale monitoring of animals at transmission sites could help to ensure the sustainability of schistosomiasis control.
