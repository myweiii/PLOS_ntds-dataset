We studied genomic diversity in the environmental bacterial pathogen, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which caused the disease melioidosis in goats at a small farm in northern Australia. By comparing genomes from 92 B. pseudomallei isolates from goats and soil, we discovered 12 diverse lineages at this location, three of which infected the majority of goats and were cultured from the soil of goat enclosures. We also conducted a mouse challenge experiment using six isolates from this farm and determined that two soil isolates displayed much greater virulence than the others. Finally, we investigated soil factors associated with B. pseudomallei occurrence and found 1) most B. pseudomallei isolates were sampled from irrigated soils, and 2) B. pseudomallei was much more likely to be encountered at soil depths of 30 cm than 10 cm. The presence of this pathogen in the soil severely impacted maintenance of the goat herd due to high mortality and emphasizes its One Health implications for other livestock operations in tropical countries where B. pseudomallei is endemic. Our findings provide insight into the importance of more fully understanding soil habitats that promote B. pseudomallei presence, thereby increasing the risk of melioidosis to humans and agricultural animals.
