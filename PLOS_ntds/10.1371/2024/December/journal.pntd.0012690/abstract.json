    "Abstract": "The enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) catalyzes the first step in the post-translational modification of the eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A). This is the only protein known to contain the amino acid hypusine, which results from this modification. Both eIF5A and DHS are essential for cell viability in eukaryotes, and inhibiting DHS is a promising strategy to develop new therapeutic alternatives. DHS proteins from many are sufficiently different from their human orthologs for selective targeting against infectious diseases; however, no DHS inhibitor selective for parasite orthologs has previously been reported."
