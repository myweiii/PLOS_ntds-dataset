The enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) modifies the protein eIF5A, essential for translating proteins from mRNA. Without this modification, cells cease protein production and die. DHS is an anticancer drug target. Here, we explore it for targeting the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax. Using computer-based and robotized searches among large sets of small molecules previously shown to kill P. vivax and other pathogens, we found candidate DHS inhibitors. These candidates were tested in genetically engineered yeast strains expressing either human or P. vivax DHS. The strains were also modified to uptake external molecules and labeled with a fluorescent protein for quantification. Three of the candidate molecules selectively inhibited growth of the yeast strain expressing P. vivax DHS, and blocked eIF5A modification in that strain. These molecules were effective against malaria parasites in human red blood cells grown in the laboratory, including parasite strains resistant to the commonly used antimalarial drug chloroquine, with minimal toxicity to human cells. We demonstrate a synthetic biology method to identify small molecules selective for P. vivax DHS, offering potential starting points for antimalarial drug development.
