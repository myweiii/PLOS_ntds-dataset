Mosquito-borne diseases threaten millions worldwide, necessitating effective personal protection tools. Our study assessed wash-in and spray-on repellents against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the vectors of Zika and other arboviruses. When applied as a treatment on clothing and skin, the novel repellent compound delta-undecalactone provided over 50% bite prevention for more than 7 hours. Mathematical modelling indicated that if such a repellent, with 100% initial efficacy, were to be applied twice daily by 80% of the population, it could mitigate more than 30% of Zika virus infections in a severe outbreak. In a less severe outbreak scenario, it could avert 96% of infections. Similar results were found for dengue and chikungunya outbreaks. Our findings underscore mosquito repellents as highly cost-effective interventions in preventing mosquito-borne illnesses, and the model we present can be used to guide the future development of repellent-based personal protection tools.
