Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer, a progressive infection affecting skin and subcutaneous soft tissues. Although predominantly reported in central and west Africa, Australia, and Japan, new endemic regions for Buruli ulcer continue to be discovered. In Australia, the state of Victoria has seen a significant public health challenge with Buruli ulcer, where evidence points to zoonotic transmission from native possums to humans via mosquitoes. Recently, a new location of locally acquired Buruli ulcer has been identified in Batemans Bay, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Genome sequencing of cases in this area has revealed a distinct M. ulcerans genotype, suggesting the pathogen is extant in NSW similar to the situation in Victoria. Surveys of possum excreta in Batemans Bay have confirmed the presence of M. ulcerans, indicating its establishment in a local wildlife reservoir in a new endemic region.
