    "Background": "Human ascariasis is the most prevalent geohelminthiasis worldwide, affecting approximately 446 million individuals. In regions with endemic prevalence, the majority of infected adults are frequently exposed to the parasite and tend to have a low parasite load. Further studies are necessary to provide more evidence on the dynamics of infection and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in regulating protection, especially during the acute phase, also known as larval ascariasis. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of lung function between single and multiple infections in a murine model.",
    "Methods": "We infected BALB/c mice considering the frequency of exposures: single-exposure\u2014SI; twice-exposures\u2014RE 2x and thrice-exposures\u2014RE 3x, and considering the doses of infection: 25 eggs\u2014RE 25; 250 eggs\u2014RE 250 and 2,500 eggs\u2014RE 2500, followed by infection challenge with 2,500 eggs. From this, we evaluated: parasite burden in lungs, cellular and humoral response, histopathological and physiological alterations in lungs.",
    "Results": "The main results showed a reduction of parasite burden in the reinfected groups compared to the single-infected group, with protection increasing with higher exposure and dose. Furthermore, the RE 250 group exhibited a decrease of parasite burden close to RE 2500, but with less tissue damage, displaying the most favorable prognosis among the reinfected groups.",
    "Conclusion": "Our research indicates a dose-dependent relationship between antibody production and the intensity of the immune response required to regulate the parasite burden."
