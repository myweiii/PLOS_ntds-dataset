Human ascariasis is a common and neglected disease and is the most prevalent geohelminthiasis worldwide. In certain regions considered endemic, recurrent infections are frequent. This is mainly due to inadequate sanitation infrastructure and ineffective health education. This study aims to better understand the dynamics of Ascaris infection and thus elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the regulation of protection, especially during the acute phase, also known as larval ascariasis. To this end, we infected BALB/c mice with different frequencies of exposure and different doses of infection. We observed a reduction in larval recovery in the re-infected groups compared to the single-infection group. This protection increased with increasing exposure frequency and dose. In addition, we found that the production of antibodies and the intensity of the immune response appeared to be related to the regulation of parasite burden.
