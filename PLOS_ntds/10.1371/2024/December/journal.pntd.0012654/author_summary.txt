Scrub typhus is an acute infectious disease of natural epidemic origin caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. Scrub typhus is spread primarily through the bite of a chigger mite larva that carries Orientia tsutsugamushi. Itâ€™s clinical manifestations mainly include non-specific symptoms such as headache, fever, rash, cough, vomiting, muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes. It can lead to a variety of complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and myocarditis, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. Scrub typhus is prevalent globally in Southeast Asia, the Southwest Pacific Islands, Japan, and China, and is expanding. However, it remains a neglected infectious disease. We aim to understand the temporal and seasonal variations of scrub typhus in Yunnan Province, discover the high prevalence areas of scrub typhus and their seasonal patterns, so as to provide a basis for conducting targeted surveillance and health education in Yunnan Province, especially in high-risk areas.
