Recent nationwide epidemiological data on human intestinal microsporidiosis and parasites are scarce, especially among primary health care patients and in developed countries. Using novel data, we present an exhaustive epidemiology of intestinal parasites (IPs) in France and Luxembourg in 2022 from the primary health care patients. In this study, a high prevalence of IPs of 33.2% was found. Blastocystis sp. and Dientamoeba fragilis were the most frequently detected parasites, in 20.5% and 13.1% of patients, respectively. Considering only pathogenic parasites, the prevalence was 7.0%. Differences according to sex, region, season or age group were observed. Coinfection of two or more parasites was observed in 9.9% of patients. The use of molecular assays shows that IPs are underestimated in industrialized countries. The high prevalence of pathogenic IPs underlines the importance of investigating gastrointestinal disorders through parasite examination. The detection of parasites, pathogenic or not, remains a marker of the faecal-oral route of transmission and results should be interpreted accordingly.
