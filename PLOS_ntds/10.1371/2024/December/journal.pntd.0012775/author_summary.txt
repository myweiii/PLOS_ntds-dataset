Scabies is an infectious disease predominantly prevalent in tropical and humid regions, particularly affecting children and the elderly. The disease is caused by the infestation of Sarcoptes scabiei mite and transmitted through direct skin contact. Risk factors for this disease include overcrowding, poverty, and unclean water sources. The primary symptom is severe itching, which is more pronounced at night and can lead to insomnia. Scabies can significantly impact the quality of life and incur substantial treatment costs, making it a public health issue of considerable concern. However, research on scabies remains insufficient, and its patterns of prevalence and incidence require further exploration. The GBD study offers free, continuously updated data on hundreds of diseases, including scabies, providing scientific and reliable results. Using the latest high-quality GBD 2021 data, this study examined global scabies prevalence, incidence, and DALYs across different regions, genders, and age groups. Findings indicated that the burden remained high in tropical regions, children, and adolescents, despite some decline. Moreover, burden of scabies has increased in higher SDI regions, and individuals over 40 years old, particularly women and the elderly. This analysis provided a comprehensive overview of global scabies burden, revealing its recent trends and may be helpful in the formulation of scabies control policies.
