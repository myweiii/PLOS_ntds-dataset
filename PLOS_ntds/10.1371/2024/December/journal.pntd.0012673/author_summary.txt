In recent years, research into Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) has intensified; however, there remains a paucity of studies addressing SFTS through the lens of serum lipid metabolism. It is well-documented that lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in viral infections, as evidenced by numerous investigations across various viral diseases. Crucially, examining SFTS from the perspective of lipid metabolism not only enhances our understanding of viral pathogenesis but may also yield valuable insights for therapeutic interventions. This study provides a thorough examination of the serum lipid profiles in SFTS patients from a clinical perspective. Our findings first establish that SFTS patients exhibit significant lipid metabolic dysregulation compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses reveal a notable correlation between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) levels and the prognosis of SFTS patients. Finally, our research opens new avenues for future investigations into SFTS by emphasizing the importance of lipid metabolism.
