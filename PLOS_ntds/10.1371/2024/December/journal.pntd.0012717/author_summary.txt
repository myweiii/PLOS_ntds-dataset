Intestinal protist parasites are a major public health concern in sub-Saharan countries with limited access to safe drinking water and with poor sanitation infrastructures. Children are at higher risk of infection because of suboptimal personal hygiene practices and immature immune systems. Asymptomatic carriers of intestinal protists were common in children in Lusaka Province, Zambia and their role on the epidemiology and human-to-human spread of these pathogens may have been underestimated. In Zambia, all available epidemiological information on these pathogens comes from Lusaka Province, but virtually nothing is known from other geographical regions. More research should be conducted in these areas to ascertain the true epidemiology and public health impact on these pathogens in the country.
