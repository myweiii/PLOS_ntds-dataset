The COVID-19 pandemic led to massive changes in human behavior and hospital capacity, which also affected the way other infectious diseases, like dengue, spread and our ability to track infections. Several countries observed unusual dengue outbreaks in 2020, including Brazil. However, we do not fully understand how the pandemic altered dengue case counts in different parts of the country and whether changes in human mobility or hospital capacity were more impactful. In this study, we examined how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted dengue in each Brazilian state in March and April 2020. We also tried to understand whether these changes were caused by insufficient hospital capacity to monitor dengue infections or actual changes in the number of people who were infected. We found that 19 out of 25 states reported fewer dengue cases than expected, mainly because patients were less likely to seek medical care and hospitals had lower capacity to treat and report illnesses. However, states in the South experienced unusually large dengue outbreaks in 2020, which cannot be explained by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. By adjusting for under-reporting, our estimates provide a clearer picture of the true dengue burden in 2020, which is important to prepare for future outbreaks.
