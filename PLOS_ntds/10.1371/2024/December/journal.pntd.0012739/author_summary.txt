Malaria is an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily affecting tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Despite significant efforts to control malaria, the rates of illness and death are still important. In the Americas, Brazil, Venezuela, and Bolivia account for more than 50% of the cases. This study focuses on the Brazilian Amazon, where malaria is most prevalent, accounting for 99.5% of all reported cases in the country. We aimed to understand how malaria affects individuals’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in these endemic areas. Using the EQ-5D-3L instrument, we collected data from over 1,100 adults in endemic municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. We compare the EQ-5D-3L utility scores for those who recently had malaria with those who did not by means of Propensity Score Matching. Our findings revealed that individuals who recently had malaria experienced a significant reduction in HRQoL. Specifically, there was a 16.3% decrease in EQ-5D-3L utility for those affected by recent malaria episodes. These results highlight the urgent need for malaria prevention and treatment programs. Effective strategies and better access to healthcare are key in reducing the disease’s impact on individuals’ lives, especially in regions with challenging health environments, and poor socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure.
