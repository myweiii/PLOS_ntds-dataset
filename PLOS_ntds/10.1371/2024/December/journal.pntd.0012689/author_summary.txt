Human intestinal nematode infections (HINIs) pose a significant public health concern in Sri Lanka, especially among the deprived communities. Most Sri Lankan research information on HINIs over the years has been scattered and inconsistent, and many are not accessible to all. To address this issue, we conducted an extensive review of the literature from inception to September 2022. The review showed the first HINI to be recorded as hookworm infection, while all five HINI species were reported in Sri Lanka. In the early 1900s infection prevalence was over 90%, and a gradual decline in prevalence over the period was noted. Among the many measures taken to reduce the infection rates since the early part of the 20th century are the national deworming guidelines framed and implemented from 2012 onwards. The current islandwide prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection is less than 1%. Prevalence data on enterobiasis and strongyloidiasis are sparse and the current islandwide prevalence of these two species is not known. As all prevalence estimates were made using microscopic techniques, more sensitive diagnostic methods should be employed to understand the true picture of present low prevalence estimates. The burden of disease is highest in the hill country plantation sector and urban slum communities where living conditions and sanitary facilities are poor. The experiences and control measures implemented in Sri Lanka can offer valuable insights to other countries especially when facing limited resources and similar challenges.
