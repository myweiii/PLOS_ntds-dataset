Noma is a rapidly progressing and debilitating orofacial disease, primarily affecting vulnerable, malnourished children in impoverished regions. Ethiopia has seen increased cases of Noma since 2010, mainly through medical missions. Understanding the disease’s burden is essential for planning and prevention.
To assess Noma in Ethiopia, we conducted a rapid evaluation, including literature reviews, health sector assessments, and a retrospective analysis of confirmed cases from 2015–2022. Our findings show that Ethiopia lacks a standalone national policy on Noma, though the national health policy addresses poverty-related diseases. There is also no formal oral health program within primary care; dental services are limited to regional hospitals and the private sector.
The review identified 69 Noma cases reported between 2015 and 2020, mostly from two hospitals in the capital supported by NGOs. Cases were found across nearly all regions, with a concentration in Amhara. No acute Noma cases were recorded, and overall cases declined over the years.
This assessment underscores the need for enhanced public awareness, better training for health workers, and integrated control programs to address Noma through existing health systems.
