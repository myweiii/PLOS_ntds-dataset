Opossums are primary reservoirs of T. cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, mainly transmitted to mammals by triatomine insects. Besides the vectorial route, opossums, which may have the unique ability among mammals to harbor the infective form of the parasite in their anal glands, may be involved in alternative transmission routes. Additionally, recent findings suggest that Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) may vertically transmit T. cruzi, potentially increasing parasite prevalence within their populations and transmission risk via vectorial and non-vectorial routes. This makes opossums critical for studying T. cruzi transmission mechanisms, especially non-vector pathways. While T. cruzi has been detected in anal glands of various opossum species, transmission through gland secretions has only been confirmed in Didelphis marsupialis and D. albiventris. Moreover, if vertical transmission occurs in opossums, the mechanism remains unclear. We assessed the presence of T. cruzi in blood, anal gland secretions, and milk sampled in urban opossums from the metropolitan area of Merida, Yucatan, in southeastern Mexico. Detection of the parasite in anal gland secretions and milk suggests possible non-vectorial transmission routes. Absence of infection in offspring from infected opossum mothers, along with the observed tendency towards a lower parasite load in females with offspring, suggests that parasite load may constrain vertical transmission.
