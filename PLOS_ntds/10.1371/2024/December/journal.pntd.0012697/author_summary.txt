Dengue virus has four distinct serotypes and each serotype is further divided into distinct genotypes. There are currently two licensed dengue vaccines, Dengvaxia and QDENGA and we compared the genotypes of the circulating wild type (WT) dengue viruses (DENV) versus the genotypes of the strains of the two dengue vaccines. We also analyzed whether there were any amino acid changes in selected locations which have been previously identified as targets by potent virus neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which are considered important in vaccine development. We collected blood from patients diagnosed with dengue from 2014 to 2019 from the Philippines and sequenced the dengue RT-PCR positive samples. WT DENV all belonged to different genotypes versus the QDENGA vaccine and except for DENV-4, belonged to different genotypes versus the Dengvaxia strains. We detected several amino acid changes in the dengue envelope protein and in particular, among important mAbs targeted epitope positions among the 4 serotypes when we compared QDENGA and Dengvaxia vaccine sequences with WT DENV sequences. We observed that the DENV genotypes circulating in the Philippines from 2014â€“2019 had low complexity and the circulating clades were genetically distinct.
