After inoculation of the venom by a snake of the genus Bothrops, a series of changes occur around the site of the bite, as a direct effect of toxins producing tissue damage and changes in blood flow to the site associated to coagulation disorders. Current knowledge about histopathological changes resulting from snakebites is almost exclusively derived from experimental animal models. In this study, we describe the dermatopathological findings observed in a series of 22 patients diagnosed with Bothrops atrox envenomation treated in a tertiary hospital of Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon. We found relevant changes in all strata of the skin, with emphasis on hemorrhage, inflammatory infiltrate, edema, congestion, and vascular damage. Interestingly, we observed a persistence of inflammatory and vascular alterations days after antivenom administration, suggesting that antivenom may have limited efficacy in reversing or preventing local injury mechanisms, and that inflammation following those pathological processes plays a major role in the progression of tissue damage.
