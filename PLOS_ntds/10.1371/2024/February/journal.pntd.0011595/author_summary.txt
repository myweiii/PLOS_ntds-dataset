Insecticides are vital disease control tools against pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes. However, they are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. Among the molecular changes that contribute to resistance, increased production of enzymes that break down/sequester the insecticide is common. In Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which spread many arboviruses, over-expression of the carboxylesterase enzyme, CCEae3A, has been associated with resistance to certain insecticides used for vector control, particularly organophosphate compounds. However, multiple resistance enzymes/mechanisms are likely to be present in resistant mosquitoes at the same time. To examine the effect of CCEae3A expression in isolation, we utilised the An. gambiae mosquito with its convenient access to GAL4/UAS technology to regulate gene expression. This enabled production of CCEae3A in a normally insecticide-sensitive mosquito strain, permitting expression without interference from other resistance mechanisms. As anticipated, resistance to organophosphates was observed in larvae expressing CCEae3A. In adults, resistance was also found against compounds from organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticide classes, including two compounds for which there had been no previous association. As well directly linking CCEae3A expression to specific insecticide resistance, this transgenic line can be included in a panel expressing alternative enzymes to screen new insecticidal compounds for liability to existing resistance mechanisms.
