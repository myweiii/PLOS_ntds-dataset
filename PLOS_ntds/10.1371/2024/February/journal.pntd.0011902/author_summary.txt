Typhoid fever remains a significant health challenge in low- and middle-income nations, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A comprehensive understanding of the disease’s geospatial distribution is pivotal for its control—a gap previous studies overlooked. Addressing this, we undertook a study to chart the incidence of typhoid fever throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from 2000 to 2022, we developed high-resolution maps with a granularity of 20 km by 20 km, detailing the spatial distribution of typhoid incidence. Our findings reveal pronounced disparities in typhoid incidence across different geospatial tiers: from local communities to entire nations and regions. Particularly, Western and Eastern Africa registered the highest incidences, with children aged 5–14 years being the most vulnerable. Distinctively, countries such as South Sudan reported alarmingly high figures, whereas Zimbabwe had notably fewer cases. Such insights are indispensable for health policymakers at local, national, and global levels. Pinpointing the areas hardest hit by typhoid allows for a more strategic allocation of resources and interventions. Armed with this data, we’re better positioned to fight typhoid effectively and safeguard lives in sub-Saharan Africa.
