Spotted fever group rickettsiae infect endothelial cells of humans and animals with spotted fever rickettsiosis. Severe infection is associated with marked blood vessel permeability. We showed in vitro that certain calcium-active drugs, such as calcium channel blockers can stabilize or reverse vascular permeability in vitro. This prompted a preclinical study of the calcium channel blocker benidipine in a spotted fever rickettsiosis mouse model designed to yield 50% deaths. While benidipine did not reliably stabilize vascular permeability in this model, itâ€™s use led to a significant dose-dependent increase in animal deaths and a marked loss in the control of rickettsial infections, also associated with a significant reduction in the ability to mount an early innate immune response. Hypothetically, this reflected diminished Ca2+ signaling and reduced innate immune cell activation. Thus, we also showed impaired R. parkeri antigen T cell activation in the presence of benidipine in vitro providing support. These findings are distinct in outcome from recent discussions of calcium channel blocker benefits in viral and chronic infectious or inflammatory diseases. A role for calcium channel blockers in exacerbation of human rickettsiosis and acute inflammatory infections should be evaluated.
