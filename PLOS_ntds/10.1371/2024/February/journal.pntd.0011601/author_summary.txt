The sand flea (Tunga penetrans), is the cause of a tropical parasitic skin disease (tungiasis) that is severely neglected by scientists and policy makers yet it affects millions of people in the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa. The adult female sand flea burrows into the skin, especially in the feet where it grows and expels hundreds of eggs that than develop off-the host on the ground. These environmental off-host stages are responsible for constant re-infection even if a person was medically treated. It was not known up to date where exactly the off-host stages are. Our study provides for the first time direct evidence that indoor floors, specifically those where people with tungiasis sleep, are hotspots for sand flea development and consequently for tungiasis transmission in East Africa. Based on our results, we recommend the interruption of the life cycle and hence prevent re-infection with locally targeted environmental prevention measures such as improving indoor floors with sealed and easily cleanable surfaces or the application of insecticides on indoor floor surfaces.
