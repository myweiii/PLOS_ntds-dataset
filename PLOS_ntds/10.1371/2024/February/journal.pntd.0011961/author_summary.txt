Chagas disease, present on all continents, in HIV-infected patients with cellular immunodeficiency may lead to the multiplication of T. cruzi. Reactivation of Chagas disease is life-threatening, occurring in immunosuppressed patients and diagnosed by parasite detection in blood or tissues. Here, we employed the quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to detect the increase of parasite copies in the blood and other biological fluids.
Twelve HIV-coinfected patients with increased parasitemia without reactivation and ten patients with Chagas disease reactivation were selected for antiparasitic treatment and compared with 38 HIV-coinfected untreated patients with low parasitemia. Antiparasitic treatment changed positive parasitemia to negative in 77.3% of treated patients, with or without reactivation, whereas 19% of untreated cases changed from positive to negative parasitemia, after 92 and 76 months of follow-up, respectively. Two patients with reactivation died before ten days of treatment, suggesting that the diagnosis and treatment were quite late. We recommend parasitemia monitoring by qPCR and point out the value of antiparasitic treatment to coinfected T. cruzi/HIV patients with high levels of parasites in the blood, alongside early antiretroviral introduction. We also suggest early antiparasitic treatment for all coinfected patients and the analysis of the role of benznidazole in the reduction of parasitemia and control of Chagas disease evolution.
