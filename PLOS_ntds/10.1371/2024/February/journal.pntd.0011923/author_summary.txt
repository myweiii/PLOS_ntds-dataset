Dengue fever, a widespread viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is caused by the dengue virus (DENV). In our study, we explored how DENV infection affects human macrophages, crucial immune cells in our body. By analyzing the metabolic changes within these cells during DENV infection and its antibody-dependent enhancement, we uncovered a metabolic landscape characterized by significant alterations.
Our findings revealed a shift towards utilization of amino acids and increased production of carbohydrates and fatty acids, indicating an overall boost in cellular activity—a signature response to the virus’s replication demands and immune system activation triggered by the infection. Specifically, we identified 88 metabolic changes induced by DENV, with 36 showing notable statistical significance, highlighting decreased acylcarnitine and increased fatty acids and carbohydrates as prominent alterations. Importantly, our study identified 11 distinct metabolites significantly different between DENV infection alone and its enhancement by antibodies. These results strongly suggest that the virus not only facilitates its replication but also orchestrates anabolic processes that integrate viral growth with the host immune responses.
Understanding these metabolic dynamics during DENV infection could offer valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions in combating this prevalent and impactful disease.
