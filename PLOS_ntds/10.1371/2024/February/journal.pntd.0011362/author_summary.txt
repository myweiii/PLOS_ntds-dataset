Opisthorchis viverrini is a liver parasite contracted by consumption of raw fish which affects over 10 million people in Southeast Asia despite sustained control efforts, with heavy infections being a major risk factor for often fatal bile duct cancer. Efforts to reduce the worm burden in populations include education of individuals on the safe consumption of fish meals, improvement of sanitation to interrupt the parasitic life cycle and mass drug administration campaigns, where ideally all targeted individuals of a population receive a drug against the parasite without a prior test of whether they are infected.
We present a new agent-based mathematical model of Opisthorchis viverrini transmission and control. This model allows us to include systematic adherence to interventions, which describes the pattern of some individuals consistently being missed by interventions aimed at an entire (sub-)population. Our findings show how systematic adherence can explain the observed persistence of worm burden, but how interventions can be greatly beneficial even for individuals that systematically miss treatment. At the same time, we show the substantial opportunity to further reduce worm burden if patterns of systematic adherence can be overcome.
