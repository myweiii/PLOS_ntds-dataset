Ascariasis is the most common helminth infection and leads to significant global morbidity. Current therapies specifically target intraluminal adult intestinal worms and do not provide sufficient protection against the Ascaris larva. To reduce Ascaris-induced morbidity, novel interventions are needed that target Ascaris larval migration which calls for a better understanding of the Ascaris larval migration cycle. After oral ingestion of Ascaris eggs, previous studies have indicated that Ascaris larval migration initiates in the small intestine. However, our study demonstrates that Ascaris larva begin the migration cycle by hatching in the stomach by using the hostâ€™s acidic mammalian chitinase and stomach acid to help degrade the chitinous egg shell. The larvae subsequently translocate across the stomach mucosa in this mouse model. Our study provides the first insight that the gastric corpus microenvironment plays a critical role in Ascaris egg hatching and initiation of infection, and will aid in the identification of novel drug targets.
