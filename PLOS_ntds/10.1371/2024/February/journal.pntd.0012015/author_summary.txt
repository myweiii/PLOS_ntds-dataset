Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum. Immunosuppressive conditions such as those generated using immunosuppressive treatments (i.e., methotrexate), to treat autoimmune diseases have increased the risk of developing severe complications linked to this parasitic disease, especially in endemic areas. Of note, treatment of VL in immunosuppressed patients is very challenging and frequently results in clinical relapse. For these reasons, it is capital to better understand any potential impact of the use of immunosuppressants on the antileishmanial effect of current drugs (i.e. antimonials) and their potential contribution to the emergence and spread of drug resistance. Here we report the first evidence of the potential co-selection of antimicrobial resistance between antimonials and methotrexate in L. infantum circulating strains. In addition to shedding some light on the causes of treatment failure and relapses in patients under methotrexate immunosuppression, this new knowledge could assist in the development of better immunosuppression strategies in endemic areas of leishmaniasis.
