The WHO prequalified two typhoid conjugate vaccines for use to reduce the burden of typhoid fever. As policymakers design vaccination strategies, accurate, high-resolution estimates of typhoid burden are crucial for efficient use of the vaccines. Typhoid burden can vary widely; for example, in Bangladesh, burden is high in the urban capital city Dhaka, but is 100-fold lower in the rural site, Mirzapur. Optimal local data rely on traditional blood-culture-based surveillance, which is expensive and often unavailable. With the knowledge that Salmonella Typhi, cause of typhoid fever, is a water-borne pathogen, we tested an environmental surveillance tool that detects bacteriophages (viruses) against Salmonella Typhi in environmental water bodies using simple assays. Testing of 303 water samples from Dhaka and Mirzapur showed a 10-fold lower abundance of bacteriophages in Mirzapur, depicting a correlation with typhoid burden in the community. This low-cost surveillance can be employed in different regions to generate rapid data on typhoid burden for evidence-based introduction of vaccines and tracking their impact upon rollout.
