Trypanosoma cruzi is a single cell eukaryotic parasite that infects humans and animals. Infection can result in Chagas disease, a debilitating chronic disease that frequently affects the heart. The major downside of the current treatments is their side-effects, which frequently prevent patients from completing their treatment course. New, safer medicines are therefore urgently needed. Here we sought to enable the development of new medicines by identifying inhibitors of a key parasite enzyme; acidic M17 leucyl-aminopeptidase (LAPTc). We identified 28 LAPTc inhibitors, among more than 3000 compounds tested. The most potent inhibitor, compound 4, inhibited parasite growth and did not inhibit the equivalent human aminopeptidase. Using computational tools, we predicted how this compound binds to the enzyme. Our results indicate that the LAPTc inhibitors could be considered for further development as antiparasitic agents for the treatment of Chagas disease.
