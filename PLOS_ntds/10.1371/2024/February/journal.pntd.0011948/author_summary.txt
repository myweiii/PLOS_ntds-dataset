Upon its emergence in the Americas in late 2013, chikungunya virus spread rapidly, leading to >2 million suspected autochthonous chikungunya cases between 2014–2015. Much of what we know about chikungunya is derived from adult populations, leading to gaps in guidelines to treat pediatric chikungunya cases. To address these gaps, we assembled a large cohort of both pediatric (n = 612) and adult (n = 158) laboratory-confirmed (n = 682) or clinically/epidemiologically probable (n = 88) chikungunya cases from two distinct epidemics in 2014 and 2015 in Managua, Nicaragua, followed these patients over a two-year timeframe, and analyzed chikungunya-associated arthralgia using rigorous statistical approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the pediatric (0–15 years old [y/o]) population faces a previously unappreciated high burden of post-acute chikungunya-associated arthralgia. Further, we observed that post-acute arthralgia presents differently between pediatric and adult cases (16+ y/o). The difference between the two groups was evident when comparing distribution of polyarthralgia across the body parts and when analyzing the persistence of arthralgia >10 days post-fever onset. Using detailed longitudinal data, our findings provide insight into long-term chikungunya-associated arthralgia across age, sex, body parts, and the different phases of chikungunya. We believe these findings will inform clinical guidelines regarding chikungunya-associated arthralgia across all ages.
