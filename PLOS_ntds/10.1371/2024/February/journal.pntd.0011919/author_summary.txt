The study highlights the significance of passive tick surveillance data collected by Forest Inventory and Analysis crews in providing valuable information into the presence and distribution of ticks in the southeastern United States. We used ecological niche modeling and generalized linear models to assess the geographic regions and temporal periods associated with where and when ticks are likely to be encountered. In the region, ticks remain active throughout the year with their distribution influenced by climatic and topographical factors. Of interest, maximum temperature was a significant environmental variable for all three species suggesting that distributions may be altered as the climate warms. Elevation and landcover were important variables for both Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis, whereas Ixodes scapularis populations were correlated with evapotranspiration, vegetation indices, and soil organic matter. The research also identified new tick occurrence records providing data in a region with minimal infrastructure for tick surveillance, but with many ticks and tick-borne diseases. Continued long-term passive surveillance with collaborations with academic and government partnerships will help monitor tick distribution changes resulting from landscape and temperature changes which affect public health risks.
