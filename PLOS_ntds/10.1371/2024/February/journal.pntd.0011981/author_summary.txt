Previous studies on Chagas disease in the Orinoco region primarily focused on domestic and peri-domestic areas of rural residences. However, to fully grasp the dynamics of T. cruzi transmission from natural, preserved areas to humans, it is crucial to comprehend the habitats and food resources that kissing bugs encounter in their natural distribution zones. In this study, we delved into both the habitat conditions and the food sources available on wild palms in the eastern plains region of Colombia, with the aim of understanding the establishment of the Chagas disease vector. Notably, our findings revealed that the studied kissing bugs fed on both wild and domestic animals, as well as humans, across all stages of their development. Furthermore, this research identified differences in the structural physiognomy of wild palms directly linked to the establishment of bug colonies. This knowledge enhances our understanding of the role of wild habitats in the dynamics of T. cruzi transmission in endemic areas.
