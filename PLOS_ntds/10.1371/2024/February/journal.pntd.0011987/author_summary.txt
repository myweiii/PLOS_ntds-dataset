Clonorchis sinensis, a trematode of the Opisthorchiidae family, is a genus of zoonotic parasite and liver fluke. This species specifically resides in the bile ducts of humans and mammals during its adult stage. Known as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Clonorchis sinensis has gained recognition for its association with cholangiocarcinoma. The occurrence of Clonorchis sinensis and its transmission to humans heavily relies on geographical factors and the dietary preferences of its hosts. Individuals, along with other definitive hosts, contract the parasite by consuming raw or undercooked freshwater fish or shrimp that harbor infective metacercariae. A study indicated that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma combined with Clonorchis sinensis infection have a worse prognosis after hepatectomy. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of Clonorchis sinensis infection with spontaneous rupture Hepatocellular Carcinoma(srHCC). We have retrospectively analyzed the infection rate of srHCC. We found that 19.7% of patients with srHCC had a combination of Clonorchis sinensis infection. We also found that srHCC patients with Clonorchis sinensis infection have a worse prognosis after hepatectomy. This is a single center study, hopefully lending guidance the prognosis of srHCC with Clonorchis sinensis.
