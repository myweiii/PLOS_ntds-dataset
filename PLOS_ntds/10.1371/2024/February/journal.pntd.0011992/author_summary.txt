Neglected tropical diseases, such as schistosomiasis, which is caused by parasitic worms, represent serious public health problems in many countries around the world. Schistosoma mansoni is the major parasitic platyhelminth species causing intestinal schistosomiasis. Currently the control of schistosomiasis is heavily reliant on the drug praziquantel (PZQ) that it is unfortunately not highly effective against larval and immature worm stages. The use of PZQ in mass treatment programs means that the development of resistance is likely, therefore identifying novel drug targets and their associated compounds is critical. Drugs that inhibit enzymes that modify the chromatin structure have been developed for several diseases. We and others have shown that S. mansoni epigenetic enzymes are also potential therapeutic targets. Here, we evaluate and characterize several histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors on the larval and adult stage of Schistosoma mansoni and report the anti-parasitic profile of these compounds. Some of the HDAC inhibitors tested showed potent effects, particularly NF2839, that impacts larval and adult parasites as well as egg viability and maturation. The findings of this study provide a starting point for the development of new HDAC-based schistosomicidal compounds.
