As a neglected disease, rabies remains a major problem in Africa and Asia. Here we report the results of an extensive community survey on dog ownership and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to rabies control and prevention, covering the Northern Communal Areas (NCAs) of Namibia. The survey conducted in 2021 included more than 3,700 households and provided useful insights that will inform interventions in order to improve human rabies prevention and Namibia’s dog rabies control strategy. Our results show that there was 1 dog for about every 5 humans, of which the vast majority is free-roaming. This surprisingly high dog population is not only supporting disease transmission but further complicating control efforts. Most people were aware that dog-mediated rabies is present in this part of Namibia and had an acceptable attitude and behavior towards it. Depending on the region, between 262 and 1,369 people per 100,000 inhabitants were bitten by dogs during the survey period. Although the number of dog bites is relatively high, more than 90% of victims stated that they had sought hospital treatment after being bitten. However, there are still gaps in laboratory-based surveillance of dog-mediated rabies, and incomplete or lack of rabies prophylaxis after dog bite injuries have led to unreported human deaths. Therefore, improved vaccination measures for dogs, consistent rabies prophylaxis after dog bite injuries as well as awareness-raising measures to increase people’s knowledge and awareness are necessary if human deaths caused by rabies are to be permanently prevented.
