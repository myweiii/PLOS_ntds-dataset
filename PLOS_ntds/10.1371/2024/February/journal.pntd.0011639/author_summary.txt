Oral vaccination of rabies reservoir and spill-over species is the key to control the disease and prevent human rabies. In the past, baits containing live-attenuated rabies vaccines decreased significantly carnivore-mediated rabies in Central and Western Europe as well as North America. However, certain susceptible species are refractory to the oral immunization using so far licensed vaccines. Our vector vaccine based on avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has the potential to contribute to the targeted rabies eradication as it was safe and immunogenic after oral administration in goats and foxes. A single vaccine application elicited a rabies virus (RABV) specific systemic humoral immune response in the majority of the vaccinated animals as well as RABV specific T cells in some of the vaccinated animals. NDV can be manufactured at low-cost using already existing infrastructure of influenza vaccines, opening new possibilities especially for middle- and low-income countries that suffer under the economically burden of rabies.
