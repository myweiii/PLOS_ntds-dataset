Intestinal worm infections, also known as soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, are a significant public health concern that can impair physical growth, lead to anemia, and affect cognitive development among children. Initial surveys in Uganda between 1998 and 2005 showed a high prevalence of STH infections, with over 50% of school-aged children affected in many districts. In response, the Ugandan Ministry of Health initiated biannual deworming campaigns targeting school-aged children, along with health education programs.
Our follow-up surveys in November 2023 across five districts aimed to evaluate the impact of these deworming campaigns on the prevalence of STH infections. We found a substantial decrease in STH prevalence in four districts, suggesting that the national deworming program has been effective and could potentially reduce the frequency of deworming campaigns in these areas. However, in Kamwenge District, the STH prevalence remained elevated, indicating a need for further investigation to understand the persistence of infections and to enhance control measures to meet World Health Organization targets.
