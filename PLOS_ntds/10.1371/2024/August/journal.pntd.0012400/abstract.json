    "Background": "Geographically targeted Taenia solium ring approaches consisting of treating individuals within a radius of 100-meter of a cysticercosis positive pig have been trialled in Peru. This study explored if a similar approach could be proposed to control T. solium transmission in a post elimination setting in Zambia, focussing on community membersâ€™ willingness to be sampled and treated.",
    "Methodology and Principal findings": "The study was conducted in a community where elimination of active T. solium transmission was achieved. All eligible pigs and people were sampled, at 4- to 6-monthly intervals, followed by implementation of the ring treatment approach. This implied that whenever a pig was seropositive for cysticercosis during sampling, every human and pig residing in a radius of 50-meters of the seropositive pig would be treated. The results of the positive human stool samples were used to create the rings, whenever no pigs were positive.",
    "Conclusions": "Participants were willing to participate and get treatment, once the rings were opened. However, the utility of ring treatment approaches in a post elimination setting needs further evaluation, given the lack of highly accurate diagnostic tools for porcine cysticercosis and the challenges in obtaining stool samples. The ring treatment approach adopted should be further improved before recommendations to public health authorities can be given."
