Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a genital manifestation of a waterborne parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma haematobium, however, it is mostly neglected. FGS diagnosis is still a challenge due to the lack of reference standards for its diagnosis. Colposcope has been used as a standard for diagnosing FGS, it shows the FGS clinical findings on the cervix and vagina. However, FGS diagnosis by colposcope has not been feasible in most rural endemic settings due to its unavailability, low level of knowledge of its use for diagnosing FGS, and low FGS knowledge among healthcare workers. Thus, there is a need to develop an alternative cheap diagnostic tool to be used in endemic areas for identifying women and adolescent girls at high risk of having FGS lesions and referring them for colposcopy examination. This call has been given more weight by the WHO in its roadmap plan for ending Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) by 2030. In response to this call, this study determined the sensitivity and specificity of the risk factors and symptoms checklist (variables), and the prevalence of FGS by both colposcope and risk factors and symptoms checklist using a score point of 7 as a cut-off point to suspect FGS. Furthermore, we also determined the prevalence of S. haematobium infection using a urine filtration technique and determined the symptoms and risk factors of urogenital schistosomiasis among women in selected villages of Maswa district, north-western Tanzania. The findings of this study demonstrated a high prevalence of FGS in the current study population using both methods/diagnoses. There is a need for further evaluation of the performance of the risk and symptoms questionnaire to improve its performance. Furthermore, there is a need to integrate the FGS services into a wide spectrum of reproductive health services, to allow women with urogenital symptoms to receive treatment.
