Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected vector-borne infectious disease with a systemic and chronic involvement that is lethal when untreated. Para-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (para-KDL) is a complication of VL, in which the patient presents with dermatological and visceral manifestations simultaneously. Para-KDL cases are of significant epidemiological importance, as humans act as a source of infection in parasite transmission. In the Americas, Brazil accounts for over 90% of VL cases. Nevertheless, reports of para-KDL remain scarce. This paper presents three cases of VL-HIV co-infection with Leishmania-containing skin lesions resembling para-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. The three cases exhibit similarities in terms of signs and symptoms, diagnostic criteria for AIDS, and the presence of active VL with skin lesions. The study contributes to the understanding of the epidemiological profile of para-PKDL cases in Brazil. It highlights the significance of multidisciplinary follow-up and secondary prophylaxis for patients with VL and emphasizes the need for more effective clinical management strategies for these patients.
