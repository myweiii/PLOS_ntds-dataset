Leprosy and lymphatic filariasis (LF) are severe tropical diseases that affect over 1 billion people worldwide, especially in poor regions. In Mozambique, where 11 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are common, there is limited information about the impact of leprosy and LF on peopleâ€™s mental and social wellbeing. The current study, which occurred in northern Mozambique, with support from NLR Mozambique and health authorities, aims to understand this impact. The research team examined mental distress, participation restriction and stigma using surveys and interviews.
In total, 127 persons affected by leprosy and 184 persons affected by LF were included in the quantitative portion of the study. In addition, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted. Our findings showed that many participants face mental distress (70%), participation restriction (55%) and health-related stigma (86%), with the severity of leprosy and LF linked to greater challenges. Moreover, our analysis revealed that disability, stigma and marital status played a significant role in the presence or absence of psychosocial challenges. Participation in self-care groups was suggested to have a positive impact on mental and social wellbeing.
Despite some limitations, our study highlights the urgent need for better mental and social support for persons affected by disabling NTDs. It is crucial to address mental health, promote inclusion and adapt services to local needs. To this end, we recommend more research with diverse groups and suggest the integration of mental health care into programmes for NTDs. This study emphasises the importance of looking after the overall wellbeing of those affected by leprosy and LF in Mozambique.
