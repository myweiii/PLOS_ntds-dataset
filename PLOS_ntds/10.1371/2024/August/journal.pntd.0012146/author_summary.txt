Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) of African lineage has the potential to cause epidemics alongside a high risk of fetal pathogenicity. Improved surveillance has enabled a deeper understanding of the molecular characteristics of currently circulating viral strains from sub-Saharan Africa. A remarkable conservation of ZIKV NS1 protein has been identified between recently isolated viral strains from West Africa, with data indicating that contemporary African NS1 is secreted efficiently from human cells. The protein has been shown to enhance viral replication, associated with a reduced activation of innate immune responses. The NS1 protein might therefore play a major role in the pathogenicity of contemporary ZIKV from sub-Saharan Africa.
