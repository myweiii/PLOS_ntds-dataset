Rabies, a deadly zoonotic disease, remains a public health concern in Tunisia despite ongoing prevention efforts. Our study, the first of its kind in Tunisia, aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of dog rabies and identify factors influencing its spread. Using a Bayesian approach, we examined the relationships between epidemiological, socio-economic, and environmental factors and the occurrence of rabies cases in different regions (delegations) of Tunisia. Our study revealed that variations in the risk of rabies were primarily associated with spatial effects rather than temporal trends. We found a negative association between average monthly temperature and dog rabies cases, consistent with decreased viral survival and dog activity in warmer temperatures. The risk of rabies cases had a non-linear relationship with dog density. We also found that dog rabies risk was positively associated with the density of slaughterhouses, indicating that these locations might contribute to interactions between infected and susceptible animals. Surprisingly, vaccination coverage did not show a significant association with rabies risk. Our findings contribute to the global goal of eradicating rabies by 2030 and underscore the importance of adapting strategies based on the unique factors influencing disease transmission in specific regions.
