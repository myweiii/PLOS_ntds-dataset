We examined the sensitivity and the time-to-result of a cascaded pooled testing approach for detecting and estimating the intensity of Schistosoma haematobium infection. Urine samples collected from school-aged children in the Afar and Gambella regions of Ethiopia were analyzed individually and in pools using both urine filtration microcopy (UFM) and urine reagent strips (URS). The cascaded pooled testing approach detected close to 52% of urine samples with S. haematobium eggs. The sensitivity increased as the egg count of the individual samples increased but was comparable when the amount of urine examined was 10 mL vs. 15 mL, and when the diagnostic test used was UFM vs. URS. Pooled testing reduced the time needed for processing urine samples and counting S. haematobium eggs by 29%. Pooled testing based on UFM may help rapidly identify areas with higher prevalence of S. haematobium infection in a population.
