    "Abstract": "Podoconiosis is a non-infectious, neglected tropical disease caused by chronic barefoot contact with irritant volcanic soils. It typically presents with lower limb swelling, disfigurement, and chronic disability. Patients and their families experience stigma from their communities. Depression, anxiety, and emotional distress contribute to the total illness burden of podoconiosis. This study used a survey-based comparative cross-sectional quantitative study design involving podoconiosis patients, their family members, and unaffected neighbors. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS 21), the WHO Quality of Life Scale (WHO-QOL Brief), and the Tekola clinical staging system were used to collect data. We surveyed 741 participants (33.1% patients, 33.3% family, 33.5% neighbors). Podoconiosis patients exhibited significantly elevated odds of severe depression (19.8x), anxiety (10.7x), and stress symptoms (13.5x) in comparison to unaffected neighbors. Family members of podoconiosis patients displayed 1.5x higher odds of experiencing severe anxiety symptoms compared to unaffected neighbors. Higher clinical stages of podoconiosis were associated with increased severity of depressive symptoms. Podoconiosis patients demonstrated lower median scores across all domains of the WHO QoL Brief in contrast to family members and unaffected neighbors. The burden of depression, anxiety, and stress on podoconiosis patients and their family members is high. Podoconiosis morbidity management programs need to encompass families of patients and integrate continuous mental health support within the broader framework of podoconiosis management."
