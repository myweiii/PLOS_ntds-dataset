In this study, we examined the mental health ramifications of podoconiosis, a non-infectious neglected tropical disease caused by prolonged barefoot contact with irritant volcanic soils and affecting poor farming communities in the highlands of Africa, South America, and Asia. Podoconiosis, characterized by lower limb swelling, skin changes, and chronic disability, subjects patients and their families to significant stigma and seclusion. Our comparative cross-sectional study involved podoconiosis patients, their family members, and unaffected neighbors. Using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, as well as the WHO Quality of Life Scale—Brief, we assessed each group’s mental health and quality of life status. The results were telling, podoconiosis patients displayed considerably higher odds of severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms while family members had higher anxiety compared to their unaffected neighbors. This stark mental health burden highlights the necessity for comprehensive podoconiosis morbidity management programs, incorporating mental health support for patients and their families.
