Schistosomiasis, commonly known as bilharzia, is the third most significant tropical disease after malaria and soil-transmitted helminthiases. Like other neglected tropical diseases common in Zimbabwe, schistosomiasis remains mostly undiagnosed or undetected. This is partly due to the fact that reliable identification of parasites requires expertise for specimen preparation, and microscopic examination. Unfortunately, this level of expertise is unavailable in most rural clinics. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the recommended microscopy-based methods for schistosomiasis diagnosis lack sensitivity, especially in infections of low intensity. To overcome some of the problems associated with microscopy-based methods, highly sensitive serological tests have been utilized. Unfortunately, currently available serological tests have low specificity and show cross-reactivity with other helminthic infections. One way to mitigate cross-reactivity and increase the specificity, is to use immunoinformatic tools and immunoassays to identify schistosomiasis species-specific immunogenic peptides mimicking B-cell epitopes (short amino acid sequences of the antigen that reacts with antibodies). Utilizing immunoinformatic tools coupled with peptide microarray immunoassay validation approach several peptides that can be used to develop diagnostic tools for showing exposure to infection for people living in non-endemic or low-transmission areas were identified in the current study.
