Our study evaluates the interplay of immune responses in individuals coinfected with HIV and neurocysticercosis (NCC) in resource-limited settings. We analyzed cytokine profiles among 234 participants, discovering that HIV infection significantly modulates various key cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, and IFN-γ. Notably, our results indicate that while HIV has a dominant influence on cytokine levels, it does not cause additional cytokine alterations specifically due to NCC. This suggests that the immunomodulatory effects of NCC are minimal in the presence of HIV, pointing to the overarching impact of HIV on the immune system. Our findings emphasize the complexity of immune responses in coinfected individuals and underscore the critical role of effective antiretroviral therapy. Insights from our study are crucial for refining therapeutic strategies in managing such complex coinfections in endemic regions.
