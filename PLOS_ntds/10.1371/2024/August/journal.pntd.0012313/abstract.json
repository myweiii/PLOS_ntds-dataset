    "Abstract": "Human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a zoonotic tick-borne bacterial infection caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. While most cases are reported from North America, HGA has been recognized as an emerging disease in several regions of the world in recent decades. Most available data comes from case reports, case series and retrospective studies, while prospective studies and clinical trials are largely lacking. To obtain a clearer picture of the currently known epidemiologic distribution, clinical and paraclinical presentation, diagnostic aspects, complications, therapeutic aspects, and outcomes of HGA, we systematically reviewed the literature and analyzed and summarized the data."
