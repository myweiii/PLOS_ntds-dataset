Human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum which is transmitted by tick bites. While often asymptomatic, symptomatic disease usually presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, exhaustion, headaches, and muscle aches. Response to antibiotic treatment is usually fast and effective, and although complications may arise, most patients experience a favorable outcome. Most cases of HGA are reported from North America, but since the first description of HGA in 1994, cases of HGA have been reported worldwide. Since most available data on HGA comes from case reports, case series and retrospective studies, data on several aspects of the disease remains patchy. To obtain a better overview on various aspect of HGA we systematically reviewed the existing literature and compiled and analyzed the reported data on epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of HGA. By compiling and comparing data from different sources, we aimed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of HGA.
