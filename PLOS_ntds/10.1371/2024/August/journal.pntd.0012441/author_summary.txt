The ownership of pets, especially dogs, is widespread in South Korea, with millions of people choosing them as companions. However, there is a lack of research on the composition of organisms from dog feces and the identification of potential disease-causing pathogens that can affect both dogs and humans. Understanding these risks is crucial as many infectious diseases can be transmitted from animals to humans. In this study, we used metabarcoding techniques to analyze the fecal organisms of pet and stray dogs in Seoul, South Korea. We found significant differences in the microbiota composition between stray and pet dogs, and we identified putative bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter, Campylobacter, and Fusobacterium, and eukaryotic pathogens, such as Giardia, Pentatrichomonas, and Cystoisospora. The prevalence of these putative pathogens was higher in stray dogs compared to pet dogs. These findings emphasize the importance of public health planning and zoonotic disease control, particularly in densely populated urban areas where the risk of zoonotic pathogens associated with dogs is amplified. It is crucial to educate pet owners and the general public about the potential risks associated with exposure to dog feces and contaminated environments.
