Loa loa is a vector borne, filarial worm affecting an estimated 20 million people in Central and West Africa. Long considered a benign infection, more recently it has been associated with substantial morbidity and increased mortality in individuals with high L. loa microfilaraemia, prompted to reconsider the importance this infection and investigate the potential pathophysiological mechanisms. The spleen has a central role in the response to pathogens, including parasites; therefore, its dysfunction may lead to an increase in the risk and severity of infectious diseases, which might contribute to the observed excess mortality in hypermicrofilaremic loiasis. The presence of spleen centimetric nodules, originating from degradation of microfilariae, in humans and animals infected with L. loa, has been described, but the long-term consequences of this process on individuals chronically exposed to infection in terms of spleen function are unknown. In this study performed in individuals with L. loa infection living in highly endemic areas of Gabon, we found a prevalence of 3.4% spleen nodules in microfilaraemic participants, while no such lesions were observed in symptomatic amicrofilaraemic participants. Nodules were transitory and appeared to be a rather benign phenomenon in terms of impact on spleen morphology and function.
