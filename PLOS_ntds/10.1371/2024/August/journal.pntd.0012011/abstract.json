    "Abstract": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important zoonotic viral disease affecting several species of domestic and wild ruminants, causing major economic losses and dozens of human deaths in various geographical areas of Africa, where it is endemic. Although it is not present in Europe, there is a risk of its introduction and spread linked to globalisation and climate change. At present, the only measure that could help to prevent the disease is vaccination of flocks in areas at risk of RVF. Available live attenuated vaccines are an effective means of controlling the disease, but their use is often questioned due to residual virulence, particularly in susceptible hosts such as pregnant sheep. On the other hand, no vaccine is currently licensed for use in humans. The development of safe and effective vaccines is therefore a major area of research. In previous studies, we selected under selective mutagenic pressure a highly attenuated RVFV 56/74 virus variant called 40Fp8. This virus showed an extremely attenuated phenotype in both wild-type and immunodeficient A129 (IFNARKO) mice, yet was still able to induce protective immunity after a single inoculation, thus supporting its use as a safe, live attenuated vaccine. To further investigate its safety, in this work we have analysed the attenuation level of 40Fp8 in immunosuppressed mice (A129) when administered by the intranasal route, and compared it with other attenuated RVF viruses that are the basis of vaccines in use or in development. Our results show that 40Fp8 has a much higher attenuated level than these other viruses and confirm its potential as a candidate for safe RVF vaccine development."
