Leprosy affects various organs in addition to skin, eyes and peripheral nerves. Testicular involvement in leprosy patients is common and causes disturbance in endocrine function of the testis and results in hypogonadism.
Mycobacterium leprae reach the testicles through skin tissue invasion, blood or the lymphatic system, and the testes can serve as a reservoir for Mycobacterium leprae. A lower testicular temperature than internal body temperature may promote M. leprae growth in the testicle. It causes thickening and constriction of vessels, interstitial fibrosis, hyalinization and obliteration of seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells. These cause low testosterone productions among leprosy patients.
The prevalence and risk factors of hypogonadism among male leprosy patients vary in different settings. In this study area the prevalence of hypogonadism was 26.7%. Overweight and grade-II disability were identified as independent risk factors for hypogonadism.
