    "Introduction": "Schistosomiasis is a relatively neglected tropical disease caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma, mainly S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum [1]. This disease is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Asia, affecting more than 250 million people worldwide and causing at least 200,000 deaths every year [1\u20134]. Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent human schistosomiasis [1], and praziquantel (PZQ) is the only drug available for the treatment and control of schistosomiasis [1,3,4]. The extensive use of PZQ increases the probability of the emergence of drug resistance and worrisome data on reduced efficacy of PZQ have already been reported both in the laboratory and in the field, thus rendering the search for potential drug targets as well as novel drug candidates a strategic priority [1\u20134].\nSchistosome has a complex life cycle and undergoes asexual proliferation and sexual reproduction. Significant morphological and metabolic changes in different developmental stages imply the existence of subtle epigenetic control of gene expression [5\u20137]. In addition, parasites and cancer cells have several common features, such as high metabolic and reproductive activity and the use of epigenetic processes to escape host immune surveillance [8,9]. Thus, targeting the epigenome with epidrugs developed for cancer pathologies has been considered a new promising strategy for the treatment of schistosomiasis and other parasitic diseases [9\u201311]. One of the most investigated posttranslational modifications is histone acetylation, where writers, readers and erasers work together to control the acetylation state of histones and consequently the transcription and expression level of different genes [12]. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) recognized as epigenetic writers, catalyze the acetylation of histone lysine residues, which annul the positive charge of the lysine and reduce chromatin compaction, favoring transcription, whereas deacetylation, via the erasers of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has the opposite effect [13]. Relevant epigenetic targets for antischistosomal effects, such as SmHDAC8 and SmSIRT2, have been identified in S. mansoni [14,15]. Among them, SmHDAC8 appears to be a valuable target because it is the most abundant isoform in S. mansoni and has specific and vital functions in the parasite cell cycle. Furthermore, its downregulation compromises the capacity of schistosomula to survive and become mature worms in infected mice [14,16]. However, compared with those on HDAC inhibitors, few studies on HAT inhibitors against schistosomes are currently available. Carneiro et al [17] applied a variety of technical and biological approaches to verify that histone acetylation by SmCBP1 and SmGCN5 creates the required epigenetic state for Smp14 transcriptional activation and eggshell formation. The HAT inhibitor PU139 prevents chromatin decondensation at the Smp14 promoter, which could further impair the production of normal S. mansoni eggs and affect the development of the female reproductive system [17]. In our previous study, we developed the patent compound DW-3-15 (patent no. ZL201110142538.2), a praziquantel (PZQ) derivative that has promising antischistosomal properties against all developmental stages of S. japonicum [18]. In the following study, we found that the S. japonicum HAT (SjHAT) protein level was significantly downregulated after treatment with DW-3-15 (S1 Table and S1 Fig). In this study, we assessed the schistosomicidal efficacy of three commercially available HAT inhibitors, including A485, C646 and curcumin. A 485 is a potent, selective and drug-like p300/CBP catalytic inhibitor that selectively inhibited proliferation across lineage-specific tumor types, including several hematological malignancies and androgen receptor positive prostate cancer [19]. C646 is a widely utilized competitive p300/CBP inhibitor [19\u201321]. Curcumin is a natural compound that directly inhibits p300 HAT activity in a transcription-independent manner [22,23]. In addition, more than one experiment has demonstrated that curcumin has potent schistosomicidal effect on schistosomes both in vitro and in vivo [24\u201326].\nIn this study, the antischistosomal activities of the three commercially available HAT inhibitors were compared with those of DW-3-15, with the aim of verifying whether SjHAT could be a potential target for developing novel antischistosomal agents.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAll animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All efforts were made to relieve the suffering of the experimental animals. The protocol (including mortality aspects) was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Soochow University (Permit Number: 2007\u201313).\n\n\nParasites and animals\nFemale ICR mice weighing 15\u201325 g were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Soochow University (Suzhou, China). All mice were raised under specific pathogen-free conditions with a controlled temperature of 22\u00b0C and photoperiod (12 h light, 12 h dark). Each mouse was transcutaneously infected with 60\u00b15 S. japonicum cercariae (a Chinese mainland strain) shedding from Oncomelania hupensis snails, which were provided by the Institute of Schistosomiasis Control in Jiangsu Province (Wuxi, China).\n\n\nReagents\nThe praziquantel derivative DW-3-15 was synthesized by WuXi App Tec Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The synthetic route of DW-3-15 was described by Wang et al. [27]. PZQ was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). A485, C646 and curcumin were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Shanghai, China). For in vitro treatment, all chemicals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Dulbecco\u2019s modified minimum Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The newborn calf serum was obtained from Biological Industries (Cromwell, CT, USA).\n\n\nIn vitro treatment\nWorms recovered from S. japonicum cercaria infected mice at 16 days (juvenile worm) and 35 days (adult worm) by perfusion of the hepatic portal system and mesenteric veins [28], were placed in 6-well plates (Corning Costar, Corning, New York, USA) containing DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Juvenile worms were divided into six groups, with five worms per well, each tested in triplicate, as follows: group I, untreated control, incubated with complete DMEM containing 0.1% DMSO; group II, treated with A485; group III, treated with C646; group IV, treated with curcumin; group V, treated with 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15; and group VI, treated with100 \u03bcM PZQ. Group II and group III were further subdivided into three subgroups and treated with ascending concentrations of A485 and C646 (10, 30 and 50 \u03bcM). Group IV was divided into five subgroups and treated with 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 \u03bcM curcumin. Adult worms separated by sex received the same treatment as juveniles. All the worms were exposed to different chemicals for approximately 16h, then washed three times with pre-warmed sterile saline, and subsequently cultured in drug-free medium. At 24, 48 and 72h post-incubation, worms were observed under a dissecting microscope (SZX16, Olympus, Japan), and viability scores were assigned as described previously [29]. Briefly, the viability score of each worm ranged from 0 to 3, where a score of 3 represents that the worm moves actively and softly and has a transparent body; a score of 2 represents that the worm moves its entire body but stiffly and slowly, with the body translucent; a score of 1 represents the parasite moves partially and has an opaque appearance; a score of 0 represents that the worm was \u2018dead\u2019. For each sample, the viability score was calculated by the following formula: viability score = \u2211(worm scores)/number of worms. Each experiment was repeated at least twice.\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy\nFor scanning electron microscopy (SEM), worms were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol followed by acetone. After that, the specimens were dried, mounted on aluminum stubs, coated with gold, and then examined with a Hitachi-S4700 scanning electron microscope (Chiyodaku, Japan).\n\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nAfter treatment, total RNA was extracted from cultured worms using the TRIzol RNA isolation reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The extracted total RNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the RevertAid First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit with Oligo (dT) 18 primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). A Real-Time PCR sequence detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The PCR products were amplified using 2\u00d7SYBR Green qRT-PCR Master Mix (Bimake, USA) with specific primers for the target genes (Table 1). The expression levels of all the transcripts were normalized to that of the housekeeping gene proteasome 26S subunit ubiquitin receptor, non-ATPase 4 (PSMD4) in the same samples.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using the software package SPSS 26.0. The viability score data were expressed as the mean and standard error (mean \u00b1 SE). One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences between multiple groups, and Dunnett\u2019s test was used to compare the differences between the two groups. A P value<0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance.",
    "Results": "Schistosomicidal effect of commercial HAT inhibitors against male adult worms in vitro\nAs shown in Table 2 and Fig 1, A485 and C646 had little effect on the viability of S. japonicum male adults in vitro. Even after treatment with 50\u03bcM A485 or 50\u03bcM C646 for 72 h, the viability reduction rates were 10% and 13.3%, respectively, and were not significantly different from that of the control group. In contrast, curcumin, demonstrated potent antischistosomal effects on male worms in vitro. The antischistosomal effect of curcumin was both concentration- and time dependent. With increasing curcumin concentrations (from 20 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM), the viability reduction rate of male decreased significantly after 24h of exposure (F(13,266) = 105.536, P<0.0001). Moreover, as the incubation time increased, the male worm survival rate decreased remarkably. The antischistosomal activity of curcumin at 100 \u03bcM for 24h was similar to that of PZQ (P = 1.000) and DW-3-15 (P = 0.992). After 48h and 72h of treatment with 100 \u03bcM curcumin, all worms died, which was consistent with the effect of 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15.\nAdult male worms were exposed to different concentrations of A485, C646, curcumin, PZQ and DW-3-15 for 72h in vitro. The viability was evaluated using a viability score of 0\u20133. The control group was incubated with complete DMEM with 0.1% DMSO. The data were presented as the means \u00b1 SEs from multiple-group experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significant differences were indicated by *P<0.05, **P<0.005 and #P<0.0001.\n\n\nSchistosomicidal effect of commercial HAT inhibitors against female adult worms in vitro\nAmong the three commercial HAT inhibitors, A485 and C646 demonstrated very little activity against female worms of S. japonicum, and the viability reduction rate did not exceed 15.0% after treatment with different doses of A485 and C646 for 72h. However, curcumin, could exert potent schistosomicidal effect on female worms in a dose- and time dependent manner. After 24 h of exposure, all the female worms died at the concentration of 100 \u03bcM curcumin. With the incubation period extended to 72h, the lethal dose of curcumin decreased to 40 \u03bcM. The schistosomicidal activity of curcumin against females was similar to that of 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15, but slightly greater than that of 100 \u03bcM PZQ (Table 3 and Fig 2).\nAdult female worms were exposed to different concentrations of A485, C646, curcumin, PZQ and DW-3-15 for 72h in vitro. The viability was evaluated using a viability score of 0\u20133. The control group was incubated with complete DMEM with 0.1% DMSO. The data were presented as the means \u00b1 SEs from multiple-group experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significant differences were indicated by *P<0.05, **P<0.001 and #P<0.0001.\n\n\nSchistosomicidal effect of commercial HAT inhibitors against juvenile worms in vitro\nAs shown in Table 4 and Fig 3, A485 had light effects on juvenile worms in vitro. After treatment with different concentrations of A485 for 24h, 48h and 72h, the reduction in viability of the juvenile worms was relatively low, ranging from 5.0% to 13.3%. C646 had light schistosomicidal activity against schistosomula. The viability reduction rate of juvenile worms ranged from 13.3% to 28.3%. However, all the worms survived after incubation with different concentrations of A485 and C646. Unlike in A485 and C646, curcumin had a prominent worm-killing effect on S. japonicum juveniles in vitro. With increasing concentrations of curcumin, the worm survival rate decreased significantly, and as the cultivation period increased to 72h, all the juveniles died at a concentration of 60 \u03bcM.\nJuveniles were exposed to different concentrations of A485, C646, curcumin, PZQ and DW-3-15 for 72h in vitro. The viability was evaluated using a viability score of 0\u20133. The control group was incubated with complete DMEM with 0.1% DMSO. The data were presented as the means \u00b1 SEs from multiple-group experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significant differences were indicated by *P<0.05, **P<0.005 and #P<0.0001.\nThe results showed that among the three commercial HAT inhibitors, curcumin had the most significant worm-killing effect on juveniles, male and female adult worms of S. japonicum in vitro. The schistosomicidal effect of curcumin was both dose- and time dependent.\n\n\nMorphological change analysis by SEM\nUnder SEM, male worms of S. japonicum from the control group showed normal ultrastructural features (Fig 4). The tegument of the worm was intact, and the crests with sensory papillae were uniformly arranged along the body (Fig 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E and 4F). Apically directed spines with sensory papillae were distributed uniformly in the ventral sucker (Fig 4D). After treatment with 100 \u03bcM curcumin, the whole male worm swelled and shrank (Fig 5A), and the gynecophoral canal was severely injured with obvious swelling. Many hole-shaped erosions appeared on the outer wall of the gynecophoral canal (Fig 5B), and extensive sloughing was observed on the inner wall of the gynecophoral canal (Fig 5C). The spines within the ventral sucker were disformed, collapsed or fused (Fig 5D). Instead of uniformly arranged crests, severe edema and fusion of the crests in the tegument of the mid-body were prominent (Fig 5E and 5F).\n(A) Gentle panorama of a male worm in the control group after incubation in complete DMEM for 72h; (B) normal morphology of the gynecophoral canal of the male worm: the tegument is intact, and the crests with sensory papillae (SPs) are uniform along the body; (C) integrated outer wall of the gynecophoral canal: the crests and papillae (SPs) are typical; (D) ventral sucker: the spines are uniformly arranged; (E)-(F) numerous tegumental crests with sensory papillae (SPs) distributed orderly along the body surface.

With increasing concentrations of curcumin, the expression level of SjHAT decresed, but no significant difference was observed compared with that in the control group (Fig 6A). In female worms, the expression level of SjHAT decreased with increasing concentrations of curcumin. At a concentration of 40 \u03bcM, the transcription level of SjHAT was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05, Fig 6B). As the concentration of curcumin increased to 100 \u03bcM, the expression level of SjHAT decreased compared with that in the 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15 treated group and was significantly different from that in the control group (P<0.0001, Fig 6B). In contrast, after incubation with different concentrations of A485 and C646, the expression level of SjHAT in males and females was higher than that of control group (Fig 6B). While for juveniles, both DW-3-15 and curcumin at concentration of 100 \u03bcM caused little change in the transcription of SjHAT compared with that in the control group (Fig 6C). After treatment with different concentrations of A485 and C646, there was no significant difference compared with the control group (Fig 6C).\nThe control group was incubated with complete DMEM with 0.1% DMSO. \u2018Cur\u2019 represents the curcumin treatment group. *represents a significant difference compared to the control group, P<0.05. **represents a significant difference compared to the control group, P<0.005. ***represents a significant difference compared to the control group, P<0.0001. \u2018ns\u2019 represents no difference compared with the control group.",
    "Discussion": "Schistosoma species have a complex life cycle, and their development is regulated by epigenetic processes [30]. Therefore, enzymes involved in epigenetic modifications are viable drug targets. Many researchers have focused on epigenetic targets for schistosome drug discovery with most attention directed towards the identification and inhibition of histone modifying enzymes (HMEs) [5,6,31,32]. It is well known that histone acetylation is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs). Furthermore, the identification of HDACs and HATs in schistosomes [15,33,34] has revealed their potential as therapeutic targets. In our previous study, we have found that DW-3-15, a kind of PZQ derivative, could significantly downregulate the expression of SjHAT (S1 Table and S1 Fig). SjHAT belongs to the HAT1 family, which is one of the earliest discovered HATs that primarily acetylates lysine 5 and lysine 12 of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12), and is involved in replication-dependent chromatin assembly [35]. In this study, the antischistosomal activity of three commercially available HAT inhibitors, A485, C646 and curcumin was assessed, with the aim of verifying the feasibility of using SjHAT as a novel therapeutic target for schistosomiasis. All the three mentioned compounds were reported to be highly selective inhibitors of p300/CBP [19\u201323]. Our in vitro results demonstrated that both A485 and C646 had little antischistosomal activity against S. japonicum adult worms (Figs 1 and 2, Tables 2 and 3). While for juveniles, A485 also had a limited effect, but C646 at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM slightly reduced the viability compared with that of the control group after 72h of exposure (Fig 3 and Table 4). Although several reports have shown that A485 and C646 have promising anticancer effects in vitro [19,20], they do not retain the same activity against multicellular organisms, such as Schistosoma species. This phenomenon was confirmed by Wang et al [36]. They examined the activity of 10 \u03bcM A485 on S. mansoni adult worms cultured in vitro and found no effect on worm movement or attachment [36]. By contrast, curcumin, a natural compound with an inhibitory effect on histone acetylation [22,23], demonstrated the most potent schistosomicidal effect against both adult worms and juveniles. The antischistosomal activity of curcumin was both dose- and time-dependent, and it caused the death of all worms at a concentration of 60 \u03bcM after 72h of exposure (Figs 1\u20133, Tables 2\u20134). Our results were consistent with the previous reports that using curcumin as a schistosomicidal agent against schistosomes [24\u201326]. It is intriguing to note that except for curcumin, only DW-3-15 at 100 \u03bcM can cause 100% death of schistosomula and adult worms (Tables 2\u20134).\nIn addition to the similar biological effects of curcumin and DW-3-15, the ultrastructural changes in the tegument of male adult worms treated with 100 \u03bcM curcumin were also similar to those in DW-3-15. Our SEM observation revealed that curcumin caused severe damage to the tegument of male adult worms, including sloughing of the tegument on the inner wall of the gynecophoral canal, swelling and fusion of the spines and crests on the mid-body tegument (Fig 5C\u20135F). All these changes can also be observed in worms treated with 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15 [27,37], indicating that DW-3-15 and curcumin might share some common antischistosomal mechanism.\nThe mRNA level of SjHAT after 72h of exposure to 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15 and 100 \u03bcM curcumin further confirmed this hypothesis. Both DW-3-15 and curcumin significantly inhibited the expression of SjHAT in female worms (Fig 6B). Although no significant difference of SjHAT level was observed in male worms, the SjHAT mRNA level was lower than that of control group (Fig 6A). While for juveniles, both DW-3-15 and curcumin had little effect on SjHAT mRNA level in comparison with control group (Fig 6C). In contrast, the SjHAT level in adult worms treated by different concentrations of A485 and C646 was significantly higher than those in the control group (Fig 6A and 6B). The opposite expression pattern of SjHAT mirrors their antischistosomal activity. Among the compounds, curcumin and DW-3-15 are the most potent schistosomicidal agents against both male and female adults (Tables 2 and 3), even better than the effective drug PZQ. Accordingly, the mRNA level of SjHAT in worms treated by 100 \u03bcM DW-3-15 and curcumin was lower than that of negative control group. Conversely, both A485 and C646 had little effect against adult worms (Tables 2 and 3), their SjHAT level was significantly higher than those in the control group (Fig 6A and 6B). Although A485 and C646 had promising anti-cancer activity in vitro, they could not inhibit the expression of SjHAT. This might be partially attributed to their selective inhibition of p300/CBP and their weaker effect on inhibiting other types of HATs, such as HAT1. As a natural compound, curcumin may not selectively act on a single target, such as A485 and C646, but may have multiple targets. In addition to inhibiting the activity of P300/CBP, curcumin can also ameliorate PRMT5-MEP50 arginine methyltransferase expression by decreasing the expression of Sp1 and NF-YA transcription factors in the A549 and MCF-7 cells [38]. Furthermore, it has been reported that curcumin can inhibit HDAC activity and downregulate the expression of HDAC types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 11 in different cancer cell lines and mice [39]. Our results demonstrate that curcumin not only has a strong worm killing effect, but also downregulate the expression of SjHAT in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SjHAT may be a potential target for curcumin. Notably, DW-3-15 can also inhibit the expression of SjHAT, and has similar antischistosomal efficacy to that of curcumin, which in turn confirming that SjHAT may be a potential target for DW-3-15.",
    "Conclusion": "Our in vitro results demonstrated that the natural compound curcumin can potently kill both schistosomula and adult worms of S. japonicum. Curcumin, which is recognized as a kind of HAT inhibitor, can significantly reduce the mRNA level of SjHAT in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DW-3-15, a kind of PZQ derivative, displays schistosomicidal efficacy against juveniles and adults similar to that of curcumin, and can also downregulate SjHAT levels. Both curcumin and DW-3-15 can decrease the expression of the SjHAT gene, enhancing the feasibility of using SjHAT as a potential druggable target. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the characteristics of SjHAT and worm-killing mechanism by downregulating SjHAT."
