Schistosomiasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma spp. infection. Due to the lack of effective vaccines for schistosomiasis, PZQ is the only available drug chosen for the treatment and control of schistosomiasis in most developing countries. Drug resistance due to long-term, large-scale and single-agent use has been a great concern. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies. In our previous study, we developed the patented compound DW-3-15 (patent no. ZL201110142538.2), which has significant and stable antiparasitic activity, and can significantly decrease the expression of S. japonicum histone acetyltransferase (SjHAT). As we known, HATs are a class of epigenetic enzymes that are crucial for chromatin restructuring and transcriptional regulation in mammals and in parasitic development, and are thus promising targets for antischistosomal therapeutic development. In this study, we assessed three commercial HATs, including two selective p300/CBP inhibitors A485 and C646, and one natural compound, curcumin. Our results demonstrated that curcumin had the most potent worm-killing efficacy against S. japonicum juveniles and adults. In contrast, A485 and C646 displayed no effects on adult worms or mild effects on juveniles. Moreover, curcumin caused severe damage to the tegument of male worms, and the damage was similar to that of DW-3-15. Coincidentally, both curcumin and DW-3-15 significantly downregulated the expression of SjHAT, indicating that SjHAT might be an effective target for the development of novel therapeutic drugs. The screening and identification of selective HAT inhibitors may be a promising strategy for developing novel antischistosomal agents.
