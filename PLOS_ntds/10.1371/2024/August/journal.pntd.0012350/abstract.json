    "Abstract": "Aedes aegypti is an important vector of dengue virus and other arboviruses that affect human health. After being ingested in an infectious bloodmeal, but before being transmitted from mosquito to human, dengue virus must disseminate from the vector midgut into the hemocoel and then the salivary glands. This process, the extrinsic incubation period, typically takes 6â€“14 days. Since older mosquitoes are responsible for transmission, understanding the age structure of vector populations is important. Transcriptional profiling can facilitate predictions of the age structures of mosquito populations, critical for estimating their potential for pathogen transmission. In this study, we utilized a two-gene transcript model to assess the age structure and daily survival rates of three populations (Key West, Marathon, and Key Largo) of Ae. aegypti from the Florida Keys, United States, where repeated outbreaks of autochthonous dengue transmission have recently occurred. We found that Key Largo had the youngest Ae. aegypti population with the lowest daily survival rate, while Key West had the oldest population and highest survival rate. Across sites, 22.67% of Ae. aegypti females were likely old enough to transmit dengue virus (at least 15 days post emergence). Computed estimates of the daily survival rate (0.8364 using loglinear and 0.8660 using non-linear regression), indicate that dengue vectors in the region experienced relatively low daily mortality. Collectively, our data suggest that Ae. aegypti populations across the Florida Keys harbor large numbers of older individuals, which likely contributes to the high risk of dengue transmission in the area."
