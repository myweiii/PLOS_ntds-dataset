Contradictory results have been published on the impact of intestinal worm infections on malaria and there is an ongoing debate on whether general anti-helminthic treatment is desirable. For the first time, we provide highlights for the case of Plasmodium and Enterobius vermicularis co-infection in Tanzanian children. In our findings, helminth infection was shown to be associated with a protective effect on the development of clinical malaria. However, when looking at the specific effect of different helminth species, E. vermicularis was indeed protective against clinical malaria but co-infection with hookworm was associated with uncomplicated and even more so severe malaria. We speculate that specific effects of STH species tend to be obscured when analysis is carried out with all helminths aggregated. The opposite effects on malaria of all helminths reported in previous studies could be due to the individual effect of the most prevalent helminth species within the studied population. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of helminth species in low and high intensity areas in different age- and at-risk groups to better advise helminth and malaria control programs.
