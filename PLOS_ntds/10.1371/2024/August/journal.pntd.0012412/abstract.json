    "Background": "Parasitic infectious agents rarely occur in isolation. Epidemiological evidence is mostly lacking, and little is known on how the two common parasites Plasmodium and soil transmitted helminths (STH) interact. There are contradictory findings in different studies. Synergism, antagonism and neutral effect have been documented between Plasmodium and STH. This study investigated the impact of STH on clinical malaria presentation and treatment outcome.",
    "Methods": "A matched case control study with a semi longitudinal follow up according to World Health Organization (WHO) antimalarial surveillance guideline was done among children aged 2 months to 9 years inclusively living in western rural areas of Bagamoyo, coastal region of Tanzania. Cases were children with uncomplicated and severe malaria enrolled from the health facilities while controls were children with asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitemia enrolled from the same community.",
    "Results": "In simple conditional regression analysis there was a tendency for a protective effect of STH on the development of clinical malaria [OR = 0.6, 95% CI of 0.3–1.3] which was more marked for Enterobius vermicularis species [OR = 0.2, 95% CI of 0.0–0.9]. On the contrary, hookworm species tended to be associated with increased risk of clinical malaria [OR = 3.0, 95% CI of 0.9–9.5]. In multiple conditional regression analysis, the overall protective effect was lower for all helminth infection [OR = 0.8, 95% CI of 0.3–1.9] but remained significantly protective for E. vermicularis species [OR = 0.1, 95% CI of 0.0–1.0] and borderline significant for hookworm species [OR = 3.6, 95% CI of 0.9–14.3]. Using ordinal logistic regression which better reflects the progression of asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitemia to severe malaria, there was a 50% significant protective effect with overall helminths [OR = 0.5, 95% CI of 0.3–0.9]. On the contrary, hookworm species was highly predictive of uncomplicated and severe malaria [OR = 7.8, 95% (CI of 1.8–33.9) and 49.7 (95% CI of 1.9–1298.9) respectively]. Generally, children infected with STH had higher geometric mean time to first clearance of parasitemia.",
    "Conclusion": "The findings of a protective effect of E. vermicularis and an enhancing effect of hookworms may explain the contradictory results found in the literature about impact of helminths on clinical malaria. More insight should be gained on possible mechanisms for these opposite effects. These results should not deter at this stage deworming programs but rather foster implementation of integrated control program for these two common parasites."
