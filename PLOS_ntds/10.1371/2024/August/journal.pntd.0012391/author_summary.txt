Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) mostly affect marginalised groups in deprived communities, and are known to have harmful physical, financial, social, and mental health consequences. Skin-NTDS (SNTDs) are particularly damaging because they are noticeable, rendering the affected individuals vulnerable to discrimination. This systematic review of the published literature aims to understand the socio-economic and emotional effects of SNTDs and how these are influenced by individuals’ gender. Our review includes 27 studies. Men and women experience physical suffering which reduces their ability to work, socialise, and carry out usual daily activities. Some feel well supported by partners, friends, and family, at least initially, while most are avoided, abandoned, and even suffer from verbal and physical violence, particularly women. The reported impacts of SNTDs on individuals’ emotional wellbeing include low mood, anxiety, low self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts. Early treatment, disease knowledge, social support networks, and disease acceptance were mentioned as protective factors. We conclude that SNTDs increase individuals’ psychosocial suffering, with women being particularly at risk. Ensuring treatment access and socio-economic support for men and women with SNTDs and developing culturally appropriate educational interventions designed to foster more positive attitudes towards people with SNTDs will help prevent and reduce these harms.
