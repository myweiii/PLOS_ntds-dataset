Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a prevalent disease caused by an intracellular protozoan transmitted by a vector, is a serious public health issue, particularly in Kutaber district, where it causes significant physical and psychosocial problems among the residents. Even though it is not fatal, cutaneous leishmaniasis can lead to complications, lifelong scar and disfigurement, resulting in social isolation and discrimination. We showed that this is strongly associated with the district residentsâ€™ poor knowledge and prevention practice towards the disease. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a true health problem of the community, is worsened due to limited efforts of healthcare professionals, limited roles played by the media in health information communication, budget problem, low attention given from the government, lack of information dissemination, and lack of awareness. This implied that there is a need of rigorous provision of health education on the cause, transmission mechanism, intermediate host, breeding site, sandfly vector, treatment and implementation of prevention strategies.
