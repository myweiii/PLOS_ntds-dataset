Mosquito-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) are expected to increase due to climate change, and public health programs rely on insecticides to reduce mosquito vector populations. Insecticidal fogging is often conducted during post-midnight hours when temperatures are coldest. Temperature has been shown to impact the toxicity of insecticides, but this effect is understudied, particularly for WNV vectors. The researchers aimed to test the effect of temperature on the toxicity of two common insecticides to Culex tarsalis, a primary mosquito vector of WNV, and to identify when local vectors were actively seeking a host to bite. The research location was a productive riparian (wetland) area adjacent to many urban centers in Arizona. The researchers found that both insecticides became less toxic at colder temperatures and that early evening accounted for a significant portion of captures, yet is outside of normal fogging hours. Human outdoor activities also increase during these hours, which may result in elevated risk of disease transmission. This research serves to improve our understanding and usage of insecticides to reduce disease burden. As insecticides are used globally, the findings of this research may relate to all mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, and are relevant for agricultural pest management.
