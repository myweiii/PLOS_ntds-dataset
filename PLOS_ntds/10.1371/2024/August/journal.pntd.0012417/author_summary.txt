Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites. VL is characterised by uncontrolled parasite replication in internal organs and is often fatal if untreated.
Monocytes are part of a group of cells called white blood cells. These cells can become activated and play an important role against infections. They have been poorly characterised in VL patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of markers of activation on different subsets of monocytes from the blood of VL patients and healthy non-endemic controls (HNEC).
We assessed the expression levels of monocyte markers that are essential for activating and regulating the immune response. Our results how that these are increased on some monocyte subsets at the time of diagnosis as compared to the end of treatment and HNEC. We also looked at a marker that can inhibit the immune response and show that it is highly expressed at the time of diagnosis as compared to the end of treatment and HNEC.
These results show that monocytes from the blood of VL patients upregulate both activating and inhibitory receptors and that their expression levels are restored at the end of treatment.
