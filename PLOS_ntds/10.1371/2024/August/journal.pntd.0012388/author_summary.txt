Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The pathogenesis of trachoma is more complicated than other types of bacterial conjunctivitis: clinical signs of trachoma are rooted in repeated Chlamydia trachomatis infections of the inner eyelid surfaces, which roughens the skin. This leads to eyelid deformation causing the lashes to rub against the cornea. Over multiple years, this persistent rubbing leads to abrasion and eventually corneal opacification that can cause vision loss. The immune system is a pivotal aspect of this disease and is involved in disease aggravation and is also key for exploring the development of a trachoma vaccine. Here we describe a non-human primate model of trachoma that accurately reproduces acute human eye disease, allowing for a precise assessment of the local immune responses in infected eyes. We found that there was an ongoing immune response that continued for 4 weeks after exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis, which then subsided into a persistent innate immune response. Understanding these local responses is the first step towards using the model to assess new vaccines and therapeutic strategies to prevent disease.
