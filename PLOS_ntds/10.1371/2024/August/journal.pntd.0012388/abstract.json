    "Background": "Trachoma is a leading cause of infection-related blindness worldwide. This disease is caused by recurrent Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infections of the conjunctiva and develops in two phases: i) active (acute trachoma, characterized by follicular conjunctivitis), then long-term: ii) scarring (chronic trachoma, characterized by conjunctival fibrosis, corneal opacification and eyelid malposition). Scarring trachoma is driven by the number and severity of reinfections. The immune system plays a pivotal role in trachoma including exacerbation of the disease. Hence the immune system may also be key to developing a trachoma vaccine. Therefore, we characterized clinical and local immune response kinetics in a non-human primate model of acute conjunctival Ct infection and disease.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The conjunctiva of non-human primate (NHP, Cynomolgus monkeysâ€”Macaca fascicularis-) were inoculated with Ct (B/Tunis-864 strain, B serovar). Clinical ocular monitoring was performed using a standardized photographic grading system, and local immune responses were assessed using multi-parameter flow cytometry of conjunctival cells, tear fluid cytokines, immunoglobulins, and Ct quantification. Clinical findings were similar to those observed during acute trachoma in humans, with the development of typical follicular conjunctivitis from the 4th week post-exposure to the 11th week. Immunologic analysis indicated an early phase influx of T cells in the conjunctiva and elevated interleukins 4, 8, and 5, followed by a late phase monocytic influx accompanied with a decrease in other immune cells, and tear fluid cytokines returning to initial levels.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Our NHP model accurately reproduces the clinical signs of acute trachoma, allowing for an accurate assessment of the local immune responses in infected eyes. A progressive immune response occurred for weeks after exposure to Ct, which subsided into a persistent innate immune response. An understanding of these local responses is the first step towards using the model to assess new vaccine and therapeutic strategies for disease prevention."
