Hepatitis-E virus (HEV) is an infectious cause of acute liver disease and is primarily transmitted through contaminated food and water. It has emerged as a leading cause of acute clinical hepatitis in South Asia. Pregnant women face the highest risk of complications and mortality. To better understand the impact of HEV in Nepal, we conducted a two-year cohort study in the Kathmandu Valley region. We collected dried blood spots from participants every 6 months and tested the samples to detect past and new infections of HEV. Our study, involving 923 individuals, revealed that 4.8% had IgG antibodies against HEV, indicating past exposure. Each year, about 11 in 1000 people between the ages of 1 and 25 years are newly exposed to the virus. The highest infection rates were among young adults and those using untreated surface water. Our study mapped the distribution of HEV, identifying specific areas with higher infection rates.
