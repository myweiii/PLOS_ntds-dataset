Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) is a chronic ulcerating disease caused by the parasite Leishmania spp. Literature review identified inconsistencies in methods and parameters used to evaluate treatment/alternative-interventions resulting in difficulties in comparing new treatment/interventions in clinical trials. In our international consensual study, we adopted the face-to-face nominal group technique and a judgment process to identify domains key to assessment of LCL. Subsequent measures for each domain were used to form a Core Outcome Set (COS). LeishCOM_LCL was developed as an outcome measure instrument (OMI) to capture the COS incorporating existing and newly developed tools. “Clinical Cure” was agreed as the “General Concept” to be captured through five domains. It was agreed that “Signs” domain should capture clinical morphology, diameter, and induration of an index lesion with the aid of a palpability score. “Treatment Efficacy” was assessed by recording percentage change in size of the lesion and re-epithelialization compared to baseline. “Treatment Impact” was reflected through an investigator and the patient visual analogue score and “Clinical Sequelae” rated pigment change, atrophic/hypertrophic scars. Two open-ended questions were included to capture some aspects of “Health-Related Quality of Life”. LeishCOM_LCL also records patient demographic details and was validated in a small cohort of patients.
