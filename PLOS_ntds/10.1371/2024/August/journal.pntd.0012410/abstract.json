    "Background": "Hypereosinophilic syndrome can produce cardiac involvement and endomyocardial fibrosis, which have a poor prognosis. However, there is limited information regarding cardiac involvement among migrants from Latin America with eosinophilia related to helminthiasis.",
    "Methods": "We conducted a pilot observational study where an echocardiography was performed on migrants from Latin America with both eosinophilia (>450 cells/μL) and a diagnosis of helminth infection, and on migrants from Latin America without eosinophilia or helminth infection. Microbiological techniques included a stool microscopic examination using the Ritchie’s formalin-ether technique, and a specific serology to detect Strongyloides stercoralis antibodies.",
    "Results": "37 participants were included, 20 with eosinophilia and 17 without eosinophilia. Twenty (54.1%) were men with a mean age of 41.3 (SD 14.3) years. Helminthic infections diagnosed in the group with eosinophilia were: 17 cases of S. stercoralis infection, 1 case of hookworm infection, and 2 cases of S. stercoralis and hookworm coinfection. Among participants with eosinophilia, echocardiographic findings revealed a greater right ventricle thickness (p = 0.001) and left atrial area and volume index (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively), while showing a lower left atrial strain (p = 0.006) and E-wave deceleration time (p = 0.008). An increase was shown in both posterior and anterior mitral leaflet thickness (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.004, respectively) when compared with participants without eosinophilia.",
    "Conclusions": "Migrants from Latin America with eosinophilia related to helminthic infections might present incipient echocardiographic alterations suggestive of early diastolic dysfunction, that could be related to eosinophilia-induced changes in the endomyocardium."
