Using the insecticides is one of the most important methods of combating this vector. Based on this, the present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of kdr resistance in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world. This study was conducted by systematic review, and meta-analysis on the prevalence of kdr resistance and mortality rate in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world. Based on the findings, the prevalence of Kdr in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticide was estimated at 63.1%. Moreover, the mortality rate against the insecticide deltamethrin was 46%, DDT 18.5%, permethrin 42.6%, malathion 54.4% and lambdacyhalothrin 53%. More than half of Cx. quinquefasciatus had Kdr. This vector was relatively resistant to DDT and permethrin insecticides and sensitive to malathion, deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin.
