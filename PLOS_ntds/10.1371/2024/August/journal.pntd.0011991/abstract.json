    "Introduction": "Culex quinquefasciatus is one of the most important carriers of human pathogens. Using the insecticides is one of the most important methods of combating this vector. But the genetic resistance created in Culex quinquefasciatus led to disruption in the fight against this pest. Consequently, it is necessary to know the level of resistance to fight this vector. Based on this, the present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of kdr resistance in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world.",
    "Methods": "This study was conducted by systematic review, and meta-analysis on the prevalence of kdr resistance and mortality rate in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world. All pertinent articles were extracted and analyzed in accordance with this information during an unrestricted search of the scientific databases Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, biooan.org, Embase, ProQuest, and Google Scholar until the end of November 2023. Statistical analysis of data was done using fixed and random effects model in meta-analysis, I2 index, Cochranâ€™s test, and meta-regression by STATA version 17 software.",
    "Results": "Seventy articles were included in the meta-analysis process. Based on the findings, the prevalence of Kdr in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticide was estimated at 63.1%. Moreover, the mortality rate against the insecticide deltamethrin was 46%, DDT 18.5%, permethrin 42.6%, malathion 54.4% and lambdacyhalothrin 53%.",
    "Conclusion": "More than half of Cx. quinquefasciatus had Kdr. This vector was relatively resistant to DDT and permethrin insecticides and sensitive to malathion, deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin. In order to prevent the development of resistance to alternative insecticides, it is consequently critical to combat this vector with efficacious insecticides."
