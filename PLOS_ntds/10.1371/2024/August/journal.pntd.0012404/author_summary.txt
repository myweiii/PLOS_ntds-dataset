Parasitic worms cause significant global health challenges, particularly in rural communities in low and middle-income countries. Laboratory tests that detect parasite DNA in human stool are increasingly being used for the diagnosis of parasitic worm infections. While parasite DNA detection can be an excellent diagnostic tool, its performance in clinical practice varies considerably, as demonstrated by previous research. To ensure the quality in diagnostic testing of these parasitic worms, it is important that laboratories evaluate the diagnostic performance of their DNA-based tests by participating in a so-called external quality assessment scheme (EQAS). This study, focusing on the first five-yearly rounds of the so far only longitudinal international EQAS to date, reveals that quantitative DNA detection results are not directly comparable across laboratories due to substantial inter-laboratory variability. This variability mainly stems from differences in pre-treatment and DNA isolation protocols, and to a lesser extent from differences in DNA target amplification procedures. Furthermore, the study underscores the complexity of molecular diagnosis for parasitic worms in clinical practice and the necessity for laboratories to engage in EQAs to guarantee the proper functioning of these diagnostic tests.
