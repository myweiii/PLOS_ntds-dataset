Snakebites can be life-threatening, especially in places like sub-Saharan Africa. In Rwanda, there haven’t been any studies to understand how many snakebites happen and where they happen. This study wanted to find out two main things: first, how many snakebites happened in different parts of the Eastern Province of Rwanda in 2020, and second, where people who got bitten by snakes went for help—to doctors or traditional healers.
The study involved 390,546 people across 763 villages. It found that each year, about 4.3 out of 1,000 people in the province get bitten by snakes, but the numbers vary in different areas. Surprisingly, only 13% of the victims initially consulted formal healthcare providers like community health workers, health centers, or hospitals. In contrast, a larger group, 87%, sought informal care from family, friends, pharmacists, or traditional healers first. About half of the people bitten by snakes experienced severe symptoms. Unfortunately, many people used unsafe methods to treat snakebites, like cutting or burning the skin, tying a tight band around the bitten area, using black stones, or trying to suck out the venom. Only a very small number of cases, just 24 out of all 1,098 victims, received anti-venom.
The study suggests we need to make sure anti-venom is easier to get and teach communities about the risks of unsafe practices and why it’s important to get formal healthcare quickly. It’s important for doctors, traditional healers, community leaders, and government officials to work together to make sure people get safe and appropriate treatment and learn how to prevent snakebites.
