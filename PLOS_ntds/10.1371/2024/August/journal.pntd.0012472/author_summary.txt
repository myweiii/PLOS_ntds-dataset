Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and histoplasmosis are severe fungal diseases occurring simultaneously in South America. They can cause similar clinical manifestations, especially in immunosuppressed hosts. This poses challenges regarding the differential diagnosis due to overlapping clinical and laboratorial findings, hampering the management of individual cases. In this study, the authors report the occurrence of a false-positive urinary test to detect histoplasmosis in a kidney transplant recipient with acute PCM. Given the scarce information about this subject, a review on literature data is provided. As conclusion, this study highlights the urinary test developed to diagnose histoplasmosis can cross react with PCM, which may represent a concern in countries where both mycoses overlap.
