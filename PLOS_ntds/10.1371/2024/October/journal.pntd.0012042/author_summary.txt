Serology is frequently used for disease surveillance, especially in systems that are resource constrained or logistically challenging. Serological testing involves analyzing blood serum samples to detect antibodies with reactivity toward specific pathogens (or more generally, molecular antigens), with the goal of characterizing past exposure to those pathogens. However, these antibodies can be non-specific and may react against other related pathogens or strainsâ€“a phenomenon known as cross-reactivity. Interpretation of serological data exhibiting cross-reactivity is difficult and simplifying assumptions are often made (e.g., to interpret the strain that elicits the highest antibody titer level as the infecting pathogen strain). Our work shows that interpreting antibody data requires more nuance and more caution. Both absolute titers and relative reactivity against different strains can vary across host species and diagnostic laboratories, so it is essential to interpret these data in the appropriate context. These host species differences in antibody reactivity and cross-reactivity patterns make direct comparisons across species inadvisable.
