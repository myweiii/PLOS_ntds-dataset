Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes fever, rash and joint pain in humans. CHIKV is spread by bites of infected Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. In 2008–2010, CHIKV with an E1-226V mutation became highly adapted to Ae. albopictus and caused global outbreaks. In Malaysia, these major outbreaks occurred mainly in rural areas where this mosquito is most common. We found that a resurgence of CHIKV in 2017–2022 was associated with a different variant with an E1-226A mutation, which had a greater ability to replicate in the Ae. aegypti mosquito than the previous E1-226V variant. This mosquito is found mainly in urban areas, and by looking at geographical locations of reported CHIKV cases, we found that the case distribution had also shifted from rural to predominantly urban areas in 2017–2022. Genetic surveillance of CHIKV and other mosquito-borne viruses is important to identify genetic changes that may affect virus ability to infect different vectors, and disease numbers and distribution.
