In our study, we tackled the complex challenge of predicting dengue fever outbreaks, a crucial task in the field of epidemiology. Dengue prediction is complicated because it relies on the quality of data, which may be affected by the temporal and spatial resolution. We explored different machine learning algorithms across various spatial (village, city and region) and temporal resolutions (weekly and monthly). A key hurdle we encountered was the high frequency of zero values in reported dengue cases, a common issue known as zero-inflated data. This phenomenon makes accurate predictions difficult, especially at finer resolutions. To overcome this obstacle, we first made qualitative predictions about the presence or absence of dengue cases. Then, in scenarios indicating disease presence, we estimated the magnitude of cases quantitatively. This innovative method we designated as hybrid approach and significantly enhanced prediction accuracy in zero-inflated data. This approach can be applied to continuous data where zero-inflated or hurdle models cannot be applied. Our findings have broader implications beyond dengue prediction, shedding light on the challenges of dealing with zero-inflated data in various real-world situations. By improving our understanding of these complexities, our research contributes valuable insights that not only benefit scientists working in epidemiology but also have practical applications in public health strategies ensuring more effective and targeted interventions.
