    "Background": "Variation in snake venoms is well documented, both between and within species, with intraspecific venom variation often correlated with geographically distinct populations. The puff adder, Bitis arietans, is widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula where it is considered a leading cause of the ~310,000 annual snakebites across the region, with its venom capable of causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite its medical importance and wide geographic distribution, there is little known about venom variation between different B. arietans populations and the potential implications of this variation on antivenom efficacy.",
    "Methodology": "We applied a range of analyses, including venom gland transcriptomics, in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse phase chromatography to comparatively analyse B. arietans venoms originating from Nigeria, Tanzania, and South Africa. Immunological assays and in vitro enzymatic neutralisation assays were then applied to investigate the impact of venom variation on the potential efficacy of three antivenom products; SAIMR Polyvalent, EchiTAb-Plus and Fav-Afrique.",
    "Findings": "Through the first comparison of venom gland transcriptomes of B. arietans from three geographically distinct regions (Nigeria, Tanzania, and South Africa), we identified substantial variation in toxin expression. Findings of venom variation were further supported by chromatographic venom profiling, and the application of enzymatic assays to quantify the activity of three pathologically relevant toxin families. However, the use of western blotting, ELISA, and in vitro enzymatic inhibition assays revealed that variation within B. arietans venom does not appear to substantially impact upon the efficacy of three African polyvalent antivenoms.",
    "Conclusions": "The large distribution and medical importance of B. arietans makes this species ideal for understanding venom variation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy. The findings in this study highlight the likelihood for considerable venom toxin variation across the range of B. arietans, but that this may not dramatically impact upon the utility of treatment available in the region."
