The puff adder (Bitis arietans) is found across sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and is capable of causing life threatening pathology due to its potent venom. The extensive range of B. arietans exposes populations to different ecological pressures which may impact upon the composition of venom toxins. In this study, we examined the venom composition of B. arietans from three countries separated by large geographic distance: Nigeria, Tanzania and South Africa. By integrating venom gland transcriptomes, venom chromatography, and in vitro functional assays to profile B. arietans venom composition, we uncovered extensive variation between the three locales. Given that venom variation can have a significant impact on the efficacy of antivenom treatment, we also investigated the ability of three African antivenoms to recognise and inhibit in vitro venom activity. Through these analyses, we were able to determine that venom variation did not have a substantial impact on the neutralising effect of selected antivenoms. This study has highlighted the potentially extensive venom variation found across the range of B. arietans and initiated valuable investigations into the efficacy of African antivenoms to protect human populations vulnerable to snakebite envenoming.
