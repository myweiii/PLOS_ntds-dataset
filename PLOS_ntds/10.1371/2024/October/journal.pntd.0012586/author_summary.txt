Histoplasmosis is a serious disease caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which can be life-threatening and has limited treatment options. In this study, we investigated the potential of auranofin, a drug originally approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis, to combat H. capsulatum. We tested auranofin against different strains of the fungus and found that it effectively inhibited fungal growth. This drug was also effective in killing the fungus within cells from the immune system and provided protection in an experimental animal model. Furthermore, auranofin reduced the expression of several genes associated with the fungus’s ability to cause disease. These genes are involved in critical functions such as detoxifying harmful substances and maintaining cellular structures. By suppressing these genes, auranofin hampers the fungus’s ability to survive and cause infection. These findings suggest that auranofin could be repurposed as a treatment for histoplasmosis, offering a new avenue for therapy against this challenging infection. This research is significant because it highlights the potential of existing drugs to treat other diseases, broadening our arsenal of available treatments and contributing to better healthcare solutions.
