In this study from a tertiary hospital in tropical Australia, an active cancer was present in 11% of 446 patients with cultured-confirmed melioidosis, However, no solid organ or haematological cancer diagnosis appeared to be associated with developing the infection. Approximately half of the individuals with cancer who developed melioidosis died within 12 months of their melioidosis diagnosis, however, deaths were more commonly due to their underlying cancer than their melioidosis. Immune suppressing anti-cancer therapy had been prescribed in the prior 12 months in 36% of the individuals with cancer and melioidosis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not prescribed routinely to prevent melioidosis in local patients receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer therapy, but individuals receiving twice weekly TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia did not have a statistically lower rate of melioidosis than individuals who did not receive this chemoprophylaxis. Melioidosis was a rare complication of myelosuppressive anti-cancer therapy in the region. Only 16/3663 (0.44%) individuals not receiving TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis developed melioidosis, and only 3/3663 died from the disease (0.08%). As TMP-SMX has a range of potential side effects–and has the potential to interrupt the delivery of anti-cancer therapy and drive resistance to an important antibiotic–our data do not presently support TMP-SMX prophylaxis for melioidosis in patients receiving anti-cancer therapies in this region of Australia.
