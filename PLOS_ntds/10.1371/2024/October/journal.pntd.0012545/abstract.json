    "Abstract": "Clonorchis sinensis infection is an important risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). It has been reported that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the parasite-host interaction, and EVs of C. sinensis (CsEVs) can contribute to biliary injuries and inflammation. However, uncertainty surrounds the function of CsEVs in the progression of CCA. In this study, differential ultracentrifugation was used to separate CsEVs from the culture supernatant of C. sinensis adult worms, and they were then identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and proteome assays. CCK8, EdU-488 and colony formation assays were used to explore the effect of CsEVs on the proliferation of CCA cells in vitro. Wound healing assays, transwell assays and in vivo lung metastasis model were conducted to evaluate the migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, the involvement of EMT process, as well as NF-κB and ERK signaling pathway was assessed. Results showed that CsEVs were successfully isolated and could be taken up by CCA cells, which promoted proliferation by accelerating cell cycle progression. In addition, CsEVs could facilitate cell metastasis by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, activation of NF-κB signaling pathway was involved in the CsEVs-mediated EMT, which could be reversed partly by BAY 11–7082 (an inhibitor of NF-κB). In conclusion, these findings suggested that CsEVs could induce the aberrant proliferation and metastasis of CCA cells by stimulating the NF-κB/EMT axis, providing a novel theoretical explanation for liver fluke-associated CCA."
