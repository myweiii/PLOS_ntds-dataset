Gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes or worms pose a significant threat to global health, causing illness in millions-billions of people and animals. Current treatments have limitations, including concerns about drug resistance. We are exploring a promising new approach using natural Crystal (Cry) proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria, which are already widely used as safe and effective insecticides. To date, we have focused on the anthelmintic (deworming) properties of Bt Cry protein Cry5Ba. Here, our research demonstrates that a newly characterized and different Bt Cry protein, Cry14Ab, can also effectively target and kill various types of harmful parasitic nematodes in both laboratory and animal models. Moreover, we identify another related Bt protein, Cry14Ac, with similar activities against parasitic nematodes. These findings highlight the potential of Bt proteins as a novel class of deworming medications, offering hope for the development and clinical deployment of safer and more effective treatments against parasitic nematode infections.
