The discovery of hundreds of novel viruses assignable to the order Bunyavirales in recent years led to International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to impose the requirement of complete or almost complete viral sequences in order to establish a correct taxonomic classification. As a large number of incomplete sequences has confounded the understanding of Hantavirus diversity, many viruses have been recently declassified including several variants circulating in Argentina. In this work, high quality and complete genomic sequences were obtained of Buenos Aires and Lechiguanas viruses, which are responsible for the majority of the HPS cases in the CE region of Argentina. The information provided in this work will help to consider the re-classification of Lechiguanas and the inclusion of Buenos Aires as named viruses within the species Orthohantavirus andesense.
