    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are closely related flaviviruses co-circulating in the same endemic areas. Infection can raise cross-reactive antibodies that can be either protective or increase risk of severe disease, depending on the infection sequence, DENV serotype and elapsed time between infection. On the contrast, T cell-mediated immunity against DENV and ZIKV is considered protective. Therefore, we have developed a T cell vaccine enriched in immunodominant T cell epitopes derived from ZIKV and evaluated its immunogenicity and efficacy against ZIKV and DENV infection. Mice were vaccinated using DNA vaccine platform using the tetrafunctional amphiphilic block copolymer 704. We show that vaccination of 2 different HLA class I transgenic mice with the ZIKV non-structural (NS) poly-epitope elicits T cell response against numerous ZIKV epitopes. Moreover, vaccination induces a significant protection against ZIKV infection, in the absence of neutralizing or enhancing antibodies against ZIKV. However, vaccination does not induce a significant protection against DENV2. In contrast, immunization with a DENV1-NS poly-epitope induces a significant protection against both DENV1 and DENV2, in the absence of humoral immunity. Taken together, we have shown that T-cell based vaccination could protect against multiple flavivirus infections and could overcome the complexity of antibody-mediated enhancement."
