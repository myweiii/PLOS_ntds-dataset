Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are two closely related flaviviruses transmitted by Aedes species mosquito. In endemic regions with high circulation of ZIKV and multiple DENV serotypes, and the presence of cross-reactive or sub-neutralizing antibodies that could enhance dengue disease severity, alternative approaches to antibody-induced vaccination must be considered. This work describes a novel strategy for the development of a T-cell based vaccine composed of immunodominant T cell epitopes from ZIKV. This vaccine induces a significant protection against ZIKV infection in mice expressing different HLA class I molecules, in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Likewise, DNA vaccination with mosaic sequence enriched in DENV T cell epitopes with identical sequences between DENV1 and DENV2 induces a significant protection against these 2 DENV serotypes, without inducing neutralizing antibodies. This study paves the way for T-cell based vaccines that could overcome the risk for antibody-mediated enhancement and protect against multiple flavivirus infections.
