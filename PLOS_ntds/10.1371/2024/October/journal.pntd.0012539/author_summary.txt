Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) and Dugbe orthonairovirus (DUGV) are viruses that can be transmitted to humans through ticks. While CCHFV has been known to cause several cases of illness in humans, DUGV, which is distantly related to CCHFV, has been associated with fewer cases. Both viruses are commonly found in ticks and animals like cattle. This study was aimed at determining the level of exposure of cattle in Kwara State, Nigeria to these viruses through antibody detection. Blood samples collected from 877 cattle on farms and in abattoirs in Kwara State, Nigeria, were tested for antibodies to both CCHFV and DUGV. The results revealed that a significant proportion of the sampled cattle had antibodies to both viruses, indicating previous exposure. Specifically, 71.9% (631/877) of the cattle tested positive for CCHFV antibodies, while 52.8% (451/854) tested positive for DUGV antibodies. Furthermore, 37.9% (314/829) of the cattle were co-exposed to both CCHFV and DUGV, while 34.5% (286/829) had been exposed only to CCHFV, 14.8% (123/829) only to DUGV, and 12.8% (106/829) to neither virus. Multivariate analysis revealed that only location, sex, age, and tick infestation score significantly affected CCHFV seroprevalence, while for DUGV, month of the year, location, cattle breed, and sex were observed to significantly influence seroprevalence (p<0.05). This study provides the first comprehensive report on DUGV presence in sub-Saharan Africa, indicating that both CCHFV and DUGV are present in Kwara State, Nigeria.
