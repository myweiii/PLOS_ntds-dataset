    "Background": "Endemic to Central Africa, loiasis, caused by the vector-borne worm Loa loa, affects approximately 10 million individuals. Clinical manifestations include transient angioedema (Calabar swellings), migration of the adult worm under the eye conjunctiva (eye worm) and less specific general symptoms. Loiasis presents a significant public health challenge because L. loa-infected individuals can develop serious adverse events after taking ivermectin, the drug used to combat onchocerciasis. In this context, alternative interventions and rigorous diagnostic approaches are needed. Diagnosing loiasis is challenging because its main clinical manifestations are sporadic and non-specific. The definitive diagnosis relies on identifying adult worms migrating beneath the conjunctiva, or microfilariae (pre-larvae) in blood smears. However, \u201coccult loiasis\u201d (infection without blood microfilariae) is frequent. Serological rapid antibody diagnostic tests (ARTs) can provide an alternative diagnostic method. We compared a novel ART simultaneously targeting onchocerciasis (IgG4 to Ov-16 and OvOC3261, test line 1) and loiasis (IgG4 to L1-SXP-1, test line 2), called IgG4-SXP-1 biplex test) to the already established Loa-ART (all IgG isotypes to Ll-SXP-1, called pan-IgG-SXP-1 test).",
    "Methodology": "Blood samples underwent both ARTs, read qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Additionally, blood smears, skin snips, Kato-Katz method for soil-transmitted helminthiases identification and eosinophilia measurements were performed. Questionnaires gathered demographic details and loiasis-related signs. ARTs performance was compared using specific loiasis-related signs and microfilaremia as references. Discordances between the two ARTs were investigated using logistic regression models.",
    "Principal findings": "Out of 971 participants, 35.4% had L. loa microfilaremia, 71.9% had already experienced loiasis-related signs, 85.1% were positive in the pan-IgG-SXP-1 test and 79.4% were positive in the IgG4-SXP-1 biplex test. In the microfilariae-positive population, the sensitivity of the rapid tests was 87.4% for the pan-IgG-SXP-1 test and 88.6% for the prototype IgG4-SXP-1 biplex test. Sensitivity was similar for both ARTs when using eye worm or Calabar swelling as references, but diagnostic performance varied based on microfilaremia levels and occult loiasis. Overall, IgG4-SXP-1 biplex test demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.1% and specificity of 47.6% for loiasis compared to the pan-IgG-SXP-1 test, leading to a Kappa coefficient estimated at 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 for the qualitative results of the 2 ARTs. In the group that tested positive with the Pan-IgG test but negative with the IgG4-specific test, there was a lower prevalence of STH infection (p = 0.008) and elevated eosinophilia (p<0.001) compared to the general tested population.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The sensitivity of each test was good (84\u201385%) but the diagnostic agreement between the two ARTs was poor, suggesting that IgG and IgG4 antibody responses should be interpreted differently. The assessment of the innovative rapid diagnostic IgG4-SXP-1 biplex test, designed for onchocerciasis and loiasis, shows encouraging sensitivity but underlines the necessity for further in vitro assessment."
