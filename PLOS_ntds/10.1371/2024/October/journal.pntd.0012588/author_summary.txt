Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease, infects 6â€“7 million people in the Americas. Its life cycle involves the infection of triatomine insects which transmit the infection to humans and other mammals. Inside the insects, the parasite proliferates as non-infective forms, and its transmission to mammals depends on their differentiation into infective forms. Proline is a factor supporting this differentiation, while valine, leucine and isoleucine (known collectively as BCAA for branched-chain amino acids) do not. Combining proline with each BCAA results in a diminished number of viable parasites, with significantly reduced infectivity. To explore the causes of such diminished infectivity, we performed a proteomics analysis to compare parasites obtained with proline, in the presence or absence of BCAA. We observed that BCAA differentially regulated different proteins associated with metabolic processes: BCAA diminished enzymes related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle while increased enzymes involved in amino acid and purine metabolism. Furthermore, isoleucine or valine increased enzymes linked to lipid and redox metabolism. These findings suggest that the presence of BCAAs can reshape the metabolism of the parasite, contributing to the observed reduction in infectivity.
