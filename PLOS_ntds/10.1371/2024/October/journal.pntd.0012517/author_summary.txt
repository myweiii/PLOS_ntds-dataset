Leishmaniasis represents a severe global health problem, and drug resistance is a growing concern. Leishmania spp. are obligate intracellular parasites that survive within cells of the vertebrate macrophage, modulating their activation. Understanding the multilayered relationship between metabolism and function of innate immune cells during infection has great therapeutic and preventive potential. Mammalian macrophages and Acanthamoeba spp. display similarities in the molecular mechanisms involved in directional motility, recognition, binding, engulfment, and the phagolysosomal processes, and they express similar receptors. Hence, we hypothesize that Acanthamoeba spp. represent a model that can be used to evaluate macrophage–pathogen interactions from the perspective of innate immunity. However, it has not yet been described whether Leishmania spp. can survive in Acanthamoeba spp. We found that Acanthamoeba spp. support Leishmania growth. Acanthamoeba spp. contain ancient pathogen recognition mechanisms, and Leishmania spp. could manipulate amoeboid functions to favor their survival and replication based on strategies of ancestral metabolic pathways. Our robust evidence highlights that amoebae could be used as a model to understand the biology and evolution of host–Leishmania interactions.
