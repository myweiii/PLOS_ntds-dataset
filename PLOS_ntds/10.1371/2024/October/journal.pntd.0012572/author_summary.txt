Mycetoma is a rare neglected tropical disease that affects the skin and the tissues beneath skin, causing severe health issues if not diagnosed and treated early. It disproportionately affects people in rural and impoverished communities in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. Mycetoma often affects mostly young adults in their productive years especially those participating in agricultural activities. In our study, we trained community health workers (CHWs) in Northern Uganda for one day to improve their knowledge and skills in identifying and referring cases of mycetoma. Our results showed that the CHWs had significant knowledge improvement that persisted for at least six months without more training. Furthermore, they were able to identify 30 possible cases of mycetoma after assessing nearly 3,000 people in the communities. Furthermore, we found challenges and barriers to early detection of this disease such as limited initial knowledge, stigma, myths about the disease, and practical issues like transportation difficulties and long distances to health facilities. Therefore, our study shows that by empowering local health workers, we can improve early detection and treatment of mycetoma, ultimately enhancing health in affected regions.
