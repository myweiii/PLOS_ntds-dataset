Porcine cysticercosis is a tapeworm infection with a complex life cycle involving pigs and humans. This parasite is the cause of over a third of cases of acquired epilepsy in regions of the world where sanitation is poor and free-range pigs are reared, and is a public health and economic challenge to consumers and farmers. Our study aimed to estimate the prevalence of tapeworm infection in slaughtered pigs in Rwanda, in order to support disease control. We found that porcine cysticercosis is widespread across the country with a high prevalence in the south and south-west. Pigs with very high numbers of tapeworm cysts were identified and constitute a public health concern to consumers. We showed that the locally available tests for infection such as tongue palpation and veterinary meat inspection are not efficient at preventing infected pigs from reaching consumers. Control of cysticercosis in Rwanda will require further interventions that support hygienic pig production practices and improved pork processing and cooking, ensure appropriate on-farm treatment to stop transmission of porcine cysticercosis and human taeniasis and increase community awareness and behaviour change.
