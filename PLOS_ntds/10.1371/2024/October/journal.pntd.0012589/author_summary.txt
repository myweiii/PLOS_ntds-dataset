Dengue poses a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions. The lack of a specific treatment or broadly effective vaccine highlights the critical need for novel approaches. In this study, we investigated the transcriptionally active microbial species (TAMs) in 112 dengue-positive patients from MAX Hospital in Delhi, India, to identify their correlations with disease severity. RNA-seq analysis revealed an increased abundance of opportunistic TAMs in severe dengue patients, with some species showing significant associations with platelet counts and total leukocyte count (TLC). Our findings underscore the underappreciated importance of the blood microbiome in dengue, particularly the heightened metabolic activity of these opportunistic species in severe cases. This study offers valuable insights for early infection diagnosis for dengue management. The species-level data identified here could pave the way for systematic exploration of microbial involvement in dengue virus (DENV) infections, potentially serving as an indicator for new adjuvant treatment strategies.
