Highly sensitive diagnostic approaches to identify, diagnose, and monitor intestinal schistosomiasis transmission are needed to reliably measure the burden and risk of infection in endemic areas. Here, we used a range of diagnostic approaches, including highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods, to investigate Schistosoma mansoni prevalence and transmission along the southern shoreline of Lake Malawi, Mangochi District, Malawi, five years post-disease outbreak. The measured prevalence of S. mansoni infection varied considerably depending on which diagnostic assay was used. Additionally, a high degree of Schistosoma haematobium DNA was detected in DNA isolated from faecal samples and motile S. haematobium miracidia were recovered from faecal samples. Through phylogenetic analyses, it was also suggested that multiple introduction and colonisation events of S. mansoni originating from surrounding east African countries into Mangochi District may have recently taken place. As such, the revision of ongoing schistosomiasis control programmes in this area is recommended. Our study also highlights the need for reliable diagnostic assays capable of distinguishing between Schistosoma species in multispecies co-endemic areas.
