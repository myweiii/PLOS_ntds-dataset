Leishmaniases are serious human and animal diseases caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), transmitted by blood-feeding insects – phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae). They are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, but recently the ranges of the vectors have spread more into temperate regions. In Europe, species of Leishmania that were previously absent have emerged, mainly due to the mass migration of the refugees from endemic areas. It is therefore important to know whether local sand flies can transmit these “new” Leishmania species. In our study, we tested two widely distributed sand fly species, P. perniciosus and P. tobbi. In both of them, L. major and L. donovani completed their development, thus P. perniciosus and P. tobbi are potential vectors of these parasites. The third Leishmania species tested, L. martiniquensis, which has been repeatedly recorded in Central Europe, did not survive in P. perniciosus and P. tobbi; its vectors have yet to be confirmed.
