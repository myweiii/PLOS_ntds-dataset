Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-born parasitic disease which predominantly affect poor communities in isolated regions and is closely linked with extreme poverty. VL is life-threatening when left untreated and has important socio-economic impacts. In this study we examined the economic burden of VL among households in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Our findings indicate that the economic burden of VL as a percent of household income is extremely expensive, with a large proportion representing catastrophic health costs. The economic impact of VL is not only limited to high cost of treatment, but also time lost during treatment-seeking periods and hospital stays. VL diagnostics and drugs are being provided free of charge to patients treated at public hospitals, an important policy measure in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, the economic impact of the disease is still very challenging to households. Therefore, VL transmission needs to be blocked by implementing efficient prevention strategies, mainly through outreach case-detections and community awareness campaigns to alleviate the economic burden of households from VL endemic communities. In the absence of effective prevention, the other feasible way is through decentralization of VL care centers to enable patients get care services nearby without spending much time and transportation costs.
