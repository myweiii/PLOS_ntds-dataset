The authors would like to acknowledge all participants who voluntarily accepted the data collection team and served as respondents in the study for their valuable time and information; the data collectors who contributed their invaluable time and energy during data collection and all those who in one way or another contributed their thoughts in this study are highly appreciated. We would like to acknowledge members of the KalaCORE evaluation team (including Simon Croft, the project lead, Lydia Boudarene, Mark Pearson and Jayne Webster) who conducted two cross-sectional surveys in the study area in 2016 and 2018 in collaboration with the lead author of this paper. The VL patient questionnaire from those surveys was the basis for the main tool used in this study.
