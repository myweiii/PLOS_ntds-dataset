Spain is presumed to have a low burden of congenital toxoplasmosis, but the true incidence of the disease is currently unknown. To describe and analyze the status of congenital toxoplasmosis in Spain, in 2018 we created a multicenter registry known as the Spanish Research Network of Congenital Toxoplasmosis (REIV-TOXO) to collect data on all children diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis born in Spain from January 1, 2015 to the present. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of cases included in REIV-TOXO between 2015 and 2022. We also focused on the effect of prenatal treatment on clinical outcomes at birth and during follow-up, since its effectiveness has been questioned in the past and may raise several concerns. One of these issues is the actual benefit of serological screening during pregnancy as part of a public health strategy to mitigate the disease. Although the implementation of prenatal screening is still under debate, it remains the only tool available that allows any potentially infected children to be identified and afford them an opportunity for early follow-up and treatment. In view of the progressive withdrawal of prenatal screening in Spain in recent years, the results of our cohort are relevant, as they provide data that could aid public health decision-making policies.
