Aedes aegypti is a mosquito vector with public health importance on the global scale as it transmits viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Although transmission rates of dengue and Zika are low in the U.S., there are a few regions, including south Texas, where local transmission has occurred. Our study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with risk of exposure to these viruses using a serological bioassay that measured antibody response to an Ae. aegypti salivary protein to assess human-vector contact. We collected mosquitoes, took human-blood samples, and conducted urbanistic and demographic surveys in November 2021 in eight communities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas. Our knowledge, attitude, and practices survey found that most residents recognized adult mosquitoes, though few individuals knew someone personally who been sick with a mosquito-borne disease. Outdoor adult female Ae. aegypti abundance was positively associated with exposure to mosquito bites. Household income, individual age, and lot area also significantly affected exposure levels. The Bitemark Assay we used in this study can be utilized as a tool for entomological risk assessment and could be used as an alternative to infection exposure in areas where mosquito-borne disease levels are low.
