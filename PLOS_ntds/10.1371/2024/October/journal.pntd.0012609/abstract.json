    "Background": "Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an inflammatory reaction that occurs in HIV/AIDS patients after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Along with immune system recovery, IRIS can overreact to existing infections or latent pathogens, causing symptoms that mimic those infections. Few studies elucidated the clinical features and prognosis of Talaromycosis marneffei (TSM)-associated IRIS in HIV/AIDS patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of TSM-associated IRIS by retrospectively analyzing the clinical data of HIV/AIDS patients with TSM.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A total of 224 HIV/AIDS inpatients with TSM were enrolled, aged between 19 and 81 years. Among them, 86.6% were male and 13.4% were female, of which 24 (10.7%) patients developed IRIS. In IRIS group, the median time from ART initiation to IRIS occurrence was 9.0 days (IQR, 5.0\u201316.8 days), with 87.5% (21/24) occurring within 2 weeks. Primary clinical manifestations included recurrent fever and exacerbation of pulmonary infection. At the onset of IRIS, 54.2% (13/24) patients were treated with intravenous dexamethasone, and 12.5% (5/24) patients were treated with oral prednisone for 1\u20133 weeks. No significant differences in baseline characteristics or ART regimens were observed between IRIS and non-IRIS groups; however, patients in IRIS group had higher levels of CRP, CD4+ count, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio than non-IRIS group (equivalent time point: 1\u20132 weeks after ART initiation) at IRIS onset. The IRIS group exhibited longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates, but equivalent mortality rates compared with non-IRIS group.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "IRIS is a common complication in HIV/AIDS patients with TSM, often occurring within 2 weeks after ART initiation and exhibiting more pronounced immune reconstitution. The occurrence of IRIS significantly extended the hospitalization duration and increased the rate of readmission but had no influence on the mortality rate."
