Podoconiosis is a neglected tropical disease that causes swelling of the feet and legs leading to bodily disfigurement. An estimated 4 million people are affected worldwide, while in Rwanda, more than six thousand are affected with the disease. Those affected experience social exclusion and discrimination, which cause profound socio-economic and psychological impacts. The nature of this experience has not yet been fully explored. The aim of this paper is to explore the social nuances of podoconiosis-related stigma to contribute to better understanding of the experience of podoconiosis.
We explored the experience of stigma of people affected by podoconiosis. We identified various features of podoconiosis-related stigma, such as bodily deformation, illness contamination and bodily weakness. We also noted that socio-economic status, gender, age and severity of podoconiosis fuelled the experience of stigma. Participants explained how affected people experienced stigma that was influenced by many factors: their living conditions, age, gender and illness status, on which their social acceptance or rejection was judged.
The experience of affected people is multi-layered, and varies from individual to individual. Therefore, our understanding and actions should rest on an approach that enables us to analyse and identify intersected social features to reduce podoconiosis-related stigma holistically.
