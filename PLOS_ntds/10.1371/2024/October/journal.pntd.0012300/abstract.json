    "Abstract": "Q fever (QF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are endemic zoonotic diseases in African countries, causing significant health and economic burdens. Accurate prevalence estimates, crucial for disease control, rely on robust diagnostic tests. While enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are not the gold standard, they offer rapid, cost-effective, and practical alternatives. However, varying results from different tests and laboratories can complicate comparing epidemiological studies. This study aimed to assess the agreement of test results for QF and RVF in humans and livestock across different laboratory conditions and, for humans, different types of diagnostic tests. We measured inter-laboratory agreement using concordance, Cohen’s kappa, and prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) on 91 human and 102 livestock samples collected from rural regions in Chad. The serum aliquots were tested using ELISA in Chad, and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (for human QF and RVF) and ELISA (for livestock QF and RVF) in Switzerland and Germany. Additionally, we examined demographic factors influencing test agreement, including district, setting (village vs. camp), sex, age, and livestock species of the sampled individuals. The inter-laboratory agreement ranged from fair to moderate. For humans, QF concordance was 62.5%, Cohen’s kappa was 0.31, RVF concordance was 81.1%, and Cohen’s kappa was 0.52. For livestock, QF concordance was 92.3%, Cohen’s kappa was 0.59, RVF concordance was 94.0%, and Cohen’s kappa was 0.59. Multivariable analysis revealed that QF test agreement is significantly higher in younger humans and people living in villages compared to camps and tends to be higher in livestock from Danamadji compared to Yao, and in small ruminants compared to cattle. Additionally, RVF agreement was found to be higher in younger humans. Our findings emphasize the need to consider sample conditions, test performance, and influencing factors when conducting and interpreting epidemiological seroprevalence studies."
