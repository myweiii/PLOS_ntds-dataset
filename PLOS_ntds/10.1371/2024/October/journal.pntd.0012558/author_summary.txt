Our study addresses the pressing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella Typhi, which severely limits treatment options for typhoid fever. Globally, it also raises concerns for a potential pan-oral drug-resistant outbreak. We conducted typhoid fever surveillance, spanning 24 years (1999â€“2022) across two pediatric hospitals and three private clinics in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. Our aim was to understand how the AMR landscape of Salmonella Typhi has changed over the years and its correlation with antibiotic consumption. Our findings reveal a notable decline in resistance to first-line drugs including cotrimoxazole, whose decreasing consumption showed a statistically significant correlation with reduced resistance. Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility persisted at >90%. Ceftriaxone resistance remained low, but there was an upward trend in its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Azithromycin resistance is emerging and currently at <4% but is expected to increase due to the observed 38-fold rise in azithromycin consumption. Taken together, our results establish a baseline to assess the impact of interventions like typhoid conjugate vaccines on typhoid and associated AMR in Bangladesh. Our work also suggests that decreasing resistance to the first line of drugs in Salmonella Typhi may allow for the re-introduction of first line of antimicrobials as empirical treatment options for typhoid fever.
