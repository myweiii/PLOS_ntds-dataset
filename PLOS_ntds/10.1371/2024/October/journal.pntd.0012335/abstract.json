    "Background": "The venom of Bothrops lanceolatus, a viperid species endemic to the Lesser Antillean Island of Martinique, induces thrombosis in a number of patients. Previous clinical observations indicate that thrombotic events are more common in patients bitten by juvenile specimens. There is a need to develop an experimental model of this effect in order to study the mechanisms involved.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The venoms of juvenile and adult specimens of B. lanceolatus were compared by (a) describing their proteome, (b) assessing their ability to induce thrombosis in a mouse model, and (c) evaluating their in vitro procoagulant activity and in vivo hemostasis alterations. Venom proteomes of juvenile and adult specimens were highly similar, albeit showing some differences. When injected by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route, the venom of juvenile specimens induced the formation of abundant thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, whereas this effect was less frequent in the case of adult venom. Thrombosis was not abrogated by the metalloproteinase inhibitor Batimastat. Both venoms showed a weak in vitro procoagulant effect on citrated mouse plasma and bovine fibrinogen. When administered intravenously (i.v.) venoms did not affect classical clotting tests (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) but caused a partial drop in fibrinogen concentration. The venom of juvenile specimens induced partial alterations in some rotational thromboelastometry parameters after i.v. injection. When venoms were administered i.p., only minor alterations in classical clotting tests were observed with juvenile venom, and no changes occurred for either venom in rotational thromboelastometry parameters. Both juvenile and adult venoms induced a marked thrombocytopenia after i.p. injection.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "An experimental model of the thrombotic effect induced by B. lanceolatus venom was developed. This effect is more pronounced in the case of venom of juvenile specimens, despite the observation that juvenile and adult venom proteomes are similar. Adult and juvenile venoms do not induce a consumption coagulopathy characteristic of other Bothrops sp venoms. Both venoms induce a conspicuous thrombocytopenia. This experimental model reproduces the main clinical findings described in these envenomings and should be useful to understand the mechanisms of the thrombotic effect."
