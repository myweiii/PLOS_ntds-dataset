Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of encephalitis in Asia and the Western Pacific, with estimated 100,000 cases in people (mainly children) annually. Up to one third of cases result in death, and of those who survive, half can suffer ongoing neurological problems. Japanese encephalitis virus circulation is complex. It is transmitted via mosquitoes between hosts. Although well-known key hosts include pigs and water birds, our review showed that there are others that should be considered in surveillance programs such as bats and perching birds. We also found that detection is challenging because diagnostic tests cross-react with other viruses. Both improved understanding of hosts and better diagnostic tests are needed to develop surveillance systems to reduce JEV incidence in people.
