Many Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) predominantly affect the skin and are referred to as skin NTDs. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a number of strategies for the control, eradication and elimination of skin NTDs and recognizes the importance of integrated approaches to mapping skin NTDs. We conducted a study adopting integrated screening for multiple skin NTDs and other skin conditions in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana. This ran alongside a study focused on diagnostic tests for one specific skin NTD–yaws.
The results showed that integrated screening is a feasible and cost-effective way to detect multiple skin NTDs in a single intervention. Of more than 60,000 individuals screened almost one in five had a skin lesion. Cases of yaws confirmed by blood tests were detected more frequently in Ghana compared to Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon. The most common skin conditions were scabies and superficial fungal infections. Other skin NTDs such as Buruli ulcer, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and tungiasis were less common. Integrated screening allowed detection of skin conditions and co-endemicity of skin NTDs and the data can guide decisions on resource mobilization to manage skin NTDs.
