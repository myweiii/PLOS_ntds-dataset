Scrub typhus, a disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is typically treated with antibiotics. It can sometimes lead to serious complications, including thromboembolic events. These events can be life-threatening but have been rarely reported due to under-suspicion in clinical practice, as their rarity often leads to them being overlooked. In this regard, our study suggests that clinicians should be cautious when managing patients with scrub typhus to prevent the development of thromboembolic events, especially in patients with risk factors such as treatment with rifampin, Taguchi genotype, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age.
