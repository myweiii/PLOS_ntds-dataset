In the early 1990s, a large-scale survey for arboviruses in vectors was conducted in Hainan Island. However, in the past 30 years, with climate change, urbanization, and the increasing population and trades, whether the arboviruses spectrum changed on this Island is unclear. We screened arboviruses in mosquitoes and biting midges from 2019 to 2023 to assess the presence of arbovirus and the genetic evolution currently circulating on this Island. Except for arboviruses such as JEV, GTEV, and OYAV, which have been previously reported circulating on Hainan Island, TMUV and BTV were detected for the first time during this survey. These findings highlight the increasing risk of arbovirus transmission in Hainan Island. It is crucial to prioritize extensive and continuous surveillance of arboviruses carried by mosquitoes and biting midges in local regions to help prevent the spread of emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases.
