Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection, a neglected chronic parasitic infection, continues to be a significant public health concern with severe implications. Despite ongoing containment efforts leading to a decline in prevalence in Korea, assessing interventions remains challenging, due to variations in infection risk across different birth cohorts, driven by generational differences in raw freshwater fish consumption. We applied the age-period-cohort modeling approach to nationally representative C. sinensis infection prevalence data from 1981â€“2012 in Korea. Our analysis showed both cohort and period effects have significantly contributed to the observed decline in the prevalence of C. sinensis infection in Korea throughout the study period. Notably, the effectiveness of interventions remains evident even after adjusting for the cohort effect. Projections of age-stratified prevalence up to 2023 suggest a downward trend across all age groups. However, those aged over 40 are expected to maintain a prevalence exceeding 1%, highlighting the imperative for ongoing sustained efforts toward disease elimination. The age-period-cohort modeling framework offers broad applicability in other liver fluke endemic countries, particularly where data on host reservoirs beyond humans is limited. This approach provides valuable insights for future public health planning and resource allocation, aiming to mitigate the disease burden in affected regions.
