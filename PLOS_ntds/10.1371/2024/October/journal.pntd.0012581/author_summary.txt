In Thailand, Leishmania martiniquensis and Leishmania orientalis are the causative agents of cutaneous (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) reported in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. VL poses a significant health threat, especially to those with HIV infection. Our study conducted a cohort study among HIV-infected patients in Trang Hospital, Trang Province, Southern Thailand, to explore the incidence and persistence of Leishmania infection, a topic not extensively studied in this region. Our findings are crucial for multiple reasons. Firstly, this study reveals a significant incidence rate of 3.2% among HIV patients, and increasing age was a significant predictor of incident Leishmania infection. Secondly, the persistence of Leishmania infection in 3.7% of initially positive cases underscores the challenges in managing this co-infection. It has immediate implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health officials, aiding them in implementing targeted interventions and preventive measures to reduce the impact of leishmaniasis among HIV-infected individuals. By shedding light on this understudied issue, we hope to contribute to better health outcomes for this vulnerable population.
