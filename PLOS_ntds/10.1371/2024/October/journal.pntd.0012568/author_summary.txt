Dengue is endemic in Vietnam and this virus consists of four serotypes (DENV1-4) that circulate- all year-round. It has complex transmission and immunity dynamics, which makes serotype-specific transmission patterns difficult to estimate. Moreover, high asymptomatic rates which leads to under reporting and little serotype testing of cases adds to this issue. Many studies have shown that seroprevalence studies are useful to understanding dengue transmission patterns, hence, we undertook a seroprevalence studies in Ho Chi Minh City and Khanh Hoa, Vietnam. We tested samples using a flavivirus protein microarray (PMA) serological assay and used previously developed frameworks to estimate past infection exposures for each individual. With these past exposure histories, we estimated the transmission intensity for all four dengue serotypes. We found this method provided substantial information on past serotype transmission. We estimated the annual dengue force of infection (FOI) ranged from 0.005 (95%CI: 0.003–0.008) to 0.201 (95%CI: 0.174–0.228). FOI varied across serotypes, higher for DENV1 (95%CI: 0.033–0.048) and DENV2 (95%CI: 0.018–0.039) than DENV3 (95%CI: 0.007–0.010) and DENV4 (95%CI: 0.010–0.016). This method can be used for planning future control measures, especially vaccination.
