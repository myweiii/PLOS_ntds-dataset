Rickettsiosis includes a diversity of systemic infections presented with non-specific symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis of rickettsiosis is often not easy. In this 12-month study, six patients with a variety of rickettsia infections were diagnosed directly or indirectly by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). These include one patient with Japanese spotted fever in whom Rickettsia japonica sequences were detected in blood, two patients with Rickettsia felis chest infections in whom R. felis sequences were detected in respiratory samples, one patient with scrub typhus in whom Orientia tsutsugamushi sequences were detected in serum, and two patients with rickettsiosis of the typhus group. In particular, the last three patients had initial false-negative Weil-Felix test results performed in a central reference laboratory but the diagnosis of rickettsiosis was subsequently confirmed by mNGS and repeated serology. mNGS is an important diagnostic tool for rickettsiosis and other difficult-to-diagnose systemic infections.
