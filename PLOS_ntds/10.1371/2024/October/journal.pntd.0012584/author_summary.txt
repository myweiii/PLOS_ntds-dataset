Ticks found on bats might carry diseases that can be important for both animal and human health. In this study we collected three species of bat ticks and used molecular methods to demonstrate their feeding habits and to explore the pathogens they carry. We found that most of the ticks had been feeding on bats, but we also found evidence of blood meals from domestic and wild animals, such as dogs, wild boars, and horses. We also found several bacteria in these ticks that can infect or potentially infect humans and animals. These results indicate that bat ticks could be a potential link between bats and non-bat hosts and may help spread diseases between them. Learning about how ticks interact with different host species is critical to understanding the ecology and spread of wildlife disease.
