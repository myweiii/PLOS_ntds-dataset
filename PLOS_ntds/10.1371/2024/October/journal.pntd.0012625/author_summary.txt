Naturally acquired immunity to malaria relies on the development of MBCs and long-lived plasma cells that serve as the source of antibody responses that inhibit parasite invasion. To date, information is limited regarding the role of Tfh cells in supporting development of MBCs and antibodies against P. vivax infection, particularly in the context of natural malaria exposure. Here, we identified subsets of cTfh cells that involved in the generation of P. vivax-specific MBC and antibody responses. We found that P. vivax infection induced an expansion of cTfh2 cells. The cTfh2 cell responses were positively related to an increased frequency of activated and atypical MBCs, and plasma cells, as well as P. vivax-specific antibody levels. Moreover, phenotype of memory cTfh2 cells was changed from CM to EM phase during infection. The alteration of cTfh17-EM cells was significantly related to expansion of activated and atypical MBCs, while the presence of cTfh2-CM and cTfh17-CM cells was positively related to P. vivax-specific MBCs and IgM responses. Data from this study suggests a role of cTfh2 cells in contribution to the development of P. vivax-specific MBCs and antibody responses.
