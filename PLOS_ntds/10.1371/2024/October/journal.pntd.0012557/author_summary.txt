Rabies is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), predominantly prevalent in Africa and Asia, with a nearly 100% fatality rate upon onset. China is striving to achieve the WHOâ€™s global goal of zero deaths from dog-mediated human rabies by 2030. Therefore, exploring the spatial and temporal evolution of human rabies in China and the possible influencing factors can provide a scientific basis for the development of more effective human rabies prevention and control programs in China. The results of the study showed that from 2004 to 2020, the overall relative risk of human rabies incidence in China showed an increasing and then decreasing trend. The relative risk of most provinces, such as Guangxi and Guizhou, declined significantly, but there were still some provinces, such as Hunan and Henan, where the relative risk showed a rising trend year by year. The results of the analysis of influencing factors indicate that lower per capita disposable income of urban residents, local government healthcare expenditures and sunshine hours, higher temperatures are associated with a higher risk of human rabies.
