    "Background": "Tsetse flies (Glossina) transmit species of Trypanosoma which cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT). Understanding the epidemiology of this disease and controlling the vector rationally requires analysis of the abundance, age structure, infection rates and feeding patterns of tsetse populations.",
    "Methods": "We analysed a population of G. fuscipes fuscipes in the Koboko district of Uganda. Seasonal variation in the abundance of tsetse was assessed from the numbers of tsetse caught in pyramidal traps. The age structure of the population was assessed by dissecting female tsetse to estimate their ovarian categories. Classical and PCR-based methods were utilised to determine the presence of the three major pathogenic species of salivarian trypanosomes: T. vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei in a subset (n = 2369) of flies. Further, bloodmeal analysis was carried out using PCR to amplify and sequence a portion of the vertebrate cytb gene.",
    "Results": "The abundance and age structure of tsetse populations were relatively stable and a slight seasonal four-fold variation in abundance appeared to be correlated with rainfall. Analyses of age structure suggests a low natural daily mortality of 1.75% (1.62–1.88). Infection rates estimated were significantly greater (1.9–9.3 times) using the PCR-based method compared to the classical dissection-based method. Positive rates for T. brucei sl, T. congolense and T. vivax were 1.6% (1.32–2.24), 2.4% (1.83–3.11and 2.0% (1.46–2.63), respectively by PCR. The majority of bloodmeals were identified as cattle (39%, 30.5–47.8) and human (37%, 28.4–45.6).",
    "Conclusion": "The seasonally stable abundance, low mortality rate and high proportion of bloodmeals from humans may explain, in part, why this district has historically been a focus of sleeping sickness. Additionally, the high rates of cattle feeding indicate insecticide treated cattle may prove to be a useful vector control strategy in the area."
