Our research provides a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of sandflies and SAPs in China. We have identified 47 sandfly species and 6 SAPs, with 12 main sandfly species forming three distinct ecological clusters. Our machine learning models predict the distribution and risk of sandfly species and VL under various climate and socioeconomic scenarios. The model predictions reveal a significant underestimation of the current sandfly distribution and VL risk. Future global changes are projected to decrease the risk of MT-ZVL, but AVL and DT-ZVL could remain stable or slightly increase. These findings underscore the need for more active surveillance and field investigations of vectors, especially where the future risk of VL is projected to remain high or increase. This study provides important theoretical support for guiding the surveillance and control of sandflies and SAPs.
