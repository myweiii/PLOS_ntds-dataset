    "Abstract": "Melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei is an infectious disease with a high mortality rate. In acute melioidosis, sepsis is a major cause of death among patients. Once the bacterium enters the bloodstream, immune system dysregulation ensues, leading to cytokine storms. In contrast to B. pseudomallei, a closely related but non-virulent strain B. thailandensis has rarely been reported to cause cytokine storms or death in patients. However, the mechanisms in which the virulent B. pseudomallei causes sepsis are not fully elucidated. It is well-documented that monocytes play an essential role in cytokine production in the bloodstream. The present study, therefore, determined whether there is a difference in the innate immune response to B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis during infection of primary human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells by investigating pyroptosis, an inflammatory death pathway known to play a pivotal role in sepsis. Our results showed that although both bacterial species exhibited a similar ability to invade human monocytes, only B. pseudomallei can significantly increase the release of cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as the increases in caspase-1 and gasdermin D activations in both cell types. The results were consistent with the significant increase in IL-1Î² and IL-18 production, key cytokines involved in pyroptosis. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in other cytokine secretion, such as IL-1RA, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-15, IL-8, and IL-23 in cells infected by both bacterial species. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that ROS production played a crucial role in controlling pyroptosis activation during B. pseudomallei infection in primary human monocytes. These findings suggested that pyroptosis induced by B. pseudomallei in the human monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis in acute melioidosis patients."
