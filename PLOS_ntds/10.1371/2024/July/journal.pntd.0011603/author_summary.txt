Dengue is a widespread mosquito-borne disease. Mosquitoes are sensitive to temperature and rainfall and hence there have been efforts to identify such variables for predicting dengue outbreaks. Several mosquito indices are measured routinely by national surveillance systems, but which vary considerably in their success of predicting dengue outbreaks. This study explored the current and lagged associations of meteorological variables with mosquito indices and dengue incidence. Associations of mosquito indices with dengue were also explored. Rain and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) contributed most to explaining the variation in both mosquito indices and number of dengue cases. DTR and minimum temperature also explained variation in dengue cases occurring one and two months later. Mosquito indices did not provide any additional explanatory power for dengue incidences. Given the onerous nature of measuring mosquito indices, advanced warning systems might be improved using meteorological variables measured at finer scales than that traditionally available.
