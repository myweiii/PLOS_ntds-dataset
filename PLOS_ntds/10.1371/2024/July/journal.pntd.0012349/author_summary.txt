We investigated the evolutionary and molecular history of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype to determine the origins of the 2018â€“2019 chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak in Thailand. We used newly sequenced clinical samples from travellers returning to Sweden from Thailand in late 2018 and early 2019 together with previously published genome sequences. Our phylogeographic analysis shows that the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL), found within ECSA, evolved in Eastern Africa, Southern Asia, and Southeast Asia for about 15 years before the outbreak in Thailand in 2018. We have also identified amino acid substitutions that may be associated with immune evasion, increased spread, and higher virulence that occurred prior to the outbreak and may have played a critical role in the rapid spread of the virus. Our study concludes that monitoring and understanding CHIKV dynamics remains critical for an effective response to the previously unpredictable outbreaks of the virus.
