Coxiella burnetii causes infections in both humans and animals, resulting in Q fever and Coxiellosis, respectively. This bacterium poses significant public health, veterinary, and economic risks worldwide due to its potential to cause severe illness and low infectious dose. Therefore, it is important to estimate the sero-prevalence of C. burnetii infection and associated risk factors in cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, respectively. The serum samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-C. burnetii antibodies using an indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (iELISA) kit. A prevalence estimate of 18.77% was observed for C. burnetii. The sero-prevalence estimate at abbatoirs and pastoral areas was found in the order of Addis Ababa (27.17%)>Adama (19.41%)>Modjo (19.13)>pastoral areas (12.1%). The risk factors were identified as animal species, age, sex, and tick infestation. Camels were more vulnerable than sheep, goats and cattle. The adults were infected more than young. The ticks may be a potential vector for the transmission of the pathogen.
