Latin America is aiming towards malaria elimination. Genomic surveillance is crucial for a countryâ€™s malaria strategy, aiding in understanding and stopping the spread of the disease. While widely used for another malaria species (Plasmodium falciparum), limited tools exist for tracking P. vivax, a significant player in malaria-endemic areas outside of Africa, and the primary cause of malaria in Latin America.
In this study, we used a new tool, Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru assay, to examine the genetic makeup of malaria parasites in the Peruvian Amazon. This tool helps us see how the parasites from different areas are connected and tracks markers that could indicate resistance to drugs. We found that the parasites from remote areas in the Amazon were genetically different from parasites in areas surrounding the main city of Iquitos, and parasites in a remote border community were genetically more similar to Brazilian parasites.
We also show that the Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru assay can be used to study parasites from other countries in Latin America, highlighting the broader application in the region. Considering that parasites are not constrained by borders and can easily spread between neighboring countries, a regional approach can be crucial for malaria elimination.
