Canine vaccination plays a vital role in rabies prevention and control efforts; however, significant variability exists in vaccination rates across Sierra Leone. To address this issue, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving 2,558 dog-owning households to understand the factors influencing canine vaccination and identify areas with low vaccination rates. Our findings revealed that vaccination probability increased among civil servants compared to private workers/artisans, those residing in areas with veterinary establishments, those providing care to dogs, and those owning a single dog. Conversely, vaccination probability decreased among dog owners in rural areas compared to urban areas. Latent understanding, a measure of overall understanding of rabies virus, which we estimated using participant education levels and responses to questions about rabies epidemiology, was also an important predictor of vaccination probability. Spatial analysis identified high-risk clusters for low vaccination rates in Moyamba and Bo. These findings underscore the urgent need for public outreach, education initiatives, improved vaccination rates, enhanced veterinary accessibility, and targeted interventions in Bo and Moyamba to combat rabies effectively.
