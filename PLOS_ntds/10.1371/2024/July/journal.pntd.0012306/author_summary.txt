Rodents live almost everywhere in the world, adapt to extremely diverse habitats, and transmit various infectious diseases to humans and other animals. All six pathogens were detected in rodents. Our findings demonstrated that 66.7% (104/156) of rodents were infected with at least one pathogen. We also observed differences in the pathogens detected in rodents by province. These results provide evidence that rodents play an important role in the transmission of SFTSV. Although we did not screen for all rodent-borne diseases, these data provide information about emerging rodent-borne diseases disseminated in the ROK and emphasize the risk of occurrence of rodent-borne diseases.
