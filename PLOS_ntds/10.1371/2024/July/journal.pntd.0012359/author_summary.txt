King Cobra is the longest venomous snake in the world and is widely distributed in Peninsular and East Malaysia. There is lack of documentation and publication of King Cobra bite injuries in Malaysia. This may lead to poor awareness of the significance and the severity of envenomation from this species. There are two types of antivenom used in Malaysia for treating King Cobra envenomation, namely Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI), Thai Red Cross King Cobra antivenom and QSMI neuropolyvalent antivenom. There were no previous publications on the clinical outcomes of the utilisation of these antivenom for King Cobra envenomation in Malaysia. This study analysed confirmed King Cobra bite injuries consulted to Remote Envenomation Consultancy Services (RECS) from 2015â€“2020. The RECS consultation log was analysed for the frequency, geographical distribution, clinical features, management and outcome. This study provides verified and reliable information that can be used in the future for developing health policy and clinical management guidelines.
