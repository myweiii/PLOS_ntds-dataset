We would like to thank the Uvira Health Zone and OXFAM International in DRC for their support to this project. We are grateful to the French Agency for Development and the Veolia Foundation, AGC, Arab Contractors, REGIDESO, and the teams of construction workers, all of whom worked and are working tirelessly to improve the Uvira water supply network. We would like to thank all study participants.
Lastly, and most importantly, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of the late Dr Jeroen Ensink. Dr Ensink was instrumental in the conception of this study and it would not have been possible without him. He remains very much in our minds as we conclude this study and is still sorely missed as a colleague and as a friend.
