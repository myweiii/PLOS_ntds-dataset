Diarrhoeal diseases including cholera remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in areas with limited access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). However, evidence for the effect of piped water supply in reducing diarrhoeal diseases and cholera in complex emergency settings remains scarce. We evaluated a large-scale infrastructure programme to improve and expand the piped drinking water supply service in the town of Uvira (South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo), an area with a high burden of cholera and diarrhoeal diseases. We used five years of data from clinical surveillance and systematic cholera confirmation by rapid diagnostic tests in order to estimate associations between water supply infrastructure interventions and the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases and cholera. Our findings are consistent with existing evidence that a high-quality (or “safely managed”) water service can be effective in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal diseases and cholera in low-income urban settings. Beyond overall service quality, the quantity of water supplied to the household and the continuity of the drinking water supply were both associated with a reduced risk of cholera.
