American cutaneous leishmaniasis is a skin disease caused by parasites that are transmitted through the bite of sandflies. It is considered as a neglected tropical disease. In non-endemic countries like Germany, this disease is rarely seen and is imported by migrants or travellers who have been infected in tropical or subtropical areas of the Americas. Experts suggest that the treatment should be given depending on the specific parasite species found in the affected skin, but there is still a scarcity of information on the optimal management strategy. We analysed 75 American cutaneous leishmaniasis cases seen between 2000 and 2023 at our German medical centre. Most patients were men, around 35 years of age, who most commonly travelled to the Americas for tourism. We found that when using systemic medications (i.e., given by mouth, injection or drip into a vein), that were recommended for the specific parasite type, patients were more likely to be cured, with a 73% success rate, compared to a mere 35% success rate when those recommendations were not followed. This highlights the importance of identifying the species that is causing the disease, and suggests that tailoring treatment to the specific parasite species increases the chances of cure.
