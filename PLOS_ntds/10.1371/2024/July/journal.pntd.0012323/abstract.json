    "Background": "American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) shows variable response to therapy, but data on species-specific treatment efficacy is scarce. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with ACL imported to a tertiary centre in Germany and determine whether species-specific therapy according to the 2014 \u201cLeishMan\u201d group recommendations is associated with cure.",
    "Methods": "A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Charit\u00e9 Institute of International Health in Berlin. We analysed data on PCR-confirmed ACL cases collected between 2000 and 2023. Systemic therapy included liposomal amphotericin B, miltefosine, pentavalent antimony, ketoconazole or itraconazole. Localized therapy included perilesional pentavalent antimony or paromomycin ointment. Cure was defined as re-epithelialization of ulcers or disappearance of papular-nodular lesions after 3 months of treatment. Logistic regression models were used to quantify the effect of species-specific systemic therapy on the outcome.",
    "Results": "75 cases were analysed. Most patients were male (62%), median age was 35 years, no patient had a history of immunosuppression. The most common reason for travel was tourism (60%), the most common destination was Costa Rica (28%), the median duration of illness was 8 weeks, and most patients presented with ulcers (87%). Lesions were complex in 43%. The most common Leishmania (L.) species was L. braziliensis (28%), followed by L. panamensis (21%). 51/73 (70%) patients were cured after initial therapy and 17/21 (81%) after secondary therapy. Cure after systemic therapy was more frequent when species-specific treatment recommendations were followed (33/45; 73%), compared to when not followed, (6/17; 35%, P = 0.008). This association was independent of age, sex, previous therapy, complex lesions, and Leishmania species (adjusted OR, 5.06; 95% CI, 1.22\u201324.16).",
    "Conclusions": "ACL is a rare, imported disease in Germany. Complex lesions were common, challenging successful therapy. This study highlights the importance of identifying the parasite species and suggests that a species-specific approach to treatment leads to better outcomes."
