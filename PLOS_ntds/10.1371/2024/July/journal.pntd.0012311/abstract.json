    "Abstract": "Clonorchis sinensis is a significant zoonotic food-borne parasite that causes a range of hepatobiliary diseases, which in severe cases can even lead to cholangiocarcinoma. To explore new diagnostic and treatment strategies, the dynamic RNA regulatory processes across different developmental stages of C. sinensis were analyzed by using whole-transcriptome sequencing. The chromosomal-level genome of C. sinensis was used for sequence alignment and annotation. In this study, we identified a total of 59,103 RNAs in the whole genome, including 2,384 miRNAs, 25,459 mRNAs, 27,564 lncRNAs and 3,696 circRNAs. Differential expression analysis identified 6,556 differentially expressed mRNAs, 2,231 lncRNAs, 877 miRNAs and 20 circRNAs at different developmental stages. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted the critical role of microtubule-related biological processes in the growth and development of C. sinensis. And coexpression analysis revealed 97 lncRNAs and 85 circRNAs that were coexpressed with 42 differentially expressed mRNAs that associated with microtubules at different developmental stages of C. sinensis. The expression of the microtubule-related genes dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) and dynein light chain 4 (DLC4) increased with C. sinensis development, and DLC2/4 could be inhibited by albendazole. Finally, by constructing competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships were constructed, and the ceRNA networks of MSTRG.14258.5-novel_miR_2287-newGene_28215 and MSTRG.14258.5-novel_miR_2216-CSKR_109340 were verified. This study suggests, through whole transcriptome sequencing, that the context of microtubule regulation may play an essential role in the development and growth of C. sinensis."
