    "Abstract": "Musca sorbens (Diptera: Muscidae) flies are thought to be vectors of the blinding eye disease trachoma, carrying the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) between the eyes of individuals. While their role as vectors has been convincingly demonstrated via randomised controlled trials in The Gambia, studies of fly-borne trachoma transmission remain scant and as such our understanding of their ability to transmit Ct remains poor. We examined fly-eye contact and caught eye-seeking flies from 494 individuals (79% aged ≤9 years) in Oromia, Ethiopia. Ct-carrying flies (harbouring Ct DNA) were found to cluster spatially in and nearby to households in which at least one resident had Ct infection. Fly-eye contact was positively associated with the presence of trachoma (disease), lower human body weight and increased human body temperature. Studies of laboratory-reared M. sorbens indicated that Ct is found both externally and internally following feeds on Ct culture, with scanning electron microscopy revealing how Ct bodies can cling to fly hairs (setae). Testing for Ct on field-caught M. sorbens found fly ‘bodies’ (thorax, wings and abdomen) to consistently test positive for Ct while legs and heads were infrequently Ct-positive. These studies strongly support the role of M. sorbens as vectors of trachoma and highlight the need for improved understanding of fly-borne trachoma transmission dynamics and vector competence."
