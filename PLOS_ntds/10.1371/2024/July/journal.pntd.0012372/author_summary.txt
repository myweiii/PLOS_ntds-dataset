Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in low-resource countries where there is insufficient access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel has been the main control method, but it cannot protect against reinfection. With the increasing awareness of the importance of a multi-faceted control strategy, WASH has been recommended as one of the core strategic interventions for schistosomiasis control. The use of soap, one hygiene practice, might play a role in prevention by reducing the penetration of cercariae into human skin during water contact, thereby lowering the infection risk at transmission sites. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no detailed guidelines on how to use soap to prevent schistosomiasis in endemic areas. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the efficacy of four commercial Tanzanian soaps against Schistosoma mansoni cercariae to understand soap lethality. The results provide scientific evidence of soap protection against schistosome cercariae and suggest that future studies should investigate other potential mechanisms by which soap may provide protection against cercariae (e.g. damaging them sufficiently to hinder penetration into the skin or protecting skin against cercarial penetration).
