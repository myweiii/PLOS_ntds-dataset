Spotted fever (SF), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) sporadically have outbreaks in central China. Due to the similarities in clinical symptoms and the absence of reliable diagnostic methods for the detection these pathogens simultaneously, clinical diagnosis and treatment frequently result in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Thus, the development of a fast and accurate diagnostic method is crucial for prevention and precise treatment. In this study, we designed an all-in-one real-time PCR assay to differentiate spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and hantaan virus (HTNV). The ompA gene of SFGR, as well as the segment L of SFTSV and HTNV, were used as targets to design primers and probes for amplification. Through the verification of nucleic acid and clinical sample detection, the sensitivity of this detection method exceeded 97%, and its specificity was 100%.
This new assay could be applied in epidemiology and clinical diagnosis, to control new outbreaks, reduce diagnostic and identification time, and improve test efficiency.
