Jigger infestation is caused by fleas. Most of the recommended treatments for jiggers are unaffordable; thus, local people experience difficulty with the usage. This study contribute to the understanding of the efficacy of two treatments against jigger infestation in the community: a local practice (soda ash solution) and a standard treatment (silicone oil). The study participants were 23 children aged 3â€“13 years with 126 fleas in Homa Bay County, Kenya. We administered the treatment only on day 1 and followed up on days 3, 5, and 7. At 7 days, the soda ash solution killed 64% of the fleas whereas the silicone oil killed 87% of the fleas. Thus, the safety of both treatments was confirmed. As this is the first step in investigating the efficacy and safety of the soda ash solution, we need to conduct further studies with more participants to compare both treatments.
