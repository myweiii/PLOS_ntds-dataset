Pathogens spread by ticks, fleas, and mosquitos, so called vector-borne pathogens, are common in tropical countries like Sri Lanka. Some vector-borne pathogens affect dogs as well as humans, potentially causing severe illness in both. As dogs can act as reservoir hosts, preventing these infections is vital for animal and human health. Veterinarians are the experts when it comes to diagnosing, treating, and controlling vector-borne pathogens in dogs. Thus, their understanding and approach to these diseases are key in reducing their impact. This study highlights both the strengths and gaps in veterinariansâ€™ knowledge, attitude and practices concerning vector-borne pathogens and identifies areas for improvement. This will assist relevant stakeholders and policymakers to develop targeted continuing veterinary education and best practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases caused by vector-borne pathogens in dogs. This will not only lead to better care for dogs affected by these diseases, but ultimately aid in reducing the risk to human health.
