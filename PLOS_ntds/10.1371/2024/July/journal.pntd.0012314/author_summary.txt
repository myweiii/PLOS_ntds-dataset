Leprosy is an ancient infectious disease that still affects up to 200,000 new patients yearly worldwide, with an estimated three to four million people living with permanent disability. A delay in case detection is a major factor contributing to the development of disability. Case detection delay is defined as the interval between the onset of the disease’s initial signs and symptoms and the time of diagnosis, comprising a ‘patient delay’ and a ‘health-system delay’. The case detection delay tool was first designed in the cultural context of the East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia, as part of the PEP4LEP project. Subsequently, it was standardised to enable cultural adaptation to other regions and countries.
The aims of this study were to determine the reliability and consistency of this case detection delay (CDD) assessment tool. The studied tool was validated in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tanzania. The test-retest and interrater measurements demonstrated that the instrument is reliable and measures consistently. The tool can be used in routine leprosy programmes, active case detection projects, and in studies such as the PEP4LEP project. The tool is available in English, Oromiffa (Afaan Oromo), Portuguese, and Swahili via the international leprosy knowledge centre Infolep:
