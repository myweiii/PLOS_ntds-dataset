Every year, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are killed, disabled, or disfigured by bites from venomous snakes. Snakebite is especially dangerous in rural areas of the global south, where victims often must travel long distances to clinics or hospitals to receive antivenom treatment. What sorts of obstacles do snakebite victims face in their search for antivenom? And why do people choose traditional remedies, such as homeopathic treatments, even though these have limited evidence of effectiveness against snakebite envenoming? To answer these questions, we conducted field research in rural areas of Oaxaca and Chiapas states in southern Mexico in 2023, including interviews with 47 snakebite victims. In line with other studies, we found that the main obstacles to antivenom access are distance, cost, and scarcity of antivenom supply. And by listening more closely to victimsâ€™ accounts of their therapeutic itineraries, we have a better understanding of why people might choose traditional remedies for snakebite. These reasons include long-established cultural frameworks about the causes of illness and the need to alleviate pain to withstand the long journey to conventional treatment. By taking an intercultural approach, which emphasizes mutual respect and understanding between Western and indigenous health belief systems, we can improve access to antivenom, health education initiatives, and other interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of snakebites in Mexico and beyond.
