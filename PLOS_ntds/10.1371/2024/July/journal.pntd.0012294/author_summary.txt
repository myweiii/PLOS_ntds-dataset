Animal African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic wasting disease, which mainly affects livestock of poor households in remote rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. Affordable interventions are primary to eradication campaigns. The latter is mandated to the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). PATTEC conducts activities including mass screening of human population for Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and treating positive cases. This strategy has dramatically reduced cases of HAT over the last two decades. Highly sensitive and specific current tests for AAT are technically demanding, confining their use to well-equipped reference laboratories in urban centres. Inaccessibility of tests for AAT by the locals living in remote areas, hinders case finding and delays treatment intervention, eventually perpetuating disease transmission and severity. Hence, the aim of our ongoing work is to ultimately convert a complex laboratory-based test for AAT caused by T. congolense, developed earlier by our research team, into a simple hand-held device suitable for use in the field. The current test format employs a nanobody-monoclonal antibody sandwich combination to detect T. congolense infections, through detection of trypanosome Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase that is present in the blood of infected animals. The diagnostic capability of the assay was successfully demonstrated on experimental samples.
