    "Abstract": "The scarcity of reliable devices for diagnosis of Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) presents a limitation to control of the disease. Existing high-sensitivity technologies such as PCR are costly, laborious, time-consuming, complex, and require skilled personnel. Hence, utilisation of most diagnostics for AAT is impracticable in rural areas, where the disease occurs. A more accessible point-of-care test (POCT) capable of detecting cryptic active infection, without relying on expensive equipment, would facilitate AAT detection. In turn, early management, would reduce disease incidence and severity. Today, several ongoing research projects aim at modifying complex immunoassays into POCTs. In this context, we report the development of an antigen (Ag) detection sandwich ELISA prototype for diagnosis of T. congolense infections, which is comprised of nanobody (Nb) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) reagents."
