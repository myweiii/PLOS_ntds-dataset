    "Background": "There are several studies on thyroid functions and thyroid gland features in patients with leprosy in the literature. The relationship between them have not been clarified yet. These studies are time-expired and don’t contain ultrasonography examination. The purpose of the study is to investigate thyroid functions and gland characteristics in leprosy patients by ultrasonography (US) and current laboratory techniques.",
    "Patients and Methods": "This retrospective study was conducted by collecting the data of patients with lepramatous leprosy. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, anti-thyroid peroxidase, antithyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin values and thyroid ultrasonography reports were collected from previous records.",
    "Results": "The mean age is 75.12±9.89 years of total 17 subjects and 10 patients (58.8%) were male. Thyroid US was performed on 14 of the patients, nodules were detected in a total of 7 (50%) patients. The mean FT3, FT4, TSH, Anti-Tpo, Anti-TG, and TG values of the patients were found to be within normal limits.",
    "Conclusion": "In the present study, no changes were detected in the thyroid functions and structures of the patients with Lepromatous Leprosy. We consider that prospective randomized studies that will include larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether there is a relationship between leprosy and thyroid disease."
