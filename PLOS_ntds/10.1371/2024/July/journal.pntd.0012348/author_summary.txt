Relapsing fever is a globally distributed, vector-borne bacterial infection that is characterized by recurring febrile episodes. The causative Borrelia spp. were identified over 100 years ago, but little is known regarding factors required for mammalian infection or vector colonization/transmission. Relapsing fever Borrelia can be geographically and phylogenetically divided into distinct clades; New World, found in the Americas, and Old World, found in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Although Old World relapsing fever Borrelia represent major causes of disease in endemic regions of the world, genetic studies aimed at identifying bacterial gene products required during the tick-vertebrate infectious cycle have focused on the less commonly reported New World relapsing fever Borrelia. Herein, we begin to address this knowledge gap by developing techniques and molecular tools for genetic manipulation of the Old World tick-borne relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia duttonii. This genetic system will lay the foundation for future studies aimed at identifying bacterial factors required during the enzootic cycle of B. duttonii.
