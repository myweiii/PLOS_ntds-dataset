    "Abstract": "An improved understanding of the Plasmodium vivax populations in the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS) is needed to monitor the progress of malaria elimination. This study aimed to use a P. vivax single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) barcode to evaluate the population dynamics and explore the gene flow among P. vivax parasite populations in the western GMS (China, Myanmar and Thailand). A total of 315 P. vivax patient samples collected in 2011 and 2018 from four regions of the western GMS were genotyped for 42 SNPs using the high-throughput MassARRAY SNP genotyping technology. Population genetic analysis was conducted to estimate the genetic diversity, effective population size, and population structure among the P. vivax populations. Overall, 291 samples were successfully genotyped at 39 SNPs. A significant difference was observed in the proportion of polyclonal infections among the five P. vivax populations (P = 0.0012, Pearson Chi-square test, χ2 = 18.1), with western Myanmar having the highest proportion (96.2%, 50/52) in 2018. Likewise, the average complexity of infection was also highest in western Myanmar (1.31) and lowest in northeast Myanmar (1.01) in 2018. The older samples from western China in 2011 had the highest pairwise nucleotide diversity (π, 0.388 ± 0.046), expected heterozygosity (He, 0.363 ± 0.02), and the largest effective population size. In comparison, in the neighboring northeast Myanmar, the more recent samples in 2018 showed the lowest values (π, 0.224 ± 0.036; He, 0.220 ± 0.026). Furthermore, the 2018 northeast Myanmar parasites showed high and moderate genetic differentiation from other populations with FST values of 0.162–0.252, whereas genetic differentiation among other populations was relatively low (FST ≤ 0.059). Principal component analysis, phylogeny, and STRUCTURE analysis showed that the P. vivax population in northeast Myanmar in 2018 substantially diverged from other populations. Although the 42 SNP barcode is a valuable tool for tracking parasite origins of worldwide parasite populations, a more extended barcode with additional SNPs is needed to distinguish the more related parasite populations in the western GMS."
