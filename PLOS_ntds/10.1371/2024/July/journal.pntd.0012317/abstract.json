    "Background": "Melioidosis, a life-threatening infection caused by the gram negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, can involve almost any organ. Bone and joint infections (BJI) are a recognised, but incompletely defined, manifestation of melioidosis that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "We identified all individuals with BJI due to B. pseudomallei managed at Cairns Hospital in tropical Australia between January 1998 and June 2023. The patients’ demographics, their clinical findings and their treatment were correlated with their subsequent course.",
    "Conclusions": "The case-fatality rate from melioidosis BJI in Australia’s well-resourced health system is very low. However, recrudescence, relapse and orthopaedic complications are relatively common and emphasise the importance of collaborative multidisciplinary care that includes early surgical review, aggressive source control, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and thorough, extended follow-up."
