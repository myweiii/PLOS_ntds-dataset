    "Background": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection, a common mosquito-borne disease, has been linked to several mental disorders like depression and anxiety. However, the temporal risk of these disorders after DENV infection is not well studied.",
    "Methods": "This population-based cohort study encompassed 45,334 recently lab-confirmed dengue patients in Taiwan spanning 2002 to 2015, matched at a 1:5 ratio with non-dengue individuals based on age, gender, and residence (n = 226,670). Employing subdistribution hazard regression analysis, we assessed the immediate (<3 months), intermediate (3–12 months), and prolonged (>12 months) risks of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and sleep disorders post DENV infection. Corrections for multiple comparisons were carried out using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.",
    "Results": "A significant increase in depressive disorder risk across all timeframes post-infection was observed (<3 months [aSHR 1.90, 95% CI 1.20–2.99], 3–12 months [aSHR 1.68, 95% CI 1.32–2.14], and >12 months [aSHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03–1.25]). Sleep disorder risk was higher only during 3–12 months (aSHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18–2.04). No elevated anxiety disorder risk was found. Subgroup analysis of hospitalized dengue patients showed increased risk of anxiety disorders within 3 months (aSHR 2.14, 95% CI 1.19–3.85) and persistent risk of depressive disorders across all periods. Hospitalized dengue patients also had elevated sleep disorder risk within the first year.",
    "Conclusion": "Dengue patients exhibited significantly elevated risks of depressive disorders in both the short and long term. However, dengue’s impact on sleep disorders and anxiety seems to be short-lived. Further research is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
