This study addresses the crucial issue of onchocerciasis, a neglected tropical disease, with a focus on post-elimination surveillance in Bududa District, Eastern Uganda. While global efforts target onchocerciasis elimination by 2030, this research assesses community involvement in post-elimination surveillance, uncovering a low participation rate of 14% in Bududa.
Factors influencing involvement include district support, black fly sightings, and community volunteer experience. Challenges, such as funding shortages and program sustainability issues, hinder community engagement. Additionally, the study emphasizes the need for increased district support, funding, and community sensitization to improve participation. The findings provide valuable insights for similar settings.
With a total of 422 participants, the study explores both quantitative and qualitative data, offering a comprehensive perspective. Ultimately, the research contributes essential knowledge to enhance community participation and strengthen post-elimination surveillance strategies in the fight against onchocerciasis in Uganda.
