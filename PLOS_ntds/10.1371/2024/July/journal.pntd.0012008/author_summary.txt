Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is one of the most common childhood enteric infections worldwide and an important public health problem in China. In this study, we analyzed the relationships among HFMD cases, meteorological factors, and vaccine factors using time-varying distributed lag nonlinear models. We found that the susceptibility of the population may have changed after the implementation of the HFMD EV71 vaccine policy, altering the relationship between HFMD and meteorological factors. The modifying effects of vaccine interventions may be influenced by variables such as race, sex, and economic level. This provides valuable information for the prevention of the disease and policy decisions.
