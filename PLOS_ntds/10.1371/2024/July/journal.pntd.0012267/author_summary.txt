When two species, composed of different parental genetic material, manage to produce a viable offspring, new allelic interactions might arise. We do not know much about how genes are expressed in such hybrids compared to their parental species, especially for parasite species. Here we investigated gene expressions in first generation hybrids of two blood fluke parasites: Schistosoma haematobium and S. bovis. We quantified and assigned in five typical profiles genes expressed in first generation hybrids (i.e., intermediate between the parental expression levels, over-expressed, under-expressed, or expressed like one of the parental lines) and investigated their associated biological processes. Gene expressions in hybrids revealed a substantial fraction of genes being unassigned (once the sex and the direction of the cross from which a hybrid resulted were controlled) which were differentially expressed genes but not typical of any expression profiles or were not differentially expressed neither between hybrids and parental lines nor between parental lines. Among assigned genes, we recorded a predominance of genes being expressed at an intermediate level in hybrids compared to both parental species, hence highlighting the compatibility between the two species. Interestingly, we found, in particular in female hybrids, genes over- and under-expressed compared to parental lines. Those synergetic expression profiles are usually associated with heterosis in a model called over-dominance. At the functional level, our results provide evidence for compatibility between parental lines and potential heterosis in hybrids with biological processes expressed in hybrids involved in signaling pathways, energy intake, and reproduction.
