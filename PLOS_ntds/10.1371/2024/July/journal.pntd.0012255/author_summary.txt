In our study, we explore how T. cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease, interacts with human skin cells, particularly keratinocytes. Chagas disease is a major issue in Latin America, making it crucial to understand how the parasite infects skin cells for treatment development.
We discovered that T. cruzi can infect keratinocytes, likely among the first cells targeted after an insect bite. Our research emphasizes the role of natural killer (NK) cells in responding to this infection, activating and producing molecules that can directly kill the parasite.
Our findings illuminate the skin’s immune response in controlling T. cruzi infection early on. Stimulation with interferon-gamma enhances keratinocytes’ ability to alert the immune system to the parasite’s presence.
Moreover, NK cells not only kill infected cells but also communicate with other immune cells to combat the infection. Understanding these interactions could improve Chagas disease management.
Overall, our study underscores the importance of investigating pathogen-skin cell interactions for effective treatment strategies, necessitating further research into underlying mechanisms and potential therapies.
