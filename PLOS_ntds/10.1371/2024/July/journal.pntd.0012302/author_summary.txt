Giardia intestinalis (Syn. G. duodenalis or G. lamblia), is a protozoan flagellate that parasitizes humans and animals and is transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with cysts or via person-to-person contact. Causes diarrhoea. Affects children and adults worldwide. Giardiasis is known to have long-term effects. When giardiasis occurs in the first two years of a childâ€™s life, it is associated with stunted growth and psychomotor and cognitive retardation.
Giardiasis and zinc deficiency have been identified as serious health problems worldwide. Although Zn depletion is known to occur in giardiasis, no work has investigated whether changes occur in brain structures.
We modelled Giardia infection in gerbils in the first days of postnatal life and found morphological changes that suggest neuronal migration is affected by zinc depletion caused by giardiasis in early postnatal life.
For the first time, the link between giardiasis-zinc depletion and damaged brain structures is shown. This damage may explain the psychomotor-cognitive delay associated with giardiasis.
Alterations in zinc metabolism and signalling are known to be involved in many brain disorders, including autism.
