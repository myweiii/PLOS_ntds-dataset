Seoul virus is a zoonotic pathogen primarily carried by rats, and it can cause a serious illness called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. Research into the zoonotic risk associated with this virus is limited although human cases are detected worldwide. We investigated the circulation of SEOV and its genetic evolution in rats from a French urban park, where the virus was detected first in 2010â€“2012 and a strain characterized in 2011. We have studied 87 wild brown rats distributed non homogeneously all over the park and found that 17.2% of those animals had orthohantavirus-reactive antibodies. Furthermore, the molecular analyses of the virus showed amino acid exchanges over the past decade in this area. This study highlights the potential zoonotic risk posed by SEOV in a popular urban park, where humans are likely to come into contact with wild rats or their excretions. To mitigate this zoonotic risk, targeted surveillance of this virus in rat populations would be beneficial. Additionally, prevention strategies should be designed and communicated with all personnel working in the park.
