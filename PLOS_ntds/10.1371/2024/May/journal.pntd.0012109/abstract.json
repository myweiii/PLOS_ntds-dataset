    "Background": "More than 20 million people are infected with L. loa, and around 40 million live in high or intermediate-risk areas in West- and Central Africa. Although loiasis is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, little is known about the perception of loiasis by affected communities. This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices in the rural population of Sindara, Gabon, a region characterized by high loiasis prevalence.",
    "Methods": "A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gabon between January and June 2022. During systematic door-to-door visits, randomly selected inhabitants were invited to participate in this questionnaire based survey. Venous blood was collected at midday from all participants for microscopic detection of filarial infection and clinical signs of loiasis were assessed.",
    "Results": "A total of 150 participants were recruited, of which 66% were infected by L. loa. While almost everyone had some knowledge about L. loa, 72% of the participants understood that L. loa is a parasitic worm. The transmission of L. loa via the deer fly was known to only 21% of participants. The most frequently mentioned clinical symptoms attributed to loiasis were itching (84%), eye worm migration (59%), and conjunctivitis-like symptoms (53%). Participants who experienced migratory loiasis had better knowledge of loiasis and considered it as more serious. Traditional and herbal medicine was reported most often as an available treatment option (72%). While the formal healthcare sector was mentioned as the preferred treatment provider, 60% of the reported infections were treated by traditional medical practitioners.",
    "Conclusion": "Loiasis is in general well known by this community residing in a region of high L. loa transmission. Important gaps in knowledge were discovered foremost regarding the mode of transmission. The available healthcare system does not seem to provide adequate management for loiasis."
