Several rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, the most common bacterial infection transmitted from animals to humans, have been developed during the last two decades. The test accuracy, however, seems inconsistent among studies, raising questions about their reliability and applicability. Systematic review and meta-analysis were exploited to answer these questions. A total of 28 studies evaluating the human leptospirosis LFIs were included in this review. Major findings from our analysis include: i) the overall specificity of the LFIs is likely acceptable (93%), but the sensitivity is significantly low (68%); ii) substantial variation among studies was observed, alerting the reliability of this meta-analysis results; iii) the accuracy of the LFIs seems to be unaffected by samples collected from different phases of infection (acute vs. convalescent); and iv) IgM detection LFIs exhibit higher sensitivity as compared to IgG detection type. From our findings, we suggest that IgM detection LFIs should be focused on for future development. Also, in order to understand the performance of the LFIs better, other evaluation studies are still needed.
