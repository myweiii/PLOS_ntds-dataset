Rabies continues to be a problem in Africa, affecting vulnerable populations, despite effective vaccines being available. Nigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, needs to take prompt action to be able to eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030. Surveillance is an essential part of effective rabies control. This study used a mixed-methods approach to investigate how well the rabies surveillance system in Gombe state, Nigeria, is working to detect and manage cases early.
A total of 157 potential human exposures to rabies were found with two deaths suggestive of rabies. The human health and veterinary sectors were found to work together to assess risks and manage potential rabies exposures, but several factors were identified that compromised effectiveness of surveillance. Key barriers were lack of funding, infrastructure, feedback from higher authorities, and knowledge of rabies prevention and management. To improve the system, authorities are encouraged to raise awareness about rabies, employ more workers, and strengthen the capabilities of existing workers in Gombe state. By doing this, they can better detect and manage rabies cases and work towards eliminating the disease.
