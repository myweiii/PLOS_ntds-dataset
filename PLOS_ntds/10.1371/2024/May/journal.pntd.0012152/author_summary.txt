The annual incidence of snakebite in Mexico is about 3,800 cases, leading to 35 fatalities. Therefore, antivenoms, which are the primary treatment, are crucial. Two Mexican antivenoms are in therapeutic use, and a third is in development; all are made from horse-derived antibody fragments. Our study assesses antivenomâ€™s effectiveness in neutralizing the venom of several vipers in Mexico. We tested different antivenom batches, finding differences in neutralization capacity. Surprisingly, the Crotalus atrox venom is not well neutralized, and all antivenoms struggle against those of Metlapilcoatlus nummifer and Porthidium yucatanicum. Altogether, our work reveals crucial areas for antivenom improvement, stressing the need for better antivenoms, mainly due to the medical relevance of these species.
