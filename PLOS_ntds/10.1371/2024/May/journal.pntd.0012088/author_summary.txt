Autologous Blood Products such as Leucocyte and Platelets Rich Fibrin (L-PRF) gel have been widely used in the treatment of skin ulcers, including Leprosy ulcers. L-PRF gel contains a high concentration of platelets and leucocytes rich in growth factors that might promote wound healing. However, our systematic review showed that there is a lack of high-quality trial evidence for the effectiveness of L-PRF. To evaluate the efficacy of L-PRF we conducted an individual randomised controlled trial (n = 130) of L-PRF gel vs conventional normal saline dressings. Photographs were taken during twice weekly dressing changes in both intervention and control groups. The ulcer photographs were assessed by blinded assessors using three different ulcer area measurement methods. Outcomes were rate of healing and time to complete epithelialisation. Point estimates for intervention effects across outcomes and measurement methods, intervention vs control was favorable to L-PRF but the effect sizes were small and mostly not statistically significant.
