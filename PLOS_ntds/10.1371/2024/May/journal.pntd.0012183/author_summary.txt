Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection caused by the larva of the dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, which primarily affects the liver and lungs. Although the heart is rarely affected (â‰¤2% of cases), a considerable number of case reports continue to be published. While the diagnostic and clinical management of cardiac CE has greatly benefited from the increasingly widespread availability of diagnostic imaging techniques as well as from advances in heart surgery, the overall picture of cardiac CE remains patchy and several aspects remain poorly understood. To overcome this, we systematically reviewed the last five decades of published literature on cardiac CE, and analyzed and summarized the existing data.
