Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of moderate to severe diarrhea in children under 2 years of age. However, the pathogenesis of Cryptosporidium infection is not well understood. In this study, we used neonatal mice and a virulent C. parvum IId subtype as an infection model to study the mechanism of diarrhea associated with cryptosporidiosis. The results showed that the C. parvum IId subtype caused intense infection and severe pathological changes. At the peak of infection, mice had reduced intestinal digestion and absorption, and increased intestinal permeability. Transcriptomic data indicated that multiple pathways were involved in regulation of C. parvum IId infection. In particular, the adherens junction and cell junction assembly were downregulated. This was further supported by the reduction of E-cadherin expression during both peak and recovery periods. These data suggest that neonatal mice infect with C. parvum experience extensive damage of the intestinal barrier, resulting in diarrhea at the peak of infection.
