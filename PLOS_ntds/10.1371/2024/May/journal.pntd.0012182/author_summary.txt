In recent years, a rapid reemergence of mountain-type zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (MT-ZVL) has been seen in the extension region of the Loess Plateau that had previously achieved elimination in China. In this study, we investigate the epidemiological characteristics of MT-ZVL and identify the factors associated with the rapid rise in MT-ZVL epidemics using a case-control design. A questionnaire was used to collect basic information, demographic characteristics, awareness of MT-ZVL knowledge, residence, and dog breeding and living habits.
A multifactorial conditional stepwise logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors. The study revealed that there has been a rising trend in the MT-ZVL endemic areas. House building materials, presence of neighboring empty houses, breeding domestic dogs and distribution of stray dogs surrounding the home are risk factors for MT-ZVL. Awareness of MT-ZVL and implementation of preventive measures during outdoor activities in summer and autumn are protective and may reduce the risk of MT-ZVL.
We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature to develop strategy for control the ongoing local transmission of MT-ZVL in hill districts. By analyzing the epidemiological characteristics and influencing factors of MT-ZVL, this research provides a basis for further optimizing the targeted control strategies.
