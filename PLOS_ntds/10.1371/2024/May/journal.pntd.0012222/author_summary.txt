Dengue has been identified as one of Nepalâ€™s youngest emerging infectious diseases. Nepal had its first dengue outbreak in 2006 followed by major cyclic outbreaks in 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022.
This study particularly tried to capture the situation of the knowledge, attitude, and practice of non-health undergraduate students and to possibly help identify the gaps and to support interventions planning to improving the endemic condition of dengue.
This study found that 15.2% of participants had good knowledge, 25.9% and 68.3% of the participants had good attitudes and preventive practices regarding dengue respectively.
To bridge the gap between knowledge and practice on dengue and promote KAP on dengue, television, and social media can be effective tools as these are major sources of information about dengue.
Tailored interventions addressing demographic-specific factors are imperative for enhancing KAP on dengue prevention and control.
