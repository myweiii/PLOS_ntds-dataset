Repeated or chronic parasitism can maintain local or systemic chronic inflammation, CRP and hsCRP are sensitive biomarkers of subclinical low-grade inflammation. This study assessed the serum levels of CRP and hsCRP in adults with or without intestinal parasite (IPI) carriage according to residence area and parasite species. IPI chronic carriage, especially with pathogenic protozoa and/or STH, was associated with higher levels of CRP and hsCRP. These findings suggest that intestinal parasite carriage contributes to low grade systemic inflammation which is a driver of NCD. The role of chronic carriage of other enteropathogens on chronic inflammation status as well the relationship between IPI and dysbiosis should be further analyzed in endemic countries.
