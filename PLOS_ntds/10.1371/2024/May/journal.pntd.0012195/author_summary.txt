Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. This disease can affect various organs such as the lungs, skin and soft tissues, central nervous system, internal organs, and others. The clinical manifestations vary, and the lack of laboratory examination support in some countries leads to underreporting of the disease. This also results in a varied death rate, ranging from 10â€“40% and even higher in some countries. The disease is endemic in the Southeast Asian region and northern Australia and is increasingly recognised in other tropical and sub-tropical locations globally. Indonesia has reported over 100 cases from at least 5 diverse regions. One province in Indonesia, Riau, located on the island of Sumatera bordering Malaysia, has been experiencing a relatively high number of melioidosis cases. This study reports melioidosis cases obtained from two referral hospitals in the province of Riau. The research explores the characteristics of patients, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in these cases. Additionally, the study analyzes factors influencing mortality from melioidosis in Riau. Phylogenetic analysis of six isolates of B. pseudomallei determined that B. pseudomallei in the province of Riau, Indonesia is genetically linked to those from neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia.
