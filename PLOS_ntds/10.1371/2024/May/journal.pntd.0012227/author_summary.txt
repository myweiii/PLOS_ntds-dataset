Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, a technique using light to influence cell behavior, has shown promising results in reducing the damage caused by snakebites from Bothrops species, a common venomous snake in Latin America. This study explores how PBM aids in the recovery of muscle cells after exposure to Bothrops jararacussu venom. Our research focused on C2C12 myoblast cells, a type of muscle cell, treated with PBM following venom exposure. We observed that PBM not only helped these cells move and close wounds faster but also increased the production of proteins essential for muscle formation and recovery. Interestingly, it also shifted the balance towards less inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory signals and increasing anti-inflammatory ones. This work sheds light on the potential of PBM as a novel treatment approach for snakebite victims. By promoting muscle repair and reducing inflammation, PBM therapy could improve recovery outcomes following envenoming. Our findings suggest that, with further development, PBM could become a valuable tool in the medical response to snakebites, offering a ray of hope for faster, more effective recovery processes.
