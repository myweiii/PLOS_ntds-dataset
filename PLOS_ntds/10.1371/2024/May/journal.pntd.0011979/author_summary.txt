In this paper, we progress our research towards establishing a controlled human infection model (CHIM) of Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is crucial that the challenge agent used for such experiments is thoroughly characterised; not only is this important to ensure standardisation between participants, but also to reinforce their safety. Using established criteria, we systematically demonstrate why the isolate M. ulcerans JKD8049 may be a suitable challenge strain. This strain is non-genetically modified, susceptible to antibiotics, can be cultured in relatively simple media, and can be filtered and preserved as individual bacteria to ensure accurate dosing of participants. Even after repeatedly culturing the organism for months, it remains genetically stable, so significant mutations are not expected to develop during manufacture. After preserving the isolate at -80Â°C, it can be revived and diluted for human inoculation at very low doses. Importantly, it produces the toxin mycolactone, so it is expected to recreate typical Buruli ulcer disease in participants, which will be important to properly test vaccines and other therapeutics. We also demonstrate a set of principles to ensure the produced batch is free from contamination.
