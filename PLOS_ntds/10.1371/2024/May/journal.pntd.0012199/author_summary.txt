In chronic Chagas disease, illness caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, anxiety, depression, and memory decline are mostly related to social and psychological stressors. Here, we described the sequential onset of behavioral and cognitive changes in T. cruzi-infected mice, supporting a role for biological stressors. Indeed, in chronically infected mice, the behavioral changes parallel increased levels of the neurotransmitters GABA/glutamate and lipid peroxidation products and decreased expression of the neurotrophin BDNF. Therapy with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and antidepressant fluoxetine ameliorated, prevented, or reversed behavioral and cognitive changes, improved neurochemical alterations, and, surprisingly, reduced parasite load in the brain. In vitro, serotonin fueled parasite uptake by U-87 MG cells, a human astrocyte-like cell lineage. Serotonin effects were increased by prior interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation but abrogated by fluoxetine and related to nitric oxide and glutamate levels in culture supernatants. Thus, the cytokine-driven consumption of serotonin may fuel T. cruzi uptake by astrocytes, sustaining brain parasitism, reducing serotonin availability, dysregulating the neurotransmitter and neurotrophin networks, and favoring a neurotoxic milieu, which may contribute to behavioral and cognitive disorders. Therefore, fluoxetine therapy, which interferes with these biological processes, may improve the quality of life of Chagas disease patients.
