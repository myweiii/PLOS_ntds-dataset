Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging infectious pathogen that was elevated to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016, due to its possible association with congenital microcephaly, a serious birth defect for infants. We launched a prospective cohort study of pregnant women to look for evidence of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. We enrolled participants in two provinces in northeastern Thailand during May 2018-January 2020. We found a low frequency of ZIKV infection (12/3312, 0.36% by rRT-PCR assay) during the study; two infections were detected at enrollment, while ten were detected later. Six of 12 ZIKV-confirmed women were asymptomatic throughout the study. Most (11/12, 92%) Zika cases occurred in one province. All 12 women with ZIKV delivered normal live births; only one infant had low birth weight and no infants had microcephaly. The eight ZIKV isolates available for whole genome sequencing were of the Asian lineage. At enrollment, the median Dengue virus IgG titer was significantly higher in ZIKV-confirmed than non-ZIKV-confirmed women. Identifying the factors associated with neonatal outcomes after ZIKV exposure in utero would be made easier with additional research studies.
