    "Background": "In response to the 2015\u20132016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak and the causal relationship established between maternal ZIKV infection and adverse infant outcomes, we conducted a cohort study to estimate the incidence of ZIKV infection in pregnancy and assess its impacts in women and infants.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "From May 2018-January 2020, we prospectively followed pregnant women recruited from 134 participating hospitals in two non-adjacent provinces in northeastern Thailand. We collected demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic data and blood and urine at routine antenatal care visits until delivery. ZIKV infections were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Specimens with confirmed ZIKV underwent whole genome sequencing.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Confirmed ZIKV infections occurred infrequently in this large pregnancy cohort and observed adverse maternal and birth outcomes did not differ between mothers with and without confirmed infections."
