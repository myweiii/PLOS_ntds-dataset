Plague is a significant health challenge in Africa due to environmental conditions, lifestyle, and behaviors of the people living mostly in persistent areas. Understanding peopleâ€™s knowledge on the environmental conditions and lifestyle practices related to plague transmissions is essential to preventing the disease spread. We assessed community understanding on plague, factors influencing flea bites, and methods used to control rodents and fleas in the plague foci to inform the development of the potential mitigation strategies for the disease. Majority of respondents were familiar with the disease; however, few were aware of its symptoms. They reported that human cases occurred during the rainy season, with frequent flea bites experienced during the dry season. Also, households keeping livestock inside sleeping houses had a higher likelihood of flea bites compared to those without livestock. Furthermore, residents reported using both local and chemical methods to control rodents and fleas with the majority preferring local methods for flea control. Respondents stated the efficacy of the flea control methods used ranged from days to months, although there was limited understanding of the long-term health effects of the chemical residuals used among the surveyed community. The study findings emphasize the importance of understanding community awareness and preventive measures in controlling the spread of plague and call for greater community awareness raising on using appropriate flea control methods. Understanding local practices and preventive methods aids the development of interventions that are safer and more acceptable to the community, ultimately leading to more effective control strategies in these rural settings.
