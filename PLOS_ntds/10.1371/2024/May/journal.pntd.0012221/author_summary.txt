Disruptions to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic may delay progress in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) control by several years. Current studies of how NTD programs responded to the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic are largely from African settings and focus on earlier periods during the pandemic when policy advice was most stringent. In contrast, this study documents how NTD staff and other related personnel in five South-East Asian and Pacific countries adapted to changing situations throughout the pandemic. We found a difference in the strategies NTD programs initially used to manage the immediate challenges of strict new public health measures compared to those used later in the pandemicâ€™s evolution when seeking to recommence usual programs. Initially, some NTD programs devised new ways of offering modified services, primarily though cross-program integration with other health services that were allowed to continue operating. When operations re-commenced, NTD programs faced financial challenges that meant human and resource efficiencies in these units needed to be found. The cumulative impact of pandemic-related restrictions and misinformation eroded community trust in health programs more broadly and required NTD staff to rebuild local relationships. The lessons learned in these settings may help NTD programs in these and other regions prepare for prolonged future emergencies.
