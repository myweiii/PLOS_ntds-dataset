Snakebite envenoming is an important health problem in Bangladesh. A community-based survey conducted in 2009 indicated that around 700,000 snakebites/year may occur in this country. However, until now, there is no study estimating the incidence of snakebite in Bangladesh from the aspect of ecology. Considering the climatic, environmental, and human population variables, a large, 16-year clinico-epidemiological dataset of snakebite patients was analysed to portray snakebite occurrence probability in Chattogram Division, which comprises the south-eastern part of Bangladesh. Five species distribution models were used to map snakebite-prone areas. We found that the study area has large differences in the predicted incidence of snakebite. Our predictions indicate that around 200,000 snakebite cases per year might occur in the study area, where the latest estimate on 2009 estimated less than half that number for this division. Further, predictions for the year 2070 provide us with similar numbers, independent of the global increase in temperature. As snakebite will remain a major health problem for this country in the next 50 years, we propose the development of a sustainable management plan aiming to limit human-snake conflicts and their consequences while safeguarding also snakes and the ecosystem services they provide especially to agriculture.
