    "Background": "Dengue fever (DF) and West Nile fever (WNF) have become endemic worldwide in the last two decades. Studies suggest that individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a higher risk of developing severe complications from these diseases. Identifying the factors associated with a severe clinical presentation is crucial, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications and fatalities. This article aims to summarize and assess the published evidence regarding the link between DM and the risk of severe clinical manifestations in cases of DF and WNF.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. 27 studies (19 on DF, 8 on WNF) involving 342,873 laboratory-confirmed patients were included in the analysis. The analysis showed that a diagnosis of DM was associated with an increased risk for severe clinical presentations of both DF (OR 3.39; 95% CI: 2.46, 4.68) and WNF (OR 2.89; 95% CI: 1.89, 4.41). DM also significantly increased the risk of death from both diseases (DF: OR 1.95; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.52; WNF: OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.17).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study provides strong evidence supporting the association between DM and an increased risk of severe clinical manifestations in cases of DF and WNF. Diabetic individuals in DF or WNF endemic areas should be closely monitored when presenting with febrile symptoms due to their higher susceptibility to severe disease. Early detection and appropriate management strategies are crucial in reducing the morbidity and mortality rates associated with DF and WNF in diabetic patients. Tailored care and targeted public health interventions are needed to address this at-risk population. Further research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective preventive and therapeutic approaches."
