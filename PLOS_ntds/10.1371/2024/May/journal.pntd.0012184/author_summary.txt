This study, conducted from 2012 to 2022, aimed at understanding the dynamics and genetic diversity of dengue virus on Reunion Island, a French overseas department located in the southwestern Indian Ocean, which is regularly affected by dengue epidemics. Several thousand clinical isolates and patient samples were collected from across the island and sequenced, resulting in 877 new genetic sequences of dengue virus. Our results show significant genetic diversity among dengue virus variants that circulated on the island over the past decade. This diversity indicates the simultaneous presence of multiple lineages and closely related viruses, which may have resulted from regular introductions of new variants. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the sequences detected in Reunion Island may have originated from other Indian Ocean islands, such as Seychelles and Mayotte, as well as from Asian regions where dengue virus circulates.
