Disability is the long-term outcome of untreated leprosy or Hansen’s disease, which is caused by peripheral nerve invasion of the Mycobacterium leprae. It is a serious and life-limiting complication for leprosy patients. Currently, seven regions in Indonesia have not yet achieved the state of disease elimination. In addition, Indonesia has not succeeded in achieving the sub-target of the rate of new cases with grade 2 disability in 2023. The concept of disability and health including the body structure, body function, personal and environmental domains, activity limitation, and participation restriction, is provided by the ICF. Through the framework, we could assess the aspects of disability and its relationship to one another in leprosy patients. Furthermore, the early detection, screening, and management programs for leprosy have not included aspects of disability and rehabilitative measures for restoration. Thus, the purpose of this study is to find the impact of leprosy-related disability on the patients’ body function, activity, and participation. We reported 150 leprosy patients from two rural areas of Indonesia and found significant relationships between specific indicators, which would be useful for rehabilitative management programs in the future.
