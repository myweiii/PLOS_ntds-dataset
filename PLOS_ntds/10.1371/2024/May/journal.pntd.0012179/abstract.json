    "Background": "During its life cycle, the human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi must quickly adapt to different environments, in which the variation in the gene expression of the regulatory U-rich RNA-binding protein 1 (TcUBP1) plays a crucial role. We have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of TcUBP1 in insect-dwelling epimastigotes orchestrates an RNA regulon to promote differentiation to infective forms.",
    "Methods": "In an attempt to generate TcUBP1 knockout parasites by using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, in the present study, we obtained a variant transcript that encodes a protein with 95% overall identity and a modified N-terminal sequence. The expression of this mutant protein, named TcUBP1mut, was notably reduced compared to that of the endogenous form found in normal cells. TcUBP1mut-knockdown epimastigotes exhibited normal growth and differentiation into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes and were capable of infecting mammalian cells.",
    "Results": "We analyzed the RNA-Seq expression profiles of these parasites and identified 276 up- and 426 downregulated genes with respect to the wildtype control sample. RNA-Seq comparison across distinct developmental stages revealed that the transcriptomic profile of these TcUBP1mut-knockdown epimastigotes significantly differs not only from that of epimastigotes in the stationary phase but also from the gene expression landscape characteristic of infective forms. This is both contrary to and consistent with the results of our recent study involving TcUBP1-overexpressing cells.",
    "Conclusion": "Together, our findings demonstrate that the genes exhibiting opposite changes under overexpression and knockdown conditions unveil key mRNA targets regulated by TcUBP1. These mostly encompass transcripts that encode for trypomastigote-specific surface glycoproteins and ribosomal proteins, supporting a role for TcUBP1 in determining the molecular characteristics of the infective stage."
