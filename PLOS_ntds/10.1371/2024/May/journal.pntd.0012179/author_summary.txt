In the intriguing world of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease in humans, a key factor known as TcUBP1 helps the pathogen navigate its different life stages. This microorganism undergoes a complex life cycle in which it alternates between a triatomine bug ("kissing bug") and a mammalian host. Our research demonstrated that increasing TcUBP1 levels in insect-dwelling forms prompts a gene expression pattern akin to infective forms, enhancing their ability to infect. Attempts to turn off TcUBP1 through gene editing resulted in TcUBP1mut, a variant with reduced expression closely resembling the native protein. TcUBP1mut cells exhibited distinct gene expression profiles compared to infective forms, according to the results of RNA-Seq analysis. This study corroborates our earlier findings on TcUBP1 overexpression, pinpointing genes with opposing expression patterns in both scenarios. These affected genes govern the production of infective-specific glycoproteins and ribosomal proteins, offering valuable insights into TcUBP1â€™s regulatory role and unraveling mRNA targets crucial for parasite differentiation and infectivity.
