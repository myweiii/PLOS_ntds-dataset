This paper is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Alberto C. Frasch (1949â€“2023), a pioneer in molecular biology research in Argentina, whose unwavering dedication over three decades ago laid the foundation for understanding gene regulation in trypanosomes and the study of TcUBP1. We are indebted to Liliana Sferco and Agustina Chidichimo for parasite cultures. The pROCK-Cas9-GFP plasmid was gently provided by Dr. Santuza Teixeira.
