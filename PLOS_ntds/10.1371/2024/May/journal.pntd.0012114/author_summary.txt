Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most important clinical manifestation of chronic Chagas disease. Bradyarrhythmias caused by sinus node disease, atrio and intraventricular block occur in above 50% and requirement of permanent pacing is common. Prognosis of these patients is poorly studied, and mortality risk factors are unknown. Previous studies have identified predictors of death in CCC patients however CCC patients requiring pacemaker were underrepresented. We identified predictors of mortality in CCC patients with pacemaker defining a simple, validated and specific risk score. Predictors of death were: right ventricular dysfunction, heart failure class III or IV, renal disease, left ventricular end-systolic diameter > 44mm, atrial fibrillation and cardiomegaly on X-ray.
