Malaria, as one of the most important insect-borne infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical regions, poses a serious disease burden worldwide. Malaria has been prevalent in China for more than 4,000 years, seriously endangering the health of the Chinese people and restricting socio-economic development. Nowadays, there are three major species of malaria transmission in China, Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles lesteri, and Anopheles minimus. Due to vector control and climate change in recent years, the distribution range of these Anopheles mosquitoes has changed. Here, we applied an ecological niche model to simulate the potential distribution as well as seasonal variation of three species of Anopheles and to identify the factors affecting their survival. The results revealed that precipitation, temperature, and topographic variables were important influences on the distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes. A wide region from the northeast (Heilongjiang Province) to the southwest (Yunnan Province) is suitable for An. sinensis. Suitable habitat areas for An. lesteri are concentrated in the central, eastern, and southern regions of China. The suitable habitat areas of An. minimus are the smallest, which are only distributed in the border provinces of southern China. This study provides new information for policymakers to develop vector control measures.
