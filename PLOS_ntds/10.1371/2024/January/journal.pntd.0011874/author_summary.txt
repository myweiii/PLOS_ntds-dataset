Trichinella spiralis is an important foodborne parasitic nematode, and the intestinal infective larvae (IIL) invasion of hostâ€™s intestinal mucosa is the key step in T. spiralis infection. But the mechanism of the IIL invasion of gut epithelium has not been completely elucidated. Characterization of interaction between the IIL invasive proteins and their receptors in intestinal epithelium cells will be valuable to understand larval invasion mechanism, and contribute in development of preventive veterinary vaccines against T. spiralis infection. Our results indicated that a novel T. spiralis trypsin (TsTryp) binding to PAR2 in intestinal epithelium activated ERK1/2 pathway, decreased expression of gut tight junctions (TJs) proteins, disrupted gut epithelial integrity and barrier function, and consequently mediated larval invasion of gut mucosa. Therefore, TsTryp may be regarded as a potential vaccine target to block T. spiralis infection.
