Zika virus and other disease-causing flaviviruses constitute a significant threat to global human health. The development of effective antiviral strategies targeting flaviviruses has been hindered by a lack of evidence regarding their life cycle, particularly virion assembly. Here, we identified a critical Asn 67 residue in the Î±3 helix of the C protein mediating ZIKV assembly. We also isolated a compensatory mutation in the M protein, MF37L, that rescues the assembly defect caused by the CN67A mutation, revealing the first evidence of a genetic interaction between C and M protein. Using further molecular genetic analyses, we show that analogous resides in C and M proteins are also required for dengue virus (DENV) assembly, indicating a functional role of this interaction that is conserved among flaviviruses. The data reported here contribute to an increasing collection of evidence pointing toward an interaction between capsid and the external structural proteins of flaviviruses. Our findings describing the genetic interaction between C and M observed in cryo-EM structures but experimentally unproven significantly advance our understanding of Aedes-transmitted flavivirus assembly, which will be instrumental in designing assembly-specific flavivirus therapeutics and antivirals.
