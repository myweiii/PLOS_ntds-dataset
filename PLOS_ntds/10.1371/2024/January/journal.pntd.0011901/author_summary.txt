Adverse events (AE) produced by the drugs used to treat leprosy can hinder the successful completion of the therapeutic regimen. Well-known AE produced by dapsone (DDS) are related to liver problems, allergic reactions, or to the destruction of red and/or white blood cells, causing anemia. Helping the physician to recognize a patient that may develop these adverse reactions can be useful. Thus, we developed a model to predict AE in patients with leprosy receiving standard World Health Organization-recommended multidrug therapy (WHO/MDT). Our question was whether we could use sociodemographic and clinical variables to generate a predictive model for DDS-ADEs. The model developed in this study could be a useful tool to assist physicians in predicting DDS-ADEs when treating patients with standard WHO/MDT for leprosy, and thus, establish a safer therapeutic plan for patients with a greater ADE risk.
