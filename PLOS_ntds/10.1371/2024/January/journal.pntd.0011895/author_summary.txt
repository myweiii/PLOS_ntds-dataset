Reports on short-term treatment (≤30 days) with benznidazole or nifurtimox for Chagas disease in girls and women of childbearing age are scarce. Numerous studies have previously shown that treatment of infected girls and women of childbearing age for 60 days is an effective strategy to prevent transplacental transmission of T. cruzi. However, our study provides convincing evidence that a shorter duration of treatment (≤30 days) is not only effective but also beneficial in preventing transplacental transmission of Chagas disease. Our research demonstrated unequivocally that there was no congenital infection in the offspring of the 27 women who received a 30-day treatment regimen. This was confirmed by direct testing at birth and serological confirmation after 8 months of life.
