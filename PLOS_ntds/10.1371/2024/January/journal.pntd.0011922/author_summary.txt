Dengue places a significant burden on healthcare settings. Especially in low and middle income settings and during large outbreaks, allocation of limited resources to those at high risk of morbidity and mortality can be critically important. Various risk factors of severe infection outcomes and hospitalisation, such as secondary heterologous infection, have been described, yet reliable biomarkers predictive of prolonged stays once hospitalised are still lacking. In this work we analysed dengue hospitalisation data collected over a period of three consecutive years in Northern Vietnam, which revealed an unexpected negative correlation between dengue severity and length of hospitalisation. Further analysis showed that this was primarily driven by a longer period between symptom onset and admission in those patients with a higher severity score. Moreover, we found that this delay negated other observed correlates of prolonged hospital stays, which themselves revealed significant inter-annual variations. Taken together, this work demonstrates that time to admission is one of the strongest predictors of hospitalisation length and that this needs to be taken into consideration for finding reliable biomarkers of predicted healthcare needs in patients admitted to hospital due to dengue.
