Vaccination of livestock with attenuated strains of Brucella is an effective measure for controlling brucellosis, and they will continue to apply. Following "the PRISMA guidelines" we reviewed the risk posed to humans by occupational exposure to these strains and the measures that should be implemented to minimize this risk. Nineteen primary reports were included. The most frequent type of exposure was needle injury during vaccine administration, while safety accidents during vaccine manufacturing were less frequent but caused large outbreaks. Prolonged contact with the pathogen, lack of information and a low adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) use in the work environment were commonly associated with infection. Despite strict protection measures, a percentage of vaccine manufacturing workers developed a positive serology to the vaccine strain without clinical infection. To conclude, Brucella vaccines pose risk of contagion to humans from their production to their administration to livestock, but with a low morbi-mortality.
