We used a comprehensive, georeferenced compendium of Mayaro virus (MAYV) occurrence to model the suitability for MAYV in Central and South America. Our boosted regression tree model incorporated 195 MAYV occurrence locations and 9 gridded environmental covariates to generate a 5 x 5 km continuous surface of MAYV suitability across Central and South America. Using this distribution model, we estimated the total population residing in areas that are suitable for MAYV transmission. Furthermore, we developed evidence consensus scores for each country in our study region that synthesized a variety of sources to assess the overall evidence of known MAYV transmission. Our study provides a contemporary estimate of MAYV distribution using a well-established disease mapping framework. This information provides an evidence base that can guide disease surveillance (including human cases and ecological studies) and vector control efforts in Central and South America. This is especially useful in regions with high predicted MAYV suitability but only moderate evidence of current MAYV transmission (e.g., Guyana and Suriname).
