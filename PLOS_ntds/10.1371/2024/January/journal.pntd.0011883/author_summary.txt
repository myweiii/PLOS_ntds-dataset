Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne disease that is highly dangerous but often overlooked among the public. For the areas where vector survival has not yet been detected, it is important to understand the distribution patterns of suitable habitats for the vectors in order to proactively prevent their intrusion. However, the global distribution of its vectors (D. variabilis and A. cajennense) in their suitable areas has not been fully explored, while the relationship between climatic factors and vectors survival has not been clarified. In this study, we found a wide range of potential habitats for both vectors globally. D. variabilis is more likely to survive in temperate regions, and A. cajennense is more likely to survive in tropical zones. D. variabilis is more sensitive to temperature, whereas A. cajennense is sensitive to both temperature and precipitation, and A. cajennense prefers tropical regions with hot and humid characteristics. The highly suitable areas of both vectors were almost expanded in the ssp5-8.5 scenario, but not so much in the ssp1-2.6 scenario. This study highlighted that areas with high suitability should strengthen vector surveillance and public health education to prevent tick bites, and other highly suitable areas should be alert for entry and exit monitoring to prevent invasion and colonization of vectors.
