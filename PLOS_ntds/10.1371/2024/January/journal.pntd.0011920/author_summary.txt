Sand flies transmit Leishmania infections that cause devastating and potentially fatal infectious human diseases. The existence of genetic exchange between Leishmania populations has been proved in nature. We used laboratory techniques to create experimental hybrids comparable to those that arise in nature, and analysed the genomes of the resulting offspring. We found vast genetic exchange and diversity across all 36 Leishmania chromosomes of the hybrid (diploid) progeny. Genes that are involved in Leishmania parasite virulence may recombine into new forms that evade the human immune system. This genetic exchange was also shown to modify and disrupt candidate diagnostic antigens.
