A novel T. spiralis serine proteinase (TsSPc) was identified in excretory/secretory proteins (ESP) of intestinal infective larvae (IIL). The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of TsSPc action in larval invasion of intestinal epithelium. IIFT showed that natural rTsSPc bound to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), IIFT and mass spectrometry verified that rTsSPc specifically bound to the RACK1 receptor in Caco-2 cells, activated MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by increased expression of RACK1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). Binding of rTsSPc to RACK1 and activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway significantly decreased expression of gut epithelium TJs proteins (occludin, claudin-1 and E-cad), paracellular permeability was obviously increased. Besides, HO (RACK1 inhibitor) and PD98059 (ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor) suppressed and abolished the rTsSPc activating ERK1/2 pathway, and abrogated the rTsSPc down-regulating expression of occludin, claudin-1 and E-cad in Caco-2 monolayer and infected murine intestine, impeded larval invasion and improved intestinal epithelial integrity and barrier function, decreased intestinal worm burdens and meliorated intestinal inflammation. The results indicated that TsSPc binding to gut epithelial RACK1 receptor activated MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, decreased expression of gut TJs proteins, and destroyed gut epithelial integrity, thereby mediated T. spiralis larval invasion of gut mucosa. rTsSPc might be a candidate vaccine target to block T. spiralis larval intrusion.
