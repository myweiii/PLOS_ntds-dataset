This comparative study of Japanese Encephalitis Virus is the largest genomic analysis of the virus to date. We undertake a suite of analyses to investigate phylogenetic relationships, rates of recombination and patterns of genomic selection. We show that recombination is not a significant driver of evolution in JEV, demonstrate support for previous phylogenetic reconstructions of the virus, and find a number of sites across the genome under episodic diversifying selection. These adaptive hotspots of evolution serve as key genomic points for the adaptive evolution of this important vector borne pathogen.
