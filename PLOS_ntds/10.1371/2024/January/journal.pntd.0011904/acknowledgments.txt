We would like to thank the entire team in Tanzania for their careful execution of the disease specific assessment precision mapping intervention which provided contextual data to make building this model possible. This includes the Tanzania NTDCP, CUHAS, as well members of the ASCEND program and all supportive implementing partners. We would like to specifically acknowledge Crown Agents for their supportive program management and Elodie Yard from Oriole Global Health for managing and coordinating field implementation. We would like to further acknowledge the community leaders, school administrators, and many parents who help to make interventions for schistosomiasis like disease specific assessments possible in participating administrative units.
