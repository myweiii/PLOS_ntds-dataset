Fasciolosis is a foodborne disease that is caused by a parasitic worm. The disease affects both public and animal health worldwide. The transmission of Fasciola is complex and involves humans, animals and plants. The adult worms are observed in both humans and ruminants, while larval stages develop in freshwater snails. The infective larval stage attaches to aquatic plants. In recent decades, human fasciolosis has been considered an emerging disease in many regions of the world, including Southeast Asia. Although various studies surveyed Fasciola infection, an overview of existing knowledge on the distribution and prevalence of Fasciola across the different hosts is missing for this region. Yet, this is important to develop appropriate disease control measures. In this study, we systematically searched for literature on Fasciola spp. infection in Southeast Asia. Our study reconfirms that Fasciola is widespread in this region, but that it remains difficult to accurately assess the occurrence of parasite in the absence of well-designed surveys. A firm response to control fasciolosis requires both transdisciplinary and international partnerships. As next steps we propose to assess the occurrence of Fasciola spp. across all actors involved in the transmission, to identify associated risk factors and to estimate the disease burden to support national and international decision makers.
