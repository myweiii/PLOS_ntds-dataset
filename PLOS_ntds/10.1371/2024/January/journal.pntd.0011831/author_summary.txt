Yaws is an endemic disease that currently affects marginalized populations in thirteen countries. While the first yaws eradication effort in the 1950s resulted in a dramatic reduction of yaws cases, a resurgence of yaws has been observed in recent years. New treatment options including a single oral dose of azithromycin as well as new treatment regimens open a new opportunity to restart yaws eradication. The bacterium causing yaws, Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue (TPE), has been characterized in this study with a newly developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for TPE isolates collected during the Yaws 3 Trial held in the Namatanai District of Papua New Guinea. Altogether, 3 distinct TPE genotypes (JE11, SE22, and TE13) have been found as well as two new alleles of analysed loci that were shown to arise by intragenomic recombination/deletion events. Our typing method and meta-analysis may aid the ongoing yaws eradication campaign by distinguishing of infecting TPE strains to help control yaws transmission, monitoring antibiotic resistance emergence and patient reinfection in high-risk areas through targeted interventions.
