Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus native to Africa that can cause a wide range of symptoms in humans, including neurological complications and fetal abnormalities. ZIKV arrived to South America in 2015, and quickly spread through the continent. In Ecuador, this virus caused several thousand infections during 2016 and 2017, but its incidence dropped suddenly thereafter, with just 11 cases reported between 2018 and 2022. The reasons behind this abrupt decrease are not well understood.
In this work, we performed an arboviral survey in mosquitoes from four endemic Ecuadorian cities during the period 2016â€“2018. We screened 2,592 pools (comprising 6,197 specimens) for the presence of ZIKV, and estimated infection rates in female and male mosquitoes. We found high infection rates in all cities and periods sampled. Considering the low incidence of human cases during 2018, our results suggest that in our study areas the virus could be maintained by mechanisms that either do not depend on human infection, or cause low rates of symptomatic infections. High rates of ZIKV infection in male mosquitoes found during our study suggest that vertical and/or venereal transmission routes could play important roles in the inter-epidemic maintenance of this pathogen in our study area.
