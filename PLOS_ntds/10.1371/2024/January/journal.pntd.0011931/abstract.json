    "Background": "Gastrointestinal parasite (GIP) infections are a major cause of global morbidity, infecting hundreds of millions of people each year and potentially leading to lifelong infection and serious complications. Few data exist on screening for GIP infections in migrants entering the UK or on the current performance of different traditional diagnostic approaches.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We present a retrospective analysis of data from screening male adults (18â€“21 years) who arrived in the UK from Nepal between 2012 and 2020. Three separate faecal samples were obtained from participants at weekly intervals and processed for formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration/light microscopy and charcoal culture. Serum samples were analysed for IgG antibodies to Strongyloides stercoralis by ELISA.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The level of potentially pathogenic GIP infection in young Nepalese men migrating to the UK is high (20.5%) and requires a combined diagnostic approach including serology and analysis of multiple stool samples incorporating specialised parasitological methods. Advances in molecular approaches may optimise and simplify the intensive screening strategy required."
