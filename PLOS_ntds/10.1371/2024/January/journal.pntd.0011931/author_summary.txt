Gastrointestinal parasite (GIP) infections caused by protozoa and helminths affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity, but remain neglected in terms of diagnosis and management. Migrant and refugee populations are rarely offered screening for GIP infection in the UK, but providing this can create opportunities for treatment, as well as to gather valuable epidemiological data. We present a retrospective analysis of screening for gastrointestinal parasites in 2,263 young Nepalese men arriving in the UK as military Gurkha recruits, using a range of conventional diagnostic methods. The presented study is one of the largest reported and most complete approach to GIP screening in a homogeneous migrant population, finding high rates of GIP infection. When conventional diagnostic methods of light microscopy and charcoal culture are used, we found serial stool collection in combination with serological assessment for Strongyloides sp. is required to achieve satisfactory results, as opposed to a single stool examination.
