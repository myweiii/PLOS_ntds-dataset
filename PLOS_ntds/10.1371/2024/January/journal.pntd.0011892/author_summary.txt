Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania. The infection involves various cells, and effective diagnosis and treatment require a clear understanding of its multiple aspects. We conducted a study using meta-analysis and feature selection algorithms combined with co-expression analysis to shed light on the key responsive genes and mechanisms involved in Leishmania infection. Our findings revealed transcriptional signatures associated with essential cellular metabolic functions and immune system response. We also confirmed the critical role of transcription factor families, including bZIP and C2H2 ZF, in response to Leishmania infection. The applied feature selection techniques identified two genes that show potential as Leishmania infection biomarkers and treatment targets. Moreover, our co-expression analysis identified seven crucial hub genes in signaling pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune system cellsâ€™ response to Leishmania infection and present novel potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
