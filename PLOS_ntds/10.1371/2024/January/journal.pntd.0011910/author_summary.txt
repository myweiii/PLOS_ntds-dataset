The limits of the current criterion for cure, i.e., negative seroconversion determined by conventional serology, and the lack of validated and sensitive markers for early assessment of response to trypanocidal drugs in Chagas disease stress the necessity of novel therapeutic response markers. Towards this goal, we herein developed by synthetic chemistry a neoglycoprotein bearing an α-Gal antigenic surrogate, termed NGP-Tri, and evaluated its performance in a large cohort of T. cruzi-infected and treated children. An α-Gal-ELISA built upon NGP-Tri showed a very good performance on the assessment of therapy efficacy, as it displayed significantly shorter median time value of negativization and higher rate of patient negative seroconversion as compared to conventional serology methods. These findings indicate that the tools developed here, as well as optimized versions derived from them, should have a positive impact on the clinical management of Chagas disease and the identification and/or clinical validation of novel drug candidates for the treatment of T. cruzi infections.
