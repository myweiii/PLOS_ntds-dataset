Malaria and schistosomiasis are two diseases that are preventable, treatable, and affect the most vulnerable populations in the world—in particular, young children in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. These two diseases overlap geographically, co-infect vulnerable populations, share common risk factors, and have the potential for integrated control strategies. The objective of this scoping review was to identify previous efforts to integrate malaria and schistosomiasis prevention and control programs in the literature and to summarize the strategies and approaches used in these programs. Eight articles were included in the scoping review–three articles investigated the integration of mass drug administration for schistosomiasis with the administration of antimalarials, four articles investigated the effect of administering antimalarials on malaria, schistosomiasis, and their co-infection, and one article assessed the impact of an educational intervention on malaria and schistosomiasis knowledge and preventative behaviors. Our findings suggest that there is an opportunity to link disease control programs to increase access and coverage of interventions to improve outcomes for malaria, schistosomiasis, and their co-infection.
