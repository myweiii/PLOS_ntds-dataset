    "Abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a novel tick-borne viral pathogen that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). The disease was initially reported in central and eastern China, then later in Japan and South Korea, with a mortality rate of 13â€“30%. Currently, no vaccines or effective therapeutics are available for SFTS treatment. In this study, three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the SFTSV envelope glycoprotein Gn were obtained using the hybridoma technique. Two mAbs recognized linear epitopes and did not neutralize SFTSV, while the mAb 40C10 can effectively neutralized SFTSV of different genotypes and also the SFTSV-related Guertu virus (GTV) and Heartland virus (HRTV) by targeting a spatial epitope of Gn. Additionally, the mAb 40C10 showed therapeutic effect in mice infected with different genotypes of SFTSV strains against death by preventing the development of lesions and by promoting virus clearance in tissues. The therapeutic effect could still be observed in mice infected with SFTSV which were administered with mAb 40C10 after infection even up to 4 days. These findings enhance our understanding of SFTSV immunogenicity and provide valuable information for designing detection methods and strategies targeting SFTSV antigens. The neutralizing mAb 40C10 possesses the potential to be further developed as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against SFTSV and SFTSV-related viruses."
