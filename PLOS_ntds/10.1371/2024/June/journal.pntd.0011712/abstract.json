    "Background": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Oâ€™nyong nyong virus (ONNV) are phylogenetically related alphaviruses in the Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) antigenic complex of the Togaviridae family. There are limited data on the circulation of these two viruses in Burkina Faso. The aim of our study was to assess their circulation in the country by determining seroprevalence to each of the viruses in blood donor samples and by retrospective molecular and serological testing of samples collected as part of national measles and rubella surveillance.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "All blood donor samples were analyzed on the Luminex platform using CHIKV and ONNV E2 antigens. Patient samples collected during national measles-rubella surveillance were screened by an initial ELISA for CHIKV IgM (CHIKjj Detect IgM ELISA) at the national laboratory. The positive samples were then analyzed by a second ELISA test for CHIKV IgM (CDC MAC-ELISA) at the reference laboratory. Finally, samples that had IgM positive results for both ELISA tests and had sufficient residual volume were tested by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) for CHIKV and ONNV. These same patient samples were also analyzed by rRT-PCR for CHIKV. Among the blood donor specimens, 55.49% of the samples were positive for alphaviruses including both CHIKV and ONNV positive samples. Among patient samples collected as part of national measles and rubella surveillance, 3.09% were IgM positive for CHIKV, including 2.5% confirmed by PRNT. PRNT failed to demonstrate any ONNV infections in these samples. No samples tested by RT-qPCR. had detectable CHIKV RNA.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our results suggest that CHIKV and ONNV have been circulating in the population of Burkina Faso and may have been confused with malaria, dengue fever or other febrile diseases such as measles or rubella. Our study underscores the necessity to enhance arbovirus surveillance systems in Burkina Faso."
