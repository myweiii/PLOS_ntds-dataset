Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Oâ€™nyong nyong virus (ONNV) are transmitted to humans by the bite of mosquitoes; CHIKV by genus Aedes genus and ONNV by Anopheles genus mosquitoes. Diseases caused by these two viruses can be confused with other common infectious pathologies including malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella, Prior to 2023, there were limited data on the circulation of CHIKV and ONNV in Burkina Faso. The aim of our study was to assess their circulation in the country by determining their seroprevalence in blood donor samples and by carrying out retrospective molecular and serological tests on samples collected as part of national measles and rubella surveillance. Among the blood donor specimens, 56.48% of samples were IgG-positive for CHIKV and 54.49% were IgG-positive for ONNV. Among patient samples collected as part of national measles and rubella surveillance, 3.09% were IgM positive for CHIKV, including 2.5% confirmed by plaque reduction neutralizing test (PRNT). Our results suggest that CHIKV and ONNV circulated in the population of Burkina Faso and could have been misdiagnosed clinically as malaria, dengue fever or other febrile diseases such as measles or rubella. These results underscore the necessity to enhance arbovirus surveillance systems in the country through appropriate laboratory testing.
