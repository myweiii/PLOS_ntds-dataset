Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common human intestinal helminth globally, affecting a quarter of the worldâ€™s population. Microscopic methods are used to diagnose and monitor Ascaris infections. However, these methods are unsatisfactory for diagnosing low-intensity infections, are prone to human error, their accuracy is greatly affected by the heterogeneous distribution of worm eggs and are limited to detecting only patent infections. qPCR offers an attractive alternative with regard to sensitivity and high-throughput capacity but is also limited by worm patency. Here, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of different antibodies using Ascaris antigen lysates as well as Ascaris excretory/secretory (ES) products using copromicroscopy and qPCR as reference. Our data show that IgG1 antibody responses directed against ES antigens of adult Ascaris worms, but not against the infective third-stage larval or adult worm extracts, reliably decipher between Ascaris-infected and Ascaris-negative participants independent of the microscopic egg counts. Our study is the first to report strong IgG1 responses directed against ES products of adult worms and their potential value as markers for an active Ascaris infection. Our results indicate the potential to develop an antibody-based Ascaris-immunoassay utilizing Ascaris-ES antigens to complement the monitoring of reinfections and transmission dynamics.
