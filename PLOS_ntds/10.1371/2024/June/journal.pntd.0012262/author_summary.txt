At a global scale, chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis or cirrhosis are increasing. Causes and risk factors vary from one setting to another. In Europe, alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, and fatty liver disease are the leading causes. Neglected tropical diseases, especially infections with parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni, are known to cause liver damage in low- and middle-income countries. Precise data on the relevance of infections with S. mansoni compared to other causes of liver fibrosis are scarce. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the infectious diseases etiology of chronic liver diseases in a schistosomiasis-endemic setting of Côte d’Ivoire. We screened residents from four villages in the southern part of Côte d’Ivoire with transient elastography, a non-invasive method that detects liver fibrosis or -cirrhosis by liver stiffness. Participants were tested for schistosomiasis and viral hepatitis, and a questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data. We found that liver fibrosis was common (17%), with S. mansoni being the most detected pathogen (30%). Liver diseases have a high morbidity and mortality, resulting in liver cancer or gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Schistosomiasis and hepatitis C, in particular, can be treated effectively today, so a screening program with transient elastography and subsequent treatment could prevent complications of liver disease.
