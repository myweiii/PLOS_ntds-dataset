The dynamic landscape of host tissue RNA modifications and its possible association with the immune response to Toxoplasma gondii infection are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the patterns of 20 RNA modification types in the liver, spleen and serum of mice infected by T. gondii. We characterized the levels of modifications of total RNA, ∼ 80 nt tRNA and 17–50 nt sncRNAs using LC-MS/MS. Differentially abundant RNA modifications were more frequent during acute infection compared to chronic infection and were more pronounced in the liver than in the spleen. Multiple tRNA modifications were co-regulated during chronic infection. Several RNA modifications showed significant correlation with serum cytokines, highlighting the role of RNA modifications in the immune response to T. gondii infection. Alterations of RNA modifications affected tRNA stability and the translation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A/E. These findings provide new insight into the role of RNA modifications in the pathogenesis of and immune response to T. gondii infection.
