Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a skin rash which can appear after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. Although not life-threatening for the patient, this condition can be associated with social stigma, and the sandfly that transmits the disease can become infected after feeding on patients with PKDL lesions. Therefore, all patients are treated to control visceral leishmaniasis within the Southeast Asia kala-azar elimination initiative. It is difficult to justify the use of existing treatments in patients who are otherwise generally well, since they are prolonged, potentially toxic, and expensive. We designed a trial at two sites in India and one in Bangladesh to assess the efficacy and safety of two treatment options for patients with PKDL: 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B in monotherapy and 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B in combination with three weeks of miltefosine.
These two regimens were found to have a similar efficacy to the current first line treatment, but with a much shorter treatment duration, which also reduces the risk of side-effects and makes them particularly useful in the current context of elimination in the region.
