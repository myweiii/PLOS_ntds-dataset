While most individuals recover after contracting visceral leishmaniasis, there are cases where patients experience a relapsing form of the disease. This response pattern to Leishmania infection is linked to alterations in spleen structure. Until now, these spleen changes had only been examined in dogs and laboratory animals. In our study, we provide data on the disorganization of spleen structure in three patients diagnosed with VL, two of whom were also co-infected with HIV. The observed patterns of spleen disorganization closely resembled those seen in dogs. Our study emphasizes the involvement of IL6, BCL10, and ICOSLG in this process.
