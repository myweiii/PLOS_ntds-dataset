Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) is the most common cause of infectious uveitis worldwide, including Thailand. Vision loss is common despite receiving antiparasitic treatment because of the development of ocular complications. Little is known about the Thai populationâ€™s demographics, clinical presentations, and visual outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the clinical presentation and visual acuity outcomes of this group of patients, including both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, at the largest tertiary center in southern Thailand. Patients with active OT in our cohort mainly presented with unilateral, focal retinitis without associated scar, and central lesions. Our findings support those of previous studies, in which immunocompromised patients exhibited significantly larger lesion sizes with poorer visual acuity recovery than immunocompetent patients. A significant proportion (21%) of all affected eyes showed severe vision loss following antiparasitic treatment, in which oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole monotherapy was mainly used. Education on Toxoplasma gondii infection and transmission should be provided to communities to decrease the risk of infection and ocular toxoplasmosis disease burden.
