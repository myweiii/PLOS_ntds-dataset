Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a life-threatening viral disease, which has expanded beyond Asian countries. However, most studies have focused on the short-term mortality of patients with SFTS, and knowledge of their long-term outcomes is limited. This nationwide cohort study evaluated long-term outcomes of hospitalized patients with SFTS between 2016 and 2021 using the national dataset. We found that hospitalized patients with SFTS had higher one-year mortality (HR, 2.26) than those without SFTS. An increased mortality risk was attributed to death in the first 30 days of hospitalisation (HR, 3.99). Although the long-term mortality (31â€“365 days) did not differ between patients with and without SFTS, except for those in their 80s, patients with SFTS suffered from post-acute events, including readmission (HR, 1.17) or emergency room visit (HR, 2.32) during the one-year follow-up. SFTS is an emerging infectious disease that demands attention. The disease burden extends beyond the acute phase, with patients often experiencing ongoing health problems even after hospital discharge. Our findings underscore the post-acute burden of SFTS and offer valuable insights for the development of effective management plans for acute and post-acute illnesses in patients with SFTS.
