The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive species rapidly expanding worldwide. It is the main vector for several arboviruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus. These viral diseases pose a substantial threat to global public health. Ae. albopictus has developed resistance to insecticides such as malathion, making its control more challenging. To uncover the genetic basis of this resistance, we conducted a study using RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling.
In this study, we obtained gene expression patterns in malathion-resistant and susceptible mosquitoes. The transcriptomic information allowed us to identify potential key genes in detoxification gene families associated with metabolic resistance to malathion. Our discovery provides insights into the molecular mechanisms behind malathion resistance in Ae. albopictus.
Our research not only contributes to the understanding of mosquito biology and control but also highlights the future direction for continued efforts in developing innovative strategies to mitigate rapid development of insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus.
