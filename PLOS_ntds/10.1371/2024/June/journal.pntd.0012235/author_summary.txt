Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by parasitic worms, leading to stunting, reduced learning ability in children, and impaired work capacity in adults. Currently, there is no ideal staging system to assess schistosomiasis-related liver conditions. Advances in machine learning can help us understand and evaluate liver ultrasound images in entirely new dimensions. Regions with high infection rates are predominantly underdeveloped and characterized by a scarcity of medical resources, where B-mode ultrasound equipment serves as one of the primary diagnostic tools. This study aims to develop an intelligent recognition model based on ultrasound radiomics and machine learning to provide a basis for the ultrasound diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
