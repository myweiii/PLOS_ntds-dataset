People living with HIV in Suriname often present to care in a late stage of their infection. A common infection in these patients is Disseminated Histoplasmosis (DH). This is caused by a fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum. DH is currently difficult to diagnose. This study evaluated the use of a urine test for the diagnosis of DH, called LFA, in patients with advanced-stage HIV-infection.
In the study, 98 advanced-stage HIV infected patients were included. Of these, 58 had signs and symptoms that could be attributable to DH. The other 40 patients were not suspected of DH. In all these patients the usual workup was done. The urine histoplasmosis LFA was carried out afterwards, so the result did not influence clinical decisions. We compared the clinical diagnoses of all patients to the results of the LFA.
The results show that only 55% of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of DH and who started antifungal treatment had a positive LFA. Of the untreated patients 21% had a positive LFA. We conclude that treatment decisions solely based on clinical signs and symptoms lead to both over- and undertreatment and that adding this test to the clinical workup of patients suspected of DH, is cost-effective.
