Enteric fever, caused by bacteria Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi, is a serious global illness particularly affecting children in areas with inadequate hygiene and sanitation facilities. It is transmitted through the oral-fecal route. In Pakistan, prevalence of extensively drug resistant S. Typhi resistant strain further complicates its treatment. Some infected individuals develop chronic infections and become carriers of these pathogens. These asymptomatic carriers may potentially spread the disease by shedding the bacteria in urine or stool. To assess the frequency of the carrier state, we examined gallbladder specimens (bile, stones, and tissue) from patients who underwent gallbladder removal surgeries at Aga Khan University and Jinnah Post-graduate Medical Centre. We demonstrated that PCR had a higher sensitivity in detecting Salmonella carriage with a detection limit of 102 CFU/ml and identified 3.4% of typhoid carriers. Additionally, we investigated whether specific antibodies could identify these carriers using various serological tests. The results underscore the need for further research to promptly detect and appropriately treat this disease, thereby enhancing control and preventing future outbreaks.
