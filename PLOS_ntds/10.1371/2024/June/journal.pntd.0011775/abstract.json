    "Background": "Enteric fever is caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A, B, and C. It continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In highly endemic areas, children are disproportionately affected, and antimicrobial resistance reduces therapeutic options. It is estimated that 2â€“5% of enteric fever patients develop chronic asymptomatic infection. These carriers may act as reservoirs of infection; therefore, the prospective identification and treatment of carriers are critical for long-term disease control. We aimed to find the frequency of Salmonella Typhi carriers in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. We also compared the detection limit of culturing versus qPCR in detecting S. Typhi, performed a geospatial analysis of the carriers identified using this study, and evaluated the accuracy of anti-Vi and anti-YncE in identifying chronic typhoid carriage.",
    "Methods": "We performed a cross-sectional study in two centers in Pakistan. Gallbladder specimens were subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and serum samples were analyzed for IgG against YncE and Vi by ELISA. We also mapped the residential location of those with a positive qPCR result.",
    "Findings": "Out of 988 participants, 3.4% had qPCR-positive gallbladder samples (23 S. Typhi and 11 S. Paratyphi). Gallstones were more likely to be qPCR positive than bile and gallbladder tissue. Anti-Vi and YncE were significantly correlated (r = 0.78 p<0.0001) and elevated among carriers as compared to qPCR negative controls, except for anti-Vi response in Paratyphi A. But the discriminatory values of these antigens in identifying carriers from qPCR negative controls were low.",
    "Conclusion": "The high prevalence of typhoid carriers observed in this study suggests that further studies are required to gain information that will help in controlling future typhoid outbreaks in a superior manner than they are currently being managed."
