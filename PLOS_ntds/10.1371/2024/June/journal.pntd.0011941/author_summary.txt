Trachoma is a disease that causes blindness through conjunctival infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is targeted for global elimination by 2030. To know whether population-level interventions are required, we must know how intensely conjunctival C. trachomatis is being transmitted in a population. The current proxy recommended by the World Health Organization is prevalence of a clinical sign of active (inflammatory) trachoma: trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular. However, this indicator has several drawbacks. Policy-makers are considering the utility of a number of complementary indicators, including conjunctival photography and tests for infection and serology.
We sought the opinions of different stakeholders to determine the acceptability and feasibility of complementary indicators for use in trachoma programs. In Tanzania, we undertook focus group discussions with community members and in-depth interviews with public health practitioners. We also conducted an online survey of global stakeholders. We found that all the proposed test types were acceptable to stakeholders in Tanzania; common themes included not wanting undue discomfort and a preference for test types perceived to be accurate. Community education and building trust were deemed critical. From the online survey, the most agreed-upon barriers to implementation of each method were related to concerns about feasibility, rather than acceptability.
