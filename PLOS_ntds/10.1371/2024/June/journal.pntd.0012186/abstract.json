    "Abstract": "The combined region of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina has a persistently high risk of pediatric La Crosse virus neuroinvasive disease (LACV-ND). To guide public health intervention in this region, the objectives of this retrospective ecological study were to investigate the geographic clustering and predictors of pediatric LACV-ND risk at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level. Data on pediatric cases of LACV-ND reported between 2003 and 2020 were obtained from Tennessee Department of Health and North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Purely spatial and space-time scan statistics were used to identify ZCTA-level clusters of confirmed and probable pediatric LACV-ND cases from 2003–2020, and a combination of global and local (i.e., geographically weighted) negative binomial regression models were used to investigate potential predictors of disease risk from 2015–2020. The cluster investigation revealed spatially persistent high-risk and low-risk clusters of LACV-ND, with most cases consistently reported from a few high-risk clusters throughout the entire study period. Temperature and precipitation had positive but antagonistic associations with disease risk from 2015–2020, but the strength of those relationships varied substantially across the study area. Because LACV-ND risk clustering in this region is focally persistent, retroactive case surveillance can be used to guide the implementation of targeted public health intervention to reduce the disease burden in high-risk areas. Additional research on the role of climate in LACV transmission is warranted to support the development of predictive transmission models to guide proactive public health interventions."
