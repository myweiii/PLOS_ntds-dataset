    "Abstract": "A group of children with clinical suspicion of dengue were assessed to determine if there was an overestimation of dengue compared with that of leptospirosis and leishmaniasis. This descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, based on the active search of participants with acute febrile illness, was conducted at two pediatric hospitals. The collection of clinical and epidemiological data was performed using questionnaires, and laboratory tests specific for dengue were performed using immunochromatographic, serological, and molecular methods. Dengue-negative samples were assessed for Leptospira and Leishmania spp. using molecular tests. Data were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chi-square test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test. In total, 86 participants were evaluated, of whom 39 (45%) were positive for dengue fever, 4 (5%) for leptospirosis, and 1 (1%) for leishmaniasis. Forty-two participants (49%) presented dengue-like symptoms. The predominant age range for the virus was 3\u201310 years. Most clinical manifestations were nonspecific, with frequent concomitant gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, we found that the acute febrile syndrome in childhood persists as a challenge for health professionals, especially in the early days of the disease, due to a plurality of diagnostic hypotheses, associated with the difficulty of establishing well-defined symptoms in children, especially in infants. Dengue fever continues to be a frequent pathology with acute febrile infections in childhood; however, there is an overestimation of the disease, especially in endemic regions, when one considers only the clinical epidemiological diagnosis."
