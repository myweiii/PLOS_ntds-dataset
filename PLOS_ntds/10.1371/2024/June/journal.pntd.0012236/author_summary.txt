The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends triple-drug mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem for countries where targets have not been achieved using two-drug MDA, and where onchocerciasis is non-endemic. In 2018, Samoa was the first country to implement a national triple-drug MDA. This study surveyed 623 randomly selected participants across eight primary sampling units (PSUs) in Samoa, 4.5 years after the first round of triple-drug MDA. These results support the current WHO recommendations that multiple rounds of triple-drug MDA are required to interrupt transmission. A gap of 4.5 years between rounds of triple-drug MDA can result in a resurgence, with persistence of LF transmission and burden levels comparable to those observed before the MDA.
