    "Abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) causes approximately 390 million dengue infections worldwide every year. There were 22,777 reported DENV infections in Tainan, Taiwan in 2015. In this study, we sequenced the C-prM-E genes from 45 DENV 2015 strains, and phylogenetic analysis based on C-prM-E genes revealed that all strains were classified as DENV serotype 2 Cosmopolitan genotype. Sequence analysis comparing different DENV-2 genotypes and Cosmopolitan DENV-2 sequences prior to 2015 showed a clade replacement event in the DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype. Additionally, a major substitution C-A314G (K73R) was found in the capsid region which may have contributed to the clade replacement event. Reverse genetics virus rgC-A314G (K73R) showed slower replication in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells compared to wildtype virus, as well as a decrease in NS1 production in BHK-21-infected cells. After a series of passaging, the C-A314G (K73R) mutation reverted to wildtype and was thus considered to be unstable. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of three sera collected from a single DENV2-infected patient at 1-, 2-, and 5-days post-admission was employed to examine the genetic diversity over-time and mutations that may work in conjunction with C-A314G (K73R). Results showed that the number of haplotypes decreased with time in the DENV-infected patient. On the fifth day after admission, two new haplotypes emerged, and a single non-synonymous NS4A-L115I mutation was identified. Therefore, we have identified a persistent mutation C-A314G (K73R) in all of the DENV-2 isolates, and during the course of an infection, a single new non-synonymous mutation in the NS4A region appears in the virus population within a single host. The C-A314G (K73R) thus may have played a role in the DENV-2 2015 outbreak while the NS4A-L115I may be advantageous during DENV infection within the host."
