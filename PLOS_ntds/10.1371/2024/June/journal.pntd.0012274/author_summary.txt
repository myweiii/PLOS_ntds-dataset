Brain inflammation caused by a free-living amoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris is really rare but life-threatening infectious disease. Given its rarity and difficulty to obtain a clinical isolate for further study, this disease has been neglected despite high mortality rate. Many gaps in our understanding of the disease remain opened. Emergence of the organoid platform allows modelling human diseases in an in vitro setting, leading to identification of potential molecular pathway as drug targets. Thus, this work attempts to deploy a human brain organoid to reveal such pathways, which are altered by the amoeba. A strain of B. mandrillaris was isolated from human biopsied brain. In the co-culture between brain organoid and amoeba, data suggested an alteration in neuron growth and increase of proinflammatory response. Brain organoid release brain trauma biomarkers. Importantly, we show therapeutic effect of the antibiotic nitroxoline using the human cerebral organoids. Thereby, the use of the human cerebral organoids unravels the host response, identifies potential biomarkers, and provides an alternative way for testing a potential drug targeting the amoeba.
