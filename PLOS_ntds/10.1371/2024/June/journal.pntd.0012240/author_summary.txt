Even with its well-regarded vector control program, Singapore has continued to experience dengue outbreaks in recent years. Evaluation of these dengue interventions requires updated information on disease distribution and its costs. Accordingly, we gathered 20 years’ worth of data in Singapore from several research databases. Dengue surveillance by Singapore’s Ministry of Health, the source of most data, showed that multiple epidemics occurred in 2000–2021, with a peak in 2020, although the prevailing type of dengue virus has shifted over time. Dengue mostly affects the youth (15–24 years of age) and middle-aged adults, but older adults are more frequently hospitalized. Nonetheless, severe disease and death are uncommon among those affected. In our search, we found only limited data on the influence of age, disease severity, or order of infection (first, second, or higher) on dengue deaths. The costs of dengue have increased in the last decade, as costs indirectly related to medical care remain significant cost contributors. Similarly, stratification of costs by age, epidemic versus non-epidemic years and societal or governmental perspective are presently lacking in local literature. More detailed data on the epidemiology and economic burden of dengue could facilitate the design of more tailored interventions to control dengue in Singapore.
