The strategies to control Ae. aegypti require intensive work and considerable financial resources, are time-consuming, and are commonly affected by operational problems requiring urgent improvement. The PCI is a good tool for identifying higher-risk areas; however, its measure requires a high amount of human and material resources, and the aforementioned issues remain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach capable of predicting the PCI of buildings based on street-level images. This first work combines deep learning-based methods with street-level data to predict facade conditions. Considering the good results obtained with PCINet and the good correlations of facade conditions with PCI components, we could use this methodology to classify building conditions without visiting them physically. With this, we intend to overcome the high cost of identifying high-risk areas. Although we have a long road ahead, our results show that PCINet could help to optimize Ae. aegypti and arbovirus surveillance and control, reducing the number of in-person visits necessary to identify buildings or areas at risk.
