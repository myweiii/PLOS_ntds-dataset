We would like to thank the Ministry of Health Botswana disease control division and the University of Botswana, department of Family Medicine & Public health leadership for affording the team the opportunity to carry out the investigation. We are equally thankful to the communities and participants who contributed to this study. Our gratitude is also extended to the Tutume DHMT community health nurse and health care assistants for helping with data collection and navigating the district.
