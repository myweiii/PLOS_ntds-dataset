Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), listed as a priority disease by World Health Organization in 2018, is an emerging tick-borne disease that poses a significant public health risk. As a climate-sensitive infectious disease, climatic variations have profound impacts on SFTS incidence. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of meteorological variables on SFTS incidence, while few have focused on the delayed and interaction effects of these factors on SFTS incidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the interaction effects of meteorological factors on SFTS incidence, as well as the first study to estimate the relationship between meteorological factors and SFTS incidence in a humid subtropical climate region. In this study, we compared the relative importance of different meteorological factors on SFTS incidence and further explored the nonlinear trend, interaction effect, and exposure-lag effect of meteorological factors on SFTS incidence. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the dependency of SFTS incidence on meteorological factors in particular climates and may inform resource allocation plans for disease control in scenarios of climate change.
