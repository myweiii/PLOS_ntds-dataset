Fasciolosis is a disease caused by a leaf-shaped trematode called Fasciola hepatica. This disease is becoming increasingly common in humans and has been reported on five continents. F. hepatica primarily infects the bile ducts of cattle, sheep and goats, causing significant economic losses to the global livestock industry. Unfortunately, this disease has been neglected and there is currently no commercially viable vaccine to prevent it. The main treatment for this disease is chemotherapy, with triclabendazole (TCBZ) being the drug of choice for controlling these parasites. However, there is growing concern about the increase in reports of drug resistance to TCBZ in parasites. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternative treatment methods. Natural herbal products give great hope as they contain a large reservoir of medicinal ingredients that are effectively used against various parasitic diseases. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of essential oils of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) on F. hepatica. According to the findings of this study, L. angustifolia and C. siliqua essential oils (EOs) have significant effects as anthelmintics. The use of L. angustifolia and C. siliqua EOs in vitro significantly increased DNA damage, ROS production, and oxidative stress in F. hepatica worms. Therefore, it can be concluded that these EOs have the potential to be used as novel agents for the control and treatment of F. hepatica.
