Typhoid fever is claimed to prevail in Morogoro region. Most patients with stomach pain and or diarrhoea go for a diagnosis of typhoid despite the existence of other etiological agents causing the same clinical signs. Sample culture and isolation of bacteria have been a gold-standard method for the detection of disease-causing agents. However, this approach is rarely made by most hospitals, with the exception of regional and district hospitals in the public sector and big hospitals in the private sector. They always rely on the widal test, which suffers from significant limitations in its sensitivity and specificity. It is, therefore, difficult to identify appropriate etiological agents and assess their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Because of that, the contribution of non-typhoid salmonellosis is not featured. The authors have assessed the occurrence of non-typhoidal Salmonella in hospitalized and outpatients of all age groups at Morogoro Regional Hospital as a modal to establish its contribution to gastrointestinal infections in the region through both conventional and molecular approaches. It was observed that the infection rate was high in children, and the non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars had considerable resistance to the commonly used antimicrobial. This calls for further surveillance of these neglected non-typhoid salmonella in clinical settings
