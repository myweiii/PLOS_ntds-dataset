The Cry toxins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis have been used for decades to control populations of mosquito responsible for spreading febrile diseases in tropical regions. These insecticidal toxins specifically target the midgut cells of larvae. It is widely accepted that two membrane proteins, cadherin (Aae-Cad) and membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (Aae-mALP), are receptors for Cry toxins in A. aegypti. With the aim to study the functional role of Aae-Cad and Aae-mALP in the mode of action of mosquitocidal Cry toxins, in this study we employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate knockout A. aegypti strains deficient in either Aae-Cad or Aae-mALP. Interestingly, we found a sex-linked association for mutations in Aae-Cad generated by CRISPR-Cas9, attributable to its proximity to the sex-determining M-factor on chromosome 1. Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Aae-Cad or Aae-mALP proteins did not affect the normal development of the insects. Surprisingly, we found that the absence of Aae-Cad in the KO-females or Aae-mALP KO A. aegypti did not generate a resistance phenotype to four different Cry toxins, Cry11Aa, Cry11Ba, Cry4Ba and Cry4Aa, indicating that additional molecules are required in the mode of action of Cry toxins.
