Two novel compound series, based on hydroxyethylamine (HEA) and phthalimide (PHT) pharmacophores, previously led to the discovery of antiplasmodial lead compounds, both with therapeutic efficacy in a murine Plasmodium infection model. Here we employed these compound libraries, supplemented with newly designed HEA derivatives, for phenotypic screening against a wide range of protist parasites associated with unmet medical needs. We report potent hit compounds for Entamoeba histolytica, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp., with limited overlap in their structureâ€“activity relation. PHT-39 efficiently penetrated host macrophages to effectively eliminate Leishmania intracellular amastigotes, while displaying high selectivity. Leveraging an orthology-based genome-wide RNAi library screen, we propose an uptake route for the PHT-39 that relies on a transmembrane flippase, known as crucial uptake transporter for the two frontline antileishmanials miltefosine and amphotericin. Despite favourable drug properties of PHT-39, experimental PHT-39 treatment failed to eliminate the Leishmania infection in a cutaneous leishmaniasis animal model. Considering PHT-39 high selectivity and the ability of the drug to effectively reach the intracellular stage of the parasite, we suggest PHT-39 for further optimization.
