Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) that can affect wild and domestic animals. Although the RVFV transmission cycle has been well documented across Africa in savanna ecosystems, little is known about its transmission in tropical rainforests, especially in Central Africa. We thus conducted a survey in northeastern Gabon to assess RVFV circulation among wild and domestic animals. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time in Gabon the presence of the RVFV in two wildlife species (Peterâ€™s duiker Cephalophus callipygus and the blue duiker Philantomba monticola). In addition, we detected RVFV-specific antibodies in small domestic ruminants (sheep and goats) at an overall antibody prevalence of 15.4%, with a much higher seroprevalence rate in goats than sheep (20.1% versus 3.3%). Furthermore, RVFV-specific antibodies were also observed in a single (hunting) dog out of the 26 tested. These results stress the need to develop adequate surveillance plan measures to better control the public health threat of RVFV.
