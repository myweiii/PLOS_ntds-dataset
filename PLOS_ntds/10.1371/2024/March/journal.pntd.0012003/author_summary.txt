Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) which affects more than 250 million people across 78 countries worldwide. The three major schistosomes infecting humans are Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. haematobium. In China, after 70 years of control efforts, tremendous progress has been made, and now the number of schistosomiasis japonica infections is at its lowest historical level. However, advanced schistosomiasis, which is the most serious outcome of schistosome infection, poses a great threat as an increasing number of the patients have been diagnosed. Depression is a frequently occurring mental health issue caused by the disease that has long been overlooked. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to estimate the overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with advanced schistosomiasis in China and its possible influential factors. We found that the pooled prevalence was 62.01% (95% CI: 51.30% - 72.72%) in the targeted patients and the estimate was associated with complications of the disease. Our study would call for psychological interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced schistosomiasis.
