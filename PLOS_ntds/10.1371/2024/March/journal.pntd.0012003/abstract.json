    "Background": "Advanced schistosomiasis is the most serious outcome of infection and has a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental health of patients, the latter of which has long been overlooked. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall prevalence of depressive symptoms, one of the most common mental problems, in patients with advanced schistosomiasis in China.",
    "Methods": "Six electronic databases were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the targeted patients. Assessments were pooled using a fixed- or random-effects model based on heterogeneity test. Subgroup analyses were further performed and differences between/among groups were examined using the chi-squared test. The protocol had previously been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023406708).",
    "Results": "A total of 11 studies with 1,673 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms in advanced schistosomiasis in China was 62.01% (95% CI: 51.30% - 72.72%), with a significant heterogeneity among studies. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent in patients with complications and more than half of the patients suffered a mild- or moderate-level of depression. No publication bias was found, and sensitivity analysis showed a stable result.",
    "Conclusions": "The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in advanced schistosomiasis in China was high enough to warrant psychotherapeutic interventions, especially for patients with complications. This would greatly prevent or/and reduce depression and improve their quality of life."
