For decades, dengue, Zika and chikungunya have been public health issues across the Pacific Island region. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are considered most responsible for the transmission of dengue between people. The introduction of a bacteria called Wolbachia pipientis (wMel strain) to these mosquitoes is known to reduce the transmission of these diseases. Herein, we describe the production and release of wMel-carrying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes into several Pacific Island cities, including Suva, Lautoka, and Nadi in Fiji, Port Vila in Vanuatu, and South Tarawa in Kiribati. With community support, these mosquitoes were released on a weekly basis for periods ranging from 2 to 5 months. The result was a widespread integration of the wMel bacteria into local mosquito populations. Long-term monitoring has shown that the wMel bacteria has been sustained at high levels in mosquitoes in nearly all of the areas where it was introduced. This innovative approach could potentially improve the way we combat mosquito-borne diseases, protecting communities in the Pacific Islands and beyond from the devastating effects of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.
