Human brucellosis it is a disease with transmission associated with the handling of animals and ingestion of contaminated products. The disease usually presents with a subacute to chronic febrile condition characterized by nonspecific symptoms such weight loss, and sudoresis. Therapeutic regimens combining two or more drugs have been shown to be superior to monotherapy. The debilitating and disabling potential of the disease is a warning about its morbidity, whose symptoms can persist for weeks or months, generating socioeconomic impact. So far, the accumulated evidence is based on clinical trials that compared the interventions of interest against different comparators. The authors this reviewed all published studies and performed an analysis was capable of comparing the effect of therapeutic regimens to identify the best combinations to treat human brucellosis. The combination of three medicines (doxycycline + streptomycin + hydroxychloroquine) showed the best results compared to the option previously identified as more effective (doxycycline + streptomycin), so this research points to new perspectives for the treatment of brucellosis. This result point that more studies dedicated to studying this combination must be developed to confirm this trend and enable the adoption of new practices in the treatment of this disease.
