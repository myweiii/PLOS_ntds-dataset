Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a disfiguring and painful Neglected Tropical Disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, and impairs affected individualâ€™s mental wellbeing, social participation, and ability to work. The two most common clinical manifestations are hydrocoele (scrotal swelling) and lymphoedema (swelling of the limbs). Estimates of LF clinical case numbers are required to provide national and local care needs assessment, and for elimination and surveillance purposes. Clinical case prevalence is currently not readily available or is unknown across many sub-Saharan African countries, however Malawi is unique as the LF Programme has conducted extensive house-to-house patient mapping activities across one third of the country. We used this clinical data in combination with measurements of LF infection prevalence and high-resolution climate information, to develop geostatistical models, which estimate the number of clinical cases in unmapped areas. This led to the development of a national database and map of clinical case estimates that will help the Malawi LF Elimination Programme to optimize limited resources, target morbidity management and disability prevention, and improve quality of life of the people affected by this disabling and disfiguring disease.
