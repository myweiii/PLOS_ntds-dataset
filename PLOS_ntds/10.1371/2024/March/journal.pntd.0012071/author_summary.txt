Dengue is the most common arboviral infection worldwide. Dengue shock is the most severe complication of dengue infection; patients develop marked plasma leakage, hypovolaemia and extravascular fluid accumulation. At present, the only treatment available is intravenous fluid, but targeted therapies are needed. With the aim of prioritizing potential therapeutics, we conducted a prospective observational study of 135 adults with dengue shock in Vietnam, investigating the association between biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial activation and endothelial glycocalyx breakdown and clinical severity, and comparing pathophysiology with patients with septic shock and healthy controls. In the dengue shock group, 5/135 patients died. The inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and ferritin were associated with SOFA score, requirement for ICU admission and mortality. IL-6 most strongly correlated with severity of vascular leakage in the lung, measured by ultrasound. The endothelial biomarkers Angiopoietin-2 and syndecan-1 were both also associated with SOFA score and mortality. Our findings highlight the central role of hyperinflammation in determining outcomes from dengue shock; the data suggest that anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 immune modulators and Tie2 agonists may be considered as candidates for therapeutic trials in severe dengue.
