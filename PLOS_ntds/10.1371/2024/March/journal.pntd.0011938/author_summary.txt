Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne tropical disease distributed around the world and transmitted via the bite of infected sandflies. There are 3 main forms of the disease: visceral leishmaniasis, which is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases and is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anemia. The other form of the disease is cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin lesions and life-long scars on exposed parts of the body. Whereas the third one, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, leads to partial or total destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat.
In this study, the authors examined the distribution of visceral leishmaniasis, which has significant impact on livelihoods such as agriculture and livestock and affects cognitive, developmental and educational outcomes. Moreover, since visceral leishmaniasis is a killer disease, timely and accurate diagnosis is important to give appropriate treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis identify the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the rk-39 test regarding its accuracy by considering many studies in the different parts of the world. According to our findings, rk-39 is regarded as a crucial quick diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.
