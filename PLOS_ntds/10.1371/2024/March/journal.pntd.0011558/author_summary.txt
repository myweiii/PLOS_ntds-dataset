Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic neglected tropical disease which predominantly affects poor pastoral communities globally. The parasite cycles between farm dogs and livestock and is associated with livestock farming and feeding of infected offal to dogs. Human morbidity and mortality occur due to cyst formation in body organs, especially in the liver. One of the evolutionary complications of hepatic CE is the passage of parasitic structures, characteristic of CE (germ or pieces thereof, daughter vesicles or both), inside the bile duct, causing total or intermittent biliary obstruction, with or without secondary infection which is known as cholangiohydatidosis (CH), considered the most frequent evolutionary complication of CE, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and worsened prognosis of the disease. This review aims to describe the available evidence regarding clinical characteristics of CH, postoperative complications and hospital mortality.
