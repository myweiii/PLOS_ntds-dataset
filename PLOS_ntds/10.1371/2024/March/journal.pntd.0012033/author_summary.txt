Schistosomal periportal fibrosis is a form of liver fibrosis caused by a parasitic blood fluke, which is predominantly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but also affects areas of South America and South-East Asia. Ultrasound imaging is the most used method to diagnose schistosomal periportal fibrosis because it is easy to transport, safe to use, and the fibrosis is highly echogenic. Many different systems to stage this fibrosis using ultrasound have been proposed, focused on measuring blood vessels in the liver or identifying features or patterns of echogenicity in the scan that might indicate a certain stage of disease. The Niamey protocol is the most recently proposed of these staging systems, having been published by the World Health Organisation in 1996, which contains guidance for staging of S. mansoni morbidity. This guidance was updated in 2000. In the same year, updated guidance for the staging of S. japonicum morbidity was published by the China Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Both S. mansoni and S. japonicum-focused protocols evolved from the Cairo protocol. Our study aimed to understand how ultrasound has been used to stage schistosomal periportal fibrosis and to investigate how different staging systems have been applied and validated. The studies found were first conducted in 1979, and were mostly conducted in Brazil, China and Egypt. The Niamey protocol was the most reported of the staging systems. There was widespread variation in the use, and therefore interpretation, of the Niamey protocol. Future research is needed to reduce the complexity of the Niamey protocol and to standardise how the Niamey protocol is used. More detailed ultrasound procedures, focused assessments on the ultrasound pattern element, and clinically-validated guidance on the severity of the ultrasound pattern elements is needed.
