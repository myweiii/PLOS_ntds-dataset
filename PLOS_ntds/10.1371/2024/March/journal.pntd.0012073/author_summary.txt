Whipworm (T. trichiura), hookworm and roundworm (A. lumbricoides) infections are highly common worldwide. To reduce the morbidity caused by these infections, hundreds of million deworming drugs are given to children every year. To assess how good deworming drugs work it is recommended to microscopically analyze stool samples 14â€“21 days after treatment, however the evidence base for this recommendation is scarce. In Lao PDR we conducted a study collecting daily stool samples from 87 participants for 28 days post-treatment with two deworming drugs, single albendazole and co-administered albendazole-ivermectin. We counted the eggs of T. trichiura, hookworm and A. lumbricoides of each sample by microscopy and calculated the daily proportions of correctly classified negative or positive individuals according to considered real negatives and positives. We used these measures to find the optimal timepoint at which drug efficacy should be assessed. We found that only albendazole-ivermectin reduced the egg counts of whipworm infection whereas both treatments reduced hookworm egg counts and A. lumbricoides worms were absent in all participants after day 7. The best time points to evaluate the activity of the deworming drugs with microscopy were found at days 18 and 22 for whipworm, and at days 17 and 25 for hookworm, respectively.
