Human babesiosis is usually a mild to moderate illness that clears with a standard course of atovaquone and azithromycin. The disease is often severe in immunocompromised patients, including those over 50 years of age, those with asplenia, malignancy, HIV/AIDS, or on immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with multiple immunosuppressive conditions that usually result in low or absent antibody production may experience severe acute disease followed by persistent relapsing disease that can last for months or even years. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used as adjunct therapy in patients with severe babesiosis, although controlled therapeutic trials have not been carried out. This prompted us to evaluate Babesia microti antibody concentrations in IVIG samples from different commercial sources. We tested commercially available IVIG for antibodies against B. microti using IFA and ELISA assays. None of the IVIG samples contained detectable antibody against B. microti. Our results suggest that commercially available IVIG may be of limited therapeutic benefit for babesiosis patients.
