This article addresses the incidence of leprosy in Santar√©m, Brazil, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, there was a 41% reduction in cases compared to the average between 2015 and 2019, possibly due to the cancellation and rescheduling of appointments, affecting diagnoses and follow-up. Men constituted 60% of the cases, with their hesitation to seek care associated with late diagnoses. Alarmingly, 6% of patients were under 14 years old, indicating possible intrafamilial transmission. Socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities were evident, with 74% of cases in individuals of mixed race. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing leprosy not only as a public health challenge but also as a reflection of social and economic inequalities in Brazil. It proposes comprehensive health policies, expansion of medical services in remote regions, and educational initiatives for awareness and early diagnosis, especially in vulnerable communities. The association between age and clinical form of the disease, as well as spatial distribution analyses, provides crucial insights for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies.
