Leptospira are a group of bacteria, including pathogenic types that cause a zoonotic disease called leptospirosis. In Uganda, domesticated animals are implied as the source of human Leptospira exposures, yet comparable animal data is only available for cattle and dogs. Knowing that control of leptospirosis requires an understanding of infection sources and factors influencing transmission, our study aimed at determining Leptospira seroprevalence, associated risk factors, and serogroups circulating among the other domesticated animals in Uganda.
We detected a moderate seroprevalence, and several Leptospira serogroups among pigs and small ruminants from all regions of Uganda. We determined that pigs sourced from the Eastern and Northern regions were significantly more seropositive, and that being female, or adult (â‰¥7 months old) was a risk factor for seropositivity among small ruminants. These results support existing reports in cattle and dogs and imply widespread Leptospira exposure among livestock in Uganda. The findings may inform future programs for the control of leptospirosis in livestock in Uganda.
