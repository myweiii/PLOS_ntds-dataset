Sincere gratitude is conveyed to medical and veterinary staff in Lira, Mbale and Kampala City for the support rendered to us during sample collection. Nabatta Esther, Munyiirwa Damien Frederick Naimane and Edrine Kayaga supported sample analysis at CDL. Dr. Jolly Hoona formally working with the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries did foundation work that enabled sampling of slaughterhouse workers in the 3 regional abattoirs, for which she is highly commended.
