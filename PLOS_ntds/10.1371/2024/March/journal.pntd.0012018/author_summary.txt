Campylobacter is a leading cause of gastroenteritis among children living in resource poor settings. Infections are predominantly caused by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. To estimate the burden of Campylobacter, nucleic acid diagnostic testing has been utilized in large population based epidemiologic studies. However, there is evidence of heterogeneity in the binding sites for the main C. jejuni and C. coli qPCR assay utilized. This study presents and validates an alternative rpsKD-based qPCR assay to detect both C. jejuni and C. coli. Improved detection of these two species is expected to impact diagnostic studies of enteric infectious disease and improve estimates of the overall burden of Campylobacter.
