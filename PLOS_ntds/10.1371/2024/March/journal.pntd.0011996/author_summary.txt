Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of around 25 health issues caused by different germs, and they bring about serious health, social, and economic problems. Those diseases mainly affect poor communities in tropical areas, and some are found in other regions too. Despite their big impact, NTDs donâ€™t get much attention or funding from global agencies.
Studying NTDs is crucial to gather information that can help control and eliminate those diseases. However, there are challenges in doing this research, like having a hard time convincing enough people to participate. This is important to fix because if not enough people take part, the research results may not be reliable, and it can make the study take longer and cost more.
We did a careful review to understand what helps and what makes it challenging to convince people to participate in biomedical research on NTDs. Our findings can be useful for researchers to plan better, improve how many people take part in NTD studies, and avoid problems that come with not having enough participants.
