Plague is a bacterial disease transmitted by flea bites, and the rat fleas are the main vectors of Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium. Households in plague endemic-areas of Madagascar are frequently infested by Pulex irritans, the human flea, which does become naturally infected with the plague bacterium during epidemic. The intensity of flea infestation varies among households, but the reasons for such disparities are poorly understood. This study identifies factors associated with P. irritans infestation in rural households in plague-endemic areas of Madagascar. Infestation risk was more pronounced for poor households living in homes made with organic construction materials and flea density did not show a seasonal pattern. One third of the household experienced high flea infestation, putting inhabitants at risk of sustained interhuman plague transmission, should the fleas or a household member become infected. While P. irritans may be a secondary vector, this additional route of plague transmission deserves more attention from epidemiologists. The factors identified in this analysis suggest that improvement of housing and better management of livestock would alleviate flea burden and potential plague risk in rural plague-endemic villages experiencing high flea infestation.
