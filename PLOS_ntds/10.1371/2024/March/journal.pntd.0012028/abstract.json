    "Background": "India is going through the maintenance phase of VL elimination programme which may be threatened by the persistence of hidden parasite pools among asymptomatic leishmanial infection (ALI) and PKDL. The present work was designed to determine the burden of VL, PKDL, and ALI and to assess the role of treatment of ALI in maintaining post-elimination phase.",
    "Methods and finding": "The study was undertaken in Malda district, West Bengal, India during October 2016 to September 2021. Study areas were divided into ‘Study’ and ‘Control’ arms. VL and PKDL cases of both the arms were diagnosed by three active mass surveys with an interval of one year and treated as per National guideline. ALI of ‘Study’ arm was treated like VL. ALI of ‘Control’ arm was followed up to determine their fate. Fed sand-fly pools were analysed for parasitic DNA. No significant difference was noted between the incidence of VL and PKDL in both the arms. Incidence of ALI declined sharply in ‘Study’ arm but an increasing trend was observed in ‘Control’ arm. Significantly higher rate of sero-conversion was noted in ‘Control’ arm and was found to be associated with untreated ALI burden. Parasitic DNA was detected in 22.8% ALI cases and 2.2% sand-fly pools.",
    "Conclusion": "Persistence of a significant number of PKDL and ALI and ongoing transmission, as evidenced by new infection and detection of leishmanial DNA in vector sand-flies, may threaten the maintenance of post-elimination phase. Emphasis should be given for elimination of pathogen to prevent resurgence of VL epidemics."
