In Burkina Faso, the monitoring and evaluation scheme to assess the impact of lymphatic filariasis and malaria interventions is relied only on parasitological tests. While nowadays, the most simple and direct measure of vector borne diseases is xenomonitoring. When the both diseases prevalence is low in human population, sampling large numbers of mosquitoes is necessary for xenomonitoring. This study was undertaken in this context to assess the efficiency of four mosquito collection methods for xenomonitoring LF and malaria. Mosquito collections were performed between August and September 2018 in four villages, distributed in East and South-West health regions of Burkina Faso. Human Landing Catches (HLC), Window Exit-Trap, Double Net Trap (DNT) and Pyrethrum Spray Catches (PSC) were evaluated. The results showed that HLC remained the most effective collection method by collecting the highest number of Anopheles (2 388; 71.88% of total). Across the study, mosquito infection rate for W. bancrofti and P. falciparum were 0.004 and 0.13 respectively. To collect vectors infected it was found that Window Exit-Trap and PSC were efficient. In conclusion, HLC has been shown to be appropriate for collecting large number of mosquitoes. Likewise, Window Exit-Trap and PSC can be useful for malaria and lymphatic filariasis xenomonitoring.
