Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanasoma cruzi. CD is generally a chronic condition. Individuals living in vulnerable situations and marginalized populations are often more susceptible to CD infection and morbidity, determined by, among other factors, a lack of access to timely diagnosis and care. However, diagnosing CD is difficult and expensive, requiring at least two different laboratory-based tests in highly specialized facilities, and many cases of CD go undiagnosed. In Bolivia, which has the highest incidence of CD worldwide, it is estimated that just 6% of chronically infected individuals get diagnosed. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are tests that could be used to improve case management, especially in hard-to-reach populations, as they do not need specialized laboratories or highly trained people to use them. We carried out a study to evaluate LFAs that can be used for the rapid detection of CD infection, to evaluate their usefulness for diagnosis. Most of the tests we evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions were comparable to those of current laboratory-based diagnostic methods.
