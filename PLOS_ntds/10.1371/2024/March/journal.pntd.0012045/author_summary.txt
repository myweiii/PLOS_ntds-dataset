Strongyloides stercoralis is endemic to most tropical and subtropical countries, and causes potentially life-long infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Strongyloidiasis can occasionally cause life-threatening illness, particularly in immunocompromised people, and often years after the initial infection. Very little is known about the burden of strongyloidiasis in Oceania, particularly in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories of Polynesia and Fiji. Auckland (New Zealand) is home to a large population of migrants from Polynesia and Fiji, and clinicians in Auckland frequently treat strongyloidiasis.
This study describes a cohort of 691 people diagnosed with strongyloidiasis in Auckland between 2012 and 2022. Only 70% of people in this cohort received treatment. The proportion receiving treatment did not differ significantly among people with the highest risk of severe strongyloidiasis. In addition, high rates of positive Strongyloides serology were found among people born in Samoa and Fiji, which were comparable to seropositivity among migrants from other ‘high burden’ countries (South East Asia). In addition to identifying a need to improve management of strongyloidiasis in Auckland, this study suggests the burden of strongyloidiasis in Polynesia and Fiji may be higher than previously suggested.
