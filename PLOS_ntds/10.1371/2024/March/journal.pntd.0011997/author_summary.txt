Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, the most significant transmissible disease between animals and humans in Argentina. It is estimated that two-thirds of individuals with the disease currently reside in urban areas, and globally, only 10% of those affected are aware of their condition. The diagnosis of chronic infection requires conducting at least two different laboratory tests mainly available at reference laboratories, which poses logistical and economic challenges for both the patients and the health systems, and it often results in limited access to high-quality diagnosis. Primary healthcare has the potential to address around 90% of the populationâ€™s healthcare needs over their lifetime. Although there are rapid diagnostic tests for T. cruzi infection, that could be potentially incorporated at lower levels of the healthcare system in Argentina, there is a lack of independent evaluation of the available tests. In fact, since 2010 the World Health Organization emphasized the need of evaluating diagnostic tests that enable the rapid detection of T. cruzi infection in primary care centers. In this study, we assessed under controlled laboratory conditions the ability of the rapid diagnostic tests for confirming or ruling out the chronic infection in patients in Argentina.
