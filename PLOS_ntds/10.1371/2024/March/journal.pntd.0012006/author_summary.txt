Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a worldwide disease caused by Leishmania and it is a threat to public health in developing countries. Because of the non-specific skin lesion of CL and very low number of CL cases found only in Northwest China desert, it is easy to be misdiagnosed as other skin issues, especially in non-endemic region of China. As economics grows, an increasing number of Chinese travelers to endemic countries and returned with CL. While physicians in China are unfamiliar with the various cutaneous manifestation of CL, the misdiagnosis may lead to inappropriate treatment and unnecessary delay of healing. Our study summarized the clinical and parasitological features of 25 Chinese CL cases imported from Iraq for the first time, which include epidemiology, the diagnostic methods and species identification of infected Leishmania spp.. All these features of imported CL cases could help Chinese physicians with the diagnosis and treatment of CL in China.
