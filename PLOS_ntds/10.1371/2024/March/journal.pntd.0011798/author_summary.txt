Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected tropical disease and it affects many women and young girls in schistosomiasis endemic areas. A lot of research is still needed to understand the characteristics of FGS, its prevention, as well as the timing for treatment. As a result of the limited information, some women who suffer from FGS end up being misdiagnosed with diseases such as human papilloma virus or other sexually transmitted diseases. The study highlights issues that need to be taken into considerations when providing treatment or conducting mass treatment for schistosomiasis and FGS or planning gynaecological investigations to inform FGS control programmes. In this study of adolescent girls and young women of KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa, we sought to explore the factors that influence participation in mass treatment and gynaecological investigation, and investigating the effect of praziquantel treatment on FGS. Factors that influenced participation in mass treatment included HIV, current water contact, water contact as a toddler and urinary schistosomiasis. Factors that influenced participation in follow up gynaecological investigation included grainy sandy patches, abnormal blood vessels, homogenous yellow patches, previous pregnancy, current water contact, water contact as a toddler and father present in the family. There was low uptake and loss to follow up for mass treatment, and this contributed to small sample size for follow up gynaecological investigations to understand the effect of treatment. However, multivariable analysis showed that treatment had effect on the abnormal blood vessels and not on grainy sandy patches and homogenous yellow patches.
