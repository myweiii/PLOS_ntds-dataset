    "Objective": "Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) causes intravaginal lesions and symptoms that could be mistaken for sexually transmitted diseases or cancer. In adults, FGS lesions [grainy sandy patches (GSP), homogenous yellow patches (HYP), abnormal blood vessels and rubbery papules] are refractory to treatment. The effect of treatment has never been explored in young women; it is unclear if gynaecological investigation will be possible in this young age group (16–23 years). We explored the predictors for accepting anti-schistosomal treatment and/or gynaecological reinvestigation in young women, and the effects of anti-schistosomal mass-treatment (praziquantel) on the clinical manifestations of FGS at an adolescent age.",
    "Method": "The study was conducted between 2011 and 2013 in randomly selected, rural, high schools in Ilembe, uThungulu and Ugu Districts, KwaZulu-Natal Province, East Coast of South Africa. At baseline, gynaecological investigations were conducted in female learners in grades 8 to 12, aged 16–23 years (n = 2293). Mass-treatment was offered in the low-transmission season between May and August (a few in September, n = 48), in accordance with WHO recommendations. Reinvestigation was offered after a median of 9 months (range 5–14 months). Univariate, multivariable and logistic regression analysis were used to measure the association between variables.",
    "Results": "Prevalence: Of the 2293 learners who came for baseline gynaecological investigations, 1045 (46%) had FGS lesions and/or schistosomiasis, 209/1045 (20%) had GSP; 208/1045 (20%) HYP; 772/1045 (74%) had abnormal blood vessels; and 404/1045 (39%) were urine positive.",
    "Conclusion": "Compliance to treatment and gynaecological reinvestigation was very low. There is need to embark on large scale awareness and advocacy in schools and communities before implementing mass-treatment and investigation studies. Despite challenges in sample size and significant loss to follow-up, limiting the ability to fully understand the treatment’s effect, multivariable analysis demonstrated a significant treatment effect on abnormal blood vessels."
