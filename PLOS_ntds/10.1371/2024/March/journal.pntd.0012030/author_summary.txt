Brucellosis represents a prevalent zoonotic condition that significantly impacts regions constrained by limited resources. Diagnosis, usually based on symptoms and incomplete data, leads to underreporting and delayed treatment. Our comprehensive systematic literature review focused on evaluating the practical effectiveness of current diagnostic approaches for brucellosis, to guide decision-makers. Our analysis involved 38 studies primarily conducted in Asian and African regions, revealing considerable outcome variability. When considering the reference test, culture and/or SAT are deemed more suitable than culture alone. While Rose Bengal, IgG/IgM ELISA, and PCR tests exhibited equally strong performances, the evidence remained notably limited. It is vital to recognize that apart from performance, factors such as accessibility, cost, and ease of use must also be factored into informed decision-making. Our findings emphasize the critical need to expand the scope of validation studies on diagnostic tests and the development of new, more robust, and easily accessible alternatives for addressing brucellosis. This pursuit is essential to meet the urgent demand for enhanced diagnostic capabilities in this field, providing improved methods to combat this challenging disease.
