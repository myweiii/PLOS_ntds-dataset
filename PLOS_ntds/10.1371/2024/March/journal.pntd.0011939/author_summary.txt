Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the small tapeworm of dogs, Echinococcus granulosus, is considered as a prevalent zoonotic infection of human and livestock worldwide. Dogs play a crucial role in the parasite life cycle, serving as definitive hosts for the tapeworm and contributing to the transmission of the disease to humans and other livestock.
Praziquantel (PZQ) dosing of dogs is proposed as one of the main elements of CE control programs. Frequent PZQ dosing is required because of reinfection of farm dogs following feeding offal to them and this presents major logistic and financial problems. The frequency of PZQ dosing is dependent on the rate of dog reinfection in each endemic region. We explored the significance of farm dogs reinfection in an endemic area in southeastern Iran, to provide better understanding of CE transmission and developing effective control programs.
We monitored a cohort of 150 dogs previously treated for cystic echinococcosis by praziquantel. We showed that the prevalence of echinococcosis in the farm dogs, using PCR assay was 42.6% before praziquantel administration. To our surprise, a significant proportion of these dogs, approximately 17%, experienced reinfection with E. granulosus, 12 months following initial praziquantel administration. This finding was both alarming and informative. Our study emphasized the importance of responsible dog ownership behavior and proper disposal of livestock offal in endemic areas.
