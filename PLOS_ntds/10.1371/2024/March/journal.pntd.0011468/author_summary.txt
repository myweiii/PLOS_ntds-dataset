Millions of cases of typhoid fever occur each year, causing thousands of deaths, particularly in children. In order to distribute vaccines to communities with the highest need, it is important to understand disease prevalence in different regions. Clinical surveillance for typhoid fever requires testing of blood and fecal samples, which can be challenging, especially in communities that do not have easy access to healthcare. Environmental surveillance is another method of disease surveillance where wastewater samples are tested for the bacteria that causes typhoid feverâ€“Salmonella Typhi. Environmental surveillance allows researchers to infer information about the number of people who may be infected in a community by measuring the number of bacteria in wastewater samples. Researchers must determine when and where to collect wastewater samples in a complex wastewater network, and the interpretation of this data is complicated. Many different variables affect the concentration of bacteria in wastewater, including how many bacteria are shed in the stool of people with infections and how much the bacteria is diluted and degraded before it is measured. This study describes a model developed to aid with the design of an environmental sampling plan for typhoid fever and to help with the interpretation of results.
