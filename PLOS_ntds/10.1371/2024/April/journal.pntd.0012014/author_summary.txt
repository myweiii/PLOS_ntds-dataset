Malaria incidence in Vietnam has substantially declined in the last decade, however, current prevention strategies may be insufficient to achieve national elimination goals. A proposed tool for use as a mosquitocide is zooprophylaxis-aided ivermectin-based elimination (i.e., treating cattle with ivermectin to kill feeding mosquitoes). Ivermectin (IVM) is an inexpensive helminthicide and is safe for use in mammals. In laboratory studies, mosquitoes feeding on IVM-treated cattle have increased mortality compared to controls. Presented here is a randomized village-based trial to determine whether IVM treatment can reduce the number of captured mosquitoes. Six villages in Central Vietnam were randomly assigned to either receive IVM treatment or remain a control. Mosquitoes in each village were captured for six trap nights, followed by treatment in three villages, followed by trapping for an additional six nights. A difference-in-differences model did not show any statistically significant differences in capture rates between the treated and control villages. Factors including the amount of circulating IVM in the cattle population, crossover of mosquito populations, and differential feeding habits may have affected captures. A total of 18 species were identified using dichotomous keys. In post hoc analyses, no clear trends were observed in the anopheline populations after IVM treatment, as measured by ecological diversity metrics. Future studies should include additional villages, greater control of cattle movements, and consider potential vector movements.
