Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a lethal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T.b.r) protozoan parasites. The only treatment available for the late, CNS stage due to T.b.r, is melarsoprol (MelB). Notably, MelB has an arsenic moiety, that makes it very neurotoxic, causing fatal post-treatment reactive encephalopathy in about 5% of those treated. This level of drug-induced mortality is unacceptable in this day and age. The question is, how can we block T.b.r-induced organ damage and safely administer MelB? In the late stage HAT, parasites wreak havoc by inducing severe oxidative stress, inflammation and breach of the blood brain barrier (bbb); while on the other hand, MelB is driving lethal encephalopathy. We used a HAT mouse model and sought to elucidate the potential of a standardized GB extractâ€“a potent antioxidant anti-inflammatory, to alleviate T.b.r-driven damage to the bbb, induction of oxidative stress and inflammation; while ameliorating MelB-driven neurotoxic effects. According to the results, GB protected from lethal parasite induced organ damage, as well as MelB toxicity, providing a novel approach for development of an adjuvant therapy.
