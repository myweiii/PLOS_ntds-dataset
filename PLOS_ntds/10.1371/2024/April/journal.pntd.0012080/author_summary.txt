Snakebite envenoming poses a significant public health challenge, especially in rural tropical and subtropical areas. Annually, an estimated 1.2â€“5.5 million people are envenomed, with over 125,000 fatalities and many more suffering disabilities. Collecting accurate epidemiological data on snakebite is challenging. This systematic review and meta-analysis compile global data on snakebite morbidity and mortality.
After screening thousands of articles, 65 were selected, covering 663,460 snakebites. Men in agricultural areas were most at risk, with rural dwellers bearing the brunt. Most bites occurred in summer, during the day, and affected the lower limb. Envenoming severity was typically mild, often treated in hospitals with anti-venom.
Globally, the pooled incidence was 69.4/100,000 population per year and mortality was 0.33/100,000 population per year. Asia reported the highest incidence and mortality rates. Incidence was highest in lower-middle-income countries, while mortality was greatest in low-income countries.
These findings underscore the urgent need to address the burden of snakebite envenoming, particularly in resource-limited settings. Efforts must focus on prevention, treatment, and strengthening healthcare systems to mitigate the impact of this neglected tropical disease.
