Chikungunya fever virus (CHIKV) is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. The virus causes disease outbreaks and epidemics in Asia, Africa and recently, in the Americas. Despite recent approval of a live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine, additional vaccines are warranted due to the worldwide distribution of CHIKV. We developed bacterial plasmid DNA that codes for CHIKV virus V5040 with rearranged genome as an experimental CHIKV vaccine. The vaccine virus was prepared in cultured cells and tested in mice. The results showed that genome rearrangement did not prevent replication of V5040 virus. Mice injected with V5040 vaccine virus developed immune response that prevented infection with related CHIKV. The results suggest that V5040 CHIKV with genome rearrangement deserves additional studies as a potential vaccine to prevent infections with CHIKV.
