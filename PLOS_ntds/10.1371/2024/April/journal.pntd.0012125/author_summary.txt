Diabetes is a risk factor for a less favorable prognosis in patients with cancer or autoimmune diseases, but few studies have explored the association between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and in-hospital mortality, disease type, and secondary infections among individuals with severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). Our study reveal that high FPG level on admission was an independent predictor of in-hospital death and severe disease in individuals with SFTS without preexisting diabetes. FPG screening upon admission and glycemic control are effective methods to assess the prognosis and disease type of patients with SFTS regardless of diabetes status, as most individuals with SFTS are prone to glucose metabolism disorders.
