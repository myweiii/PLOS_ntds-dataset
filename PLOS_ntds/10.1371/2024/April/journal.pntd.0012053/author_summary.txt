Arboviruses coinfection in mosquitoes can occur either simultaneously or sequentially. Simultaneous coinfection of arboviruses in mosquitoes is unlikely to exert mutual developmental influence on these viruses, resulting in a single mosquito bite may transmit multiple arboviruses to humans, thereby facilitating the spread of these pathogens. However, the interplay between viruses within a mosquito after the sequential coinfection is intricated and not well understood. We present results from DENV (serotype 2) and ZIKV sequential coinfection both in mosquito cell line (C6/36) and Aedes aegypti. Our results demonstrated that both mosquito cells and adult mosquitoes could be sequentially coinfected, but prior infection with one arbovirus significantly reduced susceptibility to a secondary arbovirus infection. Moreover, upon sequential coinfection with DENV and ZIKV through oral feeding, the transmission potential of A. aegypti for the ZIKV was aborted. We preliminarily explored the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and observed that arbovirus-infected mosquitoes exhibited activated innate immunity, disrupted lipid metabolism, and enhanced RNAi pathway, all of which contributed to the reduced susceptibility to the secondary arbovirus infections. In the epidemiology of mosquito borne diseases, our findings indicates that, in contrast to simultaneous arbovirus coinfection in mosquitoes that can promote the transmission and co-circulation of these viruses, sequential coinfection appears to have limited influence on arbovirus transmission dynamics.
