    "Background": "Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. WHO-recommended treatment requires 8-weeks of daily rifampicin (RIF) and clarithromycin (CLA) with wound care. Treatment compliance may be challenging due to socioeconomic determinants. Previous minimum Inhibitory Concentration and checkerboard assays showed that amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMX/CLV) combined with RIF+CLA were synergistic against M. ulcerans. However, in vitro time kill assays (TKA) are a better approach to understand the antimicrobial activity of a drug over time. Colony forming units (CFU) enumeration is the in vitro reference method to measure bacterial load, although this is a time-consuming method due to the slow growth of M. ulcerans.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "TKA of RIF, CLA and AMX/CLV alone and in combination were performed against different M. ulcerans clinical isolates. Bacterial loads were quantified with different methodologies after 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days of treatment.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our study suggests that alternative and faster TKA methodologies can be used in BU research instead of the cumbersome CFU quantification method. These results provide an in vitro microbiological support to of the BLMs4BU clinical trial (NCT05169554, PACTR202209521256638) to shorten BU treatment."
