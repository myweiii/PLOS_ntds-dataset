Ethiopia is a high burden country for zoonotic diseases. The study showed that although there are limited official records of human Anthrax and brucellosis cases, healthcare providers and pastoralists in the Afar and Somali region recalled such cases in both animals and humans, thus highlighting under-reporting of diseases. Pastoralists had a moderate level of knowledge for Anthrax and brucellosis and over half knew at least one preventive measure. However, they still engaged in risky behavior exposing them to pathogens. Ability to respond to animal outbreaks was challenged by limited vaccine and drugs availability, timely vaccine administration and the mobility of pastoralists. Disease knowledge was relatively poor among healthcare providers. Particularly the community health professionals-as front liners, had no knowledge about Anthrax and brucellosis. Health facilities lacked protocols and standard operating procedures for managing zoonotic diseases, and did not have access to laboratory confirmation of pathogens. The study showed that in these pastoral regions, Anthrax is under-reported, and that surveillance, prevention and responses in humans and livestock remain inadequate. It highlighted the need for a One-Health and stronger trans-disciplinary approach, leveraging the knowledge and attitudes of pastoralists to enhance disease prevention and control efforts.
