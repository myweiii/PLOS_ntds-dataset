The parasite Leishmania donovani causes the fatal systemic disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in endemic nations including India. The parasite is an obligate intracellular protozoan, residing mostly in monocytic cells in the bone marrow, blood and affected organs of infected human or other vertebrate hosts. Cells of the monocytic lineage can either provide a safe intracellular location in which the parasite survives, or they can be activated to kill intracellular parasites. We studied the contribution of monocyte subsets in the blood and bone marrow of patients from India with active visceral leishmaniasis, or control subjects without leishmaniasis. Our studies suggested that circulating monocytes of patients with VL are defective in their hability to kill intracellular parasites and to migrate toward sites of inflammation. These defects are most prominent in expanded subsets of monocytes expressing both the CD16 and CD14 receptors on their surface membranes. The immune defects underlying VL may be greatly influenced by subsets of blood monocytes that expand during disease.
