Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis that is endemic and widely distributed in Nigeria. For effective control strategies, it is important to continue to identify and classify communities where the disease is still been transmitted. A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted in two closely located rural farming communities that had not had any control interventions, to determine the status of the disease in the communities, and initiate the administration of medicine. Urine samples were collected from volunteering participants and examined for S. haematobium eggs. Of 167 participants who submitted urine samples in the two communities, 32.9% were infected. The Ajagba community had more infected participants (45.6%) than the Awosan community (5.7%). All age groups were infected in the Ajagba community, but school-aged children were more infected than any other age group. Snail intermediate hosts were found at the water contact site in Ajagba but not at water contact site in Awosan. The study suggests that communities with natural freshwater bodies that harbor appropriate snail intermediate hosts are at greater risk of infection.
