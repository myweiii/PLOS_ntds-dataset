To further integrate the monitoring and evaluation of public health control programs against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), the diagnostic platforms used should ideally be able to screen multiple NTDs in one and the same sample. A stepping stone for more synergies across these programs are blood-based diagnostic assays. Although they have been both developed and implemented to inform public health programs for a number of NTDs, little is known about the progress towards a blood-based diagnostic assays to follow-up on public health programs against intestinal worms. Therefore, we conducted an extensive review of blood-based tests for intestinal worm infections in humans and animals, analysing their progress from assay-development towards routine use in both public and animal health control programs. Our results indicated that, despite many tests are used in research, the use of blood-based assays for guiding control programs against intestinal worms is limited. Only two tests for pigs are currently used to inform deworming programs in pig herds. For human diagnosis, none of the current assays has been extensively evaluated or used for routine diagnosis in control programs.
