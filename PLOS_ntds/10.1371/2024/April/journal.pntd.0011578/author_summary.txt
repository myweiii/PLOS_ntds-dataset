We produced a simple model of the population dynamics of the riverine tsetse fly, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, to simulate the field results of controlling this insect for seven years using Tiny Targets, i.e., artificial insecticide-treated baits, in NW Uganda. The model is potentially useful in planning tsetse control and teaching the principles involved. Thus, it confirmed that targets can give good control, even if the targets degrade so much that they need replacement after six months. It showed that invasion can limit severely the efficacy of control campaigns and mask the changes in the age structure of the population. We stress the need to consider the possibility of seasonal complications and problems of managing large scale operations.
