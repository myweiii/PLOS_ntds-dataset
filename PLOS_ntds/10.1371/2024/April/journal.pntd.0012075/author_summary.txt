The first vaccine to prevent chikungunya fever has been recently approved in November 2023 by the US FDA and multiple chikungunya vaccine candidates are in different phases of the development pipeline. These will be the first-ever vaccines against an alphavirus and offer new technologies for vaccine development against other viruses of the same family that may cause future epidemics. We interviewed stakeholders from areas at risk of chikungunya outbreaks across Latin America, Asia and Africa, and identified gaps in Evidence-to-Recommendation criteria that should be addressed alongside vaccine introduction. Our findings show that stakeholders from different regions prioritised chikungunya differently, but all stakeholders agreed that the unknown burden of disease, undefined target populations for vaccination and non-specific disease surveillance were challenges that needed to be addressed imminently. To address these gaps, the involvement of stakeholders in all phases of vaccine development and rollout will be crucial to uncover future challenges and to ensure vaccine equity.
