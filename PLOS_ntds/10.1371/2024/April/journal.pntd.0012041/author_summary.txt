In this school survey conducted within a primary healthcare setting in rural Kenya, a deep-learning system (DLS) was developed for detection of eggs secreted in human stool from intestinal worms, so called soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Infections caused by STHs are the most common neglected tropical diseases and a major cause of health impairment in low- and middle-income countries. Novel diagnostic methods are needed to improve disease control. In the current study, stool samples were collected from children attending local primary schools and digitized using a portable slide scanner and uploaded via mobile networks to a cloud repository. Using the digital samples, a DLS was trained and tested for the detection of eggs of the most common STHs (Ascaris lumbricoides, Tricuris trichiura and hookworms) and compared to conventional manual microscopy analysis of the samples. The results showed that the DLS was able to accurately detect STHs in the digital samples. Although the DLS detected some false positive parasites, it was able to detect a significant number of parasites that had been missed with conventional microscopy analysis. The study concludes that digital microscopy, supported by image-based artificial intelligence, can be implemented in a primary health care setting and may provide a future tool for improved STH detection and, thereby, better monitoring and evaluation of control programs. The digital method is especially promising in light intensity infections, with only a few parasite eggs per sample.
