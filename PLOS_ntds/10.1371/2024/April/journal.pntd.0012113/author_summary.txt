Human cutaneous leishmaniasis affects low-income populations living in places far from health services. The early sampling and detection of the parasite are necessary for timely treatment, however there are no uniform sampling criteria, thus the sensitivity of molecular tests may vary due to various factors such as the type of sample, the time of the disease and the parasite load in the lesion.
In this study, we compared the performance of three sampling methods for molecular identification of the genus and Leishmania (Viannia) species in Peru. Several analytical methods, including composite reference standards and latent class models, suggested that lancet scraping might be the best approach for parasite genus detection by kDNA-PCR and for parasite species determination by FRET probes-based Nested Real-Time PCR.
