Filariasis is a common tropical infectious disease. Depending on the parasite, it causes lymphoedema, elephantiasis, itching, blindness, etc. It is estimated that more than 1 billion people require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of this infection. The diagnosis of this disease is made through microscopical examination of a blood smear by a human expert, which is not always available. In this study we propose an edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that detects and quantifies four species of microfilariae (Loa loa, Mansonella perstans, Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi) using the camera of a smartphone attached to an optical microscope with a 3D printed adapter. The system works in real time and does not need internet connectivity as the AI models are run locally in a medium range smartphone. We have replicated the diagnostic workflow that is typically performed by an expert microscopist augmented by the support of the AI system.
