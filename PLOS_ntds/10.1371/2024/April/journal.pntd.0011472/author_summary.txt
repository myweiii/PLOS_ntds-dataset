Interspecific hybridization between trematode parasites pose serious health risks to humans. Many systems have shown possible hybridization between different schistosome species. As evidence of natural hybridization between human S. haematobium and animal S. bovis or S. curassoni has grown in recent years, epidemiological surveys across potential hybrid zones are required, particularly in endemic African regions. According to several reports, indiscriminate human-animal water contact is a major factor contributing to hybridization of human and animal schistosomes. We collected and genotyped 57 samples from pastoral and non-pastoral communities in Kachi, Jigawa state, and Ile Oluji/Oke Igbo, Ondo state, Nigeria to screen for hybrids. In both sites, we found Schistosoma hybrids with mitonuclear discordance that supported repeated backcrossing between S. haematobium, S. bovis, and S. curassoni. Contrary to previous reports, Schistosoma hybrids appear to be widespread and not solely dependent on human-animal water interactions.
