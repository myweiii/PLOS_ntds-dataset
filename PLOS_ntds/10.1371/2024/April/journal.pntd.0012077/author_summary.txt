Tropical fevers, specifically those caused by non-malarial infectious agents, contribute to considerable morbidity and mortality in the Asia-Pacific region. Diagnosis of these pathogens is challenging since the clinical signs are often indistinguishable. Conventional laboratory tests to differentiate between tropical diseases require substantial infrastructure and experienced staff, limiting access to accurate tests in low-resource endemic regions. Rapid diagnostic tools (RDTs) offer an affordable solution for disease management and patient care. Although RDTs are also available for detecting non-malarial pathogens, there are financial and accessibility issues in establishing multiple separate tests in resource-constrained regions. To overcome these challenges, a multi-detection diagnostic platform with the capacity to diagnose a diverse range of tropical fevers would be a solution. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an easier-to-use multiplex lateral flow immunoassay (DPP Fever Panel II Assay) that can detect IgM antibodies and specific antigens of common tropical diseases in Asia (Scrub typhus, Murine typhus, Leptospirosis, Melioidosis, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Zika virus). The test performed offers comparable diagnostic accuracy to commercially available tests, as well as some reference tests. The test also performs at equivalent accuracy with both blood and serum samples. If the fever panel were used as a stand-alone test for acute febrile illness diagnosis, cut-offs would need to be adjusted depending on the use of the test, and the desired sensitivity and specificity. There is a need to investigate the use of these cut-offs in other endemic regions, which could improve the rate of tropical fever diagnosis in low-resource settings.
