    "Background": "Transmission of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses places a huge public health burden on countries in the Americas [1\u20133]. Surveillance and control of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors that transmit these pathogens and raising public awareness have been the main control strategies [4\u20137]. Sustained vector surveillance is recommended to detect and respond to potential arbovirus outbreaks [7]. Surveillance is complex because Ae. aegypti populations are highly heterogeneous in time and space; with distribution and abundance associated with environmental and climatic factors, land cover, human host density, the availability of aquatic habitats for oviposition, and socio-economic variables among others [8\u201312]. Thus, small-scale entomological surveillance is likely required to predict human exposure risk at the local level.\nIn general, Ae. aegypti is highly associated with urban environments in tropical countries; where poor water and waste disposal infrastructure provide ample aquatic habitats for mosquito oviposition and larval development [13]. Although primarily urban, this species can also occur in peri-urban and rural areas [14\u201319]. The lower frequency of Ae. aegypti in peri-urban and rural settings may be due to the presence of other mosquito competitor species, and the reduced density of human hosts (given the high anthropophily of this species) and the artificial container habitats they prefer for oviposition [14,15,17\u201319]. Even within urban sites, Ae. aegypti can be highly heterogeneous [16,17,20]. Clusters often occur within 30 metres of households/neighbourhoods [21, 22]; matching the typical flight range of this species [23,24]. Understanding the drivers of local Aedes heterogeneity in urban centres is important for implementation of efficient surveillance and vector control. For example, as large-scale vector control across an entire city is time and resource consuming, focalized targeting at the neighbourhood or household level may be more cost effective [20,22,25,26].\nEntomological surveillance can guide vector control programmes by directing efforts to areas and periods of highest vector abundance and/or human exposure [20,22,26]. Aedes surveillance systems measure presence and abundance in terms of larvae, pupae or adult mosquitoes [27,28]. However due to the complexity of arbovirus transmission, most of these entomological indicators are poorly correlated with disease incidence [28\u201330]. Of all mosquito life-history stages, the abundance of adult female Aedes (the only life stage capable of transmission) has shown the closest albeit weak association with DENV transmission [31]. However, more investigation is needed to identify which of the many methods available for adult Aedes surveillance is most indicative of human exposure risk [5,6,32].\nFine-scale analyses of Aedes vector behaviour and habitat use is also useful for selection of appropriate vector control. Control methods for adult Aedes often involve spraying of insecticides inside houses (Indoor Residual Spraying, IRS; [32]) or in outdoor peri-domestic areas (i.e., space spraying; [33]). The relative impact of such approaches will depend on both the susceptibility of vectors to insecticides, and the degree to which they rest inside houses versus outdoors. Aedes aegypti is considered to be highly endophilic [34]; however they can bite outdoors and rest in outdoor peri-domestic areas [35]. Assessment of the degree of outdoor resting and environmental determinants of this behaviour could thus be useful in planning Aedes control.\nThe coastal region of Ecuador experiences a higher incidence of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV than the rest of the country [36]. Vector control in this region typically consists of the application of temephos to larval habitats, IRS with deltamethrin and ultra-low volume (ULV) fogging with malathion to target the adult mosquitoes [37]. Arboviral transmission is generally higher during the rainy season (December to May) but fluctuates within and between urban areas likely in response to local environmental factors [38,39]. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, abundance, and resting behaviour (indoor versus outdoor) of adult Ae. aegypti populations at the neighbourhood level within two coastal cities of Ecuador. Additionally, we tested for associations between estimates of adult Aedes abundance made using different trapping methods and locations (BG sentinel traps, Prokopack indoor and peri-domestic aspirations) and weekly dengue incidence; with the aim of assessing which method was most indicative of epidemiological risk.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nEthical approval was granted by the MVLS College Ethics Committee of the University of Glasgow (Project No.: 200150175), and by the Ethics Committee of Research on Human Beings of the San Francisco de Quito University (2016-146M).\n\n\nResearch permits\nA research permit was granted by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (MAATE) to the San Francisco de Quito University was given through the Framework Agreement on Access to Genetic Resources No. MAE-DNB-CM-2016-0052. MAATE also granted permission to transport the samples to the University\u2019s lab in Quito from Quinind\u00e9 (MAE-DPAE-2017-0427-O) and from Portoviejo (MAE-CGZ4-DPAM-2017-0588-O).\n\n\nStudy sites and period of study\nThe study coincided with the tail end of a major ZIKV outbreak that occurred throughout the Americas in 2015\u20132017; capturing the arrival of ZIKV into Ecuador in late 2016/early 2017. It was carried out in two cantons in coastal Ecuador: Portoviejo (1.0\u00b0S, 80.4\u00b0W), province of Manab\u00ed, and Quinind\u00e9 (0.3\u00b0N, 79.4\u00b0W), province of Esmeraldas (Fig 1A and 1B). In Ecuador, cantons are generally equivalent to cities and surrounding suburbs. The canton of Quinind\u00e9 is approximately 3,875 km2, with an estimated population density of 36.3 people/km2 in 2017 [40, 41]. Mosquito collections were conducted in the urban parish (Quinind\u00e9-urban) of this canton (Fig 1C). Portoviejo canton including the city of Portoviejo is approximately 960 Km2 with an estimated population density of 326.63 people/km2 (2017). Mosquito collections were conducted in the urban parishes of Andr\u00e9s de Vera, Col\u00f3n, Picoaz\u00e1, and Portoviejo; and the rural parishes of Abd\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n and Alhajuela.\n(a) Ecuador (highlighted in light blue) and its location in South America (South America background map layer was developed by ESRI, HERE, Garmin OpenStreetMap contributors and GIS user community [42], license public; Ecuador shapefile boundaries were taken from [43], whose licence is public domain; world map modified from [44], licence public domain); (b) location of the two cantons: Quinind\u00e9 (orange circle) and Portoviejo (green circle) situated in the Pacific coastal region (taken from [45], license CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication); (c) aerial view of Quinind\u00e9, with scale set at 2 km; and (d) aerial view of Portoviejo, with scale set at 3 km, with sampling points from urban (red dots) and peri-urban (blue dots) areas. Maps from panes (c) and (d) were taken from OpenStreetMap under the Open Data Commons Open Database License [46].\nPortoviejo sits at an altitude ranging between 30 and 150 m.a.s.l., while Quinind\u00e9 ranges between 80 and 130 m.a.s.l. Both settings experience a wet, warm season running from December to May (average monthly rainfall of 1600mm, ~26\u00b0C mean daily temperature) and dry, cool season from June to November (average monthly rainfall of 450mm, ~24\u00b0C of mean daily temperature).\nAedes vectors were sampled at households within urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods in each canton. Neighbourhoods are not officially defined but take their definition and delimitations from a cultural perspective and historical belonging from the local communities [47]. Neighbourhoods categorized as \u201curban\u201d were characterized by having households in a row-housing arrangement, usually organised in blocks surrounded by paved streets. Houses in urban neighbourhoods usually lacked open outdoor spaces like internal yards or gardens, and if present, these spaces were surrounded by walls. Neighbourhoods characterized as \u201cperi-urban\u201d were characterized by having fully detached houses scattered throughout the area, usually accessed by one main road. Wide lawn lots, crops and gardens surrounded peri-urban houses and properties were usually not limited by walls. Free movement of domestic animals between properties was possible in peri-urban neighbourhoods unless fences were present. Mosquitoes were sampled in each city over four periods between November 2016 and April 2017. Collection periods were approximately 45 days apart; with each consisting of three consecutive days of sampling. The first collection period in November fell within the dry, cooler season, with the others being the wet, warmer season.\nIn the last ten years, the two study sites have experienced a high incidence of arboviral diseases, with DENV occurring every year (Fig A in S1 Text). In 2016, both cantons experienced relatively similar DENV incidence (Portoviejo = 506.47 and Quinind\u00e9 514.31 cases per 100,000 population respectively), but in 2017 DENV incidence was considerable higher in Portoviejo than Quinind\u00e9 (355.58 versus 61.85 cases per 100,000 population, respectively). Zika cases occurred in both study sites in 2016, with cases being much higher in Portoviejo than Quinind\u00e9 (124.93 and 9.36 cases per 100,000 population, respectively (Fig A in S1 Text)).\n\n\nTrapping methods\nMosquito collections were carried out using methods that target different subgroups of adult Aedes: (1) BG-Sentinel (BGS) traps which target host seeking females (BioGents, Regensburg, Germany; Fig Ba in S1 Text); and (2) Prokopack aspirators that sample resting adults. BGS traps operate with a fan that pulls mosquitoes attracted by a lure into an internal collection bag [48]. BGS traps were baited with one BG-Lure cartridge and carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide was released by dry ice placed in a Coleman polyethylene cooler bottle (1.2 L capacity) placed inside traps. Baiting BGS with CO2 is known to increase their attractiveness to Aedes mosquitoes [49\u201351]. Prokopack (PPK) aspirators (John W. Hock, Gainesville, USA, [52]) were used to collect mosquitoes resting inside on house walls and ceilings, or in surrounding outdoor peri-domestic areas (Fig Bb in S1 Text). PPK are handheld aspirators that have an extendable 2-metre pole and an internal fan that pulls insects into a collection cup.\n\n\nExperimental design\nAt each site, four peri-urban and four urban neighbourhoods were selected for mosquito sampling (Fig 1C and 1D). Selection of the neighbourhoods was based on: (1) previously reported dengue cases, (2) presence of Ae. aegypti from previous government surveys, (3) informal recommendations from the local Ministry of Health personnel, (4) security and safety consideration and (5) access to logistics.\nOn each collection trip, mosquitoes were sampled from 24 households (three from each of eight neighbourhoods; in each canton). Different households from the same neighbourhoods were sampled on every collection trip; resulting in 12 households sampled in urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods on each trip (a total of 192 households sampled overall). On the first day of each collection period, houses were selected for sampling with assistance of a local guide; based on the availability of an outdoor area for peri-domestic sampling (garden/yard), residents reporting mosquito nuisance or recent arbovirus infection, and the willingness of residents to participate in the project (more information on the study design and selection of houses is in Fig C in S1 Text).\nWithin the three houses selected in each neighbourhood per field trip, one house was allocated for sampling with a BGS trap (daily collection for three consecutive days from the same house). BGS traps were set in the outdoor area and ran for an average of 9 hours daily (starting between 8\u201310 am, ending between 5\u20137 pm) to coincide with the known pattern of diurnal host seeking in Ae. aegypti [53]. Dry ice from the cooler bottles was replenished every morning. Mosquitoes were recovered from the traps at the end of each day with mosquitoes transferred into a plastic bag and placed in a cooler to kill them. Dead mosquitoes were transferred into 15 ml falcon tubes, pre-labelled with a unique code related to the sampling unit (trap type, date, trapping time, canton, neighbourhood type, neighbourhood name, and house ID) and stored in a cooler with dry ice for laboratory processing.\nSampling with Prokopack aspirators was conducted by two technicians for 10 minutes both inside and outside houses (between 10am and 5pm). One technician was randomly assigned to carry out aspiration indoors, and the other outdoors. Indoor aspirations were done by moving the aspirator nozzle along the walls, ceiling and under the furniture. Outdoor aspiration was carried out by aspirating along the outer sides of the walls, in external facilities like outdoor toilets, storage piles, garages, and laundry washing basins. Mosquitoes caught in Prokopack collection cups were transferred into 15 ml falcon tubes and placed in a cooler filled with dry ice to kill them.\n\n\nMosquito processing and identification\nMosquito specimens were stored in dry ice and transported to the Medical Entomology and Tropical Medicine Laboratory (LEMMT) at Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) for processing. At LEMMT, specimens were counted, sexed and morphologically identified to species or genus level using taxonomical keys [54\u201356]. Identification of male specimens of Cx. quinquefasciatus was not done based on terminalia features as described by Bram (1967) [57], but rather assumed from the external features of the thorax, abdomen, head and legs using taxonomic keys [54,55].\n\n\nEnvironmental and epidemiological data\nMicroclimate data were recorded using TinyTag Plus 2 TGP-4500 (Gemini Co., UK) data loggers. Loggers were tied and hung inside each BGS trap during sampling. Measurements of air temperature and relative humidity were taken every 15 minutes and used to calculate the mean value per day. Macro climate data was obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology of Ecuador (INAMHI); including daily temperature and precipitation data from meteorological stations in Quinind\u00e9 (M0156; 0.316\u00b0N, 79.469\u00b0W, 109 m.a.s.l.) and Portoviejo (M1208; 1.164\u00b0S, 80.390\u00b0W, 60 m.a.s.l.).\nWeekly epidemiological data of dengue fever cases were obtained from SIVE-ALERTA government monitoring system from the Ministry of Health of Ecuador. The reported date corresponded to when the patient reported the onset of symptoms. Case reports were collected through passive surveillance procedures based on reporting at public and private health facilities (HF) in Portoviejo (71 HF) and in Quinind\u00e9 (40 HF) [58]. Recorded cases of dengue were converted into incidence data by using population size of the given year from each canton as obtained from projections made by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses of Ecuador (INEC) [41].\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were carried out in R 3.5.0 and R Studio 1.1.419 using the packages \u201clme4\u201d, \u201ceffects\u201d and \u201cmultcomp\u201d [59\u201361]. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and General Linear Hypotheses tests (GLHT\u2013Post Hoc Tukey tests for GLMM) were used to assess variation in the abundance of Ae. aegypti females as a function of trap type (BGS, Prokopack-IN, Prokopack-OUT), location (Portoviejo or Quinind\u00e9), neighbourhood type (urban or peri-urban), month of collection (November 2016, January 2017, March 2017 and April 2017), and mean daily temperature (taken from INAMHI\u2019s weather stations). As mosquito abundance data were highly overdispersed, models were fitted with a negative binomial distribution [62]. Additionally, estimates of cumulative past rainfall were calculated (using data from INAMHI weather stations) and incorporated into models as a proxy of water availability during the larval development of Ae. aegypti adults caught in traps. Based on the known Ae. aegypti life cycle (Christophers 1960 [53]), adult females caught in a trap would have arisen from eggs laid ~16\u201339 days previously (Fig D in S1 Text); consequently the cumulative rainfall in the study area 3, 2 weeks and 1 week before collection were incorporated into models of adult abundance. Models also tested for interactions between month of collection and location, neighbourhood type and location, trapping method and location, neighbourhood type and trapping method, and mean daily temperature and location. Collection date, neighbourhood, house ID, and trap and collector ID were included as random effects. Initially, two model structures were built which differed in regard to how rainfall was included (1) the first model included all of the described explanatory variables, plus rainfall included at three different lags (Table A in S1 Text, Model 1). The second model structure was similar except that rainfall was included as only one covariate, representing the cumulative rainfall over the three-week period before mosquito collection (Table A in S1 Text, Model 2). Maximal models from both model structures were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [63]; with the model with the lowest AIC retained for further model selection to assess the significance of covariates through backward stepwise elimination using Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) [64].\nTo test the impact of microclimate (as measured at the trapping station) on the host seeking behaviour of Ae. aegypti, further analysis was conducted just on the subset of data from BGS traps where temperature and humidity were measured by TinyTag loggers (used in 3 out of 4 collection trips, in January\u2013April 2017). Here the response variable was the daily abundance of female Ae. aegypti, with the explanatory fixed and random variables used being the same as in the analysis of the full dataset except that the measure of mean daily temperature and humidity was obtained from dataloggers at the household rather than from weather stations. Additionally, interactions between temperature and humidity, temperature and location, and humidity and location were also included as fixed effects (Table A in S1 Text, Model 3).\nFinally, in order to test for a link between entomological and epidemiological data, weekly dengue fever incidence and mean Aedes abundance were estimated for that same week, and one and two weeks before the DENV cases were reported. Weekly data was standardized according to the corresponding epidemiological week (EW) defined by the World Health Organization [65]. First, mean weekly estimates of female Ae. aegypti abundance were obtained from collections made in Portoviejo and Quinind\u00e9 using GLMMs as described above. Here, female Aedes abundance was modelled as a function of EW of collection, canton, and mosquito trapping method (all fixed effects), with collection day, household ID and trap ID included as random effects. In scenarios where the 3 consecutive days of mosquito collections did not fall in the same epidemiological week, the assigned EW was that corresponding to two of the three days of sampling. The response variable was fit to a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion. Three separate Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to model dengue fever incidence as a function of female Aedes abundance during the same week of collection, and one and two weeks after the entomological surveillance took place. All figures were created using the packages \u201cggplot2\u201d and \u201cggpubr\u201d [66,67].",
    "Results": "A total of 3987 mosquitoes from 7 different genera were collected during the study. For full details of species and numbers caught, see Tables B and C in S1 Text.\n\nAbundance and behaviour of Ae. aegypti\nOf two alternative model structures compared for analysing variation in Ae. aegypti abundance (differing in how lagged rainfall effects were considered), neither had a clear advantage over the other (difference in AIC between the models was smaller than 2 units; \u0394 = 0.096) [63]. However, the model that incorporated rainfall as three separate time-lagged covariates had a slightly lower AIC and therefore was retained for further analysis and evaluation of covariates (Table A in S1 Text, Model 1).\nBased on this model, Ae. aegypti abundance was significantly associated with the month of collection (X2 = 10.11, df = 3, p = 0.02), cumulative rainfall 3 weeks prior to collection (28\u201322 days prior; X2 = 5.07, df = 1, p = 0.02), neighbourhood type (X2 = 8.60, df = 1, p<0.01), and the interaction between location (canton) and trap type (X2 = 19.83, df = 2, p<0.001; Table D in S1 Text). Ae. aegypti female abundance was significantly higher in March 2017 (wet, warm season) than in November 2016 (cool, dry season; Fig 2 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = 2.56, p = 0.04) and January 2017 (transition between cool, dry and wet, warm season; Fig 2 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = 2.88, p = 0.02). There was no difference in mean abundance between months of collections in the rest of the pairwise combinations.\nHeight of columns indicate the estimated mean of Ae. aegypti females per trapping collection, while error bars indicate the 95% CI. Different colours of bar represent different trapping methods, being BG-Sentinel trap (BGS), Prokopack aspirations made inside (PPK-IN) or outside of houses (PPK-OUT).\nThe abundance of female Ae. aegypti was approximately two times higher at households in urban than peri-urban neighbourhoods (X2 = 8.6, df = 1, p< 0.01, Fig 3 and Tables D and E in S1 Text).\nHeight of columns indicate the estimated mean of Ae. aegypti females, while error bars indicate the 95% CI. Different colours of bar represent a different neighbourhood type.\nThere was no consistent difference in Ae. aegypti abundance between cities; with the relative difference depending on the mosquito trapping method used (Table D in S1 Text). In collections made with indoor Prokopack aspirations, Ae. aegypti females were three times more abundant in Portoviejo than Quinind\u00e9 (Fig 4 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = -3.56, p<0.01), but there was no difference between cities in the number caught in outdoor aspirations (Fig 4 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = 0.87, p = 0.95). In Portoviejo, Ae. aegypti females were 6-fold higher in indoor versus outdoor Prokopack aspirations (Fig 4 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = -6.73, p<0.001), with no difference between outdoor and indoor collections in Quinind\u00e9 (Fig 4 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = -1.40, p = 0.72). The abundance of Ae. aegypti females in BGS traps was also similar in Portoviejo and Quinind\u00e9 (Fig 2 and Table E in S1 Text, GLHT Tukey: Z = 0.91, p = 0.94). BGS traps collected significantly more female Ae. aegypti than outdoor Prokopack aspirations in both cities (Fig 2 and Table E in S1 Text, Portoviejo: GLHT Tukey: Z = -3.90, p< 0.01; Quinind\u00e9: GLHT Tukey: Z = -4.07, p< 0.001); but were not significantly different from indoor Prokopack aspirations (Fig 2 and Table E in S1 Text, Portoviejo: GLHT Tukey: Z = 2.72, p = 0.07; Quinind\u00e9: GLHT Tukey: Z = -2.76, p = 0.06).\nHeight of columns indicate the estimated mean of Ae. aegypti females per collection, while the error bars indicate the 95% CI. Different colours of bar represent whether mosquitoes were collected in Prokopack aspiration made inside or outside of houses.\nFinally, there was a significant negative association between the cumulative rainfall occurring in the third week before collection (28 to 22 days prior) and the mean daily abundance of Ae. aegypti (Fig 5 and Table D in S1 Text).\nThe blue line indicates the estimated mean of Ae. aegypti females, while the grey shaded area indicates the 95% CI.\nRestricting analysis to the data set for which precise microclimatic measurements at trapping points were available (BGS collections, January to April 2017), the abundance of Ae. aegypti females also varied between collection months (X2 = 12.84, df = 2, p<0.01) by being higher towards April, and was similarly predicted to decrease in relation to rainfall (X2 = 8.68, df = 1, p<0.01) occurring 22\u201328 days before collections. However, there was no significant impact of local temperature or humidity at the trapping point (Table F in S1 Text).\n\n\nAssociation between Aedes aegypti abundance and dengue incidence\nDengue transmission occurred throughout both years of the study in each canton (Fig A in S1 Text). Incidence was high in both cantons in 2016, but with a pronounced decline in the second half of the year in Quinind\u00e9 compared to Portoviejo. In 2017, transmission remained high during the warm, wet season (Jan-July) in Portoviejo. DENV incidence in Quinind\u00e9 was much lower in 2017 than the previous year, and in comparison to Portoviejo.\nUsing these data, we tested for associations between mean Ae. aegypti abundance and DENV incidence on the same week of collections, and with Ae. aegypti abundance one and two weeks before the dengue reported case. These analyses generated contradictory results. Estimates of Ae. aegypti abundance derived from BGS (on same week) and outdoor PPK (on same week and one week before) were positively correlated with incidence, however abundance estimates from indoor PPK collections (on same week and one week before) were negatively correlated with incidence (Fig 6 and Table G in S1 Text).\nPredicted mean incidence of dengue fever in Portoviejo and Quinind\u00e9 during 2016 and 2017 given by female Aedes aegypti abundance.

    "Discussion": "Surveillance of Ae. aegypti vector populations was conducted in two urban hotspots of dengue transmission in coastal Ecuador with the aim of investigating drivers of local heterogeneity in abundance and resting behaviour. There was considerable heterogeneity in Ae. aegypti abundance and resting behaviour within the two study sites. Aedes aegypti were more abundant during the wet and warm months (March and April) than in cooler months of November and January. There was also substantial variation in Ae. aegypti abundance between neighbourhoods; with vectors being two times more abundant in urban than in peri-urban neighbourhoods. There was no consistent difference in vector abundance between cities due to an interaction between study site and trapping method. Specifically, while Ae. aegypti was much more abundant in indoor than peri-domestic resting collections in Portoviejo, this vector was similarly abundant in indoor and outdoor resting collections in Quinind\u00e9. Associations between mean Ae. aegypti abundance and weekly dengue incidence were varied and differed depending on the mosquito trapping method used. These results highlight the considerable heterogeneity in Ae. aegypti ecology and its predicted association with epidemiological risk in coastal Ecuador.\nAedes aegypti were most abundant in the warm and wet months (March and April), coinciding with the highest DENV transmission. This matches observations from the southern coast of Ecuador [68], and other countries where Ae. aegypti abundance peaks during the rainy and warm season [69\u201371]. Implementation of proactive vector control during the months before the Ae. aegypti peak may be most effective in these settings [1,4]. More extensive year-round vector surveillance over multiple years is recommended to confirm the repeatability of Aedes seasonality in these settings in coastal Ecuador, and plan vector control accordingly.\nClimate is known to be an important driver of Ae. aegypti population dynamics [72,73]. In contrast to previous studies, here we found no association between mean daily Ae. aegypti abundance and temperature and humidity as recorded at nearby weather stations. This lack of association could be due to the relatively low variation in these environmental variables over the sampling months. The only micro-climatic variable associated with Aedes abundance was cumulative rainfall occurring 22\u201328 days before sampling (negative association). The mechanism behind this negative association is unclear, but may be due to increased water storage during periods of low rain that creates more aquatic habitats for oviposition and larval developments [74].\nAs expected, Ae. aegypti females were also more abundant in urban than in peri-urban neighbourhoods. The ability of Ae. aegypti to adapt to urban environments is well known [15,75], with lower abundance in peri-urban areas likely due to the reduced availability of artificial container habitats for larvae [11,76]. Heterogeneity of living standards between urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods may also account for the variation in Ae. aegypti reported here. For instance, in these cities, households in urban neighbourhoods are often smaller and more economically-disadvantaged than those in peri-urban settings. Households in urban neighbourhoods had lower access to piped water resulting in a greater need to store water in large containers around homes, thus creating larval habitats [74\u201376]. Limited access to infrastructure in these neighbourhoods is further compounded by high population densities, providing ample blood feeding sources for Aedes females [34, 77\u201380]. Preferentially, targeting vector control to these high-density, economically-disadvantaged neighbourhoods may be more cost effective than a city-wide vector control approach [81]. However, Aedes vectors were also consistently found in peri-urban neighbourhoods, indicating these areas should not be ignored in surveillance and control activities.\nAspiration using Prokopack [41] or other methods [82] are highly efficient for sampling Ae. aegypti in urban areas; with densities typically being considerably higher in collections made inside houses than surrounding outdoor peri-domestic areas [32,34,83,84]. This observation was repeated in Portoviejo where estimated abundance of Ae. aegypti females was six times higher in aspirations made inside than outside, but not Quinind\u00e9 where abundance was relatively similar in indoor and outdoor collections. These canton-level differences might be due to a combination of factors including genetic variation in Ae. aegypti populations, their resistance to insecticides used indoors and others [85]. The notable difference in endophily between these two Ae. aegypti populations highlights the importance of studying local vector ecology as epidemiologically-relevant behaviours can vary even between similar urban settings.\nAlthough Ae. aegypti abundance is frequently assumed to be a proxy for DENV transmission (e.g., [86]), most vector indices are poor predictors of arboviral incidence [28]. The lack of concordance between vector density and human infection risk may be due to biases in Aedes sampling methods [29,85] which capture the abundance of different life stages but not direct biting rates on humans. Given the high expense and logistics involved with epidemiological monitoring in human populations, there would be great value in finding appropriate entomological indicators of risk. However, results from this study indicate that the association between Ae. aegypti abundance and dengue fever incidence differed among trapping methods. Weekly DENV incidence was positively associated with Ae. aegypti abundance as estimated from BGS traps and outdoor PPK aspirations made during the same week (and with counts from outdoor PPK aspirations made 1 week previously). However, DENV incidence was negatively correlated with abundance estimates derived from PPK collections made inside houses (both concurrently week or one week before dengue reporting). Despite the inconsistency of these associations, our results indicate the presence of predictive associations between Aedes abundance (trap-dependent) with arbovirus incidence [29]. Given the entomological (12 households/week) and epidemiological (city-wide) data were not collected at the same spatial scale, this evidence of even some statistical association is encouraging with respect to the use of entomological indicators of transmission. We encourage further investigation of the use of vector abundance data using different trapping methods, including in peri-domestic as well as indoor settings, to predict DENV incidence trends. Ideally future studies should also include finer-scale epidemiological data to facilitate geostatistical analyses of entomological and epidemiological variables over smaller and concurrent spatial scales.\nAn important limitation in our approach of testing entomological indicators of epidemiological risk was the lack of information on the infection status of mosquitoes. Dengue positivity in mosquito populations can be a strong predictor of the timing of local outbreaks [87]. Therefore, routine testing for arboviral presence would be useful to incorporate in future studies, ideally using low cost and simple infection detection methods such as the one used by Lau et al. [87,88]. Additionally, this study has a number of further limitations that require investigation. First, although this study was concentrated on the highest transmission period of the year (encompassing the rainy season of a ZIKV epidemic year, with active transmission of CHIKV and DENV), further surveillance into the dry season would be required to fully characterize seasonal dynamics and capture the extremes of environmental conditions which may impact Ae. aegypti populations. Year-round surveillance of Ae. aegypti populations over multiple years would be of great value. Longer-term surveillance would also permit more robust analysis of micro and macro climatic drivers of vector populations and DENV transmission. Furthermore, future studies would benefit from concurrent entomological and epidemiological surveillance (human case incidence) across the year, to provide a stronger foundation for assessment of the potential impact of vector control on human infection and disease. Finally, it would be useful to incorporate more detailed data on vector control practices at the neighbourhood and household level and how they relate to differences between Aedes vector populations.\nIn conclusion, our findings confirm that Ae. aegypti abundance is highly heterogeneous at the household and neighbourhood level and reveal unexpected heterogeneity in endophily; with differential use of indoor and peri-domestic resting habitats by Aedes at two urban sites. This behavioural variation highlights that applying vector control/spraying to cover peri-domestic areas could add considerable value in some but not all areas. In combination, these results identify the potential value of implementing tailored vector control activities based on the local ecological and environmental conditions."
