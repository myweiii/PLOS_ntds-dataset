Dengue virus is present in many parts of the world and has serious health and socioeconomic effects even in high-income countries, especially with rapid changes in the climate globally. In this study, we explored the literature on dengue vector control methods used in high-income, city settings and associations with number of human dengue infections, and the density of mosquitoes. We found 24 papers with relevant results. Most of these described studies in the United States or Australia. Most were about various forms of biological or chemical control of the mosquitoes. Few papers discussed effects on human dengue infection. We were unable to draw any clear conclusions on how effective mosquito control methods were as we could identify little research on this subject in this specific setting. More research is needed on this topic, particularly as climate change will make more areas of the world vulnerable to dengue infection.
