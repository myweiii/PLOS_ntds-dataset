Onchocerciasis is a disease caused by infection with the parasitic nematode, Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by blood-sucking blackflies, causing blindness, skin disease and epilepsy. The World Health Organization has listed the disease for elimination using the drug ivermectin, but the density of surveillance points necessary to ensure that elimination has been achieved throughout an area is not well understood.
Most of Burkina Faso became free from onchocerciasis after the regular application of insecticides to the blackfly breeding sites from 1975 to 1989. However, the South-West Region suffered a speedy recrudescence, probably because an insufficient number of monitoring sites were not representative of the situation throughout the whole area and blackfly control was stopped prematurely. Mass distribution of ivermectin was introduced in 1996 to control the recrudescence and CDTI in 2013 to eliminate transmission. The objective of this study was to carry out epidemiological surveys in 2011 and 2018 to see if ivermectin is reducing human infections and eliminating the recrudescence.
In 2011, 75% of villages still had some infections and the mean number of people infected across all villages was 2.63%. However, in 2018, only 31% of villages had any infections, with mean numbers infected across all villages of 0.37% showing that there is good progress towards elimination.
