Zika virus (ZIKV) remains an important public health concern. Estimating the true burden of the disease is a major challenge, often underestimated due to the substantial number of asymptomatic infections. Consequently, seroprevalence studies are valuable for determining the geographic extent of the virus, measuring levels of human immunity, and assessing potential infection-related risks. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature addressing the seroprevalence of ZIKV in asymptomatic individuals worldwide. The overall seroprevalence of ZIKV IgG antibodies was 21.0%, calculated based on 84 studies published between January 2000 and July 2023. Antibodies have been found in all WHO regions, but none in Europe, with rates ranging from 8.4% in Africa to 39.9% in America. Further standardized surveillance studies are needed to understand immunity per region and over time, evaluate vector dynamics, and assess the risk of future outbreaks.
