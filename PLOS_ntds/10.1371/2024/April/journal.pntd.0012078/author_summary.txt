After primary treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), relapse of disease occurs in a proportion of patients. Understanding parasite dynamics is crucial to improving treatment efficacy and predicting disease relapse at an early stage. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA loads in blood from East African VL patients from three clinical trials, treated with five different treatment regimens, were used to develop a semi-mechanistic model to integrate in vivo parasite replication in the host, parasite clearance by different VL drug regimens, and suppression of parasite regrowth by the host immune system after treatment. This model deepened our understanding of the parasite-drug-host interaction and described the in vivo parasite growth rate in human for the first time. Moreover, the model revealed that high blood parasite loads on Day 28 and Day 56 after start of treatment are an early indication for VL relapse, which could serve as a biomarker to predict long-term clinical outcome, an important new tool for optimizing future VL treatment regimens.
