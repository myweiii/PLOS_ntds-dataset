Tick-borne diseases pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, and their spread is being intensified by global climate change. The need for further research into the spatial distribution and influencing factors of ticks is becoming increasingly urgent. Our study compiled a comprehensive 60-year dataset on tick species distribution in Xinjiang to analyze trends and predict future distributions.
The study identified eight genera and 48 tick species across 108 cities and counties in Xinjiang, with Hyalomma asiaticum, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Dermacentor marginatus, and Haemaphysalis punctatus being the four dominant species. In addition, our study forecasts a northward expansion of suitable habitats for these species towards Altay and Tacheng Prefecture, with new suitability areas expected in Altay and the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The findings of this study provide a crucial map of tick distribution and offer valuable insights into future trends, serving as a valuable resource for tick monitoring and disease risk prediction in Xinjiang, particularly in light of the devastating effects of tick-borne diseases on human health.
