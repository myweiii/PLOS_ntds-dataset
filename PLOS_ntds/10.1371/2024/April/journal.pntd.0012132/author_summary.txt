Salmonella Typhi causes typhoid fever. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) S. Typhi is spreading globally. Local and regional surveillance of MDR S. Typhi populations using both blood culture and whole genome sequencing can uncover outbreaks and help mapping the spread of S. Typhi and resistance mechanisms, which, in turn, can guide both control and prevention efforts and clinical management. Data regarding the distribution of MDR S. Typhi genotypes and resistance mechanisms is scarce in Zanzibar, Tanzania, as in many other African countries. In this study we characterize S. Typhi phenotypically and genotypically. This study shows a high rate of MDR S. Typhi, hence few therapeutic options are available for treatment of typhoid fever in the study setting. Our findings contribute to the knowledge base on typhoid fever in the region and to guide correct treatment of individual patients and control of the disease.
