Vector control can play a major role in the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, leishmaniases and other vector-borne diseases. However, to reach its potential, national vector control systems should be adequately supported by vector surveillance, community participation and intersectoral collaboration. As a step towards strengthening vector control, it has been advocated that countries conduct a vector-control needs assessment. The authors reviewed the needs or gaps as perceived by stakeholders of disease vector control programs in eleven countries and subnational states in South Asia and the Middle East. Programs for control and elimination of malaria, dengue and leishmaniases had major shortcomings in vector surveillance and entomological capacity. This was a concern because vectors develop insecticide resistance which, if unchecked, could reduce the effectiveness of interventions. Also, attaining elimination of disease demands enhanced vector surveillance support. There were major gaps in community mobilization and intersectoral collaboration. The findings imply that vector control systems should adapt to the changing disease situation and adopt a cross-disease mandate. The authors propose improvements to the methods of needs assessment.
