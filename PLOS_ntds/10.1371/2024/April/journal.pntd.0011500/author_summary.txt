Recurrent exposure to parasites may influence the immune response to vaccines, especially in endemic African countries. In this study we aimed to assess the association between immune markers of helminth exposure and the immune response post-vaccination with the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen in African and European participants who participated in three international clinical trials. Seventy-eight (21.3%) of the 367 participants included in the study, had at least one helminth ELISA positive test at baseline with differences of prevalence between studies and an increased prevalence with increasing age. After adjustment for confounding factors, the study did not show a clear association between immunological markers of helminth exposure and the antibody concentration in response to the Ebola vaccine regimen.
