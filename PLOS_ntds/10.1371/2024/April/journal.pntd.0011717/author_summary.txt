Tropical islands are particularly vulnerable to leptospirosis outbreaks. Hot and rainy climate, abundance of reservoir species and outdoor lifestyle contribute to the high risk for human infection. These isolated areas also deal with difficulties associated with diagnosis because of low awareness of the medical staff, non-specific symptoms of leptospirosis and limited availability of laboratory testing. Leptospirosis remains poorly documented, and a better understanding of its dynamics and its climate drivers would help improve awareness and preparedness of the public health services. In this study, we provide a climate-based model of leptospirosis seasonal dynamics in 7 tropical islands. The use of climate variables from publicly available satellite data makes the model expandable to predict leptospirosis seasonal dynamics in other tropical islands where the disease is not routinely monitored. This study emphasizes the importance of rainfall and temperature in driving the seasonality of leptospirosis in tropical islands. However, climate alone did not appear to not be a sufficient indicator to predict interannual variations, suggesting that the risk of leptospirosis outbreaks must be refined, considering local specificities as the lifestyle and the very local environment.
