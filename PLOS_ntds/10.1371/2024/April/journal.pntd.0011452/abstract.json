    "Background": "Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasiteâ€“vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of the Y strain (T. cruzi II). To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on Y strain (T. cruzi II), but not on Dm28c (T. cruzi I), which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The lysis resistance observed in the Dm28c strain would be occurring at the DTU I level. T. cruzi I is the DTU with the greatest geographic distribution, from the south of the United States to central Chile and Argentina, a distribution that could be related to resistance to oxidative stress from vectors. Likewise, we can say that lysis against strain Y could occur at the level of DTU II and could be a determinant of the vector inability of these species to transmit T. cruzi II. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere."
