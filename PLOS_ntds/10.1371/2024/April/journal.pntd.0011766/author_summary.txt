Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and in Madagascar, where pregnant women are systematically excluded from prevention and control strategies. Our study shows the urgency for adapting public health strategies. We report a high prevalence of schistosome infection among pregnant women in Madagascar. The lack of systematic treatment for this vulnerable group can have a direct impact on the well-being of women and their offspring contributing to the vicious cycle of poverty perpetuated by schistosomiasis.
