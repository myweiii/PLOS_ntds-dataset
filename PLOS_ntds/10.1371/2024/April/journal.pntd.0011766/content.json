    "Introduction": "Women\u2019s health is among the priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since it has been shown that the well-being of women has a direct impact on other people, societies and the countries where they live [1]. Pregnancy, is considered a critical healthcare need of women, and the World Health Organization (WHO) states that \u201cWomen who remain healthy during pregnancy and after birth are more likely to stay healthy later in life and have better birth outcomes, influencing infancy, childhood and adulthood\u201d [1].\nGlobally, there are over 213 million pregnancies every year, of which an estimated 190 million (89%) occur in low-resource settings where the risk of poor birth outcomes is highest due to multifactorial risk factors including parasitic infections during pregnancy [2,3].\nSchistosomiasis is a parasitic infection highly prevalent in SSA where more than 90% of those requiring treatment live [4]. It is caused by different species of the trematode schistosome, of which S. mansoni and S. haematobium are the most frequent worldwide. Since the 2001 World Health Resolution calling for widespread treatment for schistosomiasis [5], the disease is receiving unprecedent attention from the global health community which targets the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030 through the recently released WHO 2021\u20132030 road map for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) [6]. To boost this goal, ad-hoc guidelines for schistosomiasis were launched in 2022 by the WHO where, on the basis of six specific recommendations, new strategies for the management of the disease are suggested [7].\nHistorically, schistosomiasis control strategies in highly endemic areas heavily relied on preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA) with 40 mg/kg praziquantel (PZQ) for school-aged children [8]. The recent WHO guidelines suggest treatment for all individuals above 2 years of age in highly endemic areas, including pregnant women after the first trimester, through the specific recommendation number one [7]. Despite this recommendation, and the growing body of evidence on poor pregnancy outcomes and lifelong effects on child\u2019s health associated with schistosome infection [9,10], pregnant women are still excluded from MDA programs [11]. However, the scarcity of data on treatment toxicity during pregnancy [12] still poses a barrier for MDA program expansion.\nAmong the affected countries, Madagascar has the fifth largest burden of schistosomiasis worldwide, with 106 out of 113 districts considered endemic for the disease. In the country, the two most frequent species of Schistosoma co-exist with a distinct geographical segregation locating S. haematobium in the western and northern regions of the island, while S. mansoni in the eastern and southern parts so as in the central highlands of the country [13]. MDA campaigns are regularly offered in the country but pregnant women are not yet targeted for treatment. Even if national guidelines allow schistosomiasis treatment for pregnant women laboratory diagnosed for the disease [13], in absence of integrated programs, i.e. through ante-natal care (ANC) services, the treatment is based on an out-of-pocket payment leading de facto to no treatment for this vulnerable group. Successful examples of ANC-integrated chemoprophylaxis for parasitic diseases come from the Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria for Pregnant Women (IPTp) that is being adopted for more than 30 years in endemic countries with solid data showing the impact on both women\u2019s and children\u2019s health [14,15].\nThe aim of the study was to provide further evidence to support the adoption of public health strategies targeted at pregnant women for the management and control of schistosomiasis in endemic areas. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of schistosome infection and identify factors associated with the infection among pregnant women in the rural highlands of Madagascar.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe freeBILy trial was implemented according to ICH-GCP guidelines in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and other legal and ethical requirements. The study protocol received approval from the National Ethics Committee of Madagascar (ref. no 022-SANP/CERBM of 05/03/2018) and the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg State Medical Chamber in Germany (ref. no PV5966 of 18/03/2019). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians (under 18 years old). Study participation was voluntary, participants had a right to withdraw from the study at any time. The reimbursement to travel from the residence to the PHCCs was the only financial incentive offered for participation.\n\n\nStudy design and target population\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted using baseline data on pregnant women enrolled in the cluster randomized controlled trial freeBILy (fast and reliable easy-to-use-diagnostics for eliminating bilharzia in young children and mothers) [16] (Pan-African Clinical Trial Register PACTR201905784271304), in which women, in the intervention arm, were treated with PZQ (40mg/kg) on site for schistosome infection following a Point-of-care Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) screening. The POC-CCA results were not used for the analysis of this study since for the purpose of the present study a more accurate and precise test was selected to describe prevalence [17].\nWomen aged 16 years old or more, with single or twin pregnancy, were recruited at routine ANC services during the second or third pregnancy trimester between April 2019 and February 2020 at one of 42 included Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs) located in the Itasy, Bongolava, and Amoron\u2019I Mania regions of Madagascar, both known to be endemic for S. mansoni. Excluded from the study were women having a history of congenital anaemia or blood transfusion (in order to exclude confounding factors for the primary outcome of the clinical trial freeBILy), epileptic or convulsive episodes (to prevent side effects after treatment with Praziquantel), fever at the day of recruitment (in order to limit the burden of possible overtreatment during pregnancy), as well as those who withdrew informed consent or did not have the urine sample for laboratory analysis.\n\n\nData and sample collection\nSociodemographic information, data on health status, previous clinical history and current medication intake were collected by trained health professionals at PHCCs using paper-based case report forms. Data was digitalized in REDCap [18] on the basis of a double data entry procedure and checked for completeness and consistency by a data quality manager.\nA urine sample was collected from each participant and stored on-site at room temperature for a maximum of seven days until transportation to the central laboratory, in order to decrease the deterioration of the samples. At reception at the central laboratory (Centre d\u2019infectiologie Charles Merieux\u2013CICM, Antananarivo), samples were aliquoted for long-term storage at -80\u00b0C [19].\n\n\nLaboratory testing\nThe upconverting reporter particle, lateral flow test detecting circulating anodic antigen (UCP-LF CAA) was used for the detection of the Schistosoma genus specific CAA antigen as marker of active infections, as described previously [19]. All urine samples were tested using the UCAAhT417 format [20]. Samples with known CAA-levels were included in the analysis to validate the test as well to quantify the CAA concentration in each sample.\nSamples were considered positive if the CAA concentration exceeded the cut-off of 2 pg/ml [20]. Post-testing quality control was performed by Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), developer and producers of the test. Any invalid result was excluded from the final analysis.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nParticipants\u2019 characteristics were summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and central tendency and dispersion statistics for numerical variables.\nPrevalence of schistosome infection with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was based on UCP-LF CAA test results and determined for the overall sample and stratified by participants\u2019 age, region of residence, urbanization, education level, working as a farmer, being the main contributor to the family income, ever being treated with PZQ, uptake of antimalaria preventive treatment and taking supplements during pregnancy.\nTo identify factors associated with the prevalence of schistosome infection crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% CIs were estimated using mixed-effect Poisson regression to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and variation across clusters (i.e. PHCCs) as a random effect.\nStatistical analyses were performed using the software Stata for Windows, version 16 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). The significance level was set at 5%.\n\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe compared the sociodemographic characteristics of women with and without UCP-LF CAA test results using chi-square test. Following this comparison, we developed a sensitivity analysis, based on standard methods [21], to estimate the possible prevalence range and change in aPR estimates under two assumptions: 1) all participants without UCP-LF CAA test results considered negative for schistosome infection and 2) all participants without UCP-LF CAA test results considered positive. A difference of\u2009>\u200910% between the original estimate and the one obtained in sensitivity analysis was considered as an indication of bias [21].",
    "Results": "Participants\u2019 characteristics\nFrom a total of 5,114 women recruited, 4,448 were included in the main analysis. The detailed participants\u2019 inclusion flowchart is shown in Fig 1.\nWomen included in the study were aged between 16 and 47 years, the mean gestational age was 24.7 weeks (SD = 1.9). The majority of women (70.4%, n = 3,133) resided in rural settings, 47.0% (n = 2,092) lived in the region of Amoron\u2019iMania, 39.5% (n = 1,758) of Itasy, and the remaining 13.4% (n = 598) of Bongolava.\nOf all women, 3.7% (n = 166) reported having no formal education, while 46.4% (n = 2,064) had secondary or higher education. Most of the participants were farmers (69.1%, n = 3,073), and 2.3% (n = 104) were the main contributors to the family income.\nRegarding the clinical history, 11.4% (n = 498) of pregnant women reported being previously treated with PZQ while 35.3% (n = 1,565) reported having used other anti-helminth medication (albendazole), 44.1% (n = 1,962) mentioned uptake of iron or folate supplements during pregnancy, and 30.7% (n = 1,364) the antimalaria preventive treatment. A minority (1%, n = 45) reported having health insurance (Table 1).\n\n\nPrevalence of schistosome infection\nOverall, the prevalence of schistosome infection among pregnant women of our sample was 55.9% (CI 95%: 53.3\u201358.5) (Table 2). Of those tested positive on site, 99.9% (n = 1801/1803) accepted treatment with PZQ.\nThe prevalence of schistosome infection increased with increasing age, ranging from 53.5% (CI 95%: 49.3\u201357.5) among women aged 16\u201320 years old to 61.8% (CI 95%: 58.1\u201365.3) among 30\u201347 years old. The proportion of positive for schistosome infection was 50.3% (CI 95%: 46.4\u201354.3) in Bongolava region, 56.1% (CI 95%: 52.1\u201360.0) in Amoron\u2019i Mania and 57.6% (CI 95%: 53.7\u201361.3) in Itasy. Moreover, we report a 54.4% (CI 95%: 52.1\u201356.6) schistosome positivity among women living in rural settings and 59.5% (CI 95%: 53.2\u201365.6) in peri-urban settings.\nConsidering socioeconomic status, we estimated a higher prevalence of schistosome infection at 62.7% (CI 95%: 53.8\u201370.7) among those with no formal education compared to those with primary school 55.5% (CI 95%: 52.5\u201358.4) or secondary/higher education 55.8% (CI 95%: 52.5\u201359.0). Prevalence estimates were 54.4% (CI 95%: 52.0\u201356.9) among women who reported farming as their main occupation and 50.0% (CI 95%: 42.6\u201357.4) in the group that contributed mostly to the family income.\nSimilar infection rates were estimated for women previously treated with PZQ and those without treatment (55.4% CI 95%: 49.4\u201361.3 vs. 56.1% CI 95%: 53.4\u201358.8) likewise infection rates stratified by another anti-helminth treatment with albendazole (56.0% CI 95%; 52.8\u201359.1 vs. 55.9% CI 95%; 52.5\u201359.2). A lower prevalence of schistosome infection was observed among those who reported uptake of antimalaria preventive treatment (51.3%, CI 95% 54.3\u201361.4 vs. 57.9%, CI 95% 47.1\u201355.6) (Table 2).\n\n\nFactors associated with schistosome infection\nAssociations between women\u2019s characteristics and schistosome infection status from the mixed-effect Poisson regression model are shown in Fig 2. After accounting for the effect of covariates, a statistically significant association was found with age group, indicating an increased prevalence in 31\u201347 years old, compared to 16\u201320 years old (aPR = 1.15, CI 95%: 1.02\u20131.29). Uptake of antimalaria preventive treatment (aPR = 0.85, CI 95%: 0.77\u20130.95), was associated with a decreased prevalence of schistosome infection. We observed no association between schistosome infection and other factors (region, urbanization, education, contribution to the family income, previous treatment with PZQ, uptake of iron/folate supplement and anti-helminth medication).\n\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe observed no differences in sociodemographic characteristics of women with and without UCP-LF CAA test results except in the distribution by the region of residence (S1 Table).\nTo assess potential bias in the reported estimates of the schistosome infection prevalence and the aPR due to the exclusion of 435 participants with missing UCP-LF CAA test results we performed a sensitivity analysis, as recommended in the literature [21]. Considering 435 participants with missing UCP-LF CAA test results as negative, we estimated the prevalence of schistosome infection of 50.9% (CI 95%: 48.5\u201353.4). Under the assumption of participants with missing UCP-LF CAA test results being all positive, the prevalence estimate was 59.8% (CI 95%: 57.3\u201362.3).\nThe aPR estimates were similar to ones from the main analysis under both assumptions, with the differences from the original estimates ranging from 0% to 6.3% (less than 10% for all variables).",
    "Discussion": "This cross-sectional study reports a high prevalence (55.9%) of schistosome infections in pregnant women in the highlands of Madagascar. These findings are in line with a recent study conducted in Madagascar [22] in the adult population and reporting prevalence above 50% in different regions of the country. Our data show an alarming gap in the accomplishment of two main SDGs and WHO targets\u2014the improvement of maternal health and the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem\u2014as pregnant women are still systematically excluded from schistosomiasis treatment in Madagascar as in many other endemic countries, despite WHO recommendations [7,11]. A recent meta-analysis reports an overall pooled prevalence of schistosomiasis in pregnant women of 13.2% in SSA, but also raised awareness about a lack of data on the determinants and outcomes of schistosomiasis during pregnancy [23]. Our study reports a high prevalence of schistosome infection among pregnant women (55.9%) in the highlands of Madagascar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed in the country on a wide territory spread over 42 different mainly rural communities in this specific population and the second [24] since the beginning of MDA in the country [25]. The previous study performed in pregnant women from samples collected in 2010, showed an overall prevalence of schistosome infection of 40.4% [24], however this was determined by a PCR-based detection method, and therefore a direct comparison with our CAA-based prevalence measurements is not appropriate. Additionally, our data show no relevant associations, apart from age and antimalaria preventive treatment, of any personal characteristics or contextual factors.\nConsidering that MDAs to control schistosomiasis started in Madagascar in 1999 [25], leastwise 82% of our study sample, who are younger than 30 years old, could have had access to PZQ treatment at least once in their lifetime. This aligns with the finding that women in the age group 31\u201347 (Fig 2) have a positive association with the infection. Similar findings have been described in the adult population of Madagascar [22], so as in other endemic countries [26\u201329], indicating that exposure to the parasite in adult life can have a critical role in the acquisition of the infection. Additionally, only the 11.4% reported to have received PZQ treatment in the past. Due to the self-reported nature of our question, we cannot exclude a reporting bias, nevertheless this data suggests that the coverage of MDA can be quite low even in those that attended school, which were almost all participants in our study. Additionally, the results of multivariable regression analysis showed that women previously treated with PZQ did not have a different chance to be actively infected with schistosomes. In this view, an active, structured and free of charge treatment in adult vulnerable populations should be considered in highly endemic areas, since adults remain clearly at high risk of infection without a concrete possibility of accessing schistosomiasis treatment. In 2018 the WHO, in the absence of solid data on safety and tolerability of praziquantel during pregnancy, suggested to treat those pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of schistosomiasis [30].\nAt the current state of the art, test and treat strategies for schistosomiasis are still hard to implement in highly endemic countries due to the limited diagnostic options. The gold standard diagnostic test for schistosomiasis according to the WHO is microscopy that proved to be cost-effective and sufficiently performant in endemic areas [17,31]. Unfortunately, in order to have good sensitivity, microscopy must be performed on samples collected over three consecutive days [32]. Moreover, even though the technique is applicable to rural contexts, it is still time-consuming meaning that the results would hardly be available the same day of a medical consultation i.e., for ANC services. Alternative diagnostic options, such as the point-of-care cathodic circulating antibody (POC-CCA) [33,34] exist but mostly the test is not registered as IVD (in vitro diagnostic) in many endemic countries complicating its use in routine practice outside of research contexts. A POC version of the UCP-LF CAA assay [35,36] is under development, but even if applicability will prove to be successful, its active adoption in clinical practice will require time.\nIn absence of an easy-to-use diagnostic test and given the high infection rates and the lack of association with any specific factors, our data support MDA for all pregnant women, as recently recommended by WHO. However, more data on safety and tolerability of praziquantel during pregnancy are crucial prior to encouraging this type of policy adaptation.\nIn our study population, among all women who were offered PZQ treatment, only 0.1% refused. Moreover, we observed a high uptake (30.7%) of preventive treatment (malaria) and (44.1%) supplement uptake (iron and folic acid supplements). In terms of compliance, MDA of pregnant women in highly endemic regions in absence of a clear diagnosis of infection seems feasible.\nSeveral studies have shown the benefit of IPTp programs in Malaria endemic regions [14]. Given that at the current state of the art, PZQ is donated to endemic countries from the WHO without limiting its use exclusively to school age children [7], the integration of PZQ into ANC packages should result in a minor investment for the health system that in exchange could benefit from a high health improvement of their populations. Treatment could be offered within the second trimester following the education sessions that are normally offered during ANC consultations. During these sessions women would have the possibility to ask questions about side effects, safety for the foetus so as get informed about the transmission of schistosomiasis.\nInterestingly, our association analysis showed a lower prevalence of infection among those women receiving malaria preventive treatment (51.3% vs. 57.9%, aPR = 0.85, CI 95%: 0.77\u20130.95). In the past few years, more than one study reported the possible efficacy of antimalarial drugs on schistosome infections [37\u201339]. The main concern of addressing schistosomiasis treatment with antimalarial drugs is associated to the risk of development of drug resistance for malaria [40], which is a more acute and deadly disease if compared to schistosomiasis. In the highlands of Madagascar, due to altitude and temperatures, malaria does not represent a major health issue since the parasite does not easily circulate [41]. It might be worth to further explore the pharmacological effect of drugs used for malaria IPT against schistosomiasis in order to evaluate the potential of its use in regions such as and similar to the highlands of Madagascar, where malaria does not represent a health concern.\nThe highly standardized study procedures (data collection and laboratory methods), a precise testing methodology, the continuing training of the staff and the quality assurance measures implemented as well as the large sample size allowed precise inference about the prevalence of schistosome infection during pregnancy in Madagascar. Despites the strengths listed above, our study does not come without limitations. Our sampling is limited to the highlands of Madagascar hence we cannot generalise the findings to the entire country since in the coastal areas there might be a different dynamic of transmission that could impact on the overall prevalence. Taken into account that data on clinical history were self-reported, we cannot exclude reporting bias for some of the variables discussed (i.e., previous exposure to PZQ). Additionally, in our sample we see a high frequency of women who completed at least primary education which does not reflect the average education level of the country [42]. This might be due to the fact that our recruitment occurred at healthcare facilities where access can be imbalanced in favour of more educated people, showing the potential for some selection bias. Finally, for some of the participants the UCP-LF CAA test results were not available potentially leading to biased estimates. Although we cannot exclude completely this possibility, the sensitivity analysis showed a low risk of bias, supporting robustness of our findings.",
    "Conclusions": "In conclusion, our study shows the urgency of treatment for pregnant women in highly endemic context supporting the adaptation of guidelines and policies in those countries where schistosomiasis is shown to be prevalent among adults. The prevalence among adults should be monitored more regularly in endemic countries in order to provide evidence to local stakeholders and policy makers for the need to adapt treatment and preventive strategies for the disease. Based on the findings of the present study, we strongly advocate for adapting schistosomiasis programs with the aim to integrate preventive schistosomiasis treatment in ANCs of highly endemic contexts. This, would contribute to both the WHO and SDGs agendas overall to improving the well-being of women and consequently breaking the vicious cycle of poverty perpetuated by schistosomiasis (Fig 3).\nCreated with Biorender."
