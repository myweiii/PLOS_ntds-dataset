Visceral leishmaniasis is a globally recognized neglected tropical disease, and Bangladesh is a major contributor of the global burden of this illness. In this article, we present a case on a 19-year-old immunocompetent female with pubertal delay, who has been diagnosed as a case of visceral leishmaniasis for 11 years and presented to us with recurrent relapses despite being treated with standard treatment regimens. The patient also developed functional hypopituitarism due to this chronic illness, which hindered her personal, familial, as well as social life. In scarcity of evidence of a standard treatment regimen for recurrent relapse cases, we treated her with high dose liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, along with secondary prophylaxis combining these two drugs with excellent result. Her pubertal delay was also addressed with utmost importance to re-establish her social confidence. This article could encourage physicians to outline an effective regimen to deal with these difficult-to-treat cases.
