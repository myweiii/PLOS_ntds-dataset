    "Introduction": "Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a skin disorder that mostly manifests among patients after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The disease is characterised by macular, papular, nodular, erythematous, or polymorphic rashes [1–3], and its incidence is estimated to range from 5–10% of treated VL patients in the Indian sub-continent (ISC) to 50% in Sudan [2]. It may also develop in asymptomatic carriers of Leishmania donovani [4]. Furthermore, an estimated 10–23% of diagnosed PKDL cases have no previous history of VL [5].\nGeographical differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics of PKDL cases have been reported [1]. Maculopapular rashes are seen in 90% of the cases in East Africa (EA), whereas macular rash is observed in a large proportion of the cases in the ISC [6]. Most PKDL cases in Sudan self-cure, while treatment is only recommended for chronic (> 6 months) and severe cases [7,8]. On the other hand, treatment is always required for a successful cure of PKDL cases in the ISC [1]. The recommended drug regimens for the treatment of PKDL in India are currently either miltefosine (MF) for 12 weeks or 60–80 doses of amphotericin B deoxycholate (amphotericin B) at 1 mg/kg body weight per day over four months [9]. In EA, treatment is initiated mainly in severe cases with either sodium stibogluconate (SSG) (20 mg/kg/day) for up to 2 months or a 20-day regimen of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) (2.5 mg/kg/day) [2,10]. However, these treatments are far from ideal in terms of safety, efficacy, adherence, and duration [2,11–13]. More recently, shorter regimens with LAmB used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs have been evaluated [14,15].\nPKDL is a public health problem in VL endemic areas as the PKDL skin lesions contain the parasite and can be an infective reservoir [16,17]. Therefore, prompt detection and treatment of PKDL cases are important for the control and elimination of the disease. Data generated from clinical trials and longitudinal studies serve as the backbone for evidence-based case management and help identify knowledge gaps to guide future research. Existing systematic reviews on efficacy studies of PKDL have so far focused on a limited set of therapeutic options [18], and to date, there has been no comprehensive systematic review to assess the landscape of prospective PKDL clinical studies aimed at describing drug efficacy. Poverty-related neglected tropical diseases such as VL and PKDL have historically received little research and development investment [15]. Consequently, these diseases which often impact people experiencing poverty are characterised by fewer studies, a smaller number of patients, and the small volume of generated data can remain in silos. The scarce data from completed PKDL studies remains an underutilised source of information that can help answer specific research priorities and identify knowledge gaps.\nThis systematic review aimed to systematically identify PKDL treatment efficacy studies in the literature and evaluate the feasibility of establishing a global PKDL individual patient data (IPD) platform. The specific objectives were:\n\nTo identify PKDL treatment efficacy studies (clinical trials and observational) and summarise the study characteristics.\nTo assess the technical feasibility of developing a global IPD database for PKDL, i.e., how much of the IPD are likely to be retrieved from the studies identified in this review.",
    "Material and methods": "Protocol and registration\nThe protocol for this scoping review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021295848) and was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic-Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines [19]. PRISMA-ScR checklist is attached as S1 File.\n\n\nInformation sources and search strategy\nA systematic scoping review of published literature was first conducted on 2nd June 2020 and updated in full on 3rd March 2023 by an expert librarian (EH) to identify PKDL efficacy studies by searching the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, WHO Global Index Medicus, PASCAL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Ovid Global Health, Cochrane Database, and CENTRAL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The database search used the query, “((Post-Kala-azar Dermal) OR pkdl)” which was kept broad to capture all relevant studies. Only prospective human studies with PKDL diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up measurements between 1973 and March 2023 were included. The search was not restricted by language of publication. The details of the search strategy used, and the time period of the search are presented in S2 File.\n\n\nEligibility criteria and study selection\nStudies in this review were screened in two stages, namely title and abstract screening and full-text screening, according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical trials and prospective observational studies, in which patients were treated for PKDL and followed-up, were eligible for inclusion. The inclusion of studies was not restricted by the age of patients, the drug regimen used as an intervention, the comparator used, the length of post-treatment follow-up, or treatment outcome to be able to include all relevant studies. The following formed part of the exclusion set: studies published as case-reports, case-series, retrospective studies, diagnostic or prognostic studies, cross-sectional studies, letters, and studies that included the wrong population (non-PKDL, non-human), were published before the year 1973, had duplicate records, and publications with full-texts not retrievable. See the PROSPERO registration (CRD42021295848) for complete eligibility criteria. All the articles were independently screened by two reviewers (AM, RK, SR, and SSP) in a blinded fashion using Covidence Systematic Review Software (RRID: SCR_016484; December 2022) [20]. Any disagreement was resolved through consensus with a third reviewer.\n\n\nData extraction\nVariable and data dictionaries with extraction rules were developed for constructing a REDCap (RRID: SCR_003445) electronic data capture tool [21,22]. From each of the articles deemed eligible for inclusion, the following variables were extracted: study title, publication year, country, study design, patient characteristics (age, gender), inclusion and exclusion criteria, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens, follow-up, efficacy endpoints, adverse events, and statistical methodology. The detailed metadata for the database is provided in S3 File. The REDCap extraction tool was piloted on 10% of eligible studies by two authors (CN, RK) to validate the database and extraction rules. Two authors (AM, RK) each extracted data from half of the eligible studies and cross-verified each other’s extraction. Extracted data from ten percent of the randomly selected article was verified by two additional authors (RC, SSP). Any discordances in data extraction were discussed for clarity and consistency with a third reviewer (PD, SSP) and resolved through consensus.\n\n\nData analysis and reporting\nDescriptive characteristics of the included studies were presented. Details of patient characteristics were reported, and the details of the treatment regimen administrated, including dosage and duration of treatment, were summarised. Descriptive analysis was carried out using R software (R Project for Statistical Computing; RRID: SCR_001905).\n\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nThe primary aim of this study was to systematically scope the literature on PKDL studies to gauge whether the establishment of a PKDL IPD platform is feasible. Meta-analysis of study results was not intended, and no specific clinical research questions were posed. Therefore, the results from this review are limited to a descriptive analysis of study and patient characteristics of identified literature, and risk of bias assessment is therefore not conducted.",
    "Results": "Search outcomes\nThe review identified a total of 3,418 records across the literature databases searched. After excluding 22 duplicate records, a total of 977 records were eligible for title and abstract screening. Of the latter, 514 records did not meet the eligibility criteria, leaving 441 records for full-text screening. After reviewing the full texts, 66 studies were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. Ten of the 66 studies are currently ongoing and remain unpublished, leading to a total of 56 unique studies describing 2,486 patients included in this review (Fig 1). One additional study was published after the literature search cut-off date of this review and another study is completed and awaiting publication. The identified studies are reported in Tables 1, 2 and 3.\nLegend: WHO ICTRP = World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. A separate search was carried out on WHO ICTRP as the server was unavailable during the time when other databases were searched.\n\n\nPublications by region and time-period\nOf the 56 included studies, 36 (64.3%) were from India (1983–2022), 12 (21.4%) from Sudan (1992–2021), 6 (10.7%) were from Bangladesh (1991–2019), and 2 (3.6%) from Nepal (2001–2007) (Fig 2). Overall, these studies enrolled 2,486 patients, of which 1,512 (60.8%) were from India, 662 (26.6%) were from Bangladesh, 265 (10.7%) were from Sudan, and 47 (1.9%) were from Nepal. There were no studies identified between 1973–1980, 5 (8.9%) studies were published between 1981–1990 (n = 193 patients), 10 (17.9%) between 1991–2000 (n = 230 patients), 10 (17.9%) between 2001–2010 (n = 198 patients), and 31 (55.4%) from 2011 onwards (n = 1,865 patients) (Fig 2).\n\n\nStudy design\nOf the 56 studies included, 8 (14.3%) were randomised studies (1987–2021) and the remaining 48 (85.7%) were non-randomised studies (Fig 2). Of the 8 RCTs (n = 386 patients), 1 was an open label trial, 1 was single blinded and blinding was not stated in the remaining 6 trials. The median number of patients recruited per study across 8 RCTs and 48 non-randomised studies were 33 (range 10–108) and 26 (range 2–280), respectively. The median post-treatment follow-up duration was 365 days (range: 90–540 days) in 8 RCTs and 360 days (range: 28–2,373 days) in 48 non-randomised trials (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n\nPatient characteristics\nOverall, patients of all age ranges were enrolled in 28 (50.0%) studies, only adults (15+ years) were enrolled in 4 (7.1%) studies; and the age range of the patients included was not clear in the remaining 24 (42.9%) studies. The age-range of the patients included in the studies is depicted in Fig 3, for the 32 studies on which the age range data was presented. The gender distribution of the study population by study type is presented in Fig 3. Of the 2,486 patients enrolled, 1,270 were males, 650 were females and gender were not stated for the remaining 566 patients. The median proportion of males enrolled was 73.7% [range: 4.4%-100%] in 48 observational studies and 70.3% [range: 48.0% -90.0%] in 8 RCTs. None of the studies explicitly reported enrolling PKDL patients with HIV, pregnancy, para kala-azar, or any other comorbidities and it was unclear if they were excluded. Previous treatment for VL was clearly confirmed in 203 (52.6%) of the 386 patients enrolled in 8 RCTs and 936 (44.6%) of the 2,100 patients enrolled in 48 non-randomised studies.\nLegend: The vertical dotted line presents age of 5, 10, and 15 years respectively. Each row represents a single study.\n\n\nDiagnostic methods\nOnly clinical criterion was adopted as a diagnostic method for disease identification in 3 (5.4%) nonrandomised studies, a mixture of clinical and parasitological demonstration in 48 (83.9%) studies on the whole, and the diagnostic method was unclear in 7 (10.7%) nonrandomised studies (Table 4). Overall, 43 (76.8%) studies used one or more laboratory tests for confirmed PKDL diagnosis in addition to clinical presentations (Table 4). All randomised clinical trials used one or more confirmatory tests for PKDL diagnosis. Microscopic demonstration of amastigotes in skin biopsies (slit or snip skin smears) in addition to other methods (clinical, serological, PCR, or culture) was used in 37 (66.1%) studies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in 20 (35.7%) studies, while serological test was used in 27 (48.2%). A further breakdown of the diagnostic methods used over time-period is presented in Fig 4.\nLegend: The number of studies is non-unique as a single study can contribute to multiple categories. See Table 4 for different combination of diagnostics methods adopted.\n\n\nDrug regimens\nThirteen different treatment regimens were adopted across 82 treatment arms. Details of treatment regimens at study arm levels were available for only 1,876 patients and it was missing for the remaining 610 patients. The most widely used drug regimen was miltefosine which was administered to 636 (33.9%, 636/1,876) patients followed by liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) (n = 508/1,876, 27.1%), sodium stibogluconate (n = 268/1,876, 14.3%), sodium antimony gluconate (n = 186/1,876, 9.9%) and 10 other drug regimens, all them enrolling less than 60 patients (Table 5; Fig 5).\nSAG = sodium antimony gluconate; SSG = Sodium stibogluconate; L-AmB = Liposomal Amphotericin B; AMBd = Amphotericin B deoxycholate.\nSix different drugs were tested in three combination therapies: liposomal amphotericin B + miltefosine (n = 16/1,876, 0.9%), terbinafine + itraconazole (n = 9/1,876, 0.5%), and sodium antimony gluconate + ketoconazole (n = 5/1,876, 0.3%). Vaccine as a therapy was tested among 54 (2.9%) PKDL patients in two studies from Sudan. ‘No treatment’ as a natural healing effect was used as a comparator arm, including 8 (0.4%) PKDL patients in one study.\nThere was variation in daily mg/kg dose and overall treatment duration within the same regimen (Fig 6). L-AmB was tested at a total dose of 15 mg/kg over 3 weeks in 1 study (n = 280 patients), 30 mg/kg over 3 weeks in 3 studies (n = 118 patients) and a total dose of 50 mg/kg in 1 study (n = 12 patients). Miltefosine was tested at 100 mg/day for 3 months in 4 studies (n = 176 patients) with dosage ranging from 100–150 mg/day over 2–4 months period, while the daily target dose of antimony regimens ranged from 10–20 mg/kg/day over 1 to 4 months period (Fig 6).\nSAG = sodium antimony gluconate; SSG = Sodium stibogluconate; L-AmB = Liposomal Amphotericin B.\n\n\nAssessment of cure in RCTs (n = 8 studies)\nThree RCTs clearly defined the initial cure criteria used; all these included disappearance/clearance or regression of lesions at the end of the therapy while the remaining 5 studies didn’t explicitly state the criterion for initial cure (Table 1). Final cure (or cure) was defined as complete disappearance of the lesions in 1 study, complete disappearance of the lesions along with parasite score of 0 in 4 studies, as absence of relapse in 1 study, and the definition was not clear in the remaining 2 studies (Table 1). Details regarding the proportion of patients who achieved initial and final cure are presented in Table 1, when reported.\n\n\nAssessment of cure in non-randomised studies (n = 48 studies)\nOf the 48 non-randomised studies, only 3 (6.3%) studies clearly defined initial cure (as clinical improvement by days 30 and/or 90 from treatment onset) and 19 (39.6%) studies clearly defined the criteria used for assessment of the final cure (Table 2). All 19 studies required complete or partial regression/healing of lesions for achieving cure with 5 studies explicitly requiring complete healing of lesions and 2 studies additionally requiring negative (or negligible) parasitaemia using PCR (Table 2).\n\n\nReporting of safety data (n = 56 studies)\nAdverse treatment outcomes were reported in all 8 RCTs. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, was used in 3 RCTs and the AE methodology, criteria and terminology was not clear in 5 RCTs. Of the 48 non-randomised studies, CTC-AE was used in 5 studies and not reported in the remaining 43 studies.",
    "Discussion": "This review identified 56 studies (2,486 patients) published in the past 50 years describing the efficacy of drug regimens adopted for treatment of PKDL. Of these, only 8 studies representing 15% of the enrolled PKDL patients were from randomised clinical trials. Despite the fact that PKDL is a potential reservoir of infection [16,23] with more than 700 to 2,322 cases reported annually (2014–2021) [23], identification of only 8 RCTs studies suggests a relatively limited evidence base supporting treatment recommendations. This review also identified that there were a limited number of studies among children (in studies that reported patients’ age-range) with an evident male preponderance (male: female ~ 2:1) among enrolled patients; this is consistent with published literature on PKDL and VL [24–26]. None of the 56 studies included in this review enrolled pregnant or lactating women. In general, PKDL in pregnancy has been described only in sporadic case reports in the literature [27]. Similar observations were found for the treatment of VL in pregnancy [28]. Finally, none of the studies identified enrolled patients with HIV or other comorbidities. Although these comorbidities are commonly reported in visceral leishmaniasis [29,30], these conditions have been less pronounced with PKDL, and only sporadic cases have been reported across India, Africa, Europe, and South America [31–33]. Overall, these observations regarding the patient spectrum show substantial knowledge gaps in treatment efficacy in these specific subpopulations.\nOf the 48 observational studies, three (125 patients) studies did not require any confirmatory tests for the PKDL diagnosis. All the RCTs used one or more laboratory tests for the PKDL diagnosis. Serological tests (antibody detection) were used in six studies involving 471 patients, although such tests are not deemed adequately reliable in this context as there can be substantial false-positive test results due to past VL infection and antibody cross-reactivity [34]. Serological tests started to be adopted for diagnosis after the 1990s and have continued to be implemented in PKDL studies, particularly, in combination with microscopy and clinical criterion. The rK39 rapid immunochromatographic test was the most common serological test used while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the direct agglutination test were also reported. Microscopic demonstration of amastigotes in skin biopsies (slit or snip skin smears) was adopted throughout the time-period included in this review. In 20 of the 31 studies published after 2010, PCR method has been used, particularly in combination with microscopy. However, the choice of PCR types (nested, quantitative, etc.) and target genes (ITS-1, K-39) varied substantially across studies.\nFollowing enrolment of patients in 82 arms across 56 studies, 13 different drugs were used for treatment with more than 85% of the patients treated with three major drugs: liposomal amphotericin B, miltefosine, and pentavalent antimony. However, even for these major drugs, there was a wide variation in daily mg/kg dose and overall treatment duration. The adoption of drug regimens was also highly regional. Miltefosine and L-AmB were adopted in the Indian subcontinent, whereas pentavalent antimony was the major drug used in Sudan. Following the completion of the treatment regimen, there was also variation in the time-point of assessment of cured proportion, including differences in criterion used for defining cure. In general, the most common definition of initial cure was parasitological clearance after treatment completion with or without clinical resolution of lesions at the planned end of the completion of the treatment regimen. Similarly, complete resolution of lesions with parasitological clearance at the time of final assessment (actual time-point of evaluation varied) was the most common definition of final cure.\nOverall, this review has characterised the variation in different aspects of study design, conduct, analysis, and reporting. For example, the outcome definitions adopted for efficacy assessments were presented in only a third of the studies, the age-range of the patients included was not reported in 43% of the studies while the diagnostic method for disease confirmation was unclear in 11% of the studies. This heterogeneity acted as a limitation to perform a direct comparison of results across the studies using the published aggregated data. Similarly, criteria used for gradation of the severity of safety outcomes were not reported in the majority of the studies included; an observation consistent with the VL literature [35]. Taken together, this warrants harmonisation of the definitions and protocols adopted across future studies for facilitating robust reporting of the efficacy and safety studies of PKDL. Besides, a scope for harmonisation of these aspects in the existing data can be exercised through IPD data platform.\nSimilarly, the median sample size recruited across 8 RCTs and 48 non-randomised studies were 33 (range 10–108) and 26 (range 2–289), respectively. This suggests that existing practice on the patient treatment of PKDL relies on evidence from relatively small studies. Such small study size including wide variations in the regimens adopted across the studies limits the possibility of robust assessment of efficacy and to identify determinants of poor treatment outcomes in any single study. Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses are a proven methodological approach to address some of the limitations of classical aggregated meta-analyses [36–38]. A harmonised repository of raw data from the studies identified in this review can facilitate IPD meta-analyses to generate new evidence regarding the efficacy of existing medicines in sub-groups of patient population. Understanding the existing volume of data was a crucial first step towards determining the feasibility of establishing an IPD data repository for PKDL. First, over half of the studies on PKDL were published in the last decade. The data from these recent studies are more likely to be retrievable than the older studies. Second, the identified volume of existing data on miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B in the trials (>500 patients in total) (these new regimens were mostly tested in studies after 2000) suggests that creating an IPD platform for these two important drug regimens would be valuable. For studies investigating treatment regimens with fewer numbers of enrolled patients, such as paromomycin, assembling the raw IPD across multiple studies could help to provide further information on these regimens. Finally, a new large study has been published since the completion of this review [39], which can be incorporated in the future update of this systematic review.\nThe Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) has an established experience in the development of an IPD repository for VL and other infectious diseases, including but not limited to malaria [WWARN], Ebola Virus Disease and COVID-19. These IDDO repositories have facilitated large scale IPD meta-analyses exploring the determinants of therapeutic efficacies [40–42]. To maximise interoperability and reusability of data, IDDO has adopted the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) compliant data standards [43]. As an important step towards the development of a PKDL data platform, the IDDO VL data platform already hosts a critical mass of data from efficacy trials in VL conducted over the past 20 years and hence has the technical and infrastructural framework to support the development of a PKDL data platform. Based on the identified volume of data with a substantial number of studies being relatively recent, and initial sharing of datasets from some key PKDL studies to the IDDO VL data platform suggests that establishment of a PKDL data platform is feasible. Such a platform can facilitate collaborative research to answer questions of public health relevance and maximise the usefulness of existing data and promote data re-use. The unique resource that would be created by a harmonised database of IPD from the identified studies would allow us to answer issues of public health concern that could not be answered through standalone trials or aggregated published data.",
    "Conclusions": "An IPD platform would have enough data on the three main medications (miltefosine, L-AmB, and pentavalent antimony) if the number of patients from nonrandomised studies were pooled, despite the fact that this review found insufficient patient volume across randomised clinical trials. With the help of relevant stakeholders, the global PKDL community, and sufficient financing, a PKDL IPD platform can be realised. This will allow a nuanced exploration of the safety and efficacy of PKDL drugs which can potentially guide future clinical practices."
