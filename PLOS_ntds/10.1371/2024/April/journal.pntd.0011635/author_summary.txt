Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a dermatosis which mostly manifests after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and is characterised by macular, papular, nodular, erythematous, or polymorphic rashes. PKDL is a public health problem in VL endemic areas, as recent infectivity studies show that L. donovani parasites can be found in PKDL lesions and remain infectious to sandfly vectors. There are numerous gaps in our existing knowledge of PKDL, including its pathology, immunology, and risk factors associated with therapeutic outcomes. Currently recommended treatments are either expensive (liposomal amphotericin-B), have raised safety concerns (especially for antimony regimens), or require long treatment duration (e.g. miltefosine). In order to scope the measure of evidence supporting therapeutic efficacy recommendations for PKDL patients, we conducted a systematic literature review. Our systematic review identified 56 PKDL studies describing 2,486 patients, with a majority of the studies (31 studies and 1,865 patients) published from 2010 onwards. The Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) already have an established data platform for VL, and the IDDO VL data platform currently hosts a critical mass of data from efficacy trials in VL conducted over the past 20 years. Based on the identified volume of data, with a substantial number of studies being relatively recent, we believe that the establishment of a PKDL data platform is feasible. Creating a platform to facilitate the sharing of the datasets would enable in-depth IPD meta-analyses with existing data to address several knowledge gaps of PKDL and guide future research priorities. With the help of relevant stakeholders, the global PKDL community and sufficient resources, a PKDL data platform can be realised and help address key research gaps.
