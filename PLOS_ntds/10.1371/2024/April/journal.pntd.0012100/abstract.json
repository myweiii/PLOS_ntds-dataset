    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family, is the causative agent of Zika fever, a mild and frequent oligosymptomatic disease in humans. Nonetheless, on rare occasions, ZIKV infection can be associated with Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS), and severe congenital complications, such as microcephaly. The oligosymptomatic disease, however, presents symptoms that are quite similar to those observed in infections caused by other frequent co-circulating arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV). Moreover, the antigenic similarity between ZIKV and DENV, and even with other members of the Flaviviridae family, complicates serological testing due to the high cross-reactivity of antibodies. Here, we designed, produced in a prokaryotic expression system, and purified three multiepitope proteins (ZIKV-1, ZIKV-2, and ZIKV-3) for differential diagnosis of Zika. The proteins were evaluated as antigens in ELISA tests for the detection of anti-ZIKV IgG using ZIKV- and DENV-positive human sera. The recombinant proteins were able to bind and detect anti-ZIKV antibodies without cross-reactivity with DENV-positive sera and showed no reactivity with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)- positive sera. ZIKV-1, ZIKV-2, and ZIKV-3 proteins presented 81.6%, 95%, and 66% sensitivity and 97%, 96%, and 84% specificity, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of the designed and expressed antigens in the development of specific diagnostic tests for the detection of IgG antibodies against ZIKV, especially in regions with the circulation of multiple arboviruses."
