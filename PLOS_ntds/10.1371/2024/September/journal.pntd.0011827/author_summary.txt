The malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is an invasive species in Africa where it threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread throughout the continent. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa through maritime trade and therefore may be at risk of An. stephensi introduction and establishment. Mauritius implemented a One Health approach, enhancing entomological surveillance at entry points and collaborating across sectors (e.g. veterinary services, sea and airport authorities, national parks and conservation, communities, etc.) conducted extensive integrated vector surveillance, inspecting 85,071 larval habitats, and analyzing 8,428 adult mosquitoes morphologically and molecularly. Although An. stephensi was not detected, the initiative catalyzed and strengthened multisectoral partnerships nationally and across the Indian Ocean region member states (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, RÃ©union Island and Seychelles). Leveraging the threat of An. stephensi, Mauritius exemplifies utilizing existing capabilities to create multisectoral networks for effective vector surveillance and response.
