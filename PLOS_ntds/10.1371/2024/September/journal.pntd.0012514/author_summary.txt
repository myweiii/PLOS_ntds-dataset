In this study the odour of bacteria that cause Buruli ulcer was examined. First, the air of bacteria cultured in the lab was analysed and compared with controls. Next, air was sampled from gauzes worn by people in the Kongo Central province, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their lesions were compatible with Buruli ulcer disease but only 12 out of 50 were infected with the Buruli bacterium. In the odour of the Buruli bacteria and in gauzes from people with Buruli ulcer, several chemicals were present more abundantly than in gauzes from people with wounds caused by other diseases. Future research has to determine whether these chemicals can become part of a new test for Buruli ulcer disease.
