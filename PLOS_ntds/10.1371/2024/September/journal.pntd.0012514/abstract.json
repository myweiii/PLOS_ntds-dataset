    "Abstract": "Diagnosing Buruli ulcer (BU) is complicated by limited access to the sensitive IS2404 qPCR. Experienced clinicians report a distinct odour of Buruli ulcers. We explored the potential of headspace analysis by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from Mycobacterium ulcerans both in vitro and clinically."
