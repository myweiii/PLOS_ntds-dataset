Urogenital schistosomiasis or bilharzia is caused by blood flukes transmitted in the urine. These parasites require compatible freshwater snails to develop and infect humans who come in contact with contaminated water. The adult females release thousands of eggs into the urinary tract, which may cause bloody urine, obstruction of urine flow, and many other urinary tract diseases. As in other developing countries, urogenital schistosomiasis is an important issue in Mauritania, where most previous studies on this disease have been concentrated along the Senegal River, the only permanent river in the country. In this work, we chose two places where schistosomiasis has never been studied before: Kankossa, where there is a permanent lake, and Oued Rawdha, where temporary ponds are present during part of the year. We found that 26% of school children had Schistosoma eggs in their urine, more in boys than girls, and more in younger children (6â€“8 years old) than in older children. We also identified the snail species responsible for disease transmission in these two sites. These data would be useful to organize mass treatment with appropriate medicines, kill the snails, disseminate the information to prevent community members from urinating in water bodies, and improve sanitary conditions.
