The BS90 population of snails used in this study were originally provided to the Anderson lab by the NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center of the Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland through NIH-NIAID contract HHSN272201000005I for distribution through BEI Resources. PacBio library preparation and/or PacBio sequencing was done by the Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS) Core Facility at Oregon State University, and the University of Oregon Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility. Illumina sequencing was done at the CQLS. Work at Texas Biomedical Research Institute was conducted in facilities constructed with support from Research Facilities Improvement Program grant C06 RR013556.
