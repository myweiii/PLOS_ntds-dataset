    "Abstract": "The trematodes that cause schistosomiasis in humans require aquatic snails as intermediate hosts. Identifying the genes in snails at which allelic variation controls resistance to infection by schistosomes could lead to novel ways to break the cycle of transmission. We therefore mapped genetic variation within the BS90 population of Biomphalaria glabrata snails that controls their resistance to infection by the SmLE population of Schistosoma mansoni. A marker in the PTC2 genomic region strongly associates with variation in resistance. The S-haplotype, which confers increased susceptibility, appears to be almost completely dominant to the R-haplotype, which confers increased resistance. This result suggests a model in which the parasite must match a molecule on the host side to successfully infect. The genomic region surrounding our marker shows high structural and sequence variability between haplotypes. It is also highly enriched for genes that code for single-pass transmembrane (TM1) genes. Several of the TM1 genes present on the S-haplotype lack orthologs on the R-haplotype, which makes them intriguing candidate genes in a model of dominant susceptibility. These results add to a growing body of work that suggests TM1 genes, especially those in this exceptionally diverse genomic region, may play an important role in snail-schistosome compatibility polymorphisms."
