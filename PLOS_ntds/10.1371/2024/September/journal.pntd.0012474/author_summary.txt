Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of humans that is caused by trematodes in the genus Schistosoma. Schistosomes require aquatic snails as an intermediate host. Infected snails shed parasites into water, which then infect people through their skin. Biomphalaria glabrata host snails show substantial genetic variation for susceptibility to infection by Schistosoma mansoni. Via genome-wide mapping we identified the general location of a gene in the B. glabrata genome at which different alleles control whether snails can be infected or not. The allele that causes susceptibility is dominant to the allele that causes resistance. This uncommon pattern suggests that an invading parasite must match some target on the host side to successfully establish an infection. The mapped snail genomic region contains multiple genes that code for proteins that span cell membranes. These proteins have an extracellular piece that can interact with molecules outside of cells. We hypothesize that these proteins are the targets of molecules produced by the schistosome. If so, then identifying the interacting molecules on the schistosome side, and how they interact with snail proteins, might reveal ways we could genetically modify snails to make them unable to transmit schistosomes to humans.
