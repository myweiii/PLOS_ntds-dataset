Lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are major neglected tropical diseases that have been targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Elimination campaigns for these infections using mass drug administration have had a huge impact in Africa. However, they face a major challenge in 11 countries in Central Africa where there is co-endemic loiasis, another filarial infection caused by the parasite Loa loa. The anti-filarial medication ivermectin that is used in elimination programs can cause serious and fatal adverse drug events in people with heavy loiasis infections, or high blood microfilarial counts. These programs would benefit from practical and affordable screening tests to detect people at high risk of adverse events from ivermectin. Furthermore, loiasis itself causes a variety of negative health outcomes and improved diagnostic tests would help control this infection. Here, we report the development of a sandwich immunoassay that detects the L. loa protein Ll-Bhp-1 in human serum samples. This assay is specific for L. loa infection and is highly sensitive in people with high microfilarial counts. Further work is needed to refine this prototype test and to determine whether antigen testing for loiasis can facilitate filarial eliminations efforts in Central Africa.
