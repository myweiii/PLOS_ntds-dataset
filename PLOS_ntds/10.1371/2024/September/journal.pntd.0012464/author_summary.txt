Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease estimated to affect 250 million people worldwide and causing severe morbidity in endemic countries. The transmission of Schistosoma is complicated by the multiplication of parasites within freshwater snails that act as obligate intermediate hosts. Rapid rebound of infection after mass treatment is commonly observed, as well as stable low transmission. Several mathematical models are currently employed to inform policy decisions, building on the predominant assumption of worm-level regulation through density-dependent egg production. We explored the interplay of different regulating mechanisms assumed at worm-, human-, and snail-level and their ability to explain observed epidemiological patterns. To this end, we developed SchiSTOP, a new modelling framework for S. mansoni transmission dynamics and considered 162 model variants. Results show that snail-level regulation is required to explain stable low transmission, while the combination of snail- and human-level regulation is necessary to reproduce a rapid rebound after control. We further show that assumptions on the regulating mechanisms heavily influence conclusions about the feasibility to reach control targets. In particular, the models that successfully explain observed patterns for S. mansoni suggest that achieving control targets solely through mass drug administration may be more challenging than currently thought.
