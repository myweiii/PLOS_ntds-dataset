Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. This disease remains a significant global health concern in many parts of the world. Traditional diagnostic methods include serological tests. However, these tests have major limitations due to their low sensibility and high false-positive rates. This poses a significant challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for careful interpretation of test results and the development of more specific diagnostic tools. In this study, we assess the utility of traditional and easily accessible serological tests. Instead of using them individually, we decided to integrate the results of these multiple testing methods. We highlight the value of combining serological results into an algorithm to enhance the diagnosis of brucellosis and achieve greater overall accuracy in diagnosis. Efforts to streamline diagnostic, bolster surveillance, and increase awareness are essential for controlling brucellosis, particularly in resource-limited settings with a high disease burden.
