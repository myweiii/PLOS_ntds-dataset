Soil-transmitted helminthes (STH) infections are one of the most common neglected tropical diseases and a significant public health problem in developing countries, despite numerous efforts to combat it. One effective yet short-term control method is preventive chemotherapy. A more comprehensive program of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), along with knowledge of and use of its preventive measures, are needed for its long-term control and eventual elimination. This study examined community knowledge, perceptions and preventive practices towards STH using mixed method in Jimma, Oromia, Ethiopia. The finding revealed that, despite the reported exposures to STH communication opportunities, there were modest amount of knowledge, perception and preventive practices among communities and it varied across districts. Educational and latrine status predicted overall knowledge, whereas knowledge specific to hand washing and overall knowledge were predictors of STH preventive practice. Furthermore, washing hands during critical times was moderately improved among the young-aged, having improved latrine and knowledgeable on hand washing. This study underscores the need for local tailored and contextualized community behavioral change interventions.
