Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is a disease caused by intestinal worms, mainly common in impoverished settings lacking access to water, sanitation, and hygiene structures. Annual mass distribution of mebendazole to at risk groups is the main control strategy. Ivermectin, another community mass-distributed treatment for onchocerciasis and/or lymphatic filariasis control/elimination, also showed a collateral impact on STH control. The Lomie Health District is a predominantly rural setting where annual school-based deworming campaigns and/or community-based preventive chemotherapy with ivermectin for onchocerciasis are ongoing. This study aimed to assess the current prevalence and intensity of STH infection among school-aged children in the Lomie Health District. STH transmission remains substantially high despite the mebendazole-based annual deworming exercises in schools and community-based ivermectin preventive chemotherapy. The current prevalence of the infection is similar to the baseline level 16 years earlier, at the commencement of the MDA strategies. Further studies are needed to understand the contextual determinants of the high STH prevalence to inform targeted interventions to reducing the transmission of the infection in the Lomie Health District.
