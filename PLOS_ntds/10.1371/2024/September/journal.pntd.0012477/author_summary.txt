This review examines the role of epigenetic changes and the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in Opisthorchis viverrini-induced cholangiocarcinoma (Ov-CCA). Through an exhaustive analysis of relevant studies, the primary epigenetic alteration identified in Ov-CCA pathogenesis is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters. This epigenetic dysregulation shows several affected genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which plays a central role in opisthorchiasis progression. Network analysis revealed an interaction between these genes and β-catenin, suggesting Wnt/β-catenin pathway dysregulation contributes to Ov-CCA development and progression. Most methylated genes act as tumor suppressors by normally inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Targeting this pathway offers therapeutic potential for Ov-CCA. Epigenetic markers hold promise as biomarkers, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting disrupted gene and signalling networks through epigenetic modulators. This approach presents an innovative strategy for developing personalized therapies tailored to the molecular profiles of Ov-CCA patients. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires rigorous validation and further in-depth exploration. Nonetheless, the insights obtained highlight the crucial necessity for ongoing research on epigenetic-based interventions, intending to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic effectiveness in managing Ov-CCA.
