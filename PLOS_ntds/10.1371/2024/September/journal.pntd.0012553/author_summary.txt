Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe acute fever disease in humans and requires a biosafety level 4 laboratory for handling. Hazara virus (HAZV), the same genus of CCHFV, has been used as a model virus to reveal the molecular mechanism of CCHFV infection. To investigate host factors for CCHFV replication, we generated a series of mutant RAW264.7 cells and conducted screening for host genes that regulate the replication of HAZV, identifying HuR (ELAVL1). HuR is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that enhances mRNA stability by binding to its 3′ non-coding region (NCR). We found that HuR is associated with the CCHFV RNA stability by binding to its 3’-NCR, and the minigenome assay showed that CCHFV replication is supported by HuR. HuR inhibitor treatment also reduced CCHFV minigenome replication. These findings present a possible starting point for the future development of antiviral drug targeting host RBPs. Combination treatment with RdRp and RBP inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the future.
