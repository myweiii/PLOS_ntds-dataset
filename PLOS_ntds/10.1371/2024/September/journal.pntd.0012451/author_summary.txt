Unbiased molecular approaches like metagenomic sequencing have improved our ability to identify not only novel microbes but also known microbes in new settings. We report the results of a metagenomic next generation sequencing approach to identify viral and cell free plasma RNA from a curated panel of 42 unexplained, acute febrile, hospitalized study participants from tertiary referral hospitals in Mubende and Arua, Uganda. In ten study participants, metagenomic sequencing allowed us to identify pathogens including Helicobacter pylori, and Rickettsia conorii that were missed on routine clinical microbiologic testing. Sequence-specific targeted PCR assays and Sanger sequencing confirmed Rickettsia conorii infection in the first hospitalized case of Mediterranean Spotted Fever diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa. Using appropriate controls, we observed metagenomic sequencing to be unable to consistently detect microbial sequences when plasma circulation levels were below 10,000 copies/mL. These results highlight the need for more studies to determine the utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing approaches for disease diagnosis and surveillance in similar settings.
