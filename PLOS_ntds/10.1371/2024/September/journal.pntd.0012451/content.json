    "Introduction": "The threat of emerging infections, limitations of target-specific diagnostics, decreasing costs, and improving bioinformatics have contributed to broader interest in unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) as a tool to identify the cause of undiagnosed infections [1\u20134]. This approach has facilitated rapid identification of novel outbreak pathogens which in turn can accelerate development of pharmacological and epidemiologic interventions [5,6]. However, while the agnostic mNGS approach to pathogen identification can be useful to overcome limitations of standard microbiologic diagnostics, questions remain about the optimal approach, patient use case, and net diagnostic gain. Careful sample selection, laboratory protocols, and computational analysis are needed to decrease misinterpretation of results from contamination, transient viremia, or nonpathogenic members of the human virome [7,8]. Additionally, careful selection of samples, knowing the clinical context, and/or performing additional confirmatory tests are important factors for optimizing the value of mNGS.\nSome acute febrile illness (AFI) is caused by infections like malaria that can be diagnosed at the point-of-care. However, many cases of AFI remain undiagnosed, either because of limitations in diagnostic testing or the emergence of new pathogens or re-emergence of a known pathogen in an unexpected setting [9].We sought to evaluate the potential for RNA mNGS to identify possible microbial causes of unexplained acute febrile illness (AFI) in East Africa. Plasma metagenomic sequencing was performed on a curated panel of study participants selected from an AFI cohort based in Uganda [10]. We used RNA rather than DNA sequencing to enable the detection of both plasma RNA viremia and highly expressed microbial RNA from emerging and reemerging human infections in Rift Valley of East and Central Africa [11\u201313]. This approach resulted in the identification and molecular confirmation of a bacterium, Rickettsia conorii, as the cause of locally acquired Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), causing severe illness, requiring hospitalization in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).",
    "Study design and methods": "Ethics statement\nThis study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study and informed consent process were reviewed and approved by the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) Research Ethics Committee (JC1518) and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST), HS 371ES, and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Internal Review Board (IRB00176961). All participants signed written informed consents prior to study procedures. All samples were de-identified prior to laboratory testing.\n\n\nStudy participants\nThis cross-sectional study sequenced plasma from individuals admitted with acute febrile illness to tertiary referral hospitals in Mubende and Arua, Uganda between 2019 to 2020[10]. In brief, adults (\u226518 years of age) in the emergency or outpatient departments to be admitted with a recorded fever (\u2265 38.0\u00b0C) or clinical history of fever within the past 48 hours and had symptom onset within the past 2 weeks were eligible for enrollment in the previously described parent cohort. After consent, study personnel collected baseline physiologic parameters, plasma and serum for standardized clinical diagnostic tests including HIV testing with consent (Determine HIV1/2: Abbott, OK, USA; Stat-Pak, Chembio Diagnostics Systems, Inc, NY, USA; SD Bioline: Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea), malaria rapid test (CareStart malaria Pf HRP2 antigen RDT), and thick malaria smears as previously described [10]. Participants were followed at one-month through in-person or telephone visits for blood collection and for determining survival. The participants in this mNGS study panel were selected based on i) clinical indication of viral infection (i.e., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) and ii) absence of a validated laboratory diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation. As one of the aims of this study was to identify emerging and remerging human infections, we prioritized sequencing of samples from patients without HIV as these patients often present with febrile illness caused by well-described opportunistic infections [14].\nSample Preparation for next generation sequencing (NGS): i) Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extraction was performed on 200 \u03bcL of plasma using ZR-Duet DNA/RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) as previously described [15]. Pre-extraction steps done to minimize non-viral sequences included centrifugation of plasma at 1600g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by filtration of the supernatant using 0.2 \u03bcM syringe filters (Whatman, Amersham Place, UK). This extraction protocol allowed for separate elution of the RNA fractions, thereby reducing DNA contamination.\nii) Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS): The NGS library constructions were performed using Ovation SoLo RNA-Seq (Tecan Genomics, Inc., CA, USA) library preparation kit. The kit was selected based on its ability to generate libraries from low biomass samples like plasma. Additionally, during library preparation extra amplification cycles were incorporated to increase the final concentration of the cDNA libraries. Qualitative assessment of each library was done using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) to visualize fragment size distribution and identify presence of non-specific DNA fragments that could potentially affect read quality. Although the average library size ranged from 300\u2013350 bp, samples that had peaks prior to the library range (likely due to primer dimer or adaptor dimers) were also taken for sequencing as these were smaller in proportion to the library peak. In our experience these do not affect read quality. This was followed by quantitative assessment using the Kappa PCR library kit (Roche, IN, USA). Samples were pooled in batches to yield a final concentration of 4nM for sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA). Required volumes of each sample library was determined using the pooling calculator made available at https://support.illumina.com/help/pooling-calculator/pooling-calculator.htm. Sequencing of pooled samples was done as technical replicates (two lanes) on a single flow cell using high output mode with a read length of 2X100 bp and 500 million reads/lane.\niii) Controls: Both positive and negative controls were included as extraction and sequencing controls. Positive controls included a) two plasma specimens with known clinical and laboratory diagnosis (Plasmodium falciparum and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and b) AcroMetrix Multi-Analyte (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The multianalyte contained SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B, and RSV A/B at a concentration of 10,000 copies/mL. Water was used as a negative control. The controls were processed identically to the study samples.\niv) Taxonomic classification of reads: All sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome T2T-CHM13[16] using Bowtie 2[17]. The remaining non-human reads were classified by KrakenUniq [18] against a customized database built from all complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes from NCBI RefSeq, a collection of 256 eukaryotic pathogens from EuPathDB, UniVec laboratory vectors from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/) and the GRCh38 human genome. The KrakenUniq database includes 46,711 bacterial genomes (5981 species), 13,011 viral genomes (9905 species), and 604 archaeal genomes (295 species), and the full database can be downloaded from https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2\nv) Computational analysis: The KrakenUniq reports for all samples were analyzed for potential infectious agents using Pavian [19] to compare read counts between all samples and the sample controls (S1 Table). Using Pavian\u2019s z-score, we isolated all species with significantly higher read counts than most other samples or controls, considering these species as potential microbial infections. Reads for any potential microbial infection were extracted using KrakenTools[20] and realigned using Bowtie 2 to visualize genome coverage of the classified reads. We also looked for indications of false positives by identifying plots that showed localization of reads in only 1\u20132 regions. Additionally, KrakenUniq algorithm reports a \"unique k-mer\" count, i.e., reads that match low-complexity regions. e.g. a long (ATATAT\u2026) repeat will have 2 k-mers while a 100bp read should have seventy 31-mers if they are all different. Hence, if KrakenUniq reports 100 reads but only 200 k-mers, that means all of those reads hit the same spot either due low complexity or a contaminant. The presence of the microbial species was considered valid only if the number of uniq k-mers were much greater than the number of reads. We primarily used the calculated z-score to identify potential calls, which were then further validated using both the k-mer counts and the genomic coverage by the reads. Clinical relevance was determined by a committee of three board-certified infectious diseases specialists.\nvi) Rickettsia PCR: For confirmation of rickettsial infection, DNA was extracted from serum using QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). PCR was performed using previously published methods targeting mRNA of spotted fever group sca0 (OmpA gene), R. conorii-specific sca0, and typhus group 17-kDa outer membrane protein gene, and positives were called only if in duplicate [21,22]. The 127-basepair amplicon from R. conorii-specific sca0 PCR plate was sent for Sanger sequencing and aligned to a reference genome using SnapGene software (GLS Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA).",
    "Results": "The 42 study participants included participants hospitalized in Mubende, Uganda (n = 26) and in Arua, Uganda (n = 16). Participants had a median age of 28 years (IQR:24, 38.5) with 50% identifying as females (Table 1). Based on the study selection criteria, participants had leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia with a median WBC and platelet count of 5.3 x103 cells/mm3(IQR:3.6 to 9.1) and 114 x103 cells/mm3 (IQR:66.5 to 189.8), respectively. Although we enriched for virions during RNA extraction, the protocol allowed us to simultaneously sequence cell free RNA. Hence, in addition to identification of RNA virome, we were also able to identify infections due to bacteria, fungi, parasites, and DNA viruses.\nRNA sequencing of all samples yielded an average of 25 million 100 bp paired reads per sample. 83.5% of all reads were identified as human using Bowtie 2 and KrakenUniq. Removal of human sequences resulted in an average of 1.4 million reads per sample (Table 2).\nThis study sequenced 42 participants, AcroMetrix control, No Template Control (NTC) and 2 with known clinical and laboratory diagnosis (AFI-6 and AFI-12).\nAnalysis of KrakenUniq read classifications revealed the expected Plasmodium falciparum species signal in the positive control (S2 Table). However, the protocol failed to identify HIV-1 present at a concentration <4 log 10 copies/ml. This is consistent with our previous observation that metagenomic sequencing can give false negative results for viruses at concentrations <4 log 10 copies/mL [15]. Additionally, the KrakenUniq protocol and Pavian analysis identified SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B, and RSV A/B, all of which were present at a concentration of 4 log 10 copies/mL in the AcroMetrix sample.\nFurther analysis of the KrakenUniq classifications identified 10 microbes among the 42 study participants with significant Pavian z-scores (Tables 3 and S2). These included organisms that are always considered pathogens when isolated from human specimens (N. gonorrhoeae, H. pylori, P. falciparum, and R. conorii). We also identified microbes that can be normal flora or pathogenic in certain settings (Candida parapsilosis, human herpes virus-8 [HHV-8], Human mastadenovirus C, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) [23\u201325]. Pegivirus hominis(also known as pegivirus-C), a commonly observed non-pathogen in blood, was also detected in two participants[26]. Fig 1 displays the read counts for these 10 microbes across all samples.\nKrakenUniq read classifications for 9 identified microbes across 42 study samples are shown. The identified reads were absent in negative control (NTC), and the AcroMetrix control. Each of these microbes had significantly higher total read counts in 1\u20132 samples as compared to the remaining samples and controls, as determined by the Pavian z-score.\n\n\nCases with clinically relevant mNGS results\nAmong the four cases adjudicated to have had clinically relevant results, the pathogens were not identified on protocolized routine clinical microbiologic testing (Table 2). First, N. gonorrhoeae sequences were found in a 27-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever. Routine testing revealed a positive anti-treponemal antibody syphilis test. The patient was diagnosed with syphilis and was treated with intramuscular penicillin. This patient received intravenous ceftriaxone (active against N. gonorrhoeae); standard blood cultures were negative. Ceftriaxone was given empirically. Second, H. pylori sequences were detected in a 40-year-old woman with fever and abdominal pain who was clinically diagnosed with gastritis and ulcers. The clinical course was consistent with H. pylori infection, but routine access to H. pylori testing was not available in this setting. Third, P. falciparum sequences were found in a 38-year-old man with fever, altered mental status, seizures who died during admission. Rapid diagnostic and smear testing for malaria were negative.\n\n\nMediterranean spotted fever (R. conorii)\nThe fourth clinically relevant case is a 39-year-old man with no past medical history who presented 7 days after symptom onset with abdominal pain, altered mental status, a generalized rash, and rigors. He was previously seen in a clinic and prescribed antimalarials (artesunate and quinine tablets) which he took for 6 days without improvement. He was a crop and livestock farmer from Mubende. He reported mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He had goats and chickens around his household. He had a fever of 40.2\u00b0C, confusion (Glasgow coma score 14), heart rate 119 bpm, blood pressure of 81/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minutes, and oxygen saturation of 87%. On exam he was toxic appearing, had nuchal rigidity, crackles on lung auscultation, tachycardia on heart auscultation, abdominal tenderness, and a papular rash. His white blood count was 4.7 x103 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 16.9 g/dL, platelet count 89 x103 cells/\u03bcL, AST 92 U/L and ALT 39 U/L. Routine microbiology laboratory results were negative for HIV, malaria, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and blood cultures were without growth. He was admitted with a diagnosis of meningitis and pneumonia and treated with clindamycin, levofloxacin, and amikacin. He remained febrile at 39.4\u00b0C, but heart rate improved to 90 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minutes, and blood pressure 120/80 mmHg with 97% oxygen saturation. He was discharged by the following day. The participant was alive at 28 days per phone follow-up.\nThe baseline enrollment plasma sample was tested using real-time PCR and was positive for the spotted fever group sca0 (ompA) target at a mean cycle threshold of 32.7. Typhus group 17-kDa PCR was negative. Serum samples were positive for R. conorii-specific sca0 primers at a mean Ct of 33.6 in three of four plasma duplicates. The amplicon was Sanger sequenced and had a 100% match with a R. conorii Malish 7 strain reference sequence.",
    "Discussion": "In a hospitalized, acute febrile illness cohort in Uganda, RNA-based mNGS identified clinically relevant pathogens in a subset of participants without a microbiologic diagnosis. This report underscores the potential and limitations of mNGS for diagnostics and pathogen discovery. The findings of this study also include the first report of a molecularly confirmed locally acquired R. conorii infection leading to hospitalization in SSA [27,28].\nThe use of mNGS allowed identification of pathogens missed by standardized diagnostic tools. The pathogens identified included R. conorii, H. pylori, N. gonorrhoeae, and P. falciparum. There are few descriptions of rickettsial illness among those hospitalized in SSA with cases primarily limited to returning travelers. In the absence of surveillance programs and diagnostics, species causing rickettsial illness among those hospitalized with AFI are also largely unknown. Notably, the MSF participant was initially misdiagnosed with malaria and developed progressive illness including signs and symptoms of meningitis and unstable vital signs. Fortunately, empiric treatment with a fluoroquinolone, to which R. conorii is susceptible, resulted in dramatic recovery and swift discharge. This case report along with recent evidence of MSF circulation in tick pools throughout Uganda provides strong clinical evidence that MSF should be considered in patients with severe non-malarial illness leading to hospitalization in Uganda [29]. Availability and application of NGS for clinical purposes could provide valuable pathogen agnostic approaches to diagnosis after first-line testing is exhausted and to inform regional diagnostic needs. As with the identification of R conorii infection, detection of H. pylori sequences in the plasma of a patient with epigastric pain and ulcers was unexpected and clinically meaningful. This finding has been previously described and likely represents a real pathogen [30]. While clinically \u2018expected,\u2019 mNGS was the sole evidence of N. gonorrhoeae and malaria infections despite routine diagnostic testing in two other patients. Molecular detection of P. falciparum with a negative blood smear does not implicate malaria as the primary cause of acute febrile illness. However, identification of P. falciparum could provide context as an infection that could contribute to anemia, splenomegaly, or non-typhoidal infection [31].\nOur findings also reflect some of the limitations of mNGS. mNGS is not widely available clinically and computational analysis require specialized bioinformatics tools for precise identification of microbial reads. As with existing blood cultures and even some clinical PCR diagnostics, microbes unlikely to be clinically significant (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococcus) may be identified and lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatments. Hence, like routine interpretation of laboratory results, careful incorporation of clinical interpretation is needed. We also failed to identify evidence of microbial infection in most persons and failed to detect HIV RNA in one positive control, underscoring the limited sensitivity of the approach in detection of acute infections with low plasma microbial RNAemia (<10,000 copies/mL)[15].\nOur study itself also had limitations. We focused on the RNA fraction and may have missed genomic DNA of other microbes like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Nonetheless, our approach allowed us to identify their transcripts [32]. The identification of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Candida parapsilosis could be due to contamination at the time of collection. The use of negative controls indicate that these were less likely from processing in the laboratory. Contamination at time of collection is a common consideration for blood culture testing which needs to be considered as well for sequencing approaches.",
    "Conclusion": "In this study using curated samples, we observed RNA mNGS to be a clinically useful diagnostic approach in a region with diverse causes of infectious diseases. mNGS identified pathogens that would have otherwise been undetected in a protocolized AFI surveillance study in Uganda. mNGS filled current gaps in diagnostic workflows by identifying pathogens not widely known to be circulating in agrarian countries with diverse causes of infection. In addition, our findings further support setting up prospective surveillance for MSF in SSA to allow for early treatment of R. conorii infections. Early recognition, empiric antibiotics, and/or diagnostics could prevent hospitalization or deaths due to rickettsial illness. In addition to demonstrating the diagnostic utility of mNGS, our study highlights the need to identify the burden of rickettsial infections in SSA. These are essential for development of rapid diagnostics, consideration of empiric treatments, and to inform public health policy.",
