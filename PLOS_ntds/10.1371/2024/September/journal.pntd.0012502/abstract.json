    "Abstract": "Schistosoma mansoni infection leads to chronic schistosomiasis and severe hepatic fibrosis. We designed a liver-targeted lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrying siRNA against type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGF\u03b2RI) mRNA to treat schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis in BALB/c mice. Knockdown of TGF\u03b2RI by LNP-siTGF\u03b2RI reduced LX-2 cell activation in vitro and alleviated liver fibrosis in S. mansoni-infected mice. \u03b1SMA and Col1a1 fibrotic markers in the liver tissues of infected mice were significantly suppressed in the treatment groups. In the serum of the LNP-siTGF\u03b2RI-treated groups, cytokines IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, RANTES (CCL5), and TNF\u03b1 increased, while GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and KC (CXCL1) decreased compared to the control. Cell proportions were significantly altered in S. mansoni-infected mice, with increased CD56d NK cells and decreased CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells compared to na\u00efve mice. Following LNP-siTGF\u03b2RI treatment, CD56d NK cells were downregulated, while B and memory Th cell populations were upregulated. The density of fibrotic regions significantly decreased with LNP-siTGF\u03b2RI treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and no systemic toxicity was observed in the major organs. This targeted siRNA delivery strategy effectively reduced granulomatous lesions in schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis without detectable side effects."
