Cholera remains a significant public health threat in areas with inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). The World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) launched "Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030" to reduce cholera deaths and eliminate the disease in 20 countries by 2030 through targeted interventions, including improved WASH practices and disease surveillance. cholera surveillance, especially in developing countries seldom poses difficulty in terms of the need for laboratory infrastructure, and other resource constraints. Thereby, in this study, we utilized a viable approach with serosurvey data from 2017, cholera outbreak data, WASH indicators, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) to create a composite vulnerability index for cholera risk in India. Overall, 11.7% of the sampled population had detectable levels of cholera antibodies reflecting previous infection. The Southern region of India experienced the highest incidence, followed by the West and North. the study showed that cholera infection is present in all five regions across India. Further, the vulnerability index which we built could be utilized in other settings so that effective tailored interventions could be applied in identified priority areas.
