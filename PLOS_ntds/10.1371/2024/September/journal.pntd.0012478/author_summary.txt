Hantaviruses are primarily hosted by small mammals such as rodents, shrews, moles, and bats. In recent years, the diseases caused by rodent-associated hantaviruses become more frequent among humans in Yunnan province. In order to curb human infections, it is necessary to monitor the dynamics of virus prevalence in their natural reservoir populations. As expected, we detected 37 SEOV strains harbored by rats in the main endemic areas of the province, and the subsequent meta-transcriptomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed two SEOV variants that diverged early from the rest of the viruses, based on which Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau appears to be the region where earlier SEOV was originated. Further studies and more samples are needed to clarify how the virus migrates worldwide, and the pathogenicity of newly discovered viruses.
