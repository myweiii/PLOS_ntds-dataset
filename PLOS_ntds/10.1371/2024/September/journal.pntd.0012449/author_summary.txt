Leptospirosis is a Neglected Tropical Disease with worldwide distribution, a heavy impact in tropical regions, and remaining knowledge gaps. Laboratory disease confirmation requires tests that are still difficult to access in rural communities where the disease is most frequent and has the heaviest impact. We conducted a study on febrile patients who approached health services in the region of Urab√° in Colombia. Patients presenting with cases compatible with leptospirosis were subjected to a PCR test to confirm the disease. The disease presents with fever, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms resulting in a highly unspecific febrile syndrome similar to other tropical infections prevalent in the same areas. However, our results suggest that some findings can increase clinical suspicion of leptospirosis and help guide decision-making among medical professionals. Eye pain had a negative correlation with leptospirosis and might guide clinicians toward other diseases, while kidney involvement among children might increase suspicion of leptospirosis in undifferentiated tropical febrile syndrome. It is important to continue studies like this to better define the spectrum of leptospirosis clinical syndromes.
