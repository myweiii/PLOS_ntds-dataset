One of the main causes of zoonotic related human morbidity and mortality is the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses such as dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, and chikungunya virus. These viruses cannot only infect humans but also livestock, pets, and wildlife, though our understanding of their non-human hosts remains limited. Rodents are thought to be an important host for these viruses because they can be abundant, often live near humans, and some are already known to be viral hosts. However, research has focused mostly on non-human primates, neglecting other potential wild hosts. To address this gap, we have developed a high-throughput antibody test to screen rodent blood against 15 different arboviruses. Our findings reveal that Mastomys natalensis, a common African rodent species, carries antibodies that (cross-)react against these viruses. We hypothesize that immunologically na√Øve juveniles may drive transmission, particularly during population outbreaks. These outbreaks coincide with environmental conditions that are favorable for mosquitoes, thus increasing the risk of spillover to humans, livestock, and wildlife. Understanding the role of rodents in arbovirus transmission dynamics is crucial for mitigating zoonotic disease risks.
