More than 600 million people are infected with the nematode intestinal parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. Dogs can also carry S. stercoralis. In southeast Asia different genetic types that either infect only dogs or humans and dogs were described. Strongyloides fuelleborni, (normally found in old-world monkeys) can also infect humans, mainly in Africa. We collected Strongyloides spp. and hook worms, from humans and a dog in Bangladesh and analysed their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. All hookworms were Necator americanus, one of the two major human hookworm species. Contrary to the general belief that human infections with S. fuelleborni are extremely rare in Asia, we found multiple such cases, suggesting that S. fuelleborni plays a more important role as a human parasite than previously thought also in Asia.
We found the two expected genetic types of S. stercoralis. For the first time, we found a genomically "dog only" type worm in a person and we found two worms with nuclear genomes of the "dog only" type but mitochondrial genomes of the "human and dog" type. This suggest that rare interbreeding between the two types occurs, such that exchange of genetic properties, such as a drug resistance, between the two types is conceivable.
