Recent efforts have successfully utilized the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia to control mosquito-transmitted viral diseases like dengue in multiple countries. However, similar initiatives have been limited in combating malaria, the most devastating and deadly mosquito-borne disease, which claims over half a million lives each year. This is primarily due to the difficulty in establishing a stable, maternally inheritable Wolbachia infection in Anopheles, the mosquito vector responsible for malaria transmission. A significant concern in malaria control is the invasion of the urban malaria vector Anopheles stephensi into Africa, where malaria burden is highest, and over 40% of the population resides in urban areas. Building on the previous breakthrough of establishing Wolbachia strain wAlbB in An. stephensi, the author has now achieved a second stable infection by transferring the wPip strain from Culex pipiens into this mosquito species using embryonic microinjection. The resultant transinfected HP1 line induces nearly complete cytoplasmic incompatibility when crossed with wild mosquitoes, displays robust fitness and male mating competitiveness, and exhibits strong resilience against heat stress. These advantageous traits position the HP1 line as a promising candidate for further development in malaria control.
