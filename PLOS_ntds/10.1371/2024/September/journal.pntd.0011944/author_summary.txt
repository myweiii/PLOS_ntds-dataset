This study was the first to investigate the population genetic structure and Wolbachia infection of Culex pipiens pallens in Shandong Province, providing a basis for mosquito-borne control and disease prevention. The joint analysis of Wolbachia and mitochondrial markers highlighted the coevolutionary relationship between Wolbachia and its host. It also provided the scientific basis for green precision prevention and control of mosquito-borne bacteria and viruses.
