Leishmania major and L. tropica are the causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Tataouine governorate of southeast Tunisia. In this study, the microbiota of Phlebotomus papatasi, Ph. perniciosus, Ph. riouxi, and Ph. sergenti, which were caught from three diverse ecotypes, were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. In total, 117 Leishmania-free and blood-non-fed female specimens were used individually in this study to avoid any bias caused by pooling samples. We found that the gut microbiota was mainly controlled by environmental habitats and other factors, as remarkable differences in microbiota composition within the same species collected from the same location was revealed. Moreover, the results suggested that host phylogeny may play a minor role in determining the insect gut microbiota, and the potential of the host factor to affect the transmission of the Leishmania parasite appeared to be very low. A better understanding of microorganism-insect-gut bacterial interactions is critical, as the interactions between pathogens and gut microbiota do not adhere to a consistent pattern of synergy or antagonism. Even the same bacterial species, such as Enterococcus faecalis, can exert opposing effects when confronted with different pathogens in various host insects
