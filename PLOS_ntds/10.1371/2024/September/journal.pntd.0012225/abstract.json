    "Background": "Orally transmitted acute Chagas disease (ACD) primarily affects low-visibility and low-income individuals in tropical and subtropical zones. Managing ACD remains challenging even after more than 100 years of its discovery. Its spread to non-endemic areas has made it a global health issue. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the difficulties encountered in handling a real-life situation.",
    "Methodology and findings": "This report examines an outbreak of 39 cases of ACD due to oral transmission by bacaba juice ingestion that occurred in Pedro do Rosário, Maranhão, Brazil. A clinical and epidemiological investigation, including an entomological search, was conducted. Diagnosis criteria included positive peripheral blood smear (PBS), seroconversion of IgG, and a two-fold increase in IgG titer (laboratory criteria); and clinical findings, epidemiological exposure, and at least one positive IgG test (clinical-epidemiological criteria). In-house conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on 33 samples. All patients were treated with benznidazole. After 4.5 years, IgG levels were reassessed in 26 individuals. The mean age was 33.6 years, with no gender difference. The mean incubation period was 13.8 days, and the mean between symptom onset and treatment was 16.6 days. The most common symptoms were fever and lymphadenopathy (90%). Diagnostic success rates were 66.6% (laboratory criteria), 23% (clinical-epidemiological criteria), and 10.2% (high clinical suspicion despite negative tests). Test positivity rates were 69.7% (PBS), 91.4% (serology), and 100% (PCR). There were no deaths. Serological cure was achieved in 34.6% of cases, and IgG titers decreased in 15.3%.",
    "Conclusions and significance": "We encountered several barriers in managing ACD, including population vulnerability, reliance on outdated diagnostic techniques, lack of standardized molecular biology methods, and limited therapeutic options. This report underscores the importance of rapid surveillance and early treatment to prevent fatalities. We recommend the standardization of conventional PCR in diagnostic routines."
