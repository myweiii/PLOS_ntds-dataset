In this study we present an outbreak of orally transmitted acute Chagas disease (ACD), a neglected tropical disease. The source of transmission was bacaba juice served at a celebration held in a quilombola community and 39 individuals were affected. The focus of this study was clinical-epidemiological investigation and diagnostic tools. There were no deaths due to this event, probably because of the quick action of the surveillance team and the early start of treatment. We show all the difficulties facing a real-life situation (vulnerability of population affected, weaknesses regarding good food safety practices and obstacles to following what guidelines recommend), discuss the performance and feasibility of the diagnostic method used and address the global threat that Chagas disease may pose. Furthermore, we propose that the polymerase chain reaction should become standardized in diagnosing acute disease, given that this was the only method with 100% positivity, even among patients whose other tests were all negative.
