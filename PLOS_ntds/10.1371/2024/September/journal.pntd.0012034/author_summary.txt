Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgery is the primary way to manage in-turned eyelashes in trachoma-endemic settings. The goal of this study was to understand what procedure has the best outcomes. We compared three ways of doing TT surgery: bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR) surgery with the World Health Organization recommended 3 mm incision height, BLTR with the incision height increased to 5 mm and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR). We hypothesized that increasing the BLTR incision height to 5 mm would reduce post-operative trichiasis (PTT) compared with the 3 mm height. On the contrary, this study demonstrates that increasing the incision height of BLTR surgeries does not improve PTT rates. It also suggests that BLTR and PLTR surgeries can have similar outcomes in some settings. Further research is needed to examine the impact of training order on surgery outcomes. The study also investigated whether surgeon performance on a particular procedure depends on the order they were trained. The current study does not suggest that converting BLTR to PLTR surgeons reduces PTT rates. However, given the small number of conversion surgeons in this study, further research is needed to evaluate whether retraining BLTR surgeons is warranted.
