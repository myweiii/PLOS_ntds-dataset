    "Background": "Poor surgical outcomes remain a problem in trachoma-endemic countries working to reach elimination thresholds. Methods to improve outcomes could positively impact programmatic success.",
    "Methods": "This parallel, three-armed clinical trial conducted in Ethiopia randomized individuals with previously unoperated trachomatous trichiasis (TT) to receive surgery utilizing one of three approaches: bilamellar tarsal rotation with a 3 mm incision height (BLTR-3), BLTR with 5 mm incision height (BLTR-5) and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR). We followed participants for one year. The primary outcome was post-operative trichiasis (PTT). Secondary outcomes were eyelid contour abnormalities (ECA) and pyogenic granulomata.",
    "Findings": "We randomized and operated on 4,914 individuals with previously unoperated TT (6,940 eyes). Primary analyses include 6,815 eyes with follow-up. Overall, 1,149 (16.9%) eyes developed PTT. The risk difference for PTT was minimal comparing BLTR-3 and PLTR (adjusted risk difference [aRD] 1.8% (98.3%CI: -0.5–4.2%)), but significantly higher for BLTR-5 surgeries compared to BLTR-3 (aRD: 6.7% (3.9–9.4%)) and PLTR (aRD: 8.6% (5.9–11.3%)). BLTR-5 had the lowest ECA (6.1% versus 9.6% BLTR-3, 11.2% PLTR) and granuloma rates (5.2% versus 6.5% BLTR-3 and 7.5% PLTR). One eyelid operated with PLTR experienced an eyelid margin division; four BLTR-3 and eight BLTR-5 eyelids experienced excessive bleeding.",
    "Interpretation": "We do not recommend modifying the BLTR incision height of 3 mm. Overall, we did not find a significant difference in PTT between BLTR-3 and PLTR in terms of PTT or ECA.",
    "Trial registration": "Registration number: NCT03100747; ClinicalTrials.gov"
