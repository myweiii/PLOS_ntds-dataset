Melioidosis, a disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, has historically been described in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. However, recent studies have demonstrated its presence outside these areas, both in the environment and in patients without a history of travel to known endemic areas. In addition, the predicted increase in extreme climatic events in the near future could increase the prevalence of the disease and lead to its emergence in new areas. For these reasons, it is important to identify areas at risk outside of known endemic areas.
Hypothesizing that we would have little chance of finding B. pseudomallei through random environmental surveys, we used serological testing to find evidence of past exposure to the bacteria in apparently healthy domestic animals. We identified seropositive animals in Les Saintes and French Guiana. We then searched for the presence of B. pseudomallei in the immediate vicinity of the seropositive animals in Les Saintes, and isolated it in the soil of a goat farm. Our study suggests that domestic animals could be used as sentinels for the detection of melioidosis outside of countries with frequent human cases.
