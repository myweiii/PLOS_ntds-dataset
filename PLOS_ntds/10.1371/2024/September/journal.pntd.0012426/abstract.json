    "Background": "Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) is a serious public health problem in Southern Mexico. Six species of Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psychodidae) have been found to be infected with Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, the causative agent of LCL in the region. However, little is known about the biology and potential participation of Psathyromyia cratifer in the Leishmania transmission cycle in Mexico, and the Americas. The present study provides evidence of temporal infection caused by Leishmania in Psathyromyia cratifer as well as data on its population dynamics in a LCL endemic area during the well-known transmission cycle of Leishmania in Southern Mexico.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Individual specimens of Psathyromyia cratifer were collected in four sites over the course of five months (from November 2020 through March 2021) using animal-baited, human-baited, and light traps. The temporal activity pattern (month + hour) of Psathyromyia cratifer was assessed along with its relationship with environmental variables. Moreover, Leishmania DNA and blood meals were analyzed and detected in female sand flies. This evidenced an infection rate ranging from 8% to 83%, and the record of Homo sapiens and Ototylomys phyllotis as blood hosts of this sand fly species. High abundances of these sand flies in human-baited traps were recorded which revealed the marked anthropophilic behavior of Psathyromyia cratifer. As regards the transmission dynamics of the parasite within the region, it was observed that the potential highest epidemiological risk for Leishmania transmission by Psathyromyia cratifer occurred during the months of January and March.",
    "Conclusion": "This is the first contribution ever made to both the population dynamic and the temporal Leishmania prevalence patterns in Psathyromyia cratifer. The resulting findings suggest that this sand fly specimen is the sixth potential vector of L. (L.) mexicana in Southern Mexico. Nonetheless, various biology, behavior, and ecology strands are yet to be addressed. The latter, to determine the role it plays in the transmission dynamics of the parasite within the region, and other areas of the country."
