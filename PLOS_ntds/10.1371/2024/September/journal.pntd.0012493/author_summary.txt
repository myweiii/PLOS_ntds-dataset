Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant public health challenges worldwide. To control and prevent the spread of these diseases, mainly insecticides are used to reduce mosquito population sizes and/or prevent human-mosquito contact. However, their excessive usage has led to the rapid development of insecticide resistance, which warrants the need for the development of new mosquito control tools. This study investigates the use of electric fields that are created between insulated conductor wires to repel Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We found that electric fields can effectively repel over 50% of host-seeking female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at electric field strengths of â‰¥ 3.66 kV/cm. There are several advantages to using this novel mosquito control tool compared to existing electric field technologies. These include the affordability and accessibility of wires, making the technology suitable for widespread implementation especially in low-middle income countries that are mostly affected by mosquito-borne diseases. This technology has the potential to reduce human-mosquito contact which is a critical factor in mosquito-borne disease transmission.
