    "Background": "The control and prevention of mosquito-borne diseases is mostly achieved with insecticides. However, their use has led to the rapid development and spread of insecticide resistance worldwide. Health experts have called for intensified efforts to find new approaches to reduce mosquito populations and human-mosquito contact. A promising new tool is the use of electrical fields (EFs), whereby mosquitoes are repelled by charged particles in their flight path. Such particles move between two or more conductors, and the use of uninsulated copper or aluminum plates as conductors has been proven to be effective at repelling mosquitoes. Here, for the first time, we assess if EFs generated using a single row of insulated conductor wires (ICWs) can also successfully repel mosquitoes, and whether mosquitoes are equally repelled at the same EF strength when the electrodes are a) orientated differently (horizontal vs. vertical placement), and b) spaced more apart.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Over a period of 23 hours, the number of host-seeking female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that were successfully repelled by EFs, using ICWs, at EF strengths ranging from 0 kV/cm (control) to 9.15 kV/cm were quantified. Mosquitoes were released inside a 220×220×180 cm room and lured into a BG-Pro trap that was equipped with a BG-counter and baited with CO2 using dry ice. Mosquitoes had to pass through an EF window, that contained a single row of ICWs with alternating polarity, to reach the bait. The baseline interaction between EF strength and repellency was assessed first, after which the impact of different ICW orientations and ICW distances on repellency were determined.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "ICWs can be used to generate EFs that partially repel host-seeking mosquitoes, which will reduce human-mosquito contact. While future studies need to assess if (i) increased repellency can be achieved, and (ii) a repellency of 50–60% is sufficient to impact disease transmission, it is encouraging that EF repellency using ICWs is higher compared to that of some spatial repellent technologies currently in development. This technology can be used in the housing improvement toolkit (i.e. preventing mosquito entry through eaves, windows, and doors). Moreover, the use of cheap, over-the-counter ICWs will mean that the technology is more accessible worldwide, and easier to manufacture and implement locally."
