Rickettsiae are Gram-negative bacteria that cause acute undifferentiated febrile illness in humans. These pathogens are associated with arthropods and primarily transmitted by ectoparasites such as ticks, fleas, and mites. In Cambodia, rickettsial diseases have been documented in local patients, travelers and military personnel. However, the lack of entomological studies and awareness of these diseases hindered our comprehensive understanding of these pathogens and their arthropod vectors. Our manuscript provides a description of ectoparasite diversity and sheds light on their potential role in rickettsial disease transmission. Through molecular techniques, we uncover the prevalence and diversity of Rickettsia species in ectoparasites collected from various animal hosts in Koh Kong and Preah Sihanouk province. Rickettsia asembonensis, Rickettsia felis, and Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis were all identified from Ctenocephalides orientis fleas, while Rickettsia species closely related to Rickettsia japonica, Rickettsia heilongjiangensis, and Rickettsia raoultii were found from Haemaphysalis ticks. Additionally, Rickettsia were also detected in Heterodoxus spiniger lice and Laelapidae mites, although we were unable to characterize the species. Insights into this pathogen-vector-host interface will better inform healthcare professionals, leading to more accurate diagnoses and increased awareness for better management of these diseases.
