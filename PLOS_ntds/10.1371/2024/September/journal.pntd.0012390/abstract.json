    "Background": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis and a significant cause of disability in Asia and the western Pacific. Many countries have introduced JE vaccination programs, including several low resource countries following WHO’s prioritization of JE vaccination in 2006. We sought to characterize the public health impact of JE vaccination programs.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "JE case data and vaccination coverage rates, were requested from country health officials in 23 JE endemic countries and Chinese Taipei. Additional data were extracted from meeting presentations and published literature. JE incidence was compared before and after vaccination using a minimum three year period pre and post program introduction or expansion. Data suitable for analysis were available for 13 JE-endemic countries and Chinese Taipei, for either all age groups or for children aged under 15 years only. Five countries and Chinese Taipei introduced vaccine prior to 2006 and the all-age JE incidence was reduced by 73–100% in about 5–20 years following introduction. Six countries have introduced JE vaccine since 2006, and JE incidence in children aged younger than 15 years has been reduced by 14–79% as of 2015–2021. JE-specific data were unavailable before introduction in Thailand and Vietnam, but vaccination programs reduced acute encephalitis incidence by 80% and 74%, respectively. Even in the programs with greatest impact, it took several years to achieve their results.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "JE vaccination has greatly reduced JE in 13 JE-endemic countries and Chinese Taipei. Highest impact has been observed in countries that introduced prior to 2006, but it often took roughly two decades and substantial resources to achieve that level of success. For greatest possible impact, more recently introducing countries and funding agencies should commit to continuous improvements in delivery systems to sustain coverage after initial vaccine introduction."
