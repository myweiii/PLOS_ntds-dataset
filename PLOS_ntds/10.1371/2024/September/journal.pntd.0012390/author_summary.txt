While JE has been controlled by vaccination in a handful of economically developed countries endemic for JE transmission with disease reductions of 73–100%, introduction of JE vaccines has ocurred later in low and low-middle income countries (LLMIC) endemic for JE. Since 2006 focused effort has been undertaken to assist with establishment of sustained vaccination efforts against JE in LLMIC. The outcome has been growing evidence of the impact of vaccination against JE in LLMIC endemic for JE transmission with disease reductions of 14–79% among children aged under 15 years. We describe the public health impact of JE vaccination programs in both economically developed and LLMIC JE endemic countries and discuss how time and sustained effort on JE vaccination in LLMIC has high potential to reach the level of control seen in earlier decades in economically developed countries.
