Chagas disease is still a serious public health problem worldwide. Currently, only two drugs are available for the treatment of patients infected by T. cruzi: Benzonidazole and Nifurtimox. The efficacy of these compounds may differ depending on the phase of the disease when the treatment is established and also impacted by the T. cruzi genotypes that cause the infection. Thus, differences in therapeutic efficacy can be observed between geographic areas due to the distinct distribution of “Discrete Typing Unitys” (DTUs) of T. cruzi. Besides all these matters related to the etiological treatment, additional concerns regarding the laboratorial methods available for post-therapeutic monitoring of Chagas disease represent a challenge during clinical management. Amongst the innovative serological approaches, proposed for diagnosis and post-therapeutic monitoring of Chagas disease, the Chagas-Flow ATE IgG1 has been presented as an outstanding methodology, applicable for universal and genotype-specific serology. In the present study, the Chagas-Flow ATE IgG1 methodology was used for post-therapeutic monitoring of chronic Chagas disease patients, aiming at identifying changes in T. cruzi genotype-specific serological profile upon Benznidazole etiological treatment. This approach is relevant to provide novel insights to support the relevance of accomplishing the genotype-specific serodiagnosis during clinical pos-therapeutic management of chronic Chagas disease patients.
