    "Abstract": "The present study aimed to verify the impact of etiological treatment on the genotype-specific serological diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease patients (CH), using the Chagas-Flow ATE IgG1 methodology. For this purpose, a total of 92 serum samples from CH, categorized as Not Treated (NT, n = 32) and Benznidazole-Treated (Bz-T, n = 60), were tested at Study Baseline and 5Years Follow-up. At Study Baseline, all patients have the diagnosis of Chagas disease confirmed by Chagas-Flow ATE IgG1, using the set of attributes (\u201cantigen/serum dilution/cut-off\u201d; \u201cEVI/250/30%\u201d). The genotype-specific serodiagnosis at Study Baseline demonstrated that 96% of patients (44/46) presented a serological profile compatible with TcII genotype infection. At 5Years Follow-up monitoring, NT and Bz-T presented no changes in anti-EVI IgG1 reactivity. However, significant differences were detected in the genotype-specific IgG1 reactivity for Bz-T. The most outstanding shift comprised the anti-amastigote TcVI/(AVI), anti-amastigote TcII/(AII) and anti-epimastigote TcVI/(EVI) reactivities. Regardless no changes in the genotype-specific serology of NT (TcI = 6%; TcII = 94%), distinct T. cruzi genotype-specific sero-classification was detected for Bz-T samples at 5Years Follow-up (TcII = 100%) as compared to Baseline (TcII = 97%; TcVI = 3%). The anti-trypomastigote TcI/(TI) was the attribute accountable for the change in genotype-specific sero-classification. In conclusion, our findings of dissimilar T. cruzi genotype-specific serology upon Bz-treatment re-emphasize the relevance of accomplishing the genotype-specific serodiagnosis during clinical pos-therapeutic management of chronic Chagas disease patients."
