Serological immunological testing is a crucial means of monitoring schistosomiasis. In China, while the seroprevalence of Schistosomiasis japonica has currently reduced to a relatively low level, risk of infection still exists in certain areas. Achieving the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis by 2030 necessitates more precise and effective prevention and control measures. Our study intended to figure out the long-term trends of Schistosomiasis japonica seroprevalence in China from 1982 to 2020, focusing on age and spatial variations to identify high-risk areas and populations. We expect that the results can inform the development of targeted measures for schistosomiasis elimination.
