Typhoid fever is a major public health concern throughout many low- and middle-income countries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, two typhoid-conjugate vaccines have been pre-qualified, with the World Health Organization recommending their targeted use in high incidence, endemic regions. However, quality assured information on the spatio-temporal distribution of typhoid fever is lacking, and scale-up of typhoid vaccination is progressing slowly. Environmental surveillance for Salmonella Typhi in sewage and wastewater may be a cost-effective and scalable approach to identify high-burden regions, thereby motivating vaccine introduction. However, many knowledge gaps regarding the use of environmental surveillance for Salmonella Typhi remain, particularly where human wastewater is unmanaged and its disposal reliant on informal drainage channels and natural river systems. Therefore, we conducted a study in Malawi, Blantyre to ascertain the feasibility of environmental surveillance throughout an urban, natural freshwater river system. We measured S. Typhi prevalence in wastewater contaminated rivers and ditches serving a mixed land use environment with diverse population densities. Whilst detection rates of S. Typhi were relatively low, and no obvious spatial pattern of distribution was observed, this study demonstrates that the presence of S. Typhi throughout the year. It suggests that wastewater testing for S. Typhi may offer a sensitive surveillance tool that complements clinical case reporting and may help identify areas to be prioritized for vaccination rollout.
