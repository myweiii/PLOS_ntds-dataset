    "Background": "Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) remains a critical and yet neglected topics in Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), significantly affecting the health of women and girls worldwide. Health workers\u2019 knowledge of FGS is vital to the prevention and management of the disease. This study adopted an implementation research approach to identify and address the existing knowledge gap regarding FGS among healthcare workers in Ghana.",
    "Methods": "This study was a 3-year (2020\u20132022) implementation research applying a pragmatic uncontrolled quasi-experimental study design. The study involved a baseline assessment, FGS training intervention for health workers and student nurses, distribution of FGS educational materials, and an endline assessment. A mixed-method approach was applied to data collection involving health workers from two schistosomiasis endemic districts and across the country. NVIVO 12 and STATA 14 were used for qualitative and quantitative data analysis, respectively.",
    "Results": "Prior to the intervention, the level of awareness about FGS among health workers was less than 8%, and most participants only understood FGS as merely urogenital schistosomiasis in females. In response to this gap, an FGS education intervention in the form of training of health workers, student nurses alongside the distribution of FGS educational materials were carried out. The intervention enhanced health workers\u2019 awareness of FGS to more than 61%, encompassing an enhanced understanding of the disease\u2019s signs and symptoms to more than 60%, as well as its management strategies. However, access to praziquantel, the primary treatment, remained a significant challenge.",
    "Conclusions": "The FGS intervention effectively raised healthcare workers\u2019 awareness and knowledge. Expanding training and improving praziquantel access are essential for optimal FGS management. A multi-faceted approach involving individuals, communities, and the healthcare system is necessary for comprehensive FGS prevention and control."
