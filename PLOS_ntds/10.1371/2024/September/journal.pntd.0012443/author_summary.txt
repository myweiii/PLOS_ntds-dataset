This study addresses Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS), a critical yet neglected issue among Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), particularly impacting women and girls globally. Enhancing healthcare workers’ knowledge of FGS is crucial for effective prevention and management. The research, conducted over three years in Ghana from 2020 to 2022, utilized an implementation research approach.
Initially, baseline assessments revealed alarmingly low awareness (less than 8%) among health workers, who often equated FGS with urogenital schistosomiasis in females. In response, a comprehensive intervention was implemented, including training sessions and distribution of educational materials. This intervention significantly increased awareness among health workers to over 61%, and improved understanding of FGS signs, symptoms, and management strategies to over 60%.
Despite these gains, challenges persist, notably in ensuring access to praziquantel, the primary treatment for schistosomiasis. The study underscores the need for ongoing training initiatives and enhanced medication accessibility to bolster FGS management. It concludes with a call for a holistic approach involving all stakeholders—individuals, communities, and healthcare systems—to advance knowledge and management of FGS effectively.
