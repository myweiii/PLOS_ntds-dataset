Horse flies are well-recognized mechanical vectors of pathogens in humans and domestic animals. Our study on the black horse fly, Osca lata, an abundant species in south-central Chile, sought to explore whether this hematophagous species could act as a vector of microorganisms that can affect domestic animal, and even human, health. We used molecular techniques to detect evidence of three types of microorganisms in samples analyzed from southern Chile. These results indicate that this fly species has the potential to harbor parasitic agents. Further studies are necessary to understand the specific role of horse flies as mechanical vectors and their potential impact on disease transmission in different regions and animal populations.
