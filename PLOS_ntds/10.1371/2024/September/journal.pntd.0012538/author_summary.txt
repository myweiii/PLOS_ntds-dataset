Globally, lymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for elimination by 2030. Since its inception in 2000 until 2018, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) has witnessed a 74% decline in people infected with LF. As we progress towards the elimination goal, more sensitive diagnostic tools are necessary for inclusion in the GPELF diagnostic portfolio. At present, the WHO recommended filariasis test strip (FTS) is extensively used to evaluate the LF elimination programme worldwide. However, FTS is documented to have certain drawbacks. As a part of a multicentric study, we evaluated the field performance of a new diagnostic kit that detects Wuchereria bancrofti filarial antigenemia. The new kit called the Q Filariasis Antigen Test (QFAT), field tested in an LF endemic area in India, had a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 99.7% compared to FTS, and both tests (FTS and QFAT) detected all W. bancrofti microfilaria-positive (100%) individuals. The Cohen’s kappa of 0.97 suggested near-perfect agreement between the test results. The test was easy to perform and interpret in the field and required only 20 μL of capillary blood, and no invalid tests were reported. This study documented that the QFAT has comparable performance characteristics with the currently used FTS in field settings, suggesting it to be a promising diagnostic tool. The pooled analysis of performance characteristics from other geographic areas will enable a decision on its inclusion in the diagnostic portfolio of GPELF.
