Rabies is one of the oldest neglected tropical diseases transmitted to humans, generally by dogs, but wild animals can also act as vectors of the disease. In most cases, a risk-contact with an infected animal without proper prophylaxis results in rabies, and the disease is nearly always fatal. Nevertheless, a few studies have documented the detection of rabies-specific antibodies in people having no history of vaccination, suggesting that exposition to the virus is possible without developing fatal rabies. To further investigate this possibility, we carried out a retrospective serological analysis on 430 sera collected between 2005 and 2008 from rural Gabonese populations. We detected 11 positive samples (2.5%). Three of these positive people was resampled in early 2023 and one was still found positive for rabies-specific antibodies, suggesting that immunity can persist over many years. This study demonstrates that rabies is actively circulating in Gabon and that some unvaccinated individuals living in rural environments can be exposed to the virus and survive. Survival despite exposure to rabies could be associated to the development of a significant and specific humoral response that persists for more than 15 years.
