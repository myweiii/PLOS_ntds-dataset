    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAll animal use involved in this work was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and was performed under the supervision of licensed and, where appropriate, board-certified veterinarians according to International AAALAC accreditation standards.\n\n\nAnimal cohort\nThe first part of this study was retrospective, using n = 20 archived skin samples from L. infantum infected dogs collected between 2011 and 2022, as depicted in the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig 1) [25]. These samples were collected as previously described (23). The second part of this study was prospective (n = 17). All samples were collected with owner/caretaker informed consent from a cohort of U.S. hunting hounds where vertically transmitted L. infantum is enzootic [24]. All dogs were housed communally in packs and naturally infected with L. infantum [26]. LeishVet clinical scores and demographics of dogs are provided (S1 Table).\nSample collection and processing workflow.\n\n\nSample collection\nFor the prospective portion of the study, on the day of sample collection, a veterinarian conducted a physical exam on each dog for clinical signs of leishmaniosis including low body condition score, dermatitis including alopecia, coat condition, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, lethargy, conjunctivitis, and pale mucous membranes. Whole blood and serum were submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry (IDEXX Laboratories Inc.).\nDogs were sedated with dexmedetomidine (Zoetis Inc.) following the manufacterer’s published dosing guidelines. Heart rate and respiratory rate were monitored throughout the procedure. Skin biopsies were taken from the cutaneous marginal pouch of the pinna using 3mm punch biopsies (Integra), and subsequent pressure used to achieve hemostasis. The biopsy site was closed with tissue adhesive (3M), and dogs were reversed with atipamezole (Zoetis Inc.) equivalent to the amount of dexmedetomidine used. All dogs recovered well following sedation. In cases of severe clinical disease when requested by the owner, humane euthanasia per AVMA guidelines was performed. For retrospective studies, exams and physicals were performed in a similar manner, with additional details in Scorza et al [24].\n\n\nDiagnostics and staging\nDNA was isolated from whole blood using the QIAmp Blood DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Real Time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for Leishmania ribosomal DNA was performed as previously described [27].\nConsistent with current LeishVet guidelines, serology was evaluated by Soluble Leishmania Antigen (SLA) ELISA, a quantitative serological assay [23,28,29]. In some retrospective cases, serology was also evaluated with the Dual-Path Platform® Canine Visceral Leishmaniosis (DPP) serological analysis (ChemBios), detecting antibodies against recombinant L. infantum rK28 antigen. Chembios Micro Reader was used for DPP tests to determine quantitative serological status with a reader value > 10 considered as seropositive [30].\nTo standardize categorization and facilitate discussion of clinical severity, the LeishVet staging system was used to categorize clinical severity based on diagnostic PCR and serology, CBC, Chemistry Panel, and physical exam findings [2]. A higher score indicated more severe clinical disease and more advanced CKD.\n\n\nRNAscope and image analysis\nManual RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine skin samples, following the manufacturer’s protocol, to identify L. infantum amastigotes by amastin, and monocytes, a common host cell for L. infantum, by CD14 [31]. Briefly, tissue sections were baked for 15 minutes at 60°C and deparaffinized. Leishmania infantum amastin (LINF_080012100, S1 Fig) and canine CD14 probes (NCBI Reference Sequence XM_843653.5, S1 Fig), mixed 50:1, were hybridized for 2 hours at 40°C, followed by signal amplification and detection with fluorophores (TSA Vivid Fluorophore 650, Tocris Bioscience and Opal 520, Akoya Biosciences). Slides were counterstained with DAPI and mounted using Prolong Gold (P36930, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California).\nImage analysis is outlined in S2 Fig. Briefly, 6–7 fields of view (FoV) for each slide were imaged with a 40X oil-immersion objective (400X magnification) on a Zeiss LSM 980. FoV imaged as z-stacks in 1μm slices from 7 to 14 slices, depending on the thickness of the section or region. Z-stacks were flattened and converted to.tiff files using Fiji [32]. In QuPath, the number of amastin+CD14+, amastin+CD14-, amastin-CD14+ cells, and amastin spots/clusters in each image were counted to evaluate the number of infected monocytes, other infected cells, uninfected monocytes, and parasite burden [33].\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nComparisons of the estimated mean number of infected monocytes, other infected cells (CD14-), and uninfected monocytes between LeishVet stages were performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The estimated mean counts generated by GEE were compared between three groups—Group 1 (LeishVet I), Group 2 (LeishVet II), and Group 3 (LeishVet III & IV)—using the Tukey method. The GEE approach included an exchangeable correlation to account for repeated observations per individual and used robust standard errors. Nonparametric Spearman rank correlations were performed to evaluate correlations between counts, creatinine, and hematocrit because the data was highly skewed. Outliers were identified by ROUT method but kept in the dataset as removal did not change Spearman rank correlations. To further evaluate the relationship between hematocrit and amastin+CD14+ counts, multinomial logistic regression was performed using 3 hematocrit categories as the outcome variable representing moderate/severe anemia, mild anemia, and no anemia: (0,30], (30,37], and (37,60]. Spearman rank correlations were performed using GraphPad PRISM v.10 for Windows (Graphpad Software). All other analysis were performed using R. For all analyses, significance is *p ≤ 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.",
    "Results": "Abundance of infected CD14+ monocytes correlated with dermal parasite burden and infectiousness\nThe influence of the systemic immune response on parasitemia and clinical disease has been described elsewhere [6]. Here, we evaluated the dermal environment, specifically parasitism of inflammatory CD14+ monocyte cells and other cell types, across LeishVet stages and clinicopathology.\nThe demographics of our cohort were consistent with the epidemiology previously seen in this population, with males and adults between 3 and 6 years old over-represented (S1 Table). Consistent with previous microscopy studies of canine leishmaniosis, inflammation was heterogeneously distributed, primarily perivascular and periadnexal in the superficial to mid-dermis [34,35]. Infected monocytes predominately aggregated around hair follicles and glands surrounding hair follicles (Fig 2F–2J). In some LeishVet II and LeishVet III dogs, infected monocytes also began aggregating in the superficial dermis, forming large patches that often coalesced with follicular and glandular inflammatory aggregates (Fig 2K–2O).\nRepresentative images from a LeishVet I dog with multiple hair follicles and adnexal structures with minimal inflammatory infiltrate (A-E). Aggregates of mixed inflammation surrounding the base of hair follicles in a LeishVet IV dog (E). On RNAscope, CD14+ monocytes (G) infected with L. infantum (F) are seen throughout the perifollicular inflammatory aggregate (I). Aggregate of mixed inflammation in the superficial dermis of a LeishVet III dog (J). CD14+ monocytes (L) infected with L. infantum (K) dispersed within the superficial dermal inflammatory aggregate on RNAscope (N). Original magnification: 400X (A), 200X (F), 100X (K), 400X (B–E, G–J, L–O).\nMany samples in the retrospective cohort were collected during a xenodiagnosis study, which quantified dermal parasite burden by PCR and evaluated infectiousness to feeding sand flies of dogs at different stages of clinical disease [24]. Thus, for this subset of individuals (n = 15), we could directly evaluate the relationships between the abundance of infected CD14+ monocytes, as determined here using RNAscope amastin+CD14+ cells, previous estimates of parasite burden derived from qPCR, and infectiousness, measured as the average parasite load per sand fly. We found that the previously estimated dermal parasite burden from qPCR positively correlated with the number of infected CD14+ monocytes (p = 0.0186, r = 0.6079, Fig 3A) and the number of dermal parasites by amastin spots (p = 0.0080, r = 0.6698, Fig 3B). Individual infectiousness also positively correlated with the number of infected CD14+ monocytes (p = 0.0019, r = 0.7471, Fig 3C), and the number of dermal parasites (p < 0.0001, r = 0.8704, Fig 3D).\nEach symbol represents the average infected CD14+ monocyte count for one dog. Average parasite load/sand fly previously calculated and discussed in Scorza, 2021. Statistical outliers indicated with gray squares. Spearman rank correlations remained significant with outliers excluded from analysis.\n\n\nExtent of dermal parasitism varies both between and within LeishVet stages\nDescriptive statistics on RNAscope counts for each LeishVet stage are summarized in S2 Table. The results of the GEE analysis showed that LeishVet I dogs (mild disease) were significantly different from dogs in other LeishVet stages, while LeishVet II and III/IV had counts that were not significantly different (Fig 4). The mean number of infected monocytes for LeishVet II dogs was 3.8 times higher than in LeishVet I dogs (18.8 vs 4.8; p = 0.0023). The mean LeishVet III and IV amastin+CD14+ count was 3.6 times higher than the LeishVet I mean count (17.9 vs 4.8; p = 0.0017). Amastin transcripts were also detected in CD14- cells at approximately 2 times higher in LeishVet III and IV dogs (20.6; p = 0.0154) and LeishVet II dogs (18.8; p = 0.0309) compared to LeishVet I dogs (10.2). Additionally, LeishVet I dogs significantly differed from LeishVet III/IV dogs (p < 0.001) and LeishVet II dogs (p < 0.0001) in the number of uninfected CD14+ monocytes. These differences in monocyte counts were not reflected in the CBC data (n = 27), where aside from 4 dogs, monocyte counts were within the reference range.\nCounts of infected CD14+ monocytes (A), infected CD14- cells (B), and uninfected CD14+ monocytes (C) across LeishVet stages. Each column of symbols is one dog. Each symbol represents the count for one 40X field. The red line highlights the median count for each individual. Generalized estimating equations.\nWhile individual counts varied widely, even within the same LeishVet stage, in LeishVet II dogs with mild clinical signs tended to have low counts, similar to LeishVet I, while dogs with moderate clinical signs tended to have higher counts. This was consistent with previous work, where dogs with mild CanL had less inflammation, by semiquantitative histological scoring, and parasite burden, by IHC and qPCR, than dogs with more advanced disease [24,34,35].\n\n\nAbundance of infected CD14+ monocytes inversely correlated with kidney function measured by serum creatinine\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) due to progressive renal damage is commonly described in CanL, and the LeishVet classification system uses the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) CKD staging guidelines to differentiate clinical severity [2,7,8]. LeishVet I and II dogs have IRIS Stage 1 CKD, while IRIS Stage 2 CKD classifies a dog as LeishVet III [2,36]. Progressive CKD causes widespread physiological derangement due to electrolyte imbalances and accumulation of toxic waste products, such as urea, in the blood [37]. As uremia has been shown to impair systemic immune cell function, including monocytes [37–41], we examined the relationship between serum creatinine and the number of infected CD14+ monocytes in the skin. While not statistically significant, there was a trend suggesting an inverse correlation between infected CD14+ monocytes and serum creatinine, with cell counts decreasing 1.19-fold as creatinine increased 4.5-fold between IRIS Stage 1 CKD and IRIS Stage 2–4 CKD (Fig 5).\nAverage infected CD14+ monocyte counts for all dogs with the reference range for creatinine shaded. Spearman rank correlation.\n\n\nAnemia significantly correlates with increased numbers of infected CD14+ monocytes\nModerate to severe cases of CanL frequently present with a mild to moderate non-regenerative anemia [2]. Based on the relationship between bone marrow and hematologic/erythroid abnormalities in CanL, we investigated the relationship between the number of infected dermal CD14+ monocytes and hematocrit (HCT), an indicator of anemia on routinely run bloodwork. Infected CD14+ monocyte numbers were negatively correlated with HCT (p = 0.0098, r = -0.4798, Fig 6A [42]). The average number of infected monocytes was 2.33 fold higher in dogs with mild anemia (HCT 30–37%) compared to dogs with no anemia (HCT > 37%), and 3.23 fold higher in dogs with moderate to severe anemia (HCT <30%) compared to dogs with no anemia [42].\nAverage infected CD14+ monocyte count for all dogs (A) and for LeishVet II dogs (B) with the hematocrit reference range shaded. Each symbol is one dog. Light grey symbols are dogs with mild anemia (hematocrit 30–37%). Dark grey symbols are dogs with moderate anemia (hematocrit 20–29%). Black symbols are dogs with severe anemia (hematocrit < 20%). Spearman rank correlation.\nBecause the renal pathology in progressive CKD can also cause anemia, we repeated the analysis, focusing only on LeishVet II dogs. Abundance of infected CD14+ monocytes remained correlated with decreasing hematocrit (p = 0.0393, r = -0.5416, Fig 6B). LeishVet II dogs also had similar fold changes in infected CD14+ monocytes–a 2.25-fold increase between dogs with no anemia vs mild anemia, and a 3.45 fold increase between dogs with no anemia vs moderate/severe anemia.\nMultinomial logistic regression analysis did not identify factors significantly influencing HCT values. However, when predicted probabilities of HCT based on infected CD14+ monocyte counts were calculated, no anemia (HCT > 37%) had the lowest probability, which consistently decreased as the average number of infected CD14+ monocytes increased.\n\n\nAnemia was associated with greater infectiousness\nBased on the significant correlations between dermal infected and uninfected CD14+ monocyte counts and skin parasite burden, infectiousness to sand flies, and hematocrit, we wanted to determine if hematocrit correlated with infectiousness. Within skin samples obtained after xenodiagnosis, a lower hematocrit (i.e. anemia) correlated with increased average parasite load/sand fly (p = 0.0022, r = -0.8364, Fig 7). The average parasites per sand fly increased almost 6-fold between dogs with no anemia vs moderate or severe anemia and increased approximately 2.5-fold between dogs with no anemia vs mild anemia (2.40) and between mild vs moderate or severe anemia (2.48).\nEach symbol represents the average value for one dog, and the reference range for hematocrit is shaded.

    "Discussion": "This study builds upon previous findings on the relationships between dermal parasitism, inflammation distribution, clinical disease, and transmissibility [24,34,35,43]. Consistent with this previous work, we found that dermal parasitism and inflammation significantly increased once dogs developed clinical signs. Dogs with a low hematocrit (an indicator of anemia) had significantly more infected CD14+ monocytes in the skin and were more infectious to feeding sand flies than dogs without anemia. Importantly, we did not find any significant associations with increasing creatinine (an indicator of chronic kidney disease). Our data suggests that parasitism of key hematopoietic organs and resultant anemia influences infectiousness to sand flies by affecting the systemic and dermal immune environments and dermal parasitism.\nIn addition to infected CD14+ monocytes, CD14- cells were identified on RNAscope. These cells could represent an uncommon host cell type, such as a fibroblast, or a subtype of phagocytic cell that does not express CD14, such as some populations of canine dendritic cells and monocytes [44–46]. Additional analysis of the transcriptional profile and protein expression of these cells will enable more accurate identification and evaluation of their role in dermal parasitism and infectiousness to sand fly vectors.\nBecause renal failure and hematologic abnormalities in CanL result from different pathologic mechanisms, we hypothesize that this affects how they influence the dermal environment, dermal parasitism, and–ultimately—infectiousness (Fig 8). Advanced CKD causes uremia, acid-base imbalances, and other physiologic derangements that create a systemically inhospitable environment [37]. As part of the generalized immunosuppression, chronic uremia causes monocytes to become more pro-inflammatory but less able to phagocytize or present antigen [41]. In addition to impairment of monocytes, the common host cell for L. infantum, chronic uremia also affects the skin, where parasite transmission occurs, through damage to the dermal vasculature [37,47]. Consequently, a harsher dermal environment in LeishVet III and IV dogs with advanced, chronic CKD may adversely affects both infiltrating immune cells and any Leishmania amastigotes they harbor, decreasing parasite viability and host infectiousness (Fig 8).\nProposed mechanisms listed in blue text. Created by Soomin Koh using BioRender.\nMultiple pathologic mechanisms in CanL can contribute to anemia [12,13], but we hypothesize that bone marrow pathology plays a significant role, as it is the primary hematopoietic organ. Infiltration of parasitized cells in bone marrow crowds out progenitor cells and shift the cytokine environment by favoring production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IFNγ, that inhibit erythropoiesis, which can result in anemia [13–15,48–50]. In addition to inhibiting erythropoiesis and creating anemia, bone marrow parasitism could promote the accumulation of infected and uninfected CD14+ monocytes in the skin by facilitating entry of parasitized cells into circulation and dispersal to peripheral tissues (Fig 8). However, other pathologic mechanisms, such as increased hemophagocytosis, or organs, such as the spleen, could be driving the relationship between anemia, dermal parasitism, and infectiousness [12,13].\nThis work builds on previous research illustrating the role of dogs with mild to moderate clinical CanL to the epidemiology of Leishmania. Current public health interventions often do not target this population, focusing primarily on dogs with severe clinical disease. Further education of veterinarians and public health officials about this population, particularly the correlation between infectiousness, dermal parasite burden, and anemia, would help increase awareness and inform interventions. Additionally, further research into the mechanisms linking anemia, dermal parasitism, and infectiousness is needed to identify effective treatment strategies."
