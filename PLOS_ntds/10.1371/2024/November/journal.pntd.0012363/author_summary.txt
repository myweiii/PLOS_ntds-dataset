Dogs infected with Leishmania can transmit parasites to humans and other dogs through sand flies. This causes human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Public health interventions removing clinically ill dogs from the population have not significantly decreased rates of human or canine disease. Additionally, studies found that dogs with mild to moderate clinical disease transmitted the most parasites to feeding sand flies. We evaluated skin sections from L. infantum-infected dogs and characterized the dermal and systemic factors associated with infectiousness to sand flies. We found that the number of parasitized immune cells positively correlated with infectiousness to sand flies. Additionally, anemia, measured by a decreasing hematocrit, significantly correlated with increased parasitized dermal immune cells and infectiousness to sand flies. In contrast, parasitized dermal immune cells did not significantly change as chronic kidney disease, measured by creatinine, progressed, even though these were the sickest animals based on the LeishVet clinical scoring system. These initial findings suggest that early host cell-parasite interactions underlying clinical parameters, more than overall clinical severity, influences infectiousness to sand flies. Public health initiatives should focus on breaking the cycle of zoonotic infection by providing insecticide intervention to dogs most infectious to sand flies.
