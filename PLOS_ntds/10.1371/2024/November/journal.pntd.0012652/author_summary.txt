Melioidosis, caused by the soil-dwelling bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, it remains a potentially fatal disease. The clinical manifestations are varied, and the lack of laboratory support in Cambodia leads to underreporting. Limited genetic data are available for B. pseudomallei in Cambodia; this study provides new insights into the genetic characteristics of this bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility in the country, benefiting public health and safety. Using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), we confirm that Cambodian clinical isolates are closely related to the Southeast Asian cluster, particularly those from Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, reflecting the regional endemicity. This study also reveals new sequence types and antibiotic resistance to the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination. To further our understanding, a One Health approach, incorporating human, environmental (mainly soil), and animal compartments, is essential to decipher the epidemiology of B. pseudomallei in Cambodia.
