    "Background": "The city of Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire has increasingly faced multiple outbreaks of Aedes mosquito-borne arboviral diseases (e.g., dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF)) during the recent years, 2017–2024. Thus, we assessed and compared Aedes aegypti larval and adult population dynamics and Stegomyia indices in four urbanized areas with differential arboviral incidences in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire.",
    "Methods": "From August 2019 to July 2020, we sampled Aedes mosquito immatures (larvae and pupae), adults and breeding habitats in Anono and Gbagba with high arboviral incidences and Ayakro and Entente with low arboviral incidences in the Abidjan city, using standardized methods. Sampling was conducted in the peridomestic and domestic (indoors and outdoors) premises during short dry season (SDS), short rainy season (SRS), long dry season (LDS) and long rainy season (LRS). The abdomens and ovaries of Ae. aegypti females were examined to determine their blood-meal and parity statuses. Stegomyia indices (container index: CI, house index: HI and Breteau index: BI), blood-meal status and parity rates were compared by study sites and seasons and with the World Health Organization (WHO)-established epidemic thresholds.",
    "Results": "Overall, Aedes and arboviral risk indices were high and similar between the four study areas. In total, 86,796 mosquitoes were identified and dominated by Ae. aegypti species (97.14%, 84,317/86,796). The most productive larval breeding habitats were tires, discarded containers and water storage containers. CI, HI, and BI in Anono (22.4%, 33.5% and 89.5), Ayakro (23.1%, 43.8% and 91.0), Entente (15.9%, 24.8% and 48.5) and Gbagba (23.3%, 43.0% and 102.0) were high in the respective study sites. Stegomyia indices were higher than the WHO-established epidemic thresholds during any seasons for DEN, and LRS and SRS for YF. The numbers of Ae. aegypti-positive breeding sites were higher in the domestic premises (68.0%, 900/1,324) than in the peridomestic premises (32.0%, 424/1,324). In the domestic premises, Ae. aegypti-positive breeding sites (94.6%, 851/4,360) and adult individuals (93.4%, 856/916) were mostly found outdoors of houses. Aedes aegypti adult females were mostly unfed (51.3%, 203/396), followed by blood-fed (22.2%, 88/396), gravid (13.9%, 55/396) and half-gravid (12.6%, 50/396), and had parity rate of 49.7% (197/396) that was comparable between the study sites.",
    "Conclusions": "The city of Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire is highly infested with Ae. aegypti which showed comparable ecological patterns across study sites and seasons. Thus, the local communities are exposed to high and permanent risks of transmission of DEN and YF viruses that were above the WHO-established epidemic thresholds throughout. The results provide a baseline for future vector studies needed to further characterize the observed patterns of local Ae. aegypti abundances and behaviors, and risks of transmission of these arboviruses. Community-based larval source management of identified productive containers might reduce Ae. aegypti numbers and risks of transmission of Aedes-borne arboviruses in Abidjan, and other sub-Saharan African cities."
