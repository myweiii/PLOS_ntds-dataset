Bangladesh experienced an unprecedented dengue surge in 2019. This cross sectional study was done in 3 hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh spanning from 1st July to 31st December, 2019 enrolling a total of 1978 participants. We observed a shift of clinical presentations and varied laboratory alterations in the severe groups which was portrayed according to national guideline case definitions. Most common co- morbidities were hypertension (4.5%). The major mode of bleeding was melaena (12%). Total 13 (0.7%) patients succumbed to death. The management received by these patients were also elaborated. Although Bangladesh is a hyper endemic region, the serotype survey is rarely done because of logistic and financial constraints. However it has become a burning need to study the infecting serotype of the severe cases to help navigate the control measures and predict the atypical manifestations and also for future vaccine deployment. Here, 81 samples were serotyped and most were serotyped as DENV-3 (79%), followed by DENV 2 (7.4%). Interestingly we also found cases co infected with these two serotypes (13.6%). These strains were sequenced and further molecular analysis were performed. This study presents the first instance of heterogeneous co-infection with several serotypes since 2000 in Bangladesh.
