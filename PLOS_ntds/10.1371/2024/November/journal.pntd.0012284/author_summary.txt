Snakebite envenoming often occurs due to unnecessary human-snake conflicts. Fear of snakes is a key factor in driving this conflict which frequently results in killing snakes. To protect humans from snakebites and snakes from humans, it is critical to estimate the level of snake phobia among vulnerable communities. Therefore, in this study, we used a robust online questionnaire (SNAQ12) to measure the level of snake phobia among members of the public in India, which is the capital of snakebites. SNAQ12 was developed in English and a local language, Tamil and validated before disseminating to members of the public through several methods. We received over 2000 responses, and the data analysis confirmed the internal consistency and robustness of this questionnaire for Indian communities. The data demonstrated that males across all age groups are more phobic to snakes than females in India. The phobia was not dependent on any other factors such as age and education levels. While this study has some limitations, it forms the basis for further research to determine the level of phobia before and after snakebites and develop robust strategies to tackle this condition. We believe that preventing and treating snake phobia will aid in mitigating snakebite burden and promoting snake conservation in India.
