Benzimidazole derivatives, including albendazole and mebendazole, are widely used anthelmintics known for their broad spectrum of activity and general tolerability. Some adverse reactions have been reported with benzimidazole derivatives, including hematological, immune, neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and skin disorders. This is the first analysis of serious adverse events reported with benzimidazole derivatives using the WHO global pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase. The study identifies potential pharmacovigilance signals for benzimidazole derivatives, including increased reporting of bone marrow failure, hypoplastic anemia, leukopenia, and hepatic disorders. It also reveals that albendazole is more frequently reported in several serious adverse events compared to other benzimidazole derivatives and anthelmintic drugs, particularly for hematological and hepatotoxic effects. We have also highlighted a new signal, not mentioned in the summaries of product characteristics, for benzimidazole derivatives. These findings highlight the importance of careful monitoring when using benzimidazole derivatives and suggest the need for further studies to confirm these observations and explore the underlying mechanisms.
