    "Background": "Benzimidazole derivatives are widely used anthelmintic drugs, particularly in mass campaigns for intestinal parasitosis treatment. Despite their generally good safety profile, serious adverse reactions have been reported. This study aims to identify potential pharmacovigilance signals for benzimidazole derivatives using disproportionality analysis in the WHO database.",
    "Methodology": "A case/non-case study was conducted using data from the WHO VigiBase database (2000\u20132023). Cases were individual case safety reports (ICSRs) where at least one suspected serious adverse event of interest was reported, while non-cases were ICSRs reporting any adverse events other than the serious adverse events of interest. Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess disproportionate reporting. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounding factors and a sensitivity analysis with imputed missing data was performed.",
    "Principal findings": "Among 19,068 serious reports analyzed, significant disproportionality signals were found for benzimidazole derivatives compared to other anthelmintic drugs, notably for bone marrow failure and hypoplastic anemia (adjusted ROR 9.44 [5.01\u201318.9]), serious leukopenia (3.89 [2.64\u20135.76]), serious hepatic disorders (3.10 [2.59\u20133.71]), hepatitis (2.88, 95% CI 2.29\u20133.63) and serious urticaria (2.02, 95% CI 1.36\u20132.99). We have also highlighted a new signal not mentioned in the summaries of product characteristics for seizures with benzimidazole derivatives. Secondary analysis revealed these signals were primarily reported with albendazole.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study identified potential pharmacovigilance signals for serious hematological and hepatic adverse events for benzimidazole derivatives, particularly albendazole. New signal for benzimidazole derivatives has been described for seizures. These findings underscore the need for vigilant monitoring during benzimidazole derivatives use and warrant further pharmacoepidemiologic studies to confirm these signals and investigate underlying mechanisms."
