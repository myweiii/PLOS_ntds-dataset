Urogenital schistosomiasis, categorized as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization (WHO), affects approximately 150 million individuals globally, predominantly in resource-limited regions of Africa. Gold standard diagnosis relies on visually identifying of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine samples using optical microscopy. However, novel diagnostic techniques based on digital image analysis by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are a suitable alternative for schistosomiasis diagnosis. In this technical proof-of-principle study, a small number (n = 24) of urine sediment samples were analyzed using AI models in non-endemic settings. The study involved manually labeling S. haematobium eggs in digital images, for training YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models for automatic egg detection, and employing MobileNetv3Large, EfficientNetv2, and NasNetLarge models for binary classification of erythrocytes/leukocytes. A robotized microscope system facilitated automated sample movement and focusing. Results indicated high precision (99.3%) and recall (99.4%) for S. haematobium detection with YOLOv5x. NasNetLarge achieved 85.6% accuracy in erythrocyte/leukocyte detection. Overall, YOLOv5x for egg detection and NasNetLarge for cell classification proved most effective. The study suggests AI-based techniques offer a cost-effective alternative to conventional microscopy for diagnosing S. haematobium infections. The automated systemâ€™s robustness and simplicity could facilitate widespread adoption in laboratories worldwide.
