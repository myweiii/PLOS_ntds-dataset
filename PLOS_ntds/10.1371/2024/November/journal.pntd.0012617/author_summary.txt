Evidence has long pointed to a significant burden of liver diseases in certain regions of the Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), primarily attributed to the Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) liver fluke. This parasite is transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish and fish products. Chronic OV infection can lead to cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a fatal bile duct cancer. The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of suspected CCA in rural OV-endemic communities in the southern part of Lao PDR. We conducted a cross-sectional study in selected communities within Savannakhet and Champasack provinces.
Adults aged 35 years and older were enrolled and underwent liver disease assessment through abdominal ultrasound. OV infection was diagnosed via fecal examination, while lifestyle risk factors like smoking and alcohol consumption were evaluated through face-to-face interviews. Additionally, diabetes mellitus and hepatitis B infection status were determined serologically.
We found a high prevalence of suspected bile duct cancer (CCA) at 7.2% overall. This rate was found higher in men compared to women, and to increase with age. Most participants (88.3%) were infected with OV, posing the highest risk for suspected CCA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.4). Additionally, a history of cholecystectomy (aOR 2.7) was a significant predictor of bile duct cancer. These results provide crucial insights for controlling liver morbidity in Lao PDR, emphasizing the urgent need to address OV infection and associated risk factors for CCA in affected communities.
