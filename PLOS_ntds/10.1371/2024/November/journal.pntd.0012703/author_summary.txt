It is estimated that 6–7 million individuals worldwide are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD), a neglected illness that impacts public health. Chronic cardiopathy is the most severe manifestation of CD, an inflammatory and fibrotic process that can progress to heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Host genetics may be a determining factor in the progression of CD. In a group of chronic CD patients, we evaluated genetic polymorphisms of members of the renin-angiotensin system (ACE I/D; AGTR1 variants), essential in regulating blood pressure and cardiovascular events. ACE D allele carriers and AGTR1 rs5186 +1166AA genotype present worse LVEF. Thus, variants of ACE and AT1R genes may be involved in the outcome of Chagas’ heart disease. Although studying a low number of patients with severe cardiopathy, our data suggest that etiological treatment years before therapy with cardioprotectors (ACE inhibitors/AT1R blockers) reduced serum levels of TNF, an inflammatory cytokine important in cardiac pathology, and improved LVEF. This paves the way for ACE and AGTR1 genotyping, and adoption of therapeutic regimens may be explored as strategies for precision medicine in CD patients. Replicating of these findings in other cohorts is essential.
