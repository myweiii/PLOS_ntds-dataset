Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) is a prominent food-borne parasite prevalent in regions such as China, particularly in Guangxi. C. sinensis is classified as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer for cholangiocarcinoma. Recently, C. sinensis has also been linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the mechanisms through which C. sinensis infection influences HCC progression, particularly through angiogenesis, are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed clinical data from 947 HCC patients, comparing those with and without C. sinensis infection. Our findings confirmed that C. sinensis infection was associated with shorter survival outcomes. Furthermore, C. sinensis (+) HCC patients exhibited significantly higher rates of metastasis and MVI compared to C. sinensis (-) HCC patients. Notably, C. sinensis infection led to an upregulation of microvessel density (MVD) in HCC tissues. Additionally, C. sinensis (+) HCC patients exhibited significantly higher levels of circulating angiogenesis-related biomarkers and overexpression of angiogenesis-related genes. These results suggest that C. sinensis may promote HCC progression by inducing angiogenesis. Our study sheds new light on the carcinogenic potential of C. sinensis and highlights the potential of anti-angiogenic therapies as a promising approach to improve outcomes for HCC patients with C. sinensis infection.
