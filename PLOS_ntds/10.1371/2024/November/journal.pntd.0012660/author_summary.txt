Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by fungi, and sharing accurate information about it is essential, especially in regions where the disease is common. YouTube, a popular platform for health information, contains many videos related to mycetoma, but their quality and reliability have not been fully assessed. In this study, we analyzed 73 YouTube videos on mycetoma to evaluate their quality and trustworthiness using established scoring methods. We found that most videos were of generally high quality, though their reliability was moderate. Videos created by healthcare professionals were significantly more reliable and of higher quality than those produced by non-professionals. Interestingly, longer videos and older uploads tended to score better. However, viewer engagement, such as the number of views, likes, or comments, did not seem to be linked to video quality. Our findings highlight the importance of expert involvement in producing reliable health content and the need for continued efforts to improve the accuracy of health information online.
