Our research tackles the challenges of diagnosing anthrax, a severe disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, especially in regions where similar bacteria coexist. Traditional methods of identifying anthrax involve microscopic examination, bacterial culture, and genetic testing. We aimed to enhance the accuracy and speed of genetic testing to identify anthrax directly from samples, without the need for bacterial culture, thereby reducing the associated risks.
We analysed blood samples from wildlife deaths in Kruger National Park, South Africa, where anthrax is common. By applying advanced genetic tests, we found that over half of the samples tested positive for anthrax. We discovered that combining certain genetic markers significantly improved the accuracy of these tests, reaching up to 100% accuracy. This method helps reduce false positives and enhances the reliability of anthrax detection.
Our findings suggest that using a combination of genetic markers can accurately identify anthrax directly from blood samples, potentially bypassing the need for bacterial culture. This approach not only speeds up the diagnostic process but also improves disease monitoring and management. This is particularly important for regions like southern Africa, where anthrax poses a significant threat to wildlife health. Our work contributes to better conservation efforts and a deeper understanding of how to control anthrax outbreaks effectively.
