Aedes albopictus (Asian Tiger mosquito) relies on vision to select oviposition sites, favoring small, dark containers during twilight hours. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we blindfolded female mosquitoes and screened their transcriptomes, identifying rho-l and kh genes as potential vision-related factors. Gene editing experiments provided crucial insights into the roles of rho-l and kh in Ae. albopictus oviposition behavior. Mutants lacking functional rho-l (rho-lâ–³807) exhibited a significant decrease in their sensitivity to long-wavelength red light, leading to a reduced ability to locate preferred oviposition sites. Similarly, khw mutants displayed a decreased ability to respond to variations in daily brightness, as well as a reduced capacity to discriminate between different colors. This impaired color discrimination and sensitivity to brightness changes directly affected their ability to identify preferred oviposition sites. These findings highlight the crucial role of rho-l and kh in mosquito visual-mediated oviposition site selection, providing valuable insights into mosquito behavior and potential targets for vector control.
