Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a bacterium that induces mild to severe life-threatening syndromes in humans and animals worldwide. The severity of NTS is affected by the serovars involved, the presence of the virulence genes, and the ability to resist antimicrobials. In this study, we followed an integrated approach involving three key sectors (humans, the food chain (food), animals, and the environment) (one-health approach), which is highly recommended in areas where their interaction is high (dairy farms). This study confirmed that the pathogen was circulating in the human-dairy interface. Six serovars were detected, which were dominated by S. Uganda, S. enterica subsp. diarizonae, and S. Typhimurium. Of the isolates, 89.3% were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 46.4% were multidrug-resistant. Hence, our research confirmed that the human-dairy interface is one source of future outbreaks of NTS. The serovars, virulent genes, and resistant character of isolates are suggestive of the tendency of the infection to become more severe and the potential to induce high mortality in the community. Therefore, intervention measures have to be implemented.
