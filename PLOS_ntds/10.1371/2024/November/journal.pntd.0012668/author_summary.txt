Previous studies on the burden of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) have focused on short-term investigations and concomitant with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This might limit a more comprehensive understanding of CL dynamics. Furthermore, in Brazilian research, there is a lack of linkage between studies and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) along with spatial and temporal analysis techniques, especially in CL. Our data showed a reduction in DALY and YLD rates. However, there was a significant increase in YLL, predominantly among adults and the elderly, and in previously unrecorded regions. It is important to emphasize the geographical disproportion of the YLD rate, given the formation of high-risk clusters in the North and Central-West regions. These results have significant implications for public health, as well as providing valuable information for directing efforts and resources. Studying the burden of CL in Brazil is crucial because it is among the countries with the highest number of global cases. Therefore, linking this study to spatial analysis has provided new insights and territorial patterns, as well as previously unknown manifestations. Additionally, it serves as a global benchmark that can help not only Brazil but also other endemic countries understand the dynamics of this disease and determine which political and surveillance measures can be taken.
