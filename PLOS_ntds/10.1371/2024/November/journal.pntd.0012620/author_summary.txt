Surgical outcomes and hospitalization costs are crucial considerations for surgeons when selecting a treatment approach. This retrospective study compared perioperative outcomes and hospitalization costs between radical and conservative surgery for hepatic cystic echinococcosis. We analyzed data from patients treated at the First Peopleâ€™s Hospital of Kashi Prefecture from July 1, 2012, to October 1, 2023, using propensity score matching to minimize selection bias.
Our findings revealed that while radical surgery entailed longer operative times, greater blood loss, and higher costs, there were no significant differences in short-term outcomes such as mortality, complication rates, or length of hospital stay compared to conservative surgery. This suggests that conservative surgery may be a viable alternative, especially in resource-limited settings where the complexity and high costs of radical surgery pose challenges.
Importantly, our study focused on short-term outcomes and hospitalization costs. Future research should incorporate long-term follow-up to assess the recurrence rates associated with each surgical approach.
