Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Ethiopia posing a significant public health burden. Schistosomiasis causes significant morbidity and reduces economic productivity as affected people frequently have chronic health conditions. This study investigated the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni and the risk factors linked with it in the Alamata District of Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia. This study revealed a considerable prevalence of S.mansoni in the local community, notably among children and young adults. The study also identified several contributing factors to the high prevalence of S.mansoni. Conditions that promote contact with contaminated water such as proximity to water bodies, having direct contact with water while crossing, swimming habits and poor protective shoe wearing behaviors were among the potential factors associated with risk of S.mansoni infection in the Alamata District of Tigray Region. Furthermore, the findings underscore the need for integrated control strategies such as improved water and sanitation, regular health education campaigns, and community-based interventions to reduce the burden of Schistosomiasis in the study area in particular and in the region in general. Overall, this study sheds light on to the epidemiology of S.mansoni in Alamata District and highlights the importance of addressing risk factors through targeted public health interventions to improve health outcomes in the affected communities.
