In the fight against Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), a devastating disease transmitted by tsetse flies, significant progress has been made through international efforts. Despite the annual cases being reduced to under 1,000, the World Health Organization aims to eliminate gHAT transmission by 2030. A key component of this strategy involves innovative approaches, such as the use of Tiny Targets–small, cost-effective, insecticide-treated screens that attract and kill tsetse flies. This study focuses on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which bears a substantial burden of gHAT cases, estimating the annual cost of vector control using Tiny Targets in the Yasa Bonga health district. The analysis, conducted from the provider’s perspective, reveals an annual economic cost of 120,000 USD for protecting a 1,925 km2 area. This translates to 5.30 USD per target used, 11 USD per target deployed, 573 USD per linear km treated, and 62 USD per km2 protected. These findings, comparable to costs in other countries, offer valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers, guiding evidence-based decisions on cost-effective strategies for gHAT control.
