Trichuris trichiura, commonly known as the whipworm, is a parasitic worm that is transmitted through soil and primarily affects children in tropical and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends controlling this parasite by periodically giving benzimidazole medications in areas where the parasite is endemic. However, studies have shown that the efficacy of this treatment is limited against T. trichiura.
One major challenge in monitoring and evaluating treatment efficacy is the need for highly sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. Some studies have investigated using multiplex real-time PCR to detect T. trichiura and other similar parasites, but few have tested its effectiveness in clinical trials.
Our study aimed to assess whether real-time PCR could be used as a diagnostic tool in randomized clinical trials evaluating treatment efficacy. Our findings show that real-time PCR agrees well with traditional diagnostic methods and could be a viable alternative for use in these trials, provided that standard guidelines are established to ensure consistent use of real-time PCR techniques.
