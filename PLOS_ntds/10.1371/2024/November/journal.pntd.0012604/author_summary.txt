Recently, a live attenuated CHIKV was approved as the first vaccine to combat the virus infection. Despite the general safety of this vaccine, several severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions have been reported, and the long-term safety should be assessed after marketing, highlighting the urgent need to develop more safe and effective vaccines against CHIVK. The rAAV vectored vaccines against several viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, HCV and Nipah virus have been developed. Here, we constructed a rAAV capsid serotype 1 based CHIKV vaccine that encoded the full-length structural proteins of CHIKV (rAAV1-CHIKV-SP), and evaluated the safety, immunogenicity and protection effect of the vaccine. The results demonstrated that a single dose immunization of the vaccine induced high level and long-lasting CHIKV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies, and completely protected against CHIKV challenge in C57BL/6 mice. Our study suggested that the rAAV1-CHIKV-SP represents a promising vaccine candidate to prevent CHIKV infection.
