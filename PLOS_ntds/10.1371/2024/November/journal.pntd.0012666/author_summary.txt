In Australia, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) cases have been on the rise since the 1970s; characterised by self-limiting enteritis, some NTS infections can result in systemic infections called invasive NTS disease. Salmonella enterica serovar Panama is a leading iNTS serovar in Australia. This study characterised the genomic epidemiology of S. Panama, identifying two lineages circulating in Australia over two decades and placing them within a global context. It also investigated the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms of S. Panama, with multi-drug resistance commonly observed. Further, it identified the first plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant S. Panama in Australia. We additionally examined the characteristics of S. Panama-mediated host-pathogen interactions in both epithelial and macrophage cells lines, providing the first insight into the infection dynamics of this understudied pathogen. Thus, this study combines genomics and in vitro infection experiments to understand the pathogenic behaviour of the neglected iNTS S. Panama.
