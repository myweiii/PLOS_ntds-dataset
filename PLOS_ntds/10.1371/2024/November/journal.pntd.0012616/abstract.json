    "Abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are causes of endemic febrile disease among Kenyan children. The exposure risk to these infections is highly multifactorial and linked to environmental factors and human behavior. We investigated relationships between household, socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral risk factors for DENV and CHIKV seropositivity and seroconversion in four settlements in Kenya. We prospectively followed a pediatric cohort of 3,445 children between 2014–2018. We utilized the Kaplan–Meier curves to describe the temporal patterns of seroconversion among tested participants. We employed logistic regression built using generalized linear mixed models, to identify potential exposure risk factors for DENV and CHIKV seroconversion and seropositivity."
