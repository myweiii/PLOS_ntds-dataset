Schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease whose transmission in Brazil is related to human contact with water contaminated by the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The national prevalence survey from 2011â€“2015 revealed a decline in schistosomiasis positivity rates to 1%, marking areas in the Middle Paranapanema river basin in SP-Brazil (MP) as low endemic. However, control programs face additional challenges due to the new dynamics connected with the social, environmental, and economic developments fueled by an urban-industrial urbanization model in the MP region. To address this, our study proposes a landscape-based methodological approach that categorizes and assesses schistosomiasis transmission potential in different regional landscape patterns. By combining remote sensing, environmental, socioeconomic, epidemiological, and malacological data, a multidisciplinary team identified ten distinct landscape-unit types associated with varying levels of schistosomiasis transmission potential. Using a decision-tree based machine learning classification method, we mapped schistosomiasis risk across the basin at a landscape scale. The identification of landscape features associated with schistosomiasis transmission risk will help to fine tune suitable surveillance and control strategies at both local and regional levels. Our findings indicate that landscape-units with higher transmission potentials are less interconnected across the basin. Low connectivity at the landscape scale, in part, explains the MP low endemic areas, contributing to the low endemicity in the Middle Paranapanema region. This approach offers promise for local and regional schistosomiasis management efforts aimed at eradicating the disease.
