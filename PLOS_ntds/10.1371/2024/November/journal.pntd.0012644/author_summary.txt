In our study, we discovered a surprising connection between mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease. We analyzed data from a large city over several years, including the year 2020, when these restrictions were rigorously in place. Our focus was to understand how the limitation of peopleâ€™s movements influenced the dynamics of dengue transmission. The results were revealing. We observed that, with fewer people moving around, there was a delay in the emergence of dengue in some areas and a decrease in cases in initially affected regions. We utilized both neural network and Interrupted Time Series (ITS) models to predict potential outcomes in the absence of mobility restrictions. Our analysis with the neural network model estimated that approximately 20,000 cases of dengue were prevented, while the ITS model indicated a reduction of about 7,000 cases during this period. This study expands our understanding of dengue, highlighting the importance of human mobility patterns in the spread of this disease. These findings are especially significant for urban areas and have important implications for public health strategies in similar contexts.
