Although, filarial parasites can in theory affect the oro-facial space little is to date known on whether oro-facial involvement occurs in the course of filarial infection. Therefore, we conducted a review of the published scientific literature to provide a first estimate on the characteristics of oro-facial filariasis. We identified 68 articles published between 1864 and 2022 totaling up to 111 cases, which we further summarized and described in detail. The fact that the article type ‘case report’ was the solely published study design suggests that this constitutes a neglected research topic. The vast majority of patients had oro-facial dirofilariasis which manifested exclusively as nodules or swellings in different tissue locations. These nodules and swellings were mostly asymptomatic and therefore, cancer is an important differential diagnosis. Further prospective studies are now needed to understand better the frequency, nature, and public health impact of oro-facial filariasis.
