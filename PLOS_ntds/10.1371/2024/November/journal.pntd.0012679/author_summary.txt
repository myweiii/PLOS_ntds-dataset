Infections from dengue and other arboviral mosquito-borne diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes are on the rise globally, with Africa being no exception. Their advances are driven by anthropogenic factors, such as rapid urbanisation, globalisation, and climate change. Yet, knowledge of dengue epidemiology and burden on the African continent, and how to enhance preparedness is scarce. Navigating the complexities of predicting the spread/outbreaks of the dengue or the presence/abundance of Aedes vector mosquitoes, is challenging due to the complex interactions between multiple factors involved in the transmission. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in developing various quantitative methods to predict spread and outbreaks in different regions in the world. Here, we conducted a systematic review to shed light on existing quantitative modelling approaches for dengue and/or its vector Aedes mosquitoes in Africa, focusing on methodology, data sources, covariates used, model performance and validation. Our study revealed several shortcomings in current modelling practices in Africa and emphasized the need for real-time primary predictor data and more comprehensive reporting of model development techniques and validation processes. This review offers an evidence-based framework for improving future modelling practices, to develop more accurate and robust dengue prediction models, tailored for African contexts.
