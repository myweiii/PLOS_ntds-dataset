The rare diffuse form of cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) manifests as non-ulcerative lesions across the skin. This disease is caused by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis that grows uncontrollably in lesions. A complete picture of host-pathogen interactions is not fully understood in DCL. We used RNA-sequencing of patient biopsies to observe host and parasite transcriptomes within this disease. In established chronic disease we discovered (1) atypical B cells producing a surprisingly dominant IgG4 isotype infiltrated lesions, (2) an absence of cytotoxic and TH2 T cell responses, and (3) host macrophage responses representing a regulatory macrophage phenotype that struggles to eliminate intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. The cellular phenotypes and activation states identified in this work could be targeted for better therapeutics and vaccines for leishmaniasis. High parasite numbers in lesions allowed us to identify highly expressed parasite genes in diffuse and localized disease, again serving as potential therapeutic or vaccine targets.
