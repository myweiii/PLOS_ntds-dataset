Lymphatic Filariasis is a significant health problem threatening 1.1 billion people in 55 countries globally. After 18 years of implementing MDA in Ghana, LF transmission still persist in some districts with microfilaria prevalence level high above the threshold needed for the interruption of transmission of the disease. For Ghana to meet the 2020 NTDs deadline, it is important to identify context specific need-based QI strategies to make the drug accessible to all eligible individuals in the endemic communities. Hence, this study has demonstrated the feasibility of using IM to develop and implement a context specific QI strategy for an existing evidence-based intervention (LF MDA) towards elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health challenge in Bole District of Northern Ghana.
