Buruli Ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. While treatment has largely improved, former BU patients may experience participation restrictions after treatment, due to physical limitations, stigmatization or other social factors.
With more than half of the BU patient population in Africa being children, a scale that measures participation restrictions among former paediatric BU patients is relevant but has not been developed yet. Here, we present a scale that measures participation restrictions among former BU patients under the age of 15 year that is suitable for low-income settings. The 16-item scale was developed in Benin and tested in both Ghana and Benin. The scale shows good performance and may be used for several diseases that occur in similar settings and result in disabilities (both physical and/or social).
