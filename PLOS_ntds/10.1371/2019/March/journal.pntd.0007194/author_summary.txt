Babesia microti is an emerging tick-borne disease and is becoming a public health problem. Over the past two decades, the I. scapularis tick population, which is primarily responsible for human infection, has exploded, doubling the number of babesiosis and other I. scapularis-borne disease cases to approximately 48 thousand reported in 2016. The increasing number of endemic areas of B. microti signals the need to develop robust and accurate surveillance tools to effectively monitor and record disease incidence. Here, we used our whole genome sequence analysis of B. microti to develop a genetic barcode for B. microti, composed of 25 robust variants. We show the validation and utility of this SNP barcode on 26 babesiosis positive clinical samples from endemic regions in the United States. This genetic barcode provides a means to identify the genetic origin of a parasite and ultimately gain insight into B. microti population structure and transmission dynamics.
