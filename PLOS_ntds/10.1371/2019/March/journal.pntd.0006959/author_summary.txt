To ensure proper communication between their different cell populations, animals rely on secreted hormones and cytokines that act on receptors of target cells. Most of the respective cytokines, such as FGFs, evolved over 500 million years ago and are present in similar form in all animals, including parasitic worms. The authors of this study show that the metacestode larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis, which grows like a malignant tumor within the host liver, expresses molecules with homology to FGF receptors from mammals. The authors show that human FGF, which is abundantly present in the liver, stimulates metacestode development and that all parasite FGF receptors are activated by human FGF, despite 500 million years of evolutionary distance between both systems. This indicates that cells of the Echinococcus metacestode can directly communicate with cells of the mammalian host using evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules. This mode of host-pathogen interaction is unique for helminths and does not occur between mammals and single-celled pathogens such as protozoans or bacteria. The authors finally demonstrate that BIBF 1120, a drug used to treat human cancer, targets the Echinococcus FGF receptors and leads to parasite death. This opens new ways for the development of anti-parasitic drugs.
