Leprosy is a major public health problem in several low- to middle-developed countries where a consistent number of new cases are diagnosed every year. Irrespective of the use of efficient treatment, diagnosis is late because of the absence of a gold standard method. Thus, the multi-drug therapy (MDT) is unable to control of disease transmission even though early diagnosis, adequate MDT treatment of new cases, and contact surveillance have been considered the pillars of leprosy endemic control. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based Mycobacterium leprae DNA direct detection in clinical samples has been developed to support diagnosis. This study used qPCR to differentially diagnose suspected cases of paucibacillary leprosy and to follow them after treatment to confirm the consensus diagnosis and therapeutic approaches. It was concluded that qPCR and histopathological analysis increase clinical diagnosis accuracy, and qPCR has higher sensitivity. The routine use of qPCR laboratory tests could therefore improve the precision of early diagnosis for the achievement of leprosy control.
