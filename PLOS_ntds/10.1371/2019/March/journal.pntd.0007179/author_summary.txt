Conventional microbiological culture has remained a relatively uncontested ‘gold standard’ for the diagnosis of cholera; however, emerging methods, including sensitive molecular tests, challenge the current paradigm. One pivotal article demonstrated that culture failed to detect cholera in one-third of the cholera-positive stool specimens confirmed by other methods. This finding underscored the absence of a reliable reference test, further complicated by newer tests outperforming the gold standard, leaving no suitable comparator. In this study, we used oral cholera vaccine as a probe to investigate the reliability of conventional culture as a diagnostic for cholera by measuring the effectiveness of the vaccine against cholera culture-negative acute watery diarrhea. We did not find any evidence of protection, implying that the culture diagnostics used were reliable. The dynamics of cholera transmission require a rapid response, and ascertaining the best rapid diagnostic test for early detection of outbreaks will maximize the effectiveness of chronically limited resources in high risk regions. As techniques advance, well-designed studies should be implemented to systematically evaluate their merit against established methods, and improved diagnostics, including rapid diagnostics and microbiological culture, should be implemented into cholera control programs to reduce cholera transmission by creating a better trigger for outbreak response.
