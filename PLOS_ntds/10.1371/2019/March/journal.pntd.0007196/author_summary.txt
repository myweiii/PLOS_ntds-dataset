Current diagnostic methods for assessing prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) largely rely on microscopic visualization of helminth eggs, an inexpensive but insensitive method of detection. However, growing interest in going beyond control to break transmission of STH through mass drug administration will require highly sensitive assays to detect the low intensity infections that occur when prevalence is low within a population. Molecular tools, such as real-time PCR, offer the required sensitivity, but depend on well-equipped laboratories and adequately trained technicians. In addition, current assays are relatively expensive to perform at the scale required for surveys. Sample pooling is a technique that can be used to estimate prevalence from a set of samples, while potentially employing fewer tests for a given sample size, reducing cost. The decision in favour of or against pooling will determine how samples are collected, properly stored and analysed, and that needs to be established early in the study or program design process. Our work identifies the key determinants on which this decision should be made, what information is needed to make the choice and how the decision can be made.
