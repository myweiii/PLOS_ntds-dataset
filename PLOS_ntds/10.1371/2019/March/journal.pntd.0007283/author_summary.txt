Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by flagellated parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. This disease has been included into the WHO roadmap for neglected tropical diseases with elimination as a public health problem targeted for 2020 and the interruption of transmission to humans for 2030. To achieve these elimination and interruption goals, it is important to identify and understand the factors that may hamper these goals. Understanding the contribution of human genetics to the response of trypanosome infections is important for the development of new control strategies. In this study, polymorphism in seven genes was investigated between controls and sleeping sickness patients of three sleeping sickness foci of Southern Cameroon in order to see if there is any association with the development of disease. Results of this study have shown that the genotype (TT) and minor allele (T) of IL1A gene and the genotype 1A3A VNTR of IL1RN are associated with an increased risk of getting T. b. gambiense infections and develop sleeping sickness in major ethno-linguistic groups of the Cameroonian population. They suggest that the association between host genetic determinants and the susceptibility to T. b. gambiense infections could vary according to the population studied. These results will improve our knowledge on the role of human genetics determinants and the risk to be infected by T. b. gambiense and develop sleeping sickness. They could thus lead to the identification of novel biomarkers which could open a frame work for the development of new diagnostics, treatments and intervention strategies.
