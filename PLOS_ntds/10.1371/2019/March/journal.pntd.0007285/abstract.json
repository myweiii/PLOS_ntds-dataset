    "Background": "Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide, causing direct losses to the livestock industry and threatening human health. Little is known about the status and factors affecting farmers\u2019 private investment in the prevention and control of sheep brucellosis in China.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "From April to October 2017, a cross-sectional, house-based study was conducted in 7 Chinese provinces. A total of 1037 households included in the study were analyzed. The average amount of private investment in the prevention and control of brucellosis was $0.73\u00b10.54 per sheep. Multivariable analysis showed that factors facilitating private investment included older age of householder (OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.03\u20131.11), herd size >100 (OR = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.38\u20134.51), a higher percentage of income from sheep farming comparing to the total household income (OR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.11\u20131.16), higher score of brucellosis knowledge (OR = 3.85, 95%CI: 1.40\u201310.51), actively learning related knowledge (OR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.55\u20135.74), actively participating in related training courses (OR = 3.07, 95%CI: 1.52\u20136.18), care about other people\u2019s attitudes (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.35\u20132.28), concern about the health of neighbors\u2019 livestock (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.23\u20132.51). The analysis found a discouraging factor for private investment, supporting culling policy (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.49\u20130.91).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In addition to providing interventions related to farmers\u2019 knowledge, attitudes and practices, guidance must be offered to help farmers understanding the importance of private investment in the prevention and control of brucellosis."
