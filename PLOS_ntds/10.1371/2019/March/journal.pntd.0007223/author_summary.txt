Cotrimoxazole, an antifolate, is a fixed-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole used to prevent opportunistic infections including malaria in HIV-infected individuals. There are concerns that widespread use of cotrimoxazole for prophylaxis may result in selection of P. falciparum parasites with cross-resistance to other antifolate drugs such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which is used as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and in infants (IPTi) in Africa. This sub-study used samples from a clinical trial in which HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral treatment were randomized to discontinue (STOP-CTX) or continue (CTX) cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for 12 months. The sub-study was designed to assess whether taking cotrimoxazole increased the risk of selecting for parasites with SP-resistant mutations in HIV-infected individuals. Samples were genotyped by sequencing to assess the prevalence of mutations associated with SP-resistance. We found there was no risk of selecting for parasites with SP-resistance mutations while on cotrimoxazole. In fact, the opposite was true; cotrimoxazole controlled parasites carrying SP-resistance mutations as evident by the gradual increase in the prevalence of parasites with mutant alleles in the STOP-CTX arm and not in the CTX-arm. We concluded that cotrimoxazole remains effective in controlling malaria infection despite of the high prevalence of SP-resistant parasites, and its use does not select for SP mutations.
