Zoonotic pathogens pose a significant health risk to humans. Mass vaccination programs have shown promise for controlling zoonoses in reservoir populations and, in turn, lessening the health burden posed to neighboring human populations. Despite some significant successes, major logistical challenges remain for programs that seek to establish and maintain herd immunity in free-ranging animal populations. Specifically, limited host access and costs associated with vaccine distribution may hinder efforts to vaccinate a host population and preempt spillover of a zoonotic pathogen. We use mathematical models, parameterized with data from campaigns in the US that target rabies in wildlife, to illustrate how transmissible vaccines can overcome these challenges. Specifically, we find levels of vaccine transmission necessary to boost vaccination efforts that seek to preempt the spread of rabies, and also predict the cost savings that could be realized with a transmissible vaccine.
