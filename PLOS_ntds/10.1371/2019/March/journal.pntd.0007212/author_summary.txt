Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that was recently introduced in Brazil and subsequently spread throughout the Americas. ZIKV is highly similar to the related dengue virus but causes unique disease outcomes including neurological disease in adults and fetal developmental complications. The ZIKV envelope protein coats the surface of the virus and allows entry into host cells. Here we investigate a portion of the ZIKV envelope protein, the CD-loop, which extends further than in dengue virus, and its role in ZIKV neurological disease. Our study finds that shortening the CD-loop reduces the ability of ZIKV to replicate in neuronal cells, that the longer CD-loop is a key factor for invasion of the central nervous system in mice, and that a deletion in the CD-loop is genetically stable with passage. Additionally, we show that infection with the CD-loop mutant induces a potent antibody response that can neutralize wildtype ZIKV, suggesting it may offer protection in mice. Shortening of the ZIKV CD-loop, and the CD-loop of other neurotropic flaviviruses, could contribute to development of rapid, effective, and safe vaccines.
