Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) are under-estimated and overshadowed by other malaria parasites in tropical countries, which can cause chronic infections that last from months to years. The chronic infection caused by P. ovale should be of concern in the context of the long-term goal of eliminating malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is one of the WHO recommended tools to confirm the infection of plasmodium parasites, which can distinguish Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum species as well. However, little is known about their performance detecting P. ovale, and the factors that affect the efficiency of RDTs in the detection of P. ovale have not been systemically investigated. This study suggested that the performance of the three pLDH-based RDTs for P. ovale detection was not optimal, the low parasite density and pLDH concentration contributed to the failure of the RDT test for P. ovale. It provided information for the application of malaria RDTs in the field and for research and development to improve RDTs for malaria diagnosis.
