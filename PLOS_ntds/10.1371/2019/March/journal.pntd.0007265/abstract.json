    "Background": "Helminth infections are known to regulate cytokine responses in both pulmonary and latent tuberculosis infection. Whether helminth infections also modulate cytokine responses in extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL), has not been examined thus far.",
    "Methodology": "Hence, to determine the cytokine profile in helminth-TBL coinfection, we measured the systemic and mycobacterial (TB)–antigen stimulated levels of Type 1, Type 2, Type 17, regulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in TBL individuals coinfected with or without Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infection.",
    "Significant findings": "TBL-Ss+ individuals have significantly higher bacterial burdens in the affected lymph nodes in comparison to TBL-Ss- individuals. TBL-Ss+ individuals exhibit significantly enhanced plasma levels of Type 2 (IL-5 and IL-13), Type 17 (IL-17 and IL-22) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines in comparison to TBL-Ss- individuals. In contrast, TBL-Ss+ individuals exhibit significantly diminished plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α and GM-CSF) in comparison to TBL-Ss- individuals. TBL-Ss+ individuals also exhibit significantly diminished unstimulated or mycobacterial—antigen stimulated levels of Type 1, Type 17 or IL-1 family cytokines in comparison to TBL-Ss- individuals but no differences in mitogen stimulated cytokine levels.",
    "Conclusion": "Therefore, our data reveal a profound influence of Ss infection on the bacteriological profile of TBL and suggesting that the underlying modulation of cytokine responses might be a mechanism by which this helminth infection could impart a detrimental effect on the pathogenesis of TBL disease."
