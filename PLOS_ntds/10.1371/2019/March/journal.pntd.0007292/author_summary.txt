The enteric infections that cause diarrheal disease remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children in low-income settings where sanitation infrastructure is limited. The role of different exposure pathways in transmission of enteric pathogens to young children is unknown, but accurate information on relative risks posed by different pathways could improve how well intervention strategies are prioritized. New evidence reveals that young children often play at public areas in their neighborhood, including areas used for human and animal feces disposal, potentially exposing them to heavily contaminated environmental fomites. We describe a novel exposure assessment approach that examines how the dose of six different enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to multiple pathogens is influenced by behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions in public areas of three low-income, urban neighborhoods of Kisumu, Kenya. We found that increased frequency of contact with the environment and volume of material ingested, especially for surface water, and increased contact with different neighborhood locations elevates dose and probability of multiple pathogen exposure. Our study demonstrates that playing in public areas poses a risk to children and provides new insights on how pathogen exposures vary across transmission pathways.
