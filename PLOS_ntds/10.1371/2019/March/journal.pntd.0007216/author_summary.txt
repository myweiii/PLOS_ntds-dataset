Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar is a vector born disease, deadly if not treated. On the Indian subcontinent VL is caused by the protozoan parasite Leismania donovani, transmitted by an insect vector, sand fly of the Phlebotomus argentipes species, and considered an anthroponotic disease. Not every L.donovani infection progresses to clinical VL disease, and only a small minority of those infected will progress to disease and therefore not all those infected need to be treated. Importantly, diagnostic and treatment options have considerably improved over the past 10 years. There are several markers of infection in VL: antibody-tests as DAT, rK39-ELISA, markers of cellular immunity as the Quantiferon assay, and molecular markers as quantitative PCR. Also SNP/HLA genotyping has been shown to be associated with VL. However the factors that determine who will and who will not progress from infection to disease remain largely unknown. To try and elucidate the factors associated with progression to disease we identified a cohort of healthy recently infected persons in a highly VL endemic area of Bihar, India, and followed them up for three years. We also included in the follow-up an age and village matched group of initially seronegative controls. SNP/HLA genotyping was performed on all subjects to identify genetic predisposition. The only factors strongly and significantly associated with progression to disease turned out to be high DAT and/or rK39 titers and positive qPCR. The proportion progressing to disease was too low to merit preventive treatment. As most disease tends to occur early during follow-up, it is recommendable to closely follow up those with high antibody titers or testing qPCR positive over at least a 6-months period.
