Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a dermal condition that occurs in South Asia in 10â€“20% of patients after apparent cure from Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). It presents with macular or papulonodular lesions that harbor Leishmania parasites, thus playing a major role in the transmission cycle. Accordingly, development of strategies for case finding, diagnosis, and treatment are major foci of the Leishmaniasis elimination programme. The major limitations include a risk of misdiagnosis, costly case finding along with inadequate and/or unnecessary treatment. This study delineated changes in the epidemiological characteristics of PKDL cases in West Bengal arising out of two modes of surveillance. Traditionally, passive surveillance was the major mode of patient recruitment, but from 2015, active surveillance came into effect. This led to the scenario changing drastically, with important differences appearing in the demographic profile of PKDL. Active surveillance proved to be a game changer as it unravelled a huge disease burden of macular cases, which had so far remained undetected. Therefore, contrary to previous studies, our study has established that macular PKDL in West Bengal, and perhaps India, is not a rare, uncommon presentation, and therefore warrants a deeper analysis.
