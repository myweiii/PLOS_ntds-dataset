SFTS were clinically misdiagnosed as HFRS. It could cause particular concern in China. Physicians could not rely heavily on the exposure history. Both SFTS and HFRS patients are treated based on the clinical diagnosis in China. Laboratory confirmation of both diseases is not performed in clinical hospitals and the patientsâ€™ blood was usually submitted to a local or provincial center for disease control and prevention. In most cases the confirmation diagnosis is to provide retrospective information rather than to guide clinical therapy. Therefore, physicians need to carefully differentiate SFTS and HFRS patients because the fatality of SFTS is much higher than HFRS and SFTS is easily spread from person to person by contacting infected blood or even through aerosol.
