A single RVF virus serotype exists, yet differences in virulence and pathogenicity of the virus have been observed. This necessitates the need for detailed genetic characterization of various isolates of the virus. Some of the RVF virus isolates that caused the 2008–2010 disease outbreaks in South Africa were most probably reassortants resulting from exchange of portions of the genome, particularly those of segment M. Although clear association between RVFV genotype and phenotype has not been established, various amino acid substitutions have been implicated in the phenotype. Viruses with amino acid substitutions from glycine to glutamic acid at position 277 of segment M have been shown to be more virulent in mice in comparison to viruses with glycine at the same position. Phylogenetic analysis carried out in this study indicated that the viruses responsible for the 2008–2010 RVF outbreaks in South Africa were not introduced from outside the country, but mutated over time and caused the outbreaks when environmental conditions became favourable.
