Leprosy, or Hansenâ€™s disease, is a chronic bacterial disease caused by M. leprae. Although it is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities, it remains an important global health concern. This is mainly due to delayed diagnosis. In leprosy, a reliable and early diagnostic tool, is still needed. In recent decades years, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on nucleic acid detection has been employed for leprosy diagnosis, which exhibited high sensitivity. The performance of qPCR assays, however, greatly varied in different studies, especially in the diagnosis of PB patients. ddPCR is a new and sensitive method used in the examination of pathogenic microorganism, showing considerable reliability and efficiency in other infectious diseases. To our knowledge, no publication reported the ddPCR assay for leprosy diagnosis. Herein, we developed and evaluated a ddPCR assay for detecting M. leprae in skin biopsy samples. Our results suggest that ddPCR specially targeting RLEP and groEL genes could be a promising tool to the detection of M. leprae in PB leprosy with a higher sensitivity than qPCR. This research provides a new molecular biology methods for leprosy diagnosis.
