The regional movements of infected individuals that connect suitable transmission areas make malaria resilient to control efforts. Those movements are expected to leave genetic signatures in the parasite populations that can be detected using analytical tools. In this study, the genetic makeups of Plasmodium vivax populations were characterized to assess whether the most endemic areas in Colombia were connected. Samples were collected from passive surveillance studies in four locations across an imaginary transect line of 1,500 km from the northwest to the south Pacific Coast of Colombia (South America). Considering the distance, and contrary to expectations, we found weak levels of genetic differentiation between these parasite populations with no evidence indicating that their genetic diversity has been eroded as expected whenever the prevalence of the disease is successfully reduced, e.g., through control programs or environmental changes. Although the sampling lacks the geographic and temporal detail to describe how the dispersion of parasite lineages occurred, the observed patterns are consistent with a series of infected populations that are connected in space by human movements allowing the parasite to diffuse across this 1,500 km transect. This malaria corridor needs to be characterized to achieve elimination.
