    "Abstract": "Leprosy is a chronic infection where the skin and peripheral nervous system is invaded by Mycobacterium leprae. The infection mechanism remains unknown in part because culture methods have not been established yet for M. leprae. Mce1A protein (442 aa) is coded by mce1A (1326 bp) of M. leprae. The Mce1A homolog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is known to be associated with M. tuberculosis epithelial cell entry, and survival and multiplication within macrophages. Studies using recombinant proteins have indicated that Mce1A of M. leprae is also associated with epithelial cell entry. This study is aimed at identifying particular sequences within Mce1A associated with M. leprae epithelial cell entry. Recombinant proteins having N-terminus and C-terminus truncations of the Mce1A region of M. leprae were created in Escherichia coli. Entry activity of latex beads, coated with these truncated proteins (r-lep37 kDa and r-lep27 kDa), into HeLa cells was observed by electron microscopy. The entry activity was preserved even when 315 bp (105 aa) and 922 bp (308 aa) was truncated from the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. This 316\u2013921 bp region was divided into three sub-regions: 316\u2013531 bp (InvX), 532\u2013753 bp (InvY), and 754\u2013921 bp (InvZ). Each sub-region was cloned into an AIDA vector and expressed on the surface of E. coli. Entry of these E. coli into monolayer-cultured HeLa and RPMI2650 cells was observed by electron microscopy. Only E. coli harboring the InvX sub-region exhibited cell entry. InvX was further divided into 4 domains, InvXa\u2014InvXd, containing sequences 1\u201324 aa, 25\u201346 aa, 47\u201357 aa, and 58\u201372 aa, respectively. Recombinant E. coli, expressing each of InvXa\u2014InvXd on the surface, were treated with antibodies against these domains, then added to monolayer cultured RPMI cells. The effectiveness of these antibodies in preventing cell entry was studied by colony counting. Entry activity was suppressed by antibodies against InvXa, InvXb, and InvXd. This suggests that these three InvX domains of Mce1A are important for M. leprae invasion into nasal epithelial cells."
