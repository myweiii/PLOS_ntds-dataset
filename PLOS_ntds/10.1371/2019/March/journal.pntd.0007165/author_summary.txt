Sand flies are vectors of human leishmaniases, an important neglected tropical disease. An alternative approach to the conventional delivery of an insecticide to the vector is to bring the vector to the insecticide using oviposition (egg-laying)-site attractants. Olfactory cues originating from organic matter have been identified as important sources of oviposition attractants. However, nothing is known regarding visual assessment of oviposition sites by sand flies. Also, little is understood about diel egg-laying patterns of sand flies. Finally, it is not known if visual cues and time-of-day may affect their sensitivity to olfactory cues. In this study, we investigated these questions in a series of lab experiments using free-flight cage arenas, with Phlebotomus papatasi (vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis). We showed that peak oviposition-site search and sensitivity to olfactory cues occurs mainly in the latest part of the night whereas peak oviposition occurs during the early part of the night. We demonstrated that only gravid females, but not any other stage or sex, were attracted to dark, round oviposition jars resembling burrow openings. Finally, we showed that sensitivity to olfactory cues is reduced in the presence of strong visual cues and in the absence of natural diel photoperiod.
