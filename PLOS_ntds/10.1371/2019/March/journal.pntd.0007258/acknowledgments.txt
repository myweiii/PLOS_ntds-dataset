We would like to thank the participants of each of the respective studies, as well as the field teams in Kenya for their dedication to the collection of this data, as without them, this study would not have materialized. We dedicate this paper to our long-term friend and colleague, Samuel Muiruri, who was devoted to the study of RVFV in Kenya and passed away in 2015.
