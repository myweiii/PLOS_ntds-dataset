Part of the transmission cycle for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is related to direct human interaction with animals as part of everyday activities, including consumption of animal products for nutritional or therapeutic benefits. Although the vector-borne transmission of RVFV by mosquito populations is well understood, less is known about how human contact with animal tissues and fluids yields direct (non-vector-borne) RVFV transmission. This study describes the risks of RVFV transmission contributed by exposure to raw milk. It analyzed humansâ€™ milk-related activities and their cumulative risk of RVFV infection, as determined by community-based behavioral and serological surveys in four villages in Kenya. Our data suggest that likelihood of exposure is increased both by actively milking live animals and by direct consumption of raw milk. The risk of RVFV exposure varied among the species of animals kept as livestock and utilized for milk production. Further investigations are necessary to fully characterize the dynamics of RVFV in milk. A better understanding of the role of milk in RVFV transmission will contribute to the public health management of RVFV outbreaks and interepidemic infections.
