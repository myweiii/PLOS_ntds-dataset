Distinguishing arboviral infections, such as dengue, from bacterial causes of febrile illness is of great importance for clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. In resource-limited countries, costly and expertise-reliant diagnostic assays cannot be performed routinely. The Infection Manager Software (IMS) is a novel diagnostic algorithm equipped on an automated Sysmex hematology analyzer, making use of the principle that different infections evoke different changes in blood cell number and cell phenotype. In a cohort of adult Indonesian patients presenting to hospital with an arboviral and/or bacterial infection, we first trained and subsequently evaluated the diagnostic performance of the IMS to distinguish common causes of acute febrile illness. The authors show that the IMS has a reasonable sensitivity for detection of arboviral and bacterial infections and a high specificity. In comparison with the commonly used biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), the performance of the IMS was comparable to CRP and better than PCT. The authors conclude that the IMS is a novel, automated, easy to use diagnostic tool that allows rapid differentiation between common causes of febrile illness in Southeast Asia.
