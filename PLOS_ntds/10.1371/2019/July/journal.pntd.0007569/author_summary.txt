Cryptococcosis is an invasive, global, and neglected mycosis. Species of the Cryptococcus neoformans complex cause opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed hosts, particularly AIDS patients, while infections by species of the C. gattii complex predominate as a primary endemic mycosis in tropical and subtropical areas. In Brazil, it is an important and hidden public health problem, mainly in its meningitis form, whose lethality ranges from 45 to 65%, but remains as a not-notifiable disease. Brazilian studies placed it as the first cause of mortality among all AIDS-associated systemic mycoses and the second cause of mortality among systemic mycoses in general. This national study used data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) in which all mentioned causes were considered, allowing the analysis of the associated causes of deaths and showing two different patterns of infections: a primary and an opportunistic cryptococcosis. Primary cryptococcosis presented a peculiar epidemiological regional profile and the opportunistic cryptococcosis was hidden by several immunosuppressive conditions. The authors expect that this study can support a better understanding of this infection and encourage more research and public health initiatives to prevent and control the cryptococcosis, both primary and opportunistic.
