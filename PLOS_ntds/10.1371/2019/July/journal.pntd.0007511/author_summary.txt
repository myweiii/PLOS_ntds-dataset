The bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes causes throat and skin infections. A danger from such infections is an immune response that attacks human heart tissue, leading to rheumatic heart disease, which is difficult to treat and potentially deadly. Disadvantaged populations such as the Indigenous people in remote tropical northern Australia have high burdens of S. pyogenes skin infection, and rheumatic heart disease. An effective vaccine would be a benefit, but none is approved for clinical use. We analysed data from 1810 S. pyogenes isolates from north Australia obtained over 28 years, to determine the potential of a previously described S. pyogenes vaccine candidate to be effective in this region. Only one quarter of the isolates from skin infections had a surface antigen corresponding to any one of the 30 antigen variants in the candidate vaccine. Previous work in animals indicates potential cross-protection from the vaccine against strains with mismatched antigens. However, even if this occurs in humans, protection against skin infection strains would likely remain compromised, unless there were additional components in the vaccine. Further studies on cross-protection are critical to defining the potential of this type of vaccine in populations burdened with S. pyogenes skin infections and rheumatic heart disease.
