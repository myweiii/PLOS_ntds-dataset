For communicable infections, variations in contact rates determine the flow of disease through populations. Therefore, describing contact patterns within populations could help to better predict and prevent disease outbreaks. Free-ranging domestic dogs are susceptible to a number of zoonotic infections yet few studies have investigated their contact patterns. We describe high-resolution contact data for free-ranging dogs in rural Chad and simulate the transmission of an infection comparable to rabies. We show that epidemic outcomes are determined by the seeded individualâ€™s network position, which was also correlated with ranging behaviour. This demonstrates that between-individual variation in the risks of spreading infection may be linked with observable traits that can help inform targeted management strategies.
