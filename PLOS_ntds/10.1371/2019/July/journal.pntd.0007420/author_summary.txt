Dengue is an emerging mosquito-borne viral disease, which is transmitted through the bite of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. The dengue virus causes 390 million infections and 96 million cases every year, and represents a major public health problem in the tropics and subtropics. Although a dengue vaccine was licensed in late 2015, it does not represent a general solution due to significant imperfections. Vector control remains still the primary method to prevent dengue infections. Environmental interventions to control dengue vectors represent sustainable and safe methods as there are limited risks of environmental contamination and toxicity. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the following environmental methods for dengue vector control: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management with and without direct garbage collection, elimination of breeding places. Both, systematic review and meta-analysis, showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval Aedes sp. populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.
