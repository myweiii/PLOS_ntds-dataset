The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) requires lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, such as Bangladesh, to estimate the number of lymphoedema and hydrocoele cases in order to deliver the minimum package of care required to control morbidity and reduce patient suffering. This paper highlights the Bangladesh LF Elimination Programme’s progress in training more than 8000 community health workers to identify more than 44,000 cases across 34 endemic districts where approximately 70 million people are at risk. The morbidity data collected enabled the creation of a national database and a series of risk maps of lymphoedema and hydrocoele to be developed, which highlighted the significant burden in northern Rangpur Division, especially of lymphoedema among female patients. The Bangladesh LF Elimination Programme’s efforts to identify LF cases across all endemic districts represents one of the most comprehensive national databases on LF clinical cases in the world. It provides an informative database for health workers to use in the delivery of the minimum package of care and a template for other countries to adopt and develop national strategies to manage morbidity and prevent disability as recommended by GPELF.
