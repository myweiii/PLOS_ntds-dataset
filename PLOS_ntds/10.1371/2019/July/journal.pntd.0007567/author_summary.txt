Amphotericin B (AmB) is the treatment of choice for systemic fungal infections. Despite its efficacy, clinical use of AmB has been associated with renal toxicity. In an attempt to improve the therapeutic effect and to reduce adverse reactions, lipid formulations of AmB were developed. Among these formulations, an in-house lipid emulsion preparation of AmB (AmB/LE) is a lower cost alternative with similar benefits. Furthermore, vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the regulation of several physiological activities. Hence, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency can contribute to the progression of diseases and increase the risk of chronic illnesses as well. Nowadays, VDD is a health problem worldwide and its prevalence in general population is high, including the sunny and industrialized countries, where vitamin D supplementation has been successfully implemented. Thus, it is essential to monitor vitamin D levels in both patients treated with conventional or lipid formulations of AmB in order to ensure a better prognosis in the development of renal diseases.
