Taenia solium cysticercosis is a parasitic disease, which can be transmitted between humans and pigs in areas of the world where pigs are raised in a traditional manner and latrines are not always used by the local population. Because cysticercosis affects humans and pigs, it is important to assess how much this infection costs both the public health and agricultural sectors in endemic countries such as Mexico. Costs associated with infection of both humans and pigs, in Mexico, were estimated using the literature, questionnaires, and publicly available data. Study findings suggest that T. solium cysticercosis results in considerable monetary losses to Mexico. The methodology developed here can be applied to estimate the monetary burden of cysticercosis in other regions in order to better prioritize disease control initiatives.
