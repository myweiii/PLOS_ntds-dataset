Dengue virus (DENV) can be classified into four serotypes, DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4. Although DENV 4 is the first dengue serotype to diverge in phylogenetic analyses of the genus Flavivirus, this serotype occurs at a low prevalence worldwide and spreads the least rapidly. Similar to other serotypes, DENV 4 can also cause severe dengue (SD) disease manifestations, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). To date, no study has investigated the epidemiology and dynamics of DENV 4 genotype I comprehensively. In this study, we seek to address this gap. Our study shows that the distribution of DENV 4-I is mainly restricted to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The most recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated from Southeast Asia–initially circulating in the Philippines, then Thailand and later on the Indian subcontinent. Viruses evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, respectively. Although DENV 4-I occasionally spread elsewhere, this genotype did not become widely established. The overall evolution rate of DENV 4-I was comparable with that of DENV 2–4. The nucleotide sequences indicates that the demographic history of DENV 4-I fluctuated with peaks apparent during parts of the 1980s and 2000s. Although a weak positive selection existed in Clade III -predominately in Vietnam, purifying selection dominated the E-gene evolution of DENV 4-I.
