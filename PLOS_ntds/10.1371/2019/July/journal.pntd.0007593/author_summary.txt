With an at-risk population in the billions, Ascaris lumbricoides is a pathogen of great global importance. In recent years, efforts to control the spread of this parasitic helminth have expanded, resulting in declining infection rates and worm burdens in some regions. While immeasurably important for global health, these declines have also served to expose the shortcomings of traditional diagnostic methods, as low-levels of pathogen generate a need for more sensitive tools, and microscopy-based techniques are proving ill-suited to the task at hand. Thankfully, improved sensitivity can be achieved through the careful selection of optimal repetitive DNA targets for PCR. However, previous attempts to identify such targets in A. lumbricoides were unsuccessful, largely due to chromosome diminution, an unusual phenomenon occurring in the Ascaridida, whereby large portions of the germline genome are reproducibly eliminated during early development, resulting in their absence in larvae or adult worms. As the stool-based molecular diagnosis of A. lumbricoides infection is primarily dependent upon the identification of egg-derived DNA, utilizing genomic DNA from adult worms for molecular target selection eliminates germline candidates and results in suboptimal target sequence choices. Recently, the publication of a pre-diminution germline genome of A. lumbricoides has provided us with an opportunity to re-evaluate target selection, facilitating the development of a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay with greatly improved sensitivity (~3100-fold as determined by relative Cq value) over previously developed assays that were based on ribosomal repeat DNA sequences with lower copy numbers.
