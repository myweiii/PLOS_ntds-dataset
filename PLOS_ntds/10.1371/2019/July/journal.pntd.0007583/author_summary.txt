Rickettsial infections are a common cause of hospitalization in tropical settings, although early, definitive diagnosis is challenging in the rural and remote locations where they are usually seen. It is important to recognise rickettsial infections early in their disease course as they can lead to life-threatening multi-organ failure if specific anti-rickettsial antimicrobial therapy is not prescribed promptly. In tropical Australia, scrub typhus and spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae are the dominant rickettsial pathogens and this twenty-year retrospective series examines the clinical and laboratory findings which might facilitate their recognition. The study highlights the infections’ increasing local clinical burden and reports that over 20% of the SFG cases in the series required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, suggesting that severe SFG disease may be more common than previously believed. Simple, clinical prediction scores—calculated at presentation—identified patients who would subsequently require ICU admission. Importantly, they were also able to identify patients at low risk of disease progression. These entirely clinical scores—which can be calculated rapidly at the bedside—have the potential to facilitate the management of patients with scrub typhus and SFG infection, particularly in resource-limited settings which have the greatest burden of disease.
