Chikungunya fever is a severe crippling illness caused by the arthropod-borne virus CHIKV. Originally from the African subcontinent, the virus has now spread worldwide and is responsible for substantial morbidity and economic loss. The existing treatment against CHIKV is primarily symptomatic, and it is imperative that specific therapeutics be devised. The present study provides detailed insight into the functionality of 6K, an ion channel forming protein of CHIKV. Amantadine, a known antiviral against influenza virus, also inhibits CHIKV replication in cell culture and drastically alters the morphology of virus particles. This work highlights striking parallels among functionalities of virus-encoded membrane-interacting proteins, which may be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antivirals.
