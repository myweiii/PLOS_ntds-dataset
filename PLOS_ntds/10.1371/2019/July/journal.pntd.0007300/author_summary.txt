Several epidemiological surveys suggest that onchocerciasis (a disease resulting from an infection with the parasite Onchocerca volvulus) is a cause of epilepsy. We conducted a study to describe the clinical characteristics of persons with epilepsy (PWE) living in onchocerciasis-endemic villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In some study sites, the frequency of seizures increased with increasing number of O. volvulus microfilariae detected in the skin snips of participants. A wide spectrum of seizures was observed, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, and focal seizures. Growth retardation and household clustering of PWE were common. Specific clinical presentations such as nodding seizures and Nakalanga features were encountered. These results suggest a high prevalence of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) in the study villages.
