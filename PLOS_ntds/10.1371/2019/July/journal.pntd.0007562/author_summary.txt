Chikungunya is an acute febrile illness (AFI), caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Patients with chikungunya exhibit joint, muscle, or bone pain, and may also have skin rash, red eyes (conjunctiva), and red swollen joints (arthritis). Up to 20% of cases develop long lasting arthritis, fatigue or psychiatric conditions. We used data from our prospective study to identify signs and symptoms that predict chikungunya. We enrolled 8,996 AFI patients and tested for CHIKV, dengue viruses 1–4 (DENV 1–4), and other pathogens. A pathogen was detected in 55% of participants; 18.2% had CHIKV and 10.8% had DENV 1–4 infections. This study compared the clinical presentation of chikungunya with that of all other AFI and dengue alone. Regardless of timing of presentation, significant predictors of chikungunya were joint pain, muscle, bone or back pain, and red conjunctiva when compared to other AFI, and arthritis, joint pain, skin rash, any bleeding, and irritability, when dengue was the comparator group. Chikungunya patients were less likely than AFI and dengue patients to have low platelets, signs of poor circulation, diarrhea, headache, and cough. By enrolling febrile patients at presentation, we identified unbiased predictors of chikungunya. These findings can assist physicians to clinically diagnose chikungunya and initiate proper patient management.
