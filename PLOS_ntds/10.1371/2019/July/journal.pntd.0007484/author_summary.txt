Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease distributed worldwide. In the Americas, Brazil reports about 96% of VL cases, which has been highlighted by the increase in lethality in last years. Accurate VL diagnosis is of utmost importance. Despite this, the performance of some commercial tests currently available in Brazil is unknown, especially for HIV-infected patients. Accordingly, in this study we present a comparative performance analysis of six commercial kits available in Brazil for the diagnosis of VL in non-HIV and HIV-infected patients, besides one immunochromatographic test (ICT) and one in-house direct agglutination test (DAT-LPC) currently not commercially available in Brazil. ICTs and DAT-LPC showed better performance among non-HIV infected patients. Despite the known limitation of serological tests for the diagnosis of patients with HIV, the direct agglutination test was more accurate in this specific group of patients. Our results demonstrate significant differences in the performance of different serological tests and confirm that the use of serology should be qualified with previous information on the performance of the tests.
