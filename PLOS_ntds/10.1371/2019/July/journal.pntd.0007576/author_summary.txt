The genus Paracoccidioides comprises fungi responsible for Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a neglected tropical disease prevalent in South America that has been shown to affect approximately 10 million people and has great medical/social impact, since available treatments are poorly effective, frequently leading to relapses, chronic infections and sequelae. Genomic information available for five reference Paracoccidioides isolates could greatly assist researchers in developing new chemotherapeutic approaches against PCM, but usefulness of such data is limited, since ~60–90% of Paracoccidioides protein-coding genes (depending on isolate) are described as responsible for hypothetical proteins, without any functional/structural description. Such elevated number of hypothetical proteins is unexpected and probably derives from annotations performed solely by automated computing pipelines. This problem can be minimized by manual curation, when expert reviewers determine the functional designation of each gene, after comparing results derived from several reference databases. This work describes an effort to review the functional assignment of >40,000 genes, annotated across the five Paracoccidioides genomes mentioned above, which reduced the number of hypothetical proteins to ~25–28%, contributing to significantly increase quality and usefulness of such genomic information. These data have been compiled in a relational database named ParaDB, constituting an important resource for researchers in the field.
