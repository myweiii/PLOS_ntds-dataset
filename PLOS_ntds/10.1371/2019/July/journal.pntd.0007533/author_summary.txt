Our study discovered a highly specific role for L. major metalloprotease in cleaving and degrading murine CXCL1. Indeed, L. major metalloprotease did not cleave murine CXCL2 or human CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL8. CXCL1 is a critical chemokine required for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection; thus, we propose that this metalloprotease may have evolved to evade immune responses specifically in the murine host. We have further identified that the C-terminal end on CXCL1 is targeted for cleavage by the L. major metalloprotease. Finally, this cleavage site information was used to design peptides that are able to inhibit CXCL1 degradation by L. major. Our study highlights an immune evasion strategy utilized by L. major to establish infection within a murine host.
