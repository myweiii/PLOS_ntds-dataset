Glanders (caused by Burkholderia. mallei) and melioidosis (caused by B. pseudomallei) are severe infectious diseases of concern worldwide because of the rising number of cases and mortality rate. The low infectious doses of these two pathogens along with their amenability for aerosolization are factors that could be exploited as potential biothreat agents. Once the diseases have developed in humans and animals, intrinsic resistance to broad classes of antibiotics becomes a challenge for treatment and increases the risk for relapse. The progress in vaccine development demonstrates that live attenuated vaccine strains are the most effective in protection and providing long-lasting immune responses against both diseases. Our data indicate that the B. mallei double mutant (ΔtonB Δhcp1) strain CLH001, is a feasible vaccine candidate to prevent glanders and melioidosis, especially for biodefense and public health purposes.
