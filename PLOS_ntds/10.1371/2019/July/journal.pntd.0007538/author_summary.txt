Aedes species mosquitos transmit pathogens of public health importance, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. No tools exist to control these mosquitos that sustainably and effectively prevent human infections. Autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) have been shown to sustainably reduce Aedes populations by >80%. After chikungunya virus was introduced into Puerto Rico, we conducted serosurveys in communities with and without AGO traps. We observed a two-fold lower prevalence of chikungunya virus infection among residents of communities with AGO traps compared to communities without. Among infected residents of communities with traps, a significant proportion likely had been infected while outside their community. These findings indicate that AGO traps are an effective tool that protects humans from infection with pathogens transmitted by Aedes mosquitos.
