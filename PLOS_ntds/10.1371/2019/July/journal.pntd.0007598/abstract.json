    "Background": "Melioidosis is a frequently fatal disease requiring specific treatment. The yield of Burkholderia pseudomallei from sites with a normal flora is increased by culture using selective, differential media such as Ashdownâ€™s agar and selective broth. However, since melioidosis mainly affects people in resource-poor countries, the cost effectiveness of selective culture has been questioned. We therefore retrospectively evaluated this in two laboratories in southeast Asia.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The results of all cultures in the microbiology laboratories of Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos and Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia, in 2017 were reviewed. We identified patients with melioidosis who were only diagnosed as a result of culture of non-sterile sites and established the total number of such samples cultured using selective media and the associated costs in each laboratory. We then conducted a rudimentary cost-effectiveness analysis by determining the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per DALY averted and compared this against the 2017 GDP per capita in each country.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Selective culture for B. pseudomallei should be considered by all laboratories in melioidosis-endemic areas. However, the appropriate strategy for implementation should be decided locally."
