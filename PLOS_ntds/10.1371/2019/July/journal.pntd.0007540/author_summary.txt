Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 is associated with systemic infection in human populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and contrasts with the related pathovariant ST19 which causes gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Although the systemic pathology associated with ST313 infection in humans has been comprehensively documented in clinical and epidemiological studies, such pathology has been inconsistently reproduced in animal models of infection. Animal models that reliably recapitulate ST313 infection in humans are needed to study the biological mechanisms underpinning the systemic disease caused by ST313. In this study we performed extensive infection experiments, using several defined and alternative animal infection models to look for robust phenotypes that differentiate infection by S. Typhimurium ST313 from ST19. Large sample sizes and multivariate statistical analysis of infection data for inbred chicken lines allowed us to detect small but consistent differences between the strains. Overall, S. Typhimurium ST313 was associated with a reduced infection burden and pathology relative to ST19. This subtle phenotype may reflect the limitation of animal models to accurately represent infection by pathogens that have adapted to specific host phenotypes, for example, immunodeficiency in humans. Our study demonstrates the challenge of using animal models to differentiate closely-related bacterial pathovariants, and shows that inter-pathovar differences detected in animal models of infection often do not reflect clinical differences in humans at the level of disease mechanism.
