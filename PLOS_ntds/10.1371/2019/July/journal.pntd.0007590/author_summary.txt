Mosquito vectors transmit many diseases to humans and animals, causing illness and death and resulting in substantial socio-economic burdens in endemic countries. The control of mosquitoes has almost exclusively relied on the use of chemical insecticides, which has recently led to the broad resistance of important mosquito vectors worldwide. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, are an important alternative or complement to chemical insecticides. However, the relatively slow action of fungal pathogens in killing mosquitoes, compared with chemical insecticides, has hampered their widespread application. To improve the insecticidal efficacy of the entomopathogen B. bassiana, the fungus was genetically modified to express the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Cyt2Ba. The mitotically stable transformant (Bb-Cyt2Ba) successfully expressed Cyt2Ba toxin, and the virulence of this strain against adults and larvae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was significantly improved. In addition, egg laying was significantly affected by Bb-Cyt2Ba infection. Infection with this fungus resulted in a dramatic reduction in fecundity of the target mosquitoes. Therefore, this recombinant B. bassiana has great potential for use in mosquito control.
