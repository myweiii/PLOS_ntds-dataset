Noma, a devouring disease of the orofacial complex, is commonly associated with poverty and impoverished regions of the world especially Sub-Saharan Africa termed the noma belt region of the world. With more reports advocating for full inclusion of noma in the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) program, the apparent neglect of the disease in north central Nigeria compared to other sub-regions is worrisome as the disease burden in the sub-region has not been reported till date. In this light, a retrospective, cross-sectional survey was conducted to provide epidemiological representation to the cases encountered within an eight-year period by the Cleft and Facial Deformity Foundation (CFDF), an indigenous surgical mission. The incidence of noma was estimated using methods recommended by WHO while the period prevalence was calculated considering the population living below poverty line in the sub-region. This study extrapolates an incidence of 8.3 cases per 100000 and a period prevalence of 1.6 per 100000 persons at risk. Notable is the finding that most individuals encountered were above thirty years of age and suffered varying degree of facial disfigurement consequent to acute noma disease experienced in their childhood/early adolescence. Therefore, we advocate public awareness on the disease risk factors and prevention within the sub-region as well as training of primary health personnel on disease identification, primary care and nearest referral centres. We also identify the need to bolster the efforts of existing health facilities and indigenous surgical missions in the management and rehabilitation of noma cases and survivors.
