Trachoma, caused by conjunctival infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, remains the leading infectious cause of blindness. Repeated infection during childhood can trigger prolonged inflammation, which is the main risk factor for conjunctival scarring. Azithromycin is distributed globally for trachoma control, however it is also widely reported to have immunomodulatory properties. This report investigated the impact of one round of oral azithromycin for trachoma control on conjunctival immune responses, clinical signs and C. trachomatis infection in Tanzanian children. A large anti-inflammatory effect of azithromycin on conjunctival gene expression was observed 3 months post-treatment, however, gene expression patterns had mostly resumed to pre-treatment levels by 6 months. The effect was evident after adjusting for C. trachomatis infection and when analysis was restricted to uninfected individuals, however it was also observed to a lesser extent in individuals that did not receive treatment. These findings suggest that azithromycin may have a direct immunomodulatory effect on conjunctival gene expression but that it may also reduce inflammation by reducing exposure to C. trachomatis and other infections. This anti-inflammatory effect could have therapeutic potential in limiting the development of disease sequelae, that goes beyond its effect on the clearance of ocular C. trachomatis infection.
