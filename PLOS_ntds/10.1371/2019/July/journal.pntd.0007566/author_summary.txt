The host-pathogen interaction is highly dynamic and tightly regulated, and yet is difficult to monitor. Traditional investigations provide valuable information for the understanding of pathogenic microbial biology but are time-consuming and often neglect the host immune responses. In addition, current animal models for studying pathogenic fungi are limited in mimicking the responses from humans. The development of a new Cryptococcus neoformans infection model using nonhuman primates and the utilization of simultaneous RNA sequencing analysis provide fast and clinically relevant research data allowing the identification of novel critical players from both the invading fungus and the host. The data from the current study would not only help to decipher disease mechanisms but also promote the discovery of novel antifungal drug targets.
