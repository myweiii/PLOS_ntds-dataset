Mycetoma is a progressive and destructive, chronic granulomatous tumourous inflammatory disease, which is caused by a wide range of bacterial and fungal organisms. These causative agents form grains inside the tissue and a large inflammation zone and collagen capsule is found to be surrounding them. How these grains and the surrounding tissue reaction are formed is currently not known. In this study we demonstrated that IL-17A and MMP-9 were expressed in the mycetoma granuloma but at different zones surrounding the grain. The MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to the IL-17A levels. The highest IL-17A expression was found in the largest lesions and the lesions with the longest duration. These lesions are often also associated with a continuous influx of neutrophils and tissue damage and remodeling due to the production of ROS and metalloproteases and this could explain the correlation found between IL-17A and MMP-9 in mycetoma lesions.
