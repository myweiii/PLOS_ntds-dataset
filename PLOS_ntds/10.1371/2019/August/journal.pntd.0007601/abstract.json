    "Abstract": "Genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) predominance has gradually been replaced by genotype I (GI) over the last 20 years in many Asian countries. This genotype shift raises concerns about the protective efficacy of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines, as all of the currently licensed JE vaccines are derived from GIII strains. In this study, we conducted vaccination-challenge protection assays to evaluate the cross-protective efficacy of GI- or GIII-derived vaccines against the challenge of a heterologous genotype using a mouse challenge model. Titration of the neutralizing antibodies elicited by SA14-14-2 live-attenuated JE vaccine (SA14-14-2 vaccine), a GIII-derived vaccine, indicated that the titer of neutralizing antibodies specific to heterologous genotype GI stain was significantly lower than that specific to homologous genotype GIII strain in both pigs and mice immunized with the SA14-14-2 vaccine. Vaccination of mice with SA14-14-2 vaccine or a GIII-inactivated vaccine at high and medium doses completely protected vaccinated mice against challenge with the homologous genotype GIII strains, but failed to provide the vaccinated mice complete protection against the challenge of heterologous genotype GI strains. The protection rates against GI strain challenge were 60%–80%, showing that these vaccines were partially protective against GI strain challenge. Additionally, vaccination of mice with a GI-inactivated vaccine conferred 100% protection against the challenge of homologous genotype GI strains, but 50%–90% protection against the challenge of heterologous genotype GIII strains, showing a reduced protective efficacy of a GI-derived vaccine against GIII strain challenge. Overall, these observations demonstrated a partial cross-protection between GI and GIII strains and suggested a potential need for new JE vaccine strategies, including options like a bivalent vaccine, to control both genotype infection."
