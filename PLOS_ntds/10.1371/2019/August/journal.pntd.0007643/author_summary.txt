Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum and L. donovani, is characterized by high rate mortality worldwide. Current treatments for this disease suffer from toxicity, variable efficacy, requirements for parenteral administration and length of treatment regimens. New chemical entities and development of new drugs are important to overcome the impact of this protozoan disease. Actinobacterial strains, such as Streptomyces, have been a source of most naturally derived antibiotics, as well as anticancer, anthelmintic, and antifungal drugs. These microorganisms also produce small molecules important in symbiotic interactions with insects, such as fungus-growing ants, fungus-growing termites, beetles and wasps against pathogens. Several novel compounds have been reported from these microorganisms with promising biological activities. In this work we show an interesting ecologic approach for drug discovery that also shows promise for the identification of antileishmanial natural products from fungus-growing ant ecosystem. Two compounds isolated from Streptomyces strains showed potent activity against L. donovani, higher than the positive control (miltefosine) with high selectivity indexes.
