The expansion of the geographic distribution of arthropods has led to an increase in the number of infections of Zika and Dengue. This motivates the search for new alternative approaches for disease control. Wolbachia pipientis, an obligate intracellular bacteria known to provide pathogen-blocking capabilities to its host, has been used to this end. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes have been released into the environment as a strategy for controlling the mosquito population and hence the spread of arboviral-derived diseases. However, there is little knowledge regarding the specific interactions that occur between Wolbachia and its host, particularly those associated with its obligate intracellular nature. In this work we studied Wolbachia endosymbiosis from a systems biology perspective. By analyzing the gaps in the metabolic networks of four Wolbachia strains we were able to identify key interaction points between this intracellular bacteria and its host, which play a crucial role in their metabolic relationship. This approach focuses on what is missing to allow unveiling new information regarding the interplay between interacting metabolic networks, and it is especially useful in the case of intracellular bacteria where experimental information is scarce. This additional insight on the metabolic interactions between host and parasite hold great potential for the development of arboviral disease control strategies.
