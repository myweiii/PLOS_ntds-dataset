Evaluation of therapeutic response in chronic Chagas disease is a major challenge, particularly in the early post-treatment phase, due to prolonged persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies and lack of sensitivity of available parasitological tests. The main limitation in evaluating Chagas disease treatment response stems from the need for long-term follow-up to observe negative seroconversion of conventional serological tests. New biomarkers of cure are needed. We evaluated F2/3-ELISA, a promising early serological marker of therapeutic response, and T.cruzi PCR for T.cruzi DNA, for neonatal diagnosis and evaluation of parasitemia after treatment. F2/3-ELISA and PCR proved to be excellent early markers of treatment response that correlate with ELISA and IHA but can identify treatment response or failure at much earlier timepoints. This information can help design future paediatric clinical trials in Chagas disease.
