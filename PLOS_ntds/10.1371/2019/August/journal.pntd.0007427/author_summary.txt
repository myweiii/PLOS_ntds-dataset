Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, including Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, remain endemic in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including parts of Kenya. The current WHO-recommended treatment strategy focuses on morbidity control, and comprises periodic deworming of population groups at particular risk, including pre-school and school–age children. Consequently, the majority of epidemiological descriptions of STH have focused on infection in this age group, and are conducted using a school platform. There is therefore a notable lack of age-stratified data (that includes adults) from communities. We present data from a community-wide, cross-sectional survey of STH infection across 19,684 individuals and investigate associated risk factors at the household and individual level. We demonstrate highest prevalence and intensity of hookworm (the predominant species in this setting) in adults and males—a group not routinely included in deworming activities. There was marked geographic variation in infection risk across the study area, and an enduring relationship between infection risk and factors associated with poor access to sanitation and hygiene. Conducted after three years of ongoing, annual school-based deworming, the findings presented here are likely to be representative of many regions of SSA, with similar epidemiological and demographic profiles, implementing the current WHO-recommended STH control strategy.
