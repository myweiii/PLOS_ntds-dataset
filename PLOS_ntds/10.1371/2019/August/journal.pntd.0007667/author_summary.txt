Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis poses a considerable health problem in Ethiopia. Efficient disease control can only be accomplished when all players of transmission are well understood and taken into account. The aim of our study was to investigate in a village in the south, called Ochollo, whether rodents also harbor the parasite and to assess the different potential vector species (sandflies) and their spatial and seasonal distribution. We established that the rodent species we captured are probably no hosts for Leishmania aethiopica, but confirmed that hyraxes are abundant and that a high percentage of them is positive for L. aethiopica. Based on a very large sample size, we found that Phlebotomus pedifer is the only vector in the area. We discovered that the general sandfly and specific P. pedifer abundance are lowest in the wet season and negatively correlated with humidity. We also demonstrated that the sandfly abundance is equally distributed among different habitats, but P. pedifer and infected sandflies mainly reside in caves. Altogether, we suggest that if outdoor sandfly control methods would be considered, it would be useful to carry it out in the wet season in or around caves. The role of hyraxes in disease transmission should be further investigated.
