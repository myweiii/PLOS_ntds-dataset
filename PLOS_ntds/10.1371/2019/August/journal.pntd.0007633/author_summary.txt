Amoebiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica that is an important health problem worldwide because of high morbidity and mortality rates. However, clinical options are inadequate; therefore, developing new preventive measures, such as anti-amoebic drugs, is urgently needed. In general, for the development of new drugs, the identification of appropriate leads and targets is a prerequisite. Here, to develop new drugs against amoebiasis, we focused on E. histolytica adenosine 5â€²-phosphosulfate kinase (EhAPSK), an essential enzyme in sulfur metabolism. An EhAPSK-based combination approach of computer-based in silico and laboratory-based in vitro analyses enabled us to screen 400 chemicals, from which we identified 15 that inhibit EhAPSK activity. Furthermore, among them, three compounds halted biological processes in Entamoeba that are closely associated with the clinical manifestation and pathogenesis of amoebiasis and with disease transmission. Hence, this study provides leads as well as a target for the development of new drugs against amoebiasis. This study also provides a basis to identify inhibitors for use in the study of sulfur metabolism, an important topic in general biochemistry and physiology.
