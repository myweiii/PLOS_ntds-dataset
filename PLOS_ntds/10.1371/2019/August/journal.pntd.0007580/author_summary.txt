Hundreds of millions of people in South Asia are infected with parasitic worms, such as hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm. However, precise information on where these infections occur and the exact number of people affected is not available. Such information though is important to aid control programs, so that interventions can be targeted to priority areas and limited financial and human resources allocated in a cost-effective manner. We did a systematic review of the literature to collect prevalence data on soil-transmitted helminth infections and used Bayesian geostatistical models to predict infection risk at high spatial resolution in four mainland countries (i.e., Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan) of South Asia. These countries account for 97% of the population in the region. We estimate that more than 350 million people were infected with at least one species of parasitic worms in 2015. The risk maps provide an overview of the geographic distribution of parasitic worm infections in the study region. Our results highlight the need for up-to-date surveys to more accurately evaluate the disease burden in South Asia.
