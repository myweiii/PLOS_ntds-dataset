    "Background": "Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) containing killed Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 organisms (Bivalent-OCV; Biv-OCV) are playing a central role in global cholera control strategies. OCV is currently administered in a 2-dose regimen (day 0 and 14). There is a growing body of evidence that immune responses targeting the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae mediate protection against cholera. There are limited data on anti-OSP responses in recipients of Biv-OCV. We assessed serum antibody responses against O1 OSP, as well as antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses (a surrogate marker for mucosal immunity) and memory B cell responses in blood of adult recipients of Biv-OCV in Dhaka, Bangladesh.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We enrolled 30 healthy adults in this study and administered two doses of OCV (Shanchol) at days 0 and 14. Blood samples were collected before vaccination (day 0) and 7 days after each vaccination (day 7 and day 21), as well as on day 44. Serum responses were largely IgA with minimal IgG and IgM responses in this population. There was no appreciable boosting following day 14 vaccination. There were significant anti-OSP IgA ASC responses on day 7 following the first vaccination, but none after the second immunization. Anti-OSP IgA memory B cell responses were detectable 30 days after completion of the vaccination series, with no evident induction of IgG memory responses. In this population, anti-Ogawa OSP responses were more prominent than anti-Inaba responses, perhaps reflecting impact of previous exposure. Serum anti-OSP responses returned to baseline within 30 days of completing the vaccine series.",
    "Conclusion": "Our results call into question the utility of the 2-dose regimen separated by 14 days in adults in cholera endemic areas, and also suggest that Biv-OCV-induced immune responses targeting OSP are largely IgA in this highly endemic cholera area. Studies in children in cholera-endemic areas need to be performed. Protective efficacy that extends for more than a month after vaccination presumably is mediated by direct mucosal immune response which is not assessed in this study. Our results suggest a single dose of OCV in adults in a cholera endemic zone may be sufficient to mediate at least short-term protection."
