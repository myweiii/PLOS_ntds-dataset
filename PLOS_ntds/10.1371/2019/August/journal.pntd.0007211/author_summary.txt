Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of death among young children in the developing world. It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.
