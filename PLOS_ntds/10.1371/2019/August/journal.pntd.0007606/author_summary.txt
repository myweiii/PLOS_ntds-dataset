Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, infecting as many as 400 million people per year. While comprehensive, rigorous vector control can reduce transmission, in practice inadequate coverage, improper application, insecticide resistance, high labor costs, and community indifference hinder its wide implementation and sustainability. Maximum impact in reducing vector populations may be achieved when control interventions are implemented with high coverage and are integrated with other control strategies. A single thermal fogging application will not result in long lasting protection and will have low probability of affecting populations of the Aedes vectors and hence disease. This study catalogues an 83% reduction in dengue incidence in the city of Makassar, Indonesia, over an 8-year period, associated with the additional single evidence-based and targeted pre-emptive chemical intervention in addition to good case surveillance and an integrated vector management systemâ€”attributable to governmental commitment and investment in control of vector-borne disease. A vital part of the observations presented is that they are based on the normal function, capability, and capacity of a Ministry of Health team implementing a community-wide intervention.
