Although there was a decrease of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection since late 2017, the specter of congenital Zika syndrome and its re-emergence in flavivirus-endemic regions emphasize the need for sensitive and specific serological tests to distinguish ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV) and other flaviviruses. Compared with traditional tests based on envelope protein, several nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-based assays had improved specificity, however, none can discriminate three flaviviruses in a single assay. Moreover, secondary DENV infection and ZIKV infection with previous DENV infection, both common in endemic regions, cannot be distinguished. Herein we developed a high-throughput and multiplex IgG microsphere immunoassay using the NS1 proteins of four DENV serotypes, ZIKV and West Nile virus to test samples from laboratory-confirmed cases with different primary and secondary flavivirus infections. Combination of four DENV NS1 assays revealed a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 97.2%. The ZIKV and WNV NS1 assays had a sensitivity/specificity of 100%/87.9% and 86.1%/78.4%, respectively. Based on the signal ratio of ZIKV NS1 to DENV1 NS1, the assay can distinguish ZIKV infection with previous DENV infection and secondary DENV infection with a sensitivity of 88.9–90.0% and specificity of 91.7–100.0%. This has applications to serodiagnosis and serosurveillance in endemic regions.
