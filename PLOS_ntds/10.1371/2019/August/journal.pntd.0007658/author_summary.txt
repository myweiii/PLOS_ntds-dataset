Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal disease that affects more than 20 000 people every year. Its diagnosis is difficult since the clinical symptoms are not specific and the existing diagnostic tests are not useful in limited resource countries or they a not accurate enough in East Africa. In this review we performed a systematic search of the published literature to analyse the potential candidate antigens in the pipeline for a new antibody detection test in East Africa. We found 96 tests based on 89 antigens. Eighty six of these tests were evaluated in a study design that is insufficient (phase I and II) to make conclusions on their performance in clinical practice. We found that the candidate antigens either lacked carbohydrate or lipid structures or are based on single antigens as opposed to mixtures or are extracted from the causative parasite itself, making them expensive and prone to variations. Considering that the most widely used diagnostic test does not detect all cases of visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa, we analysed how many of the candidate antigens were tested on East African specimens: We found that only 2 tests (rK28 based immunochromatographic test and the intact promastigote based indirect fluorescent antibody technique) that were tested in a phase III study and only one (dot blot with SLA) that was tested in a phase II study performed well according to our criteria. Due to the antigen characteristics we consider only the rK28 based test as suitable for further evaluation and implementation.
