Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease with a complex transmission cycle that includes many parasite, vector and host species. This disease continues to pose public health problems worldwide despite the measures put in place. In recent years, methodological tools commonly used in ecology, called ecological niche prediction models, have made it possible to determine the environmental and anthropogenic variables that may be favourable to the presence of the host and vector species communities involved in the cycle and therefore to the presence of certain disease agents. The use of these models, based on the presence of human cases of the disease, can overcome some of the uncertainties concerning the diversity of the vectors and the potential hosts involved in the transmission cycle. This approach of health ecology combining ecology and epidemiology could provide new insights into understanding the cycle of disease transmission and the influence of environmental factors and thus improve the prediction of disease emergence and epidemics. It can be applied to various vector-borne diseases whose transmission cycles are still poorly understood and for which studies classically carried out in epidemiology have not prevented disease progression.
