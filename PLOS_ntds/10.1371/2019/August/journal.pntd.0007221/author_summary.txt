Snakebite envenomations cause tens of thousands of deaths and hundred thousands of injuries in many developing tropical countries annually, and sub-Saharan Africa represents an epitome example of this ‘neglected tropical disease’. We here present data collected over a 10-year period applying different methodologies across a typical rural savanna community of northern Ghana. Our data corroborates previous findings from the region that snakebites represent a serious public health threat, and that young and active farmers are particularly at risk, hence compromising both livelihoods and economic wealth of the people. We highlight that many interrelated factors involving both snake ecology and human behaviour in particular, are responsible for the past and current high snakebite prevalence recorded. We conclude that our findings support increased and concerted efforts from both local authorities and state institutions to address the African snakebite crisis that continues unabated. Such interventions require generation of more general baseline data on snake ecology and human behaviour, combined with public awareness campaigns, education and information. To achieve this, we recommend community-based stakeholder meetings involving local people, traditional authorities, as well as public institutions aiming at addressing the ongoing snakebite menace in this part of the world.
