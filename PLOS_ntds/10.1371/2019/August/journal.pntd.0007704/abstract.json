    "Background": "Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most common helminth infections affecting a large population of people in sub-Saharan Africa. This helminth infection is known to cause immunomodulation which has affected the efficacy of a number of vaccines. This study examined whether a chronic schistosoma infection has an effect on the immunogenicity of HPV vaccine which is currently administered to girls and women aged 9 to 24. Little is known about the immune responses of the HPV vaccine in individuals with chronic schistosomiasis.",
    "Methods": "This study was carried out at the Institute of Primate Research (IPR) and involved an Olive baboon model. The experimental animals were randomly placed into three groups (n = 3–4); Two groups were infected with S. mansoni cercaria, and allowed to reach chronic stage (week 12 onwards), at week 13 and 14 post-infection, one group was treated with 80mg/kg of praziquantel (PZQ). Sixty four weeks post schistosoma infection, all groups received 2 doses of the Cervarix HPV vaccine a month apart. Specific immune responses to the HPV and parasite specific antigens were evaluated.",
    "Results": "Animals with chronic S. mansoni infection elicited significantly reduced levels of HPV specific IgG antibodies 8 weeks after vaccination compared the PZQ treated and uninfected groups. There was no significant difference in cellular proliferation nor IL-4 and IFN-γ production in all groups.",
    "Conclusion": "Chronic S. mansoni infection results in reduction of protective HPV specific IgG antibodies in a Nonhuman Primate model, suggesting a compromised effect of the vaccine. Treatment of schistosomiasis infection with PZQ prior to HPV vaccination, however, reversed this effect supporting anti-helminthic treatment before vaccination."
