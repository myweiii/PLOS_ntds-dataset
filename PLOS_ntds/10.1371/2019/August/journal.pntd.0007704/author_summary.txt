In sub-Saharan Africa countries, vaccines are administered to people who may suffer from existing infections, especially helminth infections. These infections are known to modulate immune responses rendering some vaccines ineffective. The impact of helminth infections such as schistosomiasis on a recently introduced Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on infected or treated populations and the degree or duration has not been clearly elucidated. This study was set up to investigate whether a chronic schistosoma infection compromises the specific immune responses elicited by the HPV vaccine.
