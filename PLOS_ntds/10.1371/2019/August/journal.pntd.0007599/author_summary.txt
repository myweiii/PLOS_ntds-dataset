Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an insect transmitted, tropical parasitic disease and in Brazil it causes thousands of human deaths every year. Domestic dogs can also be infected, and they are a risk factor for people. The Brazilian Ministry of Health tries to control the disease in 3 ways; first by reducing the population of insects that can carry the disease, second by using therapeutic drugs to treat the disease in humans, and third by identifying and euthanising infected dogs. However, despite these efforts the burden of VL has doubled since 2010 and a significant contributing factor is the lack of a rapid and accurate pathway for diagnosing dogs. In this study we have shown that an eNose can differentiate between the smell of VL infected and uninfected dogs. The analysis was highly sensitive i.e. if the dog was infected, the eNose would detect it in > 97% of the cases and it was highly specific i.e. if the dog was uninfected eNose detect it in >94% of the cases. The outcome was not dependant on the numbers of parasites or the clinical status of the dog. The results suggest that eNose analysis could be used to identify VL infected dogs with improved the speed and accuracy compared to current methods.
