Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) blockers are widely used in numerous inflammatory diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel diseases. They have been recognized as a risk factor for reactivation of granulomatous infections. Although few cases have been reported, Leishmaniasis has been associated with the use of these drugs. Leishmania infantum is the main causative agent of leishmaniasis in Southern Europe and is prone to produce the visceral form. However, TNF-α has been implicated in the initial events of the infection mediating the disease expression. In our series, we have observed a surprisingly high proportion of cutaneous form (32.6%) and muco-cutaneous form (10.2%). Clinical outcome observed in this series is also unusual. Four cases (14.3%) with cutaneous leishmaniasis who received local therapy relapsed. Among patients with visceral leishmaniasis, one patient who maintained TNF-α blockers therapy relapsed despite etiological treatment. This data supports the assumption that the blockage of TNF-α modifies clinical expression of leishmaniasis leading to atypical presentations. According to the cases reported we proposed as best treatment strategy a systemic drug and the discontinuation of the TNF-α blockers therapy until clinical resolution.
