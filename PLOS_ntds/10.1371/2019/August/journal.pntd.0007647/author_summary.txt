It is not known whether Nifurtimox, a drug for Chagas disease, is significantly transferred into breast milk, and no clinical trials were conducted to evaluate this topic. Treatment with nifurtimox is safe and effective in children and newborns with Chagas disease. Treatment of young women before pregnancy prevents congenital transmission of Chagas disease. This is the first study to measure nifurtimox concentrations in breast milk. We found that presence of nifurtimox into breast milk is limited, and that breastfed babies had normal clinical evaluations with no observable adverse events. None of the mothers had to discontinue breastfeeding due to adverse events. The exposure of nifurtimox through breast milk during the treatment of mothers with Chagas disease does not seem to pose significant risks for the breastfed infants.
