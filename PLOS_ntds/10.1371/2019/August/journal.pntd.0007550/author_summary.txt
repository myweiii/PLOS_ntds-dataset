The number of gHAT cases across West Nile, Uganda has declined in the last 20 years. This decline is due to the impact of programmes of active and passive case detection and treatment which have recently been combined with tsetse control operations (post 2011). We carried out an active survey of gHAT to evaluate the prevalence in areas where vector control has been introduced. Our results confirm that the overall prevalence of gHAT is below 1 case per 10,000 people at risk in the historical foci and shows that results from passive screening are providing an accurate picture of gHAT prevalence in the area.
