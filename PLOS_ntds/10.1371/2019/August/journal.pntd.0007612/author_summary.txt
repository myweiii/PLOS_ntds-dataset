Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic disease that remains one of the most prevalent and serious of the parasitic diseases in the world. Three major Schistosoma species cause human schistosomiasis, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni and S. haematobium. However, the three schistosome references or draft genomes were released in the last decade, which greatly facilitate the progress in the whole research field of schistosome. However, limited by the sequencing technique and mixture samples at that time, only a genome draft was suppled to S. japonicum, which is fragmented and difficult to be a reference in functional genome analysis and gene discovery. Here, using the combination of PacBio and Illumina Sequencing technologies, we present a high-quality assembly of S. japonicum with contig and scaffold N50 length of 871.9 kb and 1.09 Mb, representing 142.4-fold and 6.2-fold improvement over the released WGS-based assembly, respectively. The assembly genome with high quality will certainly supply a new reference genome of S. japonicum and be beneficial to functional genomic and comparative genomics of schistosome, as well as other helminths.
