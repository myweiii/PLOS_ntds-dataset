Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis represent debilitating neglected tropical diseases that are caused by parasitic filarial nematodes. Current efforts to eliminate onchocerciasis are hampered by the lack of drugs that lead to permanent sterilization of the adult worms or provide a macrofilaricidal effect, i.e. kill the adult worms. In the past, doxycycline has been shown to deplete Wolbachia endosymbionts of filarial nematodes, leading to permanent sterilization and macrofilaricidal efficacy in filariae causing both onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. However, contraindications and a requirement for at least 4 weeks of doxycycline treatment impair its broader use, creating a need for drugs with a shorter treatment regimen and potentially fewer contraindications. ABBV-4083 is such an anti-Wolbachia candidate that was efficacious in several filarial animal models and has recently been tested in a phase 1 clinical trial. The present studies addressed several points that are important for subsequent phase 2 clinical trials, namely the comparison of once vs. twice-per-day treatments, the impact of missed treatments, and a comparison of the kinetics of Wolbachia depletion in adult worms and microfilariae, the latter of which has the potential to be a surrogate indicator to avoid the necessity of surgically removing nodules with adult worms at repeated time points.
