Filarial infections are tropical diseases caused by nematodes of the Onchocercidae family. Infections due to filariae regularly induce pulmonary manifestations, however lung pathogenesis of human filarial infections is poorly understood. Litomosoides sigmodontis is a rodent filaria living in the pleural cavity and responsible for pleural inflammation which is used to model responses in human filarial infections. Here, we analyse lung inflammation during the chronic phase of the infection, when female parasites release their offspring (microfilariae). 40% of mice do not present circulating microfilariae. We show that microfilariae enhance pleural cavity responses and induce pulmonary pathology (bronchoalveolar eosinophilia, perivascular cell infiltrates, mucus production and fibrosis of the visceral pleura). Numerous groups of tissue-resident macrophages are identified at homeostasis in the lungs which increase upon infection. Th2-deficient mice present higher parasite burden but lower inflammation and pathology. Our study provides new insight in filarial lung inflammation which may help to understand pathogenesis of human infections.
