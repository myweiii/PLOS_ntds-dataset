Infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, which causes Bilharzia, is common among communities living along the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda and elsewhere around fresh water bodies in Africa. Infection with this parasite is known to alter the body’s immune responses, even to stimuli which are not directly related to the parasite. This alteration may have an adverse impact on responses to vaccines. However, there is still insufficient information on such effects and on whether treatment of schistosomiasis can reverse them. We conducted a study on the Entebbe peninsula in Lake Victoria to examine the effects of infection with S. mansoni parasites on responses to childhood measles catch-up immunisation, and the effect of treating the parasites on the responses. A cohort of 3–5 year-old children, either infected with S. mansoni or not, was enrolled and given measles immunisation. The infected children were treated for S. mansoni either before, at the time of, or a week after the immunisation. Levels of antibodies against measles were measured at one week and 24 weeks after immunisation as indicator of possible protection against measles. The levels of antibodies against measles were lower among the S mansoni-infected children than the uninfected children, and treatment improved this situation. This implies that S. mansoni infection is associated with reduced measles immunisation responses and that treatment improves the response. At 24 weeks post-immunisation, when all children had been treated for S. mansoni, at least 95% of children in all groups had protective levels of antibody. Considering that pre-school children are vulnerable to Bilharzia, an effective schistosomiasis control programme that includes this age group may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy, an issue that needs further investigation.
