Variations in tprK have been acknowledged to be the major contributors to persistent Treponema pallidum infections. Previous studies were based on the clone-based Sanger approach, and most of them were performed in propagated strains using rabbits, which could not reflect the actual heterogeneous characteristics of tprK in the context of human infection. In the present study, we employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to explore the profile of tprK directly from 14 patients with primary syphilis. Our results showed a mixture of distinct sequences within each V region of tprK in these clinical samples. First, the length of identified distinct sequences within the region was variable, which differed by only 3 bp or multiples of 3 bp. Then, among the mixtures, a predominant sequence was usually observed for each V region, and the remaining minor variants were mainly observed at a frequency of 1â€“5%. In addition, there was a scenario of amino acid sequence consistency within the regions among the 14 primary syphilis strains. The identification of the profile of tprK in the context of human primary syphilis infection contributes to further exploration of the pathogenesis of syphilis.
