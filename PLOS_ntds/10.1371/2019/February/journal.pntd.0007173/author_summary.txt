In this study, we reviewed the available literature on the subject of safety and efficacy of the oral drug miltefosine in the treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Literature was searched systematically in the PubMed database and eight articles, with a total of 324 PKDL patients, were included. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the percentage of patients cured after longer (>4 weeks) miltefosine treatment. An estimated 90% of patients was found to be cured one year after treatment with miltefosine. In addition, descriptive analysis showed that nearly 20% of the PKDL patients suffered from side-effects. The majority of these side-effects, such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain, were mild and related to the gastro-intestinal tract. The findings of this study show that miltefosine is effective, although the efficacy has been observed to decline. The gastro-intestinal side effects were frequent but mostly mild. However, based on the limited data in this study we cannot conclude that longer treatment regimens with miltefosine are safe. In order to preserve the drugâ€™s efficacy, we suggest it may be put under consideration to halt the use of miltefosine monotherapy for PKDL until alternative treatment regiments (e.g. short combination therapies including miltefosine) are identified.
