Mass drug administration (MDA), treating either whole communities or targeted groups without a prior diagnosis, is used as a control strategy for many neglected tropical diseases, including soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection. MDA takes place at set intervals, aiming to reduce morbidity caused by the target disease. Research and policy focus is also increasingly considering the potential of interrupting STH transmission, leading to elimination. In this study we measure STH infection in two villages in the delta region of Myanmar over the course of a year, both before and after MDA rounds, to quantify the effect of treatment on infection and to identify groups with persistent infections. We found that whilst overall prevalence of STH infection decreased over the year, intensity of infection, measured by eggs per gram of faeces, did not significantly decrease. We also found evidence to suggest that particular people are predisposed to STH infection. This is possibly due to non-compliance to MDA, or behavioural and social factors. The findings presented here will provide evidence to support continuing Myanmar’s MDA programme for STH control and using accurate diagnostics to identify and target “predisposed” people for sustained treatment.
