Achieving parasitological cure at the end of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment in HIV co-infected patients does not assure definitive cure, as the disease will recur within a year in many patients. In this cohort study, the probability of relapse-free survival at one-year was 50% in all patients. The use of monthly pentamidine infusion for those with lower CD4 counts (<200 cells/μL) at the time of VL cure appeared to result in a comparable relapse-free survival rate to those patients with higher CD4 count (≥200 cells/μL) who did not receive secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, patients with a history of previous VL treatment (VL relapse) remained at high risk of relapse despite achieving CD4 count ≥200 cells/μL at the end of the VL treatment. While all VL patients with HIV co-infection may benefit from secondary prophylaxis, those with CD4 <200 cells/μL and previous history of treatment should be prioritized for secondary prophylaxis. New modalities for prevention of VL relapse in HIV patients should also be explored.
