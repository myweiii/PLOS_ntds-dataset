West Nile virus (WNV) is the cause of the largest mosquito-borne epidemic in the United States in recent history, with over 46,000 reported human cases to date, including >2000 deaths. Since the detection of WNV in California in 2003, repeated outbreaks have been associated with explosive WNV amplification in local mosquito and bird populations. Along with climatic and ecological factors, vector-host-pathogen interactions are potential drivers of WNV epidemics and warrant study. Here, we evaluated the competitive fitness of five WNV isolates made during Californian outbreaks from 2004â€“2012 by co-infection of Culex tarsalis mosquitoes and House Finches against a 2003 founding virus strain. Results indicated that competitive fitness in HOFIs was greater for four of the outbreak isolates, but coincidentally elevated mortality was not observed and viral RNA loads were lower compared to previously studied enzootic strains of WNV. Mosquito competitions resulted in levels of infection and transmission that did not differ among strains.
