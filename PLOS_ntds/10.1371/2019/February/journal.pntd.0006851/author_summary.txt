B. pseudomallei infection, the causative agent of melioidosis, results in severe disseminated or localized infections. A systemic study of the humoral immune response to B. pseudomallei infection using the B. pseudomallei aerosol caprine model would help understand the detectable antigenic proteins as the infection progresses. To study the immune response, IgG and IgM antibody responses to whole cell lysate proteins were identified and analyzed. Antigenic carbohydrates were also studied. From the results, this study suggests that the caprine humoral immune response to aerosolized B. pseudomallei has similarities to human melioidosis and may facilitate the analysis of the temporal antibody responses. In addition, commonly detected immunogenic proteins may be used as biomarkers for the future point of care (POC) diagnostics.
