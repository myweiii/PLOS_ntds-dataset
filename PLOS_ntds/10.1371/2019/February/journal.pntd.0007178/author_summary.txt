Mycobacterium ulcerans causes a destructive infection of skin and soft tissue known as Buruli ulcer that when severe can lead to serious long-term deformity and disability. It is currently not well documented whether people with Mycobacterium ulcerans disease can cure themselves without treatment. In our study we describe five people with small ulcers who cured their disease without specific medical or surgical treatment. This suggests that a proportion of people can develop an immune response sufficient enough to eradicate the disease without the help of medical intervention. This is an important step, as recognition of this possibility provides important further insights into the human immune response against the disease. It also opens the possibility to further studies that may determine characteristics of the organism and hosts that favour spontaneous healing of lesions. This knowledge may in turn improve efforts to prevent and control the disease which are currently lacking.
