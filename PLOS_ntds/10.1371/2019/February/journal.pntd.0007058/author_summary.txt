Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a deadly disease caused by Leishmania infantum parasite, it is found in animal populations, including people, in more than 98 countries across the globe. CanL was first identified within the US in hunting dogs 1980 and then again in 1999 when a large outbreak in a kennel in New York occurred. As the US is usually not considered a tropical country, there was much debate about how this neglected, vector borne, tropical disease had made its way into these dogs. We found that within the U.S. hunting dog population CanL is transmitted from mom to pup with no reported sand fly transmission in the population, despite multiple attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs. While vertical transmission of this disease has been reported in case reports around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission are not known. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R0), or number of new infections that one infected animal can cause has not been reported for vertical transmission of L. infantum. It is important to know the R0 as it helps identify how infectious a route of transmission can be and therefore how easy it might be to control this infection. A cohort of 124 dogs from 18 dams was analyzed from 1999 to 2016 for factors related to vertical transmission. Offspring from dams ever diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum were 13.84x more likely to become positive for L. infantum themselves within their lifetime (RR: 13.84 95% CI: 3.54â€“54.20 p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that an infected mom is highly likely to infect her offspring if treatment is not started to prevent transmission. There is a need for any public health prevention and control efforts to address vertical as well as vector transmission of canine leishmaniosis in endemic countries.
