Tungiasis (also called sand flea disease) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the penetration of female sand fleas in the skin, typically at the toes, the sole or the heel. Once embedded in the upper strata of the skin, the parasite hypertrophies, enlarging its body size by a factor of 2000 within ten days. This causes intense inflammation with pain and itching, eventually leading to impaired mobility. During a period of three weeks, eggs are expelled through a tiny opening in the skin. When the last egg has been released into the environment, the parasite shrinks and eventually dies. Hence, by nature tungiasis is a self-limited infection. However, in endemic settings re-infection is the rule and parasite load gradually accumulates over time. Here we report five cases with extremely severe tungiasis in patients with 400 to 1,300 embedded sand fleas. Not only the feet were affected, but clusters of parasites also occurred at the ankles, the knees, the elbows, the hand, the fingers and around the anus. The patients were partially or totally immobile. Two patients were cachectic and one required a blood transfusion. All patients showed a characteristic pattern of pre-existing medical conditions and culture-related behaviour facilitating continuous re-infection.
