Scrub typhus is an important cause of fever in many Asian countries, including China, India, Vietnam and Japan. It is caused by the intra-cellular bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi and is transmitted to humans by mite larvae (chiggers) which attach to the skin of the host. Scrub typhus is potentially life-threatening but treatable with relatively cheap antibiotics such as doxycycline. The incidence of scrub typhus in the community is not known as most studies were done at hospitals and health posts lacking a clearly defined source-population for patients seeking health care for fever. In this study, the proportion of fever cases due to scrub typhus and the incidence of the infection were estimated by retrospective case identification in a population of 42000 people living in 48 villages in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. We found that about 30% to 40% of hospitalisations for undifferentiated fever may be due to scrub typhus. In contrast, scrub typhus accounted for only about 5% of outpatient fever cases. Our findings confirm the need for large population-based cohort studies to better understand the epidemiology of scrub typhus in endemic settings.
