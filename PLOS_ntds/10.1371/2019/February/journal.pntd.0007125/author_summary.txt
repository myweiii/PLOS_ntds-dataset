Yaws is a contagious non-venereal treponematosis caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, transmitted by skin contact. It is a poverty-related chronic disease characterized by primary and secondary skin lesions, with latent infection and a chronic stage, which could include a destructive process of bones and joints. Early detection and treatment can avoid gross disfigurement and the associated stigma. Currently, the treatment with a single dose of oral azithromycin has proven effective. This systematic review shows that in the Americas there is a need to update the epidemiological situation of yaws and if needed, to implement and optimize the best public health recommended interventions to interrupt transmission and then verify elimination of transmission. Current WHO guidelines define the methodology for monitoring and evaluating yaws control programs. Yearly surveys of pre-school children, though logistically complex, are needed in the post-zero case surveillance.
