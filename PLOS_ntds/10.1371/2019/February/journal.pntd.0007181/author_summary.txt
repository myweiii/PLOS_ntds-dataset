Q fever is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. Domestic ruminants are the most common source of human infection. Main route of transmission to humans is inhalation of infected aerosols and dust with C. burnetii. Acute Q fever is usually presented as a non-specific febrile and self-limiting influenza-like illness, but in severe acute cases, may manifest as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis. In Iran, Q fever is an endemic disease with high seroprevalence among humans and domestic animals. However, human Q fever cases remain undiagnosed in most regions of Iran, especially because most clinicians fail to spot this disease in their differential diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acute Q fever in suspected cases (216 suspected cases) using molecular techniques. Nine acute Q fever patients were diagnosed by Real-time PCR and Nested PCR. Weakness and fatigue, headache, and lethargy were the most prevalent clinical symptoms in positive cases. Human Q fever cases described in this, and previous studies, indicate the need to implement diagnostic techniques for this disease across the country.
