Soil is crucial for the lifecycle and transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), a class of parasitic intestinal worms that infect over a billion people globally. Past studies have shown that water, sanitation, and handwashing may be able to reduce STH infection, but the causal pathway is unclear. This study was nested within a large randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of individual and combined water, handwashing, and sanitation interventions on child health in western Kenya. The sanitation intervention included upgrading pit latrines by installing a plastic slab, as well as delivery and promotion of child safe feces management tools. The sanitation intervention did not reduce STH contamination in household soil, suggesting households with access to improved sanitation may still be exposed to STH in the household environment. Risk factors for the presence of STH soil contamination included sharing toilets, an uncovered latrine pit, latrines <2 years old, owning dogs, shade on the sampling location, and high soil moisture content.
