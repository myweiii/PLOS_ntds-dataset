The causative agent of Buruli ulcer is Mycobacterium ulcerans. This destructive skin disease is characterized by extensive and painless necrosis of skin and underlying tissues usually on extremities of body due to production of toxin named mycolactone. The disease is prevalent in Africa and coastal Australia. The exact mode of transmission and potential environmental reservoir for the pathogen still remain obscure. Aquatic and biting insects have been identified as potential niche in transmission and maintenance of pathogen in the environment. In this study we screened mosquitoes and march flies captured from endemic areas of northern Queensland for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA. We found seven pools of mosquito out of 845 pools positive for IS2404. In only one of the seven samples were the additional targets IS2606 and KR detected. None of the March fly samples were positive. The results could indicate a low burden of the bacteria in the environment coinciding with a comparatively low number of human cases of M. ulcerans infection seen during the trapping period of the study.
