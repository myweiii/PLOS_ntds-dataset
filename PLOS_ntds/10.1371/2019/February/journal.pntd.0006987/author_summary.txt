Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most malaria infections outside Africa, with 13.8 million vivax malaria cases reported annually worldwide. Antibodies are a key component of the host response to P. vivax infection, and their study can assist in identifying suitable vaccine candidates and serological biomarkers for malaria surveillance. The binding of P. vivax Duffy binding protein region II (PvDBPII) to the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) is critical for P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes. Although the binding residues for DARC are highly conserved across PvDBPII, the parasite displays high sequence diversity in non-binding residues of PvDBPII. Other regions such as PvDBPIII-V are relatively conserved. Recently, sequencing of P. vivax field isolates, identified a homologous erythrocyte-binding protein (PvEBP), which harbors a domain, region II (PvEBPII), that is homologous to PvDBPII. To date, there has been limited investigation into the naturally acquired immunity to both PvDBPIII-V and PvEBPII in human populations. Using a longitudinal cohort study, we have characterized the serological response to PvDBPII, PvDBPIII-V, and PvEBPII among 1â€“3 years old PNG children and investigated associations with protection against clinical malaria. This study shows that both total IgG and IgG3 to the predominant PvDBPII AH allele in PNG, and total IgG and IgG1 to PvEBPII were associated with protection from P. vivax malaria.
