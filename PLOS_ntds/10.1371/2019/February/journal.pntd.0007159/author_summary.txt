The Wolbachia bacterium lives symbiotically within the filarial worms that cause onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. In the absence of these bacteria juvenile worms cannot mature, females are unable to reproduce, and the worm life-span is significantly shortened. Thus, anti-Wolbachia therapy would seem to be an ideal approach to treating filarial disease. This concept has been validated clinically using the tetracycline antibiotic doxycycline. However, doxycycline, which is contraindicated in children and women of child-bearing age, is not ideal for field use. Additionally doxycycline requires a long course of treatment (minimum 4 weeks of daily use) to provide clinical benefit. A safer, faster anti-Wolbachia agent would be a valuable addition to the filariasis pharmacopeia. Through targeted screening, we have identified the veterinary antibiotic Tylosin A (TylA) as an effective anti-Wolbachia lead compound. While the in vitro and in vivo activity of TylA match that of doxycycline, its potency is not ideal, and it suffers from poor oral bioavailability. By appropriate derivatization of the 4”-OH group of TylA (on the mycaminose sugar) we were able to improve oral absorption while simultaneously increasing anti-Wolbachia potency. Optimization of this substituent with a focus on metabolic stability led to the identification of ABBV-4083, the 4”-(4F-benzyl) analog. ABBV-4083 is exquisitely active against Wolbachia, with an improved pharmacokinetic profile. This analog outperforms doxycycline in several animal models of filariasis; in particular it clears the bacteria effectively with substantially shortened dosing regimens. Preclinical efficacy and safety studies indicate that ABBV-4083 may have a desirable profile as a novel, next-generation anti-filarial agent.
