Leishmaniasis is a major neglected tropical disease, being responsible for more than 20 million deaths per year. The high mortality rate highlights the difficulties and ineffectiveness of the current prophylactic approaches and treatments currently available. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be highly advantageous to circumvent these problems. Despite the many vaccines preparations that have been studied in the last few years, none have shown satisfactory efficacy to be approved for human use. Immune receptors, including the TLR family, are known to be important for host defense during parasitic infections, such as leishmaniasis, and also for vaccine efficacy. In this work, we investigate the role of TLR9 during Leishmania amazonensis infection in vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice. We used a C57BL/6 TLR9-/- mouse model and a first-generation vaccine preparation (LaAg) composed of a total lysate of L. amazonensis. We demonstrate that TLR9 is important for controlling leishmaniasis infection caused by L. amazonensis and is involved in the efficacy of the LaAg vaccine. These findings will certainly help in the development of a better vaccine against leishmaniasis.
