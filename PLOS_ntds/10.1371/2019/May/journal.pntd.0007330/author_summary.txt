Cholera affects more than 4 million people globally every year; people predominantly living in poverty or in resource-constrained conditions including political crises or natural disasters. Choleraâ€™s typical presentation is characterized by rapid onset of acute watery diarrhea and vomiting which can progress from watery stool to shock in as little as four hours. Laboratory conditions needed for culture confirmation and strain preservation are rarely to never present in these affected areas. In fact, many cholera endemic areas in Sub-Saharan African are so remote that even treatment response alone is often challenging. Here we present the genomic analysis of DNA extracted from dried filter paper, which is a low-cost, low-tech and sustainable method. Previously this method has facilitated cholera confirmation by PCR, but we demonstrate that this method is also suitable for whole genome sequencing and subsequent strain characterization by presenting the analysis of samples from an outbreak in a remote area of Cameroon. This method will facilitate the understanding of the molecular epidemiology in cholera-prone areas, which were previously too challenging to attempt. It also introduces a method that can be used on a broader scale for diarrheal disease surveillance, including providing a window into co-infection and microbiome analyses.
