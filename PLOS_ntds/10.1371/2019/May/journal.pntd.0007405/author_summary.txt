The present study reported serological findings and molecular assays of Rickettsia spp and ticks of wild boars, simultaneous to their correspondent hunting dogs and hunters. Seropositivity for Rickettsia spp. was higher in wild boars when compared to dogs and humans but was similar between dogs and humans. Despite Rickettsia spp. prevalence was statistically higher in southern than central-western Brazil for wild boars, no significance was observed in hunting dogs and hunters. For the first time, A. sculptum ticks were founded in wild boars from the subtropical climate of southern Brazil. Despite human beings have been considered less exposed to ticks (and therefore rickettsiae) than animals, specific human activities such as wild boar hunting may increase the risk of exposure and consequently tick-borne disease. Wild boars may be carrying and spreading capybara ticks from their original habitats to other ecosystems. These results may provide important findings for public action planning to prevent neglected vector-borne diseases in overlapping areas of wild boars, hunting dogs and hunters. Further studies can be required to explore the ability of wild boars to infecting ticks and be part of transmission cycle of Rickettsia spp.
