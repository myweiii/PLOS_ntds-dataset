Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that can cause severe heart disease. Current treatments do not work well and have significant side effects. Because of this, the authors created a new vaccine prototype with the goal that it could be given to infected people to prevent Chagas-associated heart disease. The vaccine contains a manufactured protein identical to a protein in the parasite (called Tc24) as well as a component to help the body produce a protective immune response (a vaccine adjuvant called E6020). The vaccine would boost the bodyâ€™s natural immune response to the parasite infection, reducing the number of parasites in the body, and protecting the heart. Frequently, people are not diagnosed until later in the infection, because the early (or acute) stage of disease can be mistaken for a common cold. Because of this, it is important to test the vaccine when given in the later (or chronic) stage of infection. The authors tested the vaccine in a mouse model of chronic T. cruzi infection and found that the vaccinated mice had lower levels of parasites in their body and less damage to their hearts. This research shows promising value of a therapeutic vaccine to prevent Chagas-associated heart disease in a mouse model, with the hope that the same effect could be found in humans one day.
