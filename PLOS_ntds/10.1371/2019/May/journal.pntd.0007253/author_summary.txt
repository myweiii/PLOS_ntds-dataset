Leishmaniasis, a neglected parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of a female sand fly, is endemic in 98 countries or territories with approximately 0.7 to 1.2 million cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases occurring each year. In Panama, most of the CL cases are caused by L. panamensis and, the first line of treatment is pentavalent antimony, given parenterally for 20 days. These systemic regimen is associated with toxicities that can limit the patient from receiving a full course of treatment. Alternative therapies are needed particularly for patients with mild disease, no mucosal involvement, no immunosuppression, and for patients living in areas with scarce infrastructure. Therefore, less toxic, non-parenteral new therapies against CL are urgently needed. We conducted a comparative clinical study that evaluated Paromomycin topical creams (Paromomycin alone versus Paromomycin+Gentamicin) for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 399) in three sites of country. Our study demonstrated the efficacy of these preparations against New World leishmanial species (mostly L. panamensis) with a cure rate close to 80%.
Our trial supports Paromomycin as a viable alternative treatment for CL caused for the New World Leishmania species.
