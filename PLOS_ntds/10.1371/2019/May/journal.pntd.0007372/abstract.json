    "Abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) affect more than 1.5 billion people. The global strategy to control STH infections requires periodic mass drug administration (MDA) based on prevalence among populations at risk determined by diagnostic testing. Widely used copromicroscopy methods to detect infection, however, have low sensitivity as the prevalence and intensity of STH infections decline with repeated MDA. More sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to inform program decision-making. Using an integrated product development process, PATH conducted qualitative and quantitative formative research to inform the design and development of a more sensitive test for STH infections. The research, grounded in a conceptual framework for ensuring access to health products, involved stakeholder analysis, key opinion leader interviews, observational site visits of ongoing STH surveillance programs, and market research including market sizing, costing and willingness-to-pay analyses. Stakeholder analysis identified key groups and proposed strategic engagement of stakeholders during product development. Interviews highlighted features, motivations and concerns that are important for guiding design and implementation of new STH diagnostics. Process mapping outlined current STH surveillance workflows in Kenya and the Philippines. Market sizing in 2016 was estimated around half a million tests for lower STH burden countries, and 1–2 million tests for higher STH burden countries. The cost of commodities per patient for a molecular STH diagnostic may be around $10, 3–4 times higher than copromicroscopy methods, though savings may be possible in time and staffing requirements. The market is highly price sensitive as even at $5 per test, only 27% of respondents thought the test would be used by surveillance programs. A largely subsidized STH control strategy and a semi-functional Kato-Katz test may have created few incentives for manufacturers to innovate in STH diagnostics. Diverse partnerships, as well as balancing needs and expectations for new STH diagnostics are necessary to ensure access to needed products."
