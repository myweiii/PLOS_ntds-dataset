Several African countries including Burkina Faso have experienced dengue outbreaks recently. In outbreaks, dengue control relies on the control of its vector but data on Aedes aegypti resistance to insecticide, a key for efficient control, are often lacking, especially for the African continent. We conducted a study in localities within and around Ouagadougou to assess the Ae. aegypti resistance to insecticides and investigate the mechanisms involved. We collected larvae of Aedes aegypti from three different localities and different breeding sites to assess larval and adult susceptibility to insecticides. Aedes aegypti adults showed high resistance to pyrethroid insecticides with the prevalence and intensity of resistance depending on the locality and type of breeding site. Adults showed less pronounced resistance to carbamates, and both larvae and adults remain susceptible to organophosphate insecticides. The resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is partly explained by a high frequency of a pair of kdr mutations (1534C and 1016I) and the overexpression of genes of the P450 family linked to insecticide degradation in the mosquito. Datasets on both resistance and mechanisms in Ae. aegypti from the African continent are quite rare and are important for dengue control in Burkina Faso and elsewhere.
