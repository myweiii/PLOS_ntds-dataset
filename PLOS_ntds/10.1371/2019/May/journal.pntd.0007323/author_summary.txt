Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are associated with a large disease burden worldwide. Mass administration of deworming drugs for preventive chemotherapy is the cornerstone of global strategy for STH control, but treated individuals often rapidly become reinfected, and there is also concern about emerging drug resistance. Interventions to treat drinking water, wash hands at critical times and isolate human feces from the environment through improved sanitation could reduce STH transmission by reducing the spread of ova from the feces of infected individuals into the environment and subsequently to new hosts. Nutrition improvements could reduce host susceptibility to infection. Existing evidence on the effect of these interventions on STH is scarce. In a setting with ongoing mass drug administration, we assessed the effect of individual and combined water, sanitation, handwashing and nutrition interventions on STH infection in children. Approximately 2.5 years after the initiation of interventions, we found reductions in STH infection from water treatment and sanitation interventions; there was no reduction from the handwashing and nutrition interventions. While the reductions were modest in magnitude compared to cure rates achieved by deworming drugs, they indicated sustained reduction in environmental transmission. The reductions were more pronounced for STH species that do not have long-term environmental reservoirs. These findings suggest that water treatment and sanitation interventions can augment mass drug administration programs in striving toward elimination of STH.
