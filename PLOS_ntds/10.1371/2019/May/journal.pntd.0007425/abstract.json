    "Background": "The tumor-like growth of the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm E. multilocularis causes human alveolar echinococcosis, a severe disease mainly affecting the liver. The germinative cells, a population of adult stem cells, are crucial for the larval growth and development of the parasite within the hosts. Maintenance of the germinative cell pools relies on their abilities of extensive proliferation and self-renewal, which requires accurate control of the cell division cycle. Targeting regulators of the cell division progression may impair germinative cell populations, leading to impeded parasite growth.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In this study, we describe the characterization of EmAURKA and EmAURKB, which display significant similarity to the members of Aurora kinases that are essential mitotic kinases and play key roles in cell division. Our data suggest that EmAURKA and EmAURKB are actively expressed in the germinative cells of E. multilocularis. Treatment with low concentrations of MLN8237, a dual inhibitor of Aurora A and B, resulted in chromosomal defects in the germinative cells during mitosis, while higher concentrations of MLN8237 caused a failure in cytokinesis of the germinative cells, leading to multinucleated cells. Inhibition of the activities of Aurora kinases eventually resulted in depletion of the germinative cell populations in E. multilocularis, which in turn caused larval growth inhibition of the parasite.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our data demonstrate the vital roles of Aurora kinases in the regulation of mitotic progression and maintenance of the germinative cells in E. multilocularis, and suggest Aurora kinases as promising druggable targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutics against human alveolar echinococcosis."
