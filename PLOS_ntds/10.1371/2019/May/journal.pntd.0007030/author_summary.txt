Protozoa of the genus Babesia are the second most common blood-borne parasites of mammals after the trypanosomes. Babesia and Theileria are the etiological agents of piroplasmosis, a tick-transmitted disease causing substantial losses of livestock and companion animals worldwide and has recently gained attention as one of the emerging zoonosis in humans. Diminazene aceturate (DA) and imidocarb dipropionate are still the first choices for the treatment of animals. However, these drugs cause many adverse effects. Furthermore, they are not approved for human medicine. Therefore, the development of alternative treatment remedies against babesiosis is urgently required. In the present study we evaluated the effects chalcone 4 hydrate (CH) and trans-chalcone (TC), against the growth of four species of Babesia and T. equi. Furthermore, we studied the chemotherapeutic potential of TC on B. microti in mice. The effects of the combined treatment of TC with DA, CF and AQ revealed that TC was found to diminish the adverse effects of these drugs.
