Leptospirosis which is an emerging zoonotic disease worldwide, is transmitted to humans through contact with soils or surface waters contaminated with the urine of reservoir animals. Species of Leptospira, which include infectious and non-infectious strains, are ubiquitous in the environment. In this study we have sequenced the genomes of strains of Leptospira isolated from several environmental sources worldwide. Comparison of these genomes with other members of the Leptospira genus revealed the existence of 30 novel Leptospira species. A comparative genomic analysis of species of the genus allowed us to identify genes or genome features that are specific of infectious species, providing insights into virulence evolution in these atypical bacteria but also allow refinement of the Leptospira classification.
