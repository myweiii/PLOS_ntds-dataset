Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. The highest burden is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. On the Zanzibar islands, urogenital schistosomiasis has been successfully controlled over the past decades. The Zanzibar Elimination of Schistosomiasis Transmission (ZEST) project implemented from 2011/12 through 2017 aimed to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis as a public health problem from Pemba and to interrupt S. haematobium transmission from Unguja in 5 years. In a cluster-randomized trial, we investigated the impact of biannual treatment of the population with praziquantel alone or combined with snail control or behavior change interventions. After five years of interventions, the overall S. haematobium prevalence was reduced to <3% in schoolchildren and adults. Heavy infection intensities were observed in <1% of the surveyed population groups. Urogenital schistosomiasis was eliminated as a public health problem from most of the study sites on Pemba and Unguja. The prevalence was significantly lower in 2017 compared with 2011/12, but transmission was not interrupted. To sustain and advance the gains made by ZEST, continued interventions that are adaptive and tailored to the micro-epidemiology of S. haematobium in Zanzibar are needed.
