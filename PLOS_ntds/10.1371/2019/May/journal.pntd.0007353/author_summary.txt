Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. Without treatment, VL is fatal. Although diagnostic techniques, mainly based on the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies are available, invasive procedures such as microscopy from spleen or bone marrow aspirates are still required for the diagnosis of seronegative VL suspects, for the detection of recurrent cases and to confirm cure after successful treatment. Previous investigations showed the potential of IgG1 as a biomarker of post-chemotherapeutic relapse for VL in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) sensitised with crude lysate antigen (CLA). Here we employed in silico tools to search for desired protein features in a large number of L. donovani antigens detected by human IgG1 in western blots. We then employed prediction algorithms to profile epitopes from the shortlisted proteins. We screened a panel of high-scoring peptides in a high-throughput manner using arrays, with low reagent consumption. The most reactive peptide was adapted to RDTs, showing promising results of both sensitivity and specificity. This peptide has the potential of replacing the CLAs in IgG1 RDTs. Thus we believe that in silico tools can be used to optimise wet lab experiments for a rational search of biomarkers.
