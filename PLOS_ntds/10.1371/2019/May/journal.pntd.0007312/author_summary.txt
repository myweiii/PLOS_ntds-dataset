Amidst the ambiguity of its true incidence, melioidosis is gaining importance as an emerging infection in the Indian subcontinent. Variable virulence genes contributing to varied clinical presentation and the association of LPS genotypes provides key insights regarding the disease dynamics, host and pathogen specific determinants for disease presentations and outcomes among melioidosis patients in India. The study shows the divergence of Indian B.pseudomallei strains in context to LPS genotypes compared to isolates reported worldwide. The association of LPS B with mortality foreshadows the need for understanding the cascade of immune response triggered in the presence of different LPS genotypes.
