Leishmaniasis encompasses a broad spectrum of vector-borne neglected tropical diseases with significant worldwide health impact, ranging from the self-healing cutaneous lesions to stigmatizing and disfiguring skin ulcers (mucocutaneous), and the systemic visceral manisfestations (kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis, VL). A poverty-stricken disease, VL is fatal, if left untreated and resurfaces as post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis after several years of apparent cure. Moreover, there is an upward trend in development of resistance to most of the currently available chemotherapeutic arsenal. Absence of vaccines, progressive emergence of HIV-Leishmania co-infection delineate the gravity of VL affliction. Natural products from medicinal plants have shown leishmanicidal effect, which in some cases, is potentiated by immunomodulation. Here, we elucidate the antileishmanial efficacy of Cinnamomum cassia bark fraction (CBD) with no adverse side effects. The parasites were eliminated by apoptosis in vitro while the protection in vivo was complemented by partial immunomodulation. CBD may be used in synergy with known or pipeline drugs for effective maintenance of VL. Our study represents an important step in the regional drive towards VL elimination.
