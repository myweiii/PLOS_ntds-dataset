Regulation of the host`s immune system by filarial nematodes is crucial for the fertility and survival of the nematode. Indeed, the majority of W. bancrofti-infected individuals are characterized by a regulated state including increased regulatory T cells (Treg), IL-10, TGF-Î² and filarial-specific IgG4 and suppressed Th2 cytokine responses. However, the functional role of Treg populations and regulatory B cells (Breg) during filarial infection remains unknown. Thus, in this study we investigated whether W. bancrofti-infected individuals from Ghana harbored distinct Breg and Treg populations which might be important for filarial-specific immunomodulation. Overall, this study shows that W. bancrofti induces distinct Breg populations, especially in patently (microfilaremic) infected individuals who presented significantly increased frequencies of IL-10-producing CD19+CD24highCD38dhigh Breg. Furthermore, clearance of the infection, due to anti-filarial treatment, returned these regulatory immune cells to homeostatic levels showing that an ongoing filarial infection is important for the activation of distinct Breg and Treg subsets. Those regulatory immune cell subsets are a part of a complex system which are induced by filarial nematodes to modulate the host`s immune system and maintain long-term survival.
