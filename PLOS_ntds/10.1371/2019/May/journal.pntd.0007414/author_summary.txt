The reduction in the global burden of malaria has encouraged efforts for elimination. Attempts to control and monitor transmission have mainly focused on the predominant malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. However, eliminating malaria requires the elimination of all human malaria parasites and limited interest has been directed towards estimating the disease burden attributable to the neglected malaria parasites P. ovale spp. and P. malariae. The authors used molecular methods to analyse 2897 blood samples collected in five cross-sectional surveys over a period of 22 years, and described the transmission patterns of all human malaria parasites in a Tanzanian village. They demonstrate a persistent transmission of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. despite a substantial reduction in transmission of P. falciparum, highlighting the need for more attention towards non-falciparum malaria. The authors discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current efforts for regional malaria elimination.
