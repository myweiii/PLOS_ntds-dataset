Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is mosquito-borne virus circulating in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the globe. Infected travellers from CHIKV-affected areas can initiate outbreaks and epidemics in countries where vector mosquitoes are present. Greater understanding of the pattern of imported cases is required to facilitate risk assessment of CHIKV outbreaks. We investigated the temporal pattern of imported CHIKV cases relative to the pattern of overseas arrivals. We also tested whether variability in El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can predict the import of CHIKV cases in Australia. We found that the number of monthly imported CHIKV cases displayed an unstable increased trend versus the stable linear increased trend observed in monthly overseas arrivals. Both the numbers of imported CHIKV cases and overseas arrivals showed substantial seasonality. High seasonal peaks of imported CHIKV cases were consistent with the high seasonal peaks of overseas arrivals into Australia. We also identified four significant transient relationships between ENSO variability and CHIKV importation. Our results suggest ENSO may impact the occurrence of CHIKV epidemics in endemic regions, in turn influencing the pattern of imported cases.
