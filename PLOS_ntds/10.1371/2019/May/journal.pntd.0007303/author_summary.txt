Typhoid fever is an infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. Typhoid fever is rare in developed countries but remains high in the developing world. Effective treatment is available but accurate diagnosis of typhoid fever is challenging as typhoid fever can be difficult to distinguish from other infections. Bone marrow culture is the most accurate diagnostic test for typhoid fever however is invasive and not feasible in many settings. New vaccines for typhoid and the need for improved estimates of burden increases the demand for improved understanding of diagnostic accuracy. Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of tests for typhoid fever is challenging as head-to-head studies are few. We applied newly developed methods for comparative evaluation of diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in children using statistical approaches that allowed for the proper incorporation of uncertainty and comparison of tests that had not been compared directly. The lateral-flow IgG, TPT and Reverse Passive Hemagglutination tests all had good diagnostic accuracy compared to other diagnostics. Combinations of tests may provide a feasible option to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Finally, while South Asia has the most informed set of data on typhoid diagnostic testing accuracy, the evidence base in other important regions needs to be expanded.
