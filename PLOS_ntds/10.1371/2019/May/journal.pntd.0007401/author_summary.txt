Syphilis is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections that affect millions of people around the world. The causative bacterium, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, can be transmitted from mother to fetus during maternal infection, resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although timely treatment of syphilis is highly effective, untreated infection causes late syphilis that affects virtually every organ and leads to serious clinical manifestations. Therefore, syphilis remains a serious healthcare problem. T. pallidum cannot be grown in laboratory using traditional methods, which has slowed the progress in understanding this pathogen biology and pathogenesis. We employed a novel approach of using a related bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, to express Tp0136 protein from two different T. pallidum isolates to study the function of this protein. This strategy enabled us to demonstrate the ability of this protein to bind to fibronectin and laminin receptors present on the surface of various host cells. We showed that Tp0136 facilitates binding to only those host cells that produce fibronectin. In addition, we found that Tp0136-mediated binding is not equivalent in all host cell types, suggesting that the protein could help in colonization of specific human organs and tissues during infection by T. pallidum.
