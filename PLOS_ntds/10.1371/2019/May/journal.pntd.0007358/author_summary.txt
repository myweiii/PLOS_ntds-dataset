Schistosomiasis is a chronic tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. In the Philippines, Schistosoma japonicum afflicts over 800,000 people annually, and another 6.7 million live in endemic areas. The current national control program based on human mass treatment has been unable to eliminate schistosomiasis on its own. This is in part due to the poverty of endemic areas as well as the parasiteâ€™s complex life cycle, which includes transmission by freshwater snails and livestock. A more comprehensive disease control strategy would include periodic treatment and vaccination of the widely used domestic water buffalo or carabao. Sociocultural and behavioral research would also inform and improve the impact of future control programs. To this end, we investigated knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to schistosomiasis in an endemic village in Leyte, Philippines. We found high levels of disease knowledge and awareness, but also inconsistencies in disease prevention habits. Belief in whether schistosomiasis could be prevented was important in this community, associated with previous disease experience as well as receptivity to new strategies like livestock vaccination. This kind of social context is vital to future public health campaigns, and highlights the importance of cross-disciplinary work to achieve successful disease control.
