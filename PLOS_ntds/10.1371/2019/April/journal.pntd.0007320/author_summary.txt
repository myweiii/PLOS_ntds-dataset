Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is the disease of the tropical region especially Southeast Asia and northern Australia where the microbes are present in soil and water. Melioidosis can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the site of infection. Brain and spinal cord infections are rare but fatal, and the knowledge of their characteristics is still limited. In this study, the authors found that most patients with central nervous system melioidosis have risk factors especially diabetes mellitus. Fever is the most common presentation, and brainstem is the primary site of attack causing symptoms and signs of cranial nerve abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid findings usually show mononuclear cells accompanying with high protein and normal sugar level. The diagnosis is made by isolation of B. pseudomallei mostly from brain tissue, brain pus or blood. This knowledge would help physicians to recognize the disease which leads to early diagnosis and treatment along with the better outcome.
