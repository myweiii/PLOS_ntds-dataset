We would like to express our appreciation to the numerous unnamed persons in the DVS and elsewhere in Namibia, e.g. farmers, private veterinarians, and other members of the public that reported suspect animals or submitted samples to the laboratory. Surveillance for rabies and other notifiable diseases would not be feasible without their ongoing commitment. The technical support for correcting data and for creating maps by Patrick Wysocki (FLI) is gratefully acknowledged. We would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) for supporting this project in Namibia, both directly and through the continuous support of the FLI. We also express our gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their critical and constructive comments that helped us to improve the manuscript.
