Several lungworm species are neglected pathogens in Colombia. Angiostrongylus vasorum and Crenosoma vulpis target the cardiopulmonary system of domestic and wild canids. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior infect domestic cats as well as wild felids. Angiostrongylus costaricensis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis may cause severe gastrointestinal or neurological diseases in humans, respectively. Snails/slugs are necessary intermediate hosts in the life cycles of these parasites. We assessed the prevalence of metastrongyloid larvae in 609 specimens of the giant African snail, Lissachatina fulica, from 6 Colombian municipalities. In Puerto Leguízamo, 53.3% of the snails were infected with Ael. abstrusus larvae, 8.4% with Ang. vasorum larvae, 6.5% with T. brevior larvae and 5.6% with C. vulpis larvae. Snails from Andes and Tulúa were positive for Ang. vasorum larvae with a prevalence of 4.6 and 6.3%, respectively. This epidemiological study reports for first time the presence of Ael. abstrusus, T. brevior, C. vulpis and Ang. vasorum in the invasive giant African snail in various parts of Colombia.
