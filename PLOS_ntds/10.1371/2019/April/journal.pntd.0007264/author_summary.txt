Leishmania are unique unicellular organisms in terms of cytoskeleton organization and mechanisms of cell death. For example, the major cytoskeletal components of these parasites are microtubules, which form a subpellicular corset. In terms of cell death, an apoptotic phenotype has been characterized in Leishmania but the pathways remain unknown, being devoid of key mammal cell death proteins. In a previous article, we demonstrated that the cytoskeleton of this parasite is extensively glutamylated but, paradoxically, overexpression or inhibition of polyglutamylase expression have limited visible cellular consequences. In this manuscript, we have highlighted the link between polyglutamylation and Leishmania cell death, suggesting the importance of the polyglutamylation/deglutamylation balance in this parasite. Further, we have identified, for the first time in Leishmania, deglutamylases, among which one that, in an original manner, deglutamylates glutamates at branching points but also long glutamate side chains. This work emphasizes the role of post-translational modifications as essential regulators of protein function, not only of mammal cells such as neurons or ciliated/flagellated cells, but also of infectious agents. This work suggests an important and discernible “live or die”—“cell death or autophagy” balance pathway and the conceptual mechanism that is involved in cellular decision making.
