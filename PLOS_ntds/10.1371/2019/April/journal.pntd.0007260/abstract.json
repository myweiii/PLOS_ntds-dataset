    "Background": "Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite, a primary causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. Sterol produced via the mevalonate pathway, show differences in composition across biological kingdoms. The specific occurrence of Δ22-unsaturated sterols, containing a double bond at the C-22 position in the side chain occurs in fungi as ergosterol and as stigmasterol in plants. In the present study, we report the identification and functional characterization of a plant-like Cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP710C1 in L. donovani as the Leishmania C-22 desaturase.",
    "Methodology": "In silico analysis predicted the presence of a plant like CYP710C1 gene that encodes a sterol C-22 desaturase, a key enzyme in stigmasterol biosynthesis. The enzymatic function of recombinant CYP710C1 as C-22 desaturase was determined. To further study the physiological role of CYP710C1 in Leishmania, we developed and characterized an overexpressing strain and a gene deletion mutant. C-22 desaturase activity and stigmasterol levels were estimated in the wild-type, overexpressing promastigotes and heterozygous mutants.",
    "Conclusion": "We for the first time report the presence of a CYP710C1 gene that encodes a plant like sterol C-22 desaturase leading to stigmasterol biosynthesis in Leishmania. The recombinant CYP710C1 exhibited C-22 desaturase activity by converting β-sitosterol to stigmasterol. Axenic amastigotes showed higher expression of CYP710C1 mRNA, protein and stigmasterol levels compared to the promastigotes. Sterol profiling of CYP710C1 overexpressing L. donovani and heterozygous mutant parasites demonstrated that CYP710C1 was responsible for stigmasterol production. Most importantly, we demonstrate that these CYP710C1 overexpressing promastigotes are resistant to amphotericin B, a drug of choice for use against leishmaniasis. We report that Leishmania sterol biosynthesis pathway has a chimeric organisation with characteristics of both plant and fungal pathways."
