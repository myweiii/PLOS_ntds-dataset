We derive equations for the mean and variance of the probability of, and time to, extinction in population of tsetse flies (Glossina spp), the vectors of trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa. In so doing we provide the complete proofs for all results, which were not provided in a previously published study. We also generalise the derivation to allow for the probability that an offspring is female to lie anywhere in the interval (0, 1). The probability of extinction was most sensitive to changes in adult female mortality. The unusual tsetse life cycle, with very low reproductive rates, means that populations can be eradicated as long as adult female mortality is raised to levels greater than about 3.5% per day. Simple bait methods of tsetse control, such as insecticide-treated targets and cattle, can therefore provide simple, affordable and effective means of eradicating tsetse populations. The results are of further interest in the modern situation where increases in temperature are seeing the real possibility that tsetse will go extinct in some areas, but have an increased chance of surviving in others where they were previously unsustainable due to low temperatures.
