Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a severe systemic mycosis caused by different phylogenetic species. According to previous studies, these species could have an impact in PCM clinical features. This study aims to investigate possible associations between Paracoccidioides species and corresponding clinical data. The fungal strains from the patients were recovered, whereas their clinical data were collected to evaluate possible associations of these variables with the fungal species identified through DNA sequencing. Fifty-four fungal strains were recovered from 47 patients, most infected in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Forty-one cases were caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and six by Paracoccidioides americana. P. brasiliensis was responsible for severe clinical forms, and patients infected with P. americana presented a high rate of adrenal involvement. However, no statistically significant associations were found for all variables studied. P. brasiliensis and P. americana share similar clinical features.
