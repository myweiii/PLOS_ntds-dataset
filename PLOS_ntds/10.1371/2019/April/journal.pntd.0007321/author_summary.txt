Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major is endemic in Morocco, especially in the arid pre-Saharan regions. Its main characteristics are rurality and proneness to epidemics. Zagora province an endemic focus for ZCL has been recently the scene of an important CL outbreak. Data analysis of 4,402 CL patients recorded in Zagora province, from October 2017 till Mars 2018 showed that 24 municipalities were affected to different extents; the important percent of cases belonged to Tinouzline, a rural municipality. While all age group patients were affected, children under 10 years old were the most affected. Majority of patients were female; the disfiguring CL scars often lead to the stigmatization of women and impact on their psychosocial lives. Lesions were diverse and pleiotropic ranging from a single lesion to multiple disfiguring sores, with, in extreme cases, as many as 35 lesions. Leishmania major was identified as the Leishmania species responsible of this outbreak. Self-medication by using various products caused superinfection and inflammation of lesions and complicated the diagnosis and treatment. Thus, ZCL remains a major public health problem in Zagora province, and commitment of all stakeholders is urgently required to implement a sustainable regional control program.
