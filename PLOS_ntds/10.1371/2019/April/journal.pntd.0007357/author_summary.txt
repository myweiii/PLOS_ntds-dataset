Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia symbionts are being deployed in the tropics as a way of reducing disease transmission. Some Wolbachia strains are vulnerable to high temperatures but these effects have not been evaluated outside of a laboratory setting. We reared Ae. aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia in the field during the wet season in Cairns, Australia, where the first releases of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti took place. wMel-infected mosquitoes became partially self-incompatible, with reduced egg hatch, when larvae were reared in partial shade where maximum daily temperatures exceeded 39Â°C. Under these conditions the amount of Wolbachia in adult mosquitoes was reduced to less than 1% of laboratory-reared mosquitoes on average, while some mosquitoes were cleared of Wolbachia entirely. In contrast, wMel was stable when mosquitoes were reared under cooler conditions in full shade. Field trials with the wMel strain are now underway in over 10 countries, but high temperatures in some locales may constrain the ability of Wolbachia to invade natural mosquito populations and block disease transmission.
