Leptospirosis is a world-wide zoonosis caused by pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira. Severity of infection ranges from mild features to multi-organ failure and death, although the reason for this is unclear. Clinical symptoms are similar to several other febrile illnesses such as dengue, scrub typhus, malaria, viral hepatitis. Identification of Leptospira spp. is generally based on genotyping and serotyping. This study used matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for rapid and accurate identification of Leptospira whole cell. The methods generated protein spectra of Leptospira isolates and created large protein database which can be used to compare and identify other Leptospira isolates. The machine learning based on the computational mathematic analysis of this database provide the classification of Leptospira phylogeny and biomarkers for species identification.
