The heterogeneity of clinical progression during chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection and the mechanisms determining why some individuals develop symptoms whereas others remain asymptomatic are still poorly understood. The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas Disease (CD) has been attributed mainly to the persistence of the causing parasite and the character of individual host immune responses. Collectin-11 is a host immune response molecule with affinity for sugars found on the T. cruziâ€™s surface. Together with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), it triggers the host defense response against pathogens. Genetic variants and protein levels of MASP-2 and the mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a molecule structurally similar to collectin-11, have been found to be associated with susceptibility to T. cruzi infection and clinical progression to cardiomyopathy. This prompted us to investigate collectin-11 genetic variants and protein levels in 251 patients with chronic CD and 108 healthy individuals, and to examine the effect of gene interaction between COLEC11 and MASP2 risk mutations. We found an association to CD infection with COLEC11 gene variants and reduced collectin-11 levels. The concomitant presence of these genetic variants and MASP2 risk mutations greatly increased the odds for cardiomyopathy. This is the first study to reveal a role for collectin-11 and COLEC11-MASP2 gene interaction in the pathogenesis of CD.
