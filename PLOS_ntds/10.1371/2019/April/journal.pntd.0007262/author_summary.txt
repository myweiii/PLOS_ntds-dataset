Antigenic variation is a system whereby pathogens switch identity of a protein that is exposed to the host adaptive immune response as a way of remaining one step ahead and avoiding being detected. African trypanosomes have evolved a spectacularly elaborate system of antigenic variation, with variants being used from a library of ~2,000 genes. Our ability to understand how this rich repository is used has been hampered by the resolution of available technologies to discriminate between what can be closely related gene variants. We have applied a long read sequencing technology, which generates sequence information for the whole length of the antigen gene variants, thereby avoiding having to try and piece together antigen sequences from lots of small fragments, the pitfall of standard sequencing. Applying this technology to material taken at specific time points from batches of mice infected with trypanosomes reveals that the diversity of variants is much higher than previously suspected, and that there is a clear semi-predictable pattern in the gene expression. Additionally, using this technology we have been able to detect the presence of ‘mosaic’ genes, which are created by stitching together fragments from several donor genes in the library, much earlier in infection than has been shown previously. Therefore, we shed new light on the complexity of antigenic variation and show that long read sequencing will be a very useful tool in analysing and understanding the expression patterns of closely related genes, and how pathogens use them to cause persistent infections and disease.
