Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, leads a digenetic life cycle as a flagellated promastigote in the vector sandfly and aflagellated amastigote within phagolysosomes of infected macrophages. Arginine is an essential amino acid for Leishmania which possesses a high specificity arginine transporter (LdAAP3), a protein that imports the amino acid into parasite cells. Arginine is primarily utilized in de novo protein synthesis and for biosynthesis of trypanothione via the polyamine pathway. It was previously reported by our group that L. donovani senses lack of arginine in the surrounding micro environment and activates a unique arginine deprivation response (ADR) pathway, thus upregulating the expression of LdAAP3 as well as other transporters. In the present study, we identified the region on the arginine molecule which is the ligand that activates ADR. We show that the conserved amidino group at the distal cap of the arginine side chain is the ligand that activates/suppresses ADR. Using arginine analogues that contain this group we observed that arginine sensing and transport are distinct in L. donovani, both in axenic promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. Additionally, the arginine sensor responds to both arginine starvation and sufficiency.
