Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) with praziquantel the only effective drug available. It is estimated that about 800 million people are currently at risk for this disease with more than 200 million people infected. A large drug donation partnership between Merck, Darmstadt, Germany and the World Health Organization supports widespread, successful preventive chemotherapy programs, but the donated drugs does not meet the entire need, particularly not in Africa. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of China-made praziquantel to explore whether the drug could complement preventive chemotherapy programs in Africa. A randomized controlled trial was conducted assigning participants to two groups, one receiving praziquantel from NPF, the other from Merck KGaA. After one month, the cure rate of S. haematobium and were compared to evaluate effectiveness and document potential adverse events. The outcome showed that the two sources of praziquantel that did not differ significantly from each other. China-made praziquantel can thus be trusted to complement the current use of the drug from Merck KGaA in Africa making it possible to enlarge drug provision programs.
