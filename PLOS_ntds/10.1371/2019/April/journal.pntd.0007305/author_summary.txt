The impacts of rabies outbreaks in cattle and other livestock are multifold. At the local level, economic losses resulting from the direct loss of cattle and the animalâ€™s future productivity is a significant threat to the livelihoods of subsistence farming communities. Besides, rabies in livestock poses a potential public health threat associated with human exposures that result during handling sick animals and dressing carcasses of animals that had died of rabies. Furthermore, the Government incurs costs for responding to outbreaks and providing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to potentially exposed individuals. We conducted a KAP questionnaire surveys among cattle owners in two selected study areas of Bhutan to understand the level of rabies awareness among the cattle owners, their attitude towards rabies prevention and control and to identify existing on-farm practices that can result in potential exposure to rabies in animals and humans. We observed that there was a lack of comprehensive knowledge about rabies especially regarding the post exposure care and outcome of rabies infection in humans and animals. Given that most participants lacked knowledge about clinical signs of rabies in cattle their engagement in practices such as examining oral cavity, assisting cattle during parturition and dressing wounds without wearing minimal protective equipment, was concerning. Our study identifies the need to extend rabies education into the rural communities of Bhutan. Furthermore, our findings reiterate the importance of rabies education as a crucial component of the global initiative to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in humans and animals.
