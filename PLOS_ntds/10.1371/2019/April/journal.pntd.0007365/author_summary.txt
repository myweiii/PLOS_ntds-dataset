Lymphatic filariasis (LF, also commonly known as “elephantiasis) is a leading cause of disability in the developing world. It is caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The Sri Lankan Anti-Filariasis Campaign provided five annual rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in all infected areas between 2002 and 2006, and this reduced infection prevalence to very low levels in all sentinel and spot check sites. Sri Lanka conducted transmission assessment surveys (TAS, surveys for filarial antigenemia in primary school children) based on WHO guidelines in 2012–2013, and all evaluation units (EUs) in formerly endemic areas easily passed this test. However, other types of post-MDA surveys (antigenemia and microfilaremia assessments in communities, anti-filarial antibody assessment in primary grade school children and mosquito monitoring for filarial DNA) have shown evidence of persistent LF in Sri Lanka, with the strongest signals in a coastal EU in Galle district. Results from this study show that adult-TAS efficiently detected residual filarial infections in this EU that had passed school-TAS. Adult-TAS results were highly correlated with results from prior surveys that used molecular xenomonitoring (MX) to detect filarial parasite DNA in pools of mosquitoes collected in the same study areas. Thus adult-TAS and MX should be considered as an alternative surveillance approaches for verifying that LF has been eliminated following MDA and for identifying areas that require additional intervention.
