Malaria (due to infection with Plasmodium spp.) and parasitic worms (for example soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma spp.) are common in the tropics. Hence, people are often co-infected, depending on various factors. Interactions between Plasmodium and helminth infections may alter immune response and susceptibility of the infected host, and thus impact on morbidity by either making it worse (synergism) or by reducing it (antagonism). Although these co-infections are common, little is known about the direction and magnitude of such interactions. To deepen the understanding of how co-infection could affect morbidity in infected people, we looked at clinical data (i.e., anemia and splenomegaly) in different population groups in Côte d’Ivoire. We did not observe any exacerbation from co-infection with Plasmodium and helminths; all identified significant interactions were of antagonistic nature but varied in magnitude and parasite combination. In the light of enhanced control efforts targeting helminthiases, a better understanding about potential effects on susceptibility to malaria in co-endemic areas should be gained and intervention strategies against the two type of diseases be planned in a more integrative manner.
