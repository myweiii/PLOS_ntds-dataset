Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are debilitating human diseases that are caused by filarial nematodes leading to blindness and severe dermatitis (onchocerciasis) or lymphedema (elephantiasis) and hydroceles. Current mass drug administration (MDA) programs are restricted to the use of drugs that target the filarial offspring, the microfilariae, and lead to a temporary sterilization of the female adult worms that requires annual to bi-annual MDA for the life span of the fertile adult worms. With lower endemicity, the cost-effectiveness of community-directed MDA is reduced, requiring alternative treatment strategies to ultimately eliminate these filarial infections. Therefore, new drugs targeting the adult worms are required for achieving elimination of those filarial diseases, to provide options in areas of drug resistance, and as an approach in areas of Loa loa co-endemicity, where life-threatening severe adverse events may occur through the use of microfilaricidal drugs. Such new drugs should have a macrofilaricidal effect, i.e. kill the adult worms or lead to a permanent sterilization. Furthermore, these drugs should be preferably administered as an oral formulation or by a single parenteral administration. In the current study we tested a new oral formulation of flubendazole using the rodent filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis, and have demonstrated excellent macrofilaricidal efficacy.
