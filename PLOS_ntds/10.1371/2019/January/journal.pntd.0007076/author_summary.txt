Yaws is a neglected tropical disease affecting children in underprivileged countries, transmitted through direct skin contact with an active lesion. This infection, although rarely fatal, can lead to disfigurement and serious disability. The World Health Organization is currently conducting a yaws eradication effort that employs mass administration of azithromycin, an antibiotic against which the yaws pathogen has slowly begun to develop genetic resistance. Because this phenomenon has the potential to undermine the eradication effort, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of gallium maltolate, which has a novel mechanism of action, against the yaws pathogen. Our initial results show that topical application of gallium maltolate has significant treponemicidal activity, and suggest that this compound might find an application in the effort to eradicate yaws. Future studies will evaluate whether oral administration of gallium maltolate is as effective as the antibiotics currently approved for yaws treatment to clear systemic infection.
