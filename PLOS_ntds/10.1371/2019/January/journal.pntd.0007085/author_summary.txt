Mass deworming is recommended by the World Health Organization for health benefits to communities where soil-transmitted helminth infection is endemic. In addition to health benefits, several recent studies find long run educational or economic benefits for cohorts dewormed as children. In this paper, treatment and control communities which formed part of a cluster randomized deworming trial in eastern Uganda from 2000-2003 were surveyed from 2010-2015 to measure childrenâ€™s basic numeracy and literacy. We analyze this data to see if there are detectable improvements in basic academic skills among children in the dewormed communities. We find that mass deworming of preschool aged children in high prevalence communities in Uganda resulted in no statistically significant gains in numeracy or literacy 7-12 years after program completion. However, there is suggestive evidence that deworming is relatively more effective for girls, primary school aged children, and children living in households with other treatment-eligible children.
