The disease Mekong schistosomiasis poses a threat to the health of about 1.5 million people living near the Mekong river and its tributaries in Cambodia and Laos. It is a water-borne parasite transmitted by direct contact with water in which freshwater snails of the species Neotricula aperta live. Control of the snails is an effective approach to control of the parasite; however, because many suitable habitats for N. aperta occur in remote and inaccessible areas, knowledge of N. aperta population sizes and interconnectivity is insufficient for the design of effective snail control interventions. Although much of the region is difficult to survey by conventional means, population genetics can be used to estimate population structure and total size from small samples of accessible populations. The study added to existing data-sets, to give more population samples and longer DNA-sequences, together with improved analytical approaches to provide a better overview of N. aperta. The findings suggest that N. aperta in different kinds of habitats are also genetically different, with very low levels of migration between them; this genetic clustering is greater than expected from spatial distance alone. Further work is needed to determine if these different clusters vary in ability to transmit the parasite. The overall population size estimates were very large; thus suggesting that high snail population densities observed in accessible habitats are also characteristic of inaccessible populationsâ€”parasites are therefore more likely to return after disease control by immigration from remote areas. Finally, the timing of evolutionary events for snails and parasites was found to differ; this implies that the parasite may not be as strongly restricted to one species of snail as originally thought, which has implications for avoidance of parasite control by host-switching.
