Triatoma dimidiata is one of the broadest distributed triatomine species´ complexes transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi. In Mexico, three haplogroups of the T. dimidiata complex have been reported and all are primary vectors of Chagas disease south of the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Given their epidemiological importance, the question arises whether haplogroups have similar genetic diversity in domestic/modified landscapes, as well as infection characteristics and parasite DTU associations, key components of vector capacity. The aim of the present study was to analyze Triatoma dimidiata population genetics across landscapes, sub-regional, regional, and global Neotropical realm scales, using two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene. Our results support previous evidence for the complex´s origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three principal dimidiata haplogroups and significant secondary divergence within each. Differential T. cruzi prevalence and Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) specificity for individual haplogroups provide evidence for potential differential vector capacity within the complex in Mexico.
