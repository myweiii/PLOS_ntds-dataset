Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted to humans by an infected sand fly bite, through which Leishmania parasites and saliva are co-delivered into the host skin. Despite the numerous studies performed in this area, no vaccine is yet available to control this neglected disease in humans. During the past two decades, saliva of sand flies has been tested for possible application as a vaccine against leishmaniasis. Exposure to specific salivary proteins or sand fly bites can induce a protective cell-mediated immunity. Immunization with Ph. papatasi saliva or recombinant PpSP15 has been previously reported to provide protection against L. major infection. In this study, the efficiency of immunization with Ph. sergenti saliva or plasmid coding for Ph. sergenti salivary proteins in protecting the BALB/c mice against L. tropica was explored. Here we show that although immunization with whole saliva induces a humoral response, this immune response is unable to protect mice against infection; in contrast, immunization with a plasmid coding for Ph. sergenti PsSP9 salivary protein induces a Th1 immune response characterized by a strong DTH response, no detectable antibody response, and a high expression ratio of IFN-Î³ to IL-5 in lymph nodes. The Th1 induced immunity in PsSP9-immunized mice correlates with the protection observed against infection with L. tropica, which was associated with a significant reduction in ear thickness and decrease in parasite load in the ear of protected animals in comparison to control group. Our data suggest that instead of using the whole sand fly salivary proteins, a more effective approach is the use of a single Ph. sergenti salivary protein.
