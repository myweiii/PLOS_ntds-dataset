    "Background": "Flubendazole, originally developed to treat infections with intestinal nematodes, has been shown to be efficacious in animal models of filarial infections. For treatment of filarial nematodes, systemic exposure is needed. For this purpose, an orally bioavailable amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) formulation of flubendazole was developed. As this formulation results in improved systemic absorption, the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile of the flubendazole ASD formulation have been assessed to ensure human safety before clinical trials could be initiated.",
    "Methods & findings": "Safety pharmacology, toxicity and genotoxicity studies have been conducted with the flubendazole ASD formulation.",
    "Conclusions": "Based on these results, in combination with previously described genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity data and the outcome of the preclinical efficacy studies, it was concluded that no flubendazole treatment regimen can be selected that would provide efficacy in humans at safe exposure."
