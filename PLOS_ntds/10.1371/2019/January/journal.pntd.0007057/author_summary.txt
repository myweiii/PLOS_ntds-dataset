Oral cholera vaccines are being increasingly used throughout the world as a key component of cholera prevention programs. While several recent studies suggest oral cholera vaccines may provide durable protection, the potential mechanism that generates this long lasting immune memory and protection are unknown. Unlike antibody and antibody secreting cell responses, memory B cells are thought to be an important part of the immune responses because although these cells do not produce antibody, they are long lived and can be rapidly stimulated to produce antibodies upon re-exposure to infection. Previous studies have shown that memory B cell responses to the Vibrio cholerae O-antigen are associated with protection against cholera infection. In this study, we found that oral cholera vaccine generated long lasting antibody and memory B cell responses to the Vibrio cholerae O-antigen that remained elevated for 6 to 12 months. These findings show that oral cholera vaccination does induce a strong memory B cell response, which could play a role in the generation and maintenance of long-term protection following BivWC vaccination.
