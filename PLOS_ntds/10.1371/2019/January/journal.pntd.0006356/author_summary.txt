Onchocerciasis, caused by the filarial parasitic worm, Onchocerca volvulus, is a major cause of infection-related blindness and skin disease and is targeted for elimination. Current drugs are not optimal in all patient populations and a short-course cure would accelerate elimination. Flubendazole is used to treat intestinal worms in humans. The current oral formulation is not well absorbed into the blood. Flubendazole treatment has mediated curative efficacy in onchocerciasis patients when given as an injection but also causes adverse reactions at the injection site. In this study, we tested whether a new oral formulation of flubendazole with improved absorption could selectively kill Onchocerca adult parasites compared with circulating larval filarial parasites, using immunodeficient mouse models. Whilst injections of flubendazole mediated high levels of efficacy, five-day oral treatment, at a range of doses, did not emulate this curative effect. Oral flubendazole also did not significantly affect levels of microfilariae in the blood. After comparing levels of flubendazole in the blood following injection versus oral treatment, we conclude that a long duration, low dose of the oral formulation, for 5 weeks, would be needed to match the exposure of the drug following injection.
