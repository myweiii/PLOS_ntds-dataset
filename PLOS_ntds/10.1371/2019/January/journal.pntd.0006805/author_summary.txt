We have shown how DNA sequencing can be used to detect and characterise potentially pathogenic microorganisms carried by ticks. We surveyed hard ticks collected from domesticated animals across the West Bank territory of Palestine. All the ticks came from species that are also capable of feeding on humans. We detected several important pathogens, including two species of Rickettsia, the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis and canine parvovirus. These findings highlight the importance of hard ticks and the hazards they present for human and animal health in Palestine and the opportunities presented by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of DNA sequences in this setting.
