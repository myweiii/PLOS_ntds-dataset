Safe and effective macrofilaricidal drugs are critically needed to treat onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, which affect over 54 million people worldwide. Flubendazole (FBZ) in its current commercial formulations is an effective anthelminthic for intestinal soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections but not for filarial infections due to its low bioavailability. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of a new amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) formulation of FBZ given orally to jirds (Meriones unguiculatus) infected with the filarial nematode Brugia pahangi and compare it to FBZ (in suspension) given subcutaneously as a single or multiple dose. Our results indicated that treatment with ASD FBZ did not significantly reduce the total number of worms. However, doses as low as 1.5 mg/kg caused ultrastructural damage to the early stages of developing embryos. No worms were recovered from jirds given 10 mg/kg SC injections of FBZ (suspension) for 5 days when necropsied 68 days after the first-dose, and the number of mf at necropsy was significantly decreased compared to the control group. Animals given only a single 10 mg/kg SC injection had a 63% decrease in the number of adult worms. These animals also had fewer female worms and mf compared to the control group suggesting that even a single SC injection of FBZ had an effect on female survival and fecundity. TEM of worms recovered from jirds given low doses of the ASD formulated FBZ (1.5 mg/kg) suggested that female fecundity and mf production were reduced, but longer treatments, longer takedown times or a second dosing regimen of ASD FBZ may be needed to significantly decrease the total worm burden.
