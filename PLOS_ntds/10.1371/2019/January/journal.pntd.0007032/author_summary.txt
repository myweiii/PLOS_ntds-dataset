Human cystic echinococcosis, caused by chronic infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, affects over 1 million people worldwide. This helminth parasite secretes numerous excretory/secretory products that are in contact with host tissues where it establishes hydatid cysts. In this study, we comprehensively characterized extracellular vesicles (EVs) from E. granulosus protoscoleces and metacestodes, and demonstrated for the first time that the exosome-like vesicles from helminths can interact with host dendritic cells and carry several immunoregulatory proteins. This study provides valuable data on cestode-host immune communication. Nevertheless, further research on EVs is needed to fully understand their role in the parasite-host interface and obtain new data concerning their function as therapeutic markers and diagnostic tools.
