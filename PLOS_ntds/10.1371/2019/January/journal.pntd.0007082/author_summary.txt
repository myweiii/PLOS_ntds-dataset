Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a parasitic zoonosis resembling malignancy due to its clinically silent infiltrative growth, predominately in the liver. For some somatic diseases, comorbid psychological burden predicts the course of disease. However, as far as we are aware, little is known about comorbid psychological burden and fear of disease progression in AE patients. In a cross-sectional study, AE patients were invited to report on depression, anxiety, somatic symptom load, symptoms of posttraumatic stress, quality of life, and their fear of disease progression. Furthermore, we assessed the patientsâ€™ attachment style. The present study revealed that depression, anxiety, and somatic symptom load were above norm sample means. According to our findings, symptoms of posttraumatic stress were comparable to those in cancer patients and fear of disease progression even exceeded scores found in cancer patients. Overall, psychological burden was less pronounced in securely attached patients. AE patients rarely received treatment for their depression or anxiety disorders according to German guidelines. Thus, our results show how important it is that AE patients are thoroughly assessed with regard to psychological symptoms and mental disorders, in order to give psychosocial support and supply treatment to those in need.
