Previously, two types of antigens were used for detection of antibodies to sand flies: 1) salivary gland homogenate (SGH), which requires maintaining a sand fly colony and laborious work to obtain a sufficient amount of antigen or 2) recombinant proteins with the need to use cell expression and a complicated purification procedure. In contrast, synthetic peptides have never been studied for sand flies despite it being easier to produce them in sufficient quantities and purity. In this study, we screened specific antibodies to sand flies in domestic animals using synthetic peptides based on the two most antigenic salivary proteins of Phlebotomus orientalis. This sand fly is the main East African vector of Leishmania donovani, causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, and we detected specific anti-P. orientalis IgG in naturally exposed dogs, goats, and sheep from Ethiopia. We showed that, in dogs and goats, the peptide named OR24 P2 is more suitable for antibody detection then the recombinant proteins. Therefore, we recommend this peptide to replace SGH in larger epidemiological studies for evaluation of the effectiveness of vector control programmes or to estimate the risk of Leishmania transmission.
