West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, which is endemic in a vast geographical area, including the EMRO region. However, the epidemiology of WNV in the EMRO region remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we performed a systematic review on WNV prevalence studies conducted on human populations, animals and vectors across Eastern Mediterranean countries. Our review indicated the infection of most investigated human, animal and vector populations with WNV; however, the paucity of epidemiological data underline the need for integrated surveillance programs as well as continued deployment of prevention and control strategies.
