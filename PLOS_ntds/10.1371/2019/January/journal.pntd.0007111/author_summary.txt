Neglected tropical diseases are a group of poverty-associated parasitic, bacterial, and viral conditions. Collectively, they pose a substantial burden on child health, but there is limited information on current efforts to increase pediatric therapeutic options for these conditions. Understanding gaps in research activity and treatment options to reduce the global impact of neglected tropical diseases in children presents the opportunity to inform strategic initiatives and prioritize future research efforts. We analyzed trials in the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and found that pediatric trials comprised a disproportionately small number of drug and vaccine trials for neglected tropical diseases. Certain neglected tropical diseases, including rabies, leishmaniasis, scabies, and dengue, were particularly under-represented relative to their disease burden in children. We also determined that most medications recommended for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases lack critical data to support use in children, though few of these are currently being studied in pediatric trials. This study points to the urgent need to increase pediatric research activity for certain neglected tropical diseases that result in high disease burden and for which there are limited pediatric treatment options.
