Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne disease and a leading cause of disability and chronic morbidity worldwide. Despite the progress achieved so far in stopping LF transmission by treating the affected communities with specific drugs over several years, areas where lymphatic filariasis persists still exist. Understanding the reasons behind this is pivotal to both reach and sustain elimination. We investigated the factors associated with filariasis persistence in various communities still under drug treatment from two regions of Ghana. We reported high variability in disease burden, adherence to drug treatment and mosquito net use between regions and communities. LF infection was associated with men and not taking the drugs, and men were also less likely to take treatment. Using mathematical modelling, we showed that slight increases in treatment coverage will accelerate elimination. Our findings highlight the reasons for LF persistence and provide guidance on how to successfully achieve elimination by refining drug treatment distribution and mosquito control interventions more tailored to individuals and communities. We also demonstrated the value of using field-collected data in mathematical models to assess the current status of disease elimination and to identify the gaps in control interventions.
