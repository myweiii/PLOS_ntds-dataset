Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) is the in-turning of eyelashes, which leads to sight loss. Control programmes are training health workers to recognise and refer TT for surgery. Currently, training uses a mix of 2D images and examination of live patients. With the decline in TT prevalence, there will be too few TT patients available for this training. Here we explored the possibility of using 3D images of eyes with TT to train and test new trachoma graders. We found that experienced graders were more accurate using 3D than 2D photos, compared to “live grading”. We found that novice trachoma graders could be successfully trained using 3D images, without seeing live patients; and were as reliable as experienced graders when tested in “live grading” on a mixture of people with and without TT. Therefore, we think that 3D photos offer an alternative training tool for programmes, particularly when there are too few people with TT to engage in training activities.
