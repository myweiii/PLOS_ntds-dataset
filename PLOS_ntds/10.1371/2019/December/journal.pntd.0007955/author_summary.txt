Typhoid fever remains a major global health problem in low-and middle-income countries. The treatment of typhoid fever is complicated by the emergence of widespread antibiotic resistance. Azithromycin is presently one of the few oral antibiotic options that can be reliably used for typhoid treatment, although concerns persist regarding variations in response to treatment and emerging resistance. We used a Salmonella human challenge model to better understand response to treatment with azithromycin, as compared with ciprofloxacin. We demonstrate that azithromycin effectively treated typhoid fever, within the context of the model, however longer durations of bacteraemia and fever clearance times (defined as >37.5Â°C) were observed when compared with ciprofloxacin treatment. We studied the pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin within the model to better characterise appropriate dosing strategies. We conclude that oral azithromycin is an effective treatment option for uncomplicated enteric fever in the outpatient setting and should be used in high-burden countries where fluoroquinolone-resistance is common. This study illustrates the application of human challenge models to study antibiotic treatments for typhoid fever. Further studies are required to assess novel treatment strategies, including appropriate azithromycin dosing regimens and combination therapies.
