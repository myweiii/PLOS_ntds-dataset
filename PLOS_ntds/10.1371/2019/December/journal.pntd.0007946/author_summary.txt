Despite being a curable disease, leprosy remains a public health problem in more than 100 countries, where over 200,000 new leprosy cases are reported each year. The incidence rate has remained steady since 2005, indicating continued active transmission of the disease. Since the 1940s, the strategy for leprosy control has involved diamino-diphenylsulfone (DDS) monotherapy and then multidrug therapy (MDT), as recommended by the World Health Organization in 1982. After 30 years of DDS monotherapy, drug resistance has been described worldwide, and after 30 years of MDT, drug resistance has unsurprisingly been observed. However, the nature of drug resistance in Southwest China is still unknown. As the sensitivity of the PCR/sequencing method is limited, especially among paucibacillary (PB) patients, we developed a nested PCR/sequencing and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay that dramatically increased the sensitivity of detecting drug resistance among drug resistance-determining regions (DRDRs). According to results, the folP1 mutant is predominant, but rpoB mutants were not found. The results of this study indicate the preliminary characteristics of drug resistance in the DRDRs of leprosy patients from Southwest China.
