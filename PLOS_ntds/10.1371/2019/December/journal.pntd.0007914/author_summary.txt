Snakebite envenoming is an important health issue that affects mostly rural populations in tropical countries. Antivenom is the only effective treatment, but it is not always available in every medical center located in rural areas. Additionally, the number of snakebite cases is usually not known, or severely underestimated for several tropical countries. As a consequence, antivenom distribution and disease management are hard to optimize, then the estimation of snakebite incidence has been proposed as a key factor to improve snakebite management. To the date, studies have used statistics and community-based surveys to estimate incidence, but these approaches are still challenging. Here our goal is to develop a mathematical model that can estimate the geographic patterns of snakebite incidence. By applying a simple model, which is based on the law of mass action, we successfully captured the spatial variation of snakebite incidence in Costa Rica. The inputs for this model are venomous snakesâ€™ census and presence records, and human population data. Our work gives the basis for the development of more complex models based on the law of mass action to estimate several epidemiological variables associated with snakebite in rural populations.
