Microbiota profoundly affect their host but few studies have investigated the role of bacterial genetics in host-microbe interactions in mosquitoes. Here we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to knockout a membrane protein in Cedecea neteri, which is a dominant member of the mosquito microbiome. The mutant strain had an impaired capacity to form biofilms, infected larvae and adults at lower titers, and had a reduced prevalence in adults. The lower prevalence in adults, but not larvae, likely reflects the difference in the modes of bacterial acquisition from the larval water of these two life stages. Importantly from an applied perspective, we also demonstrated that this editing technology can be harnessed for site-specific integration of genes into the bacterial chromosome. In proof-of-principle studies we integrated either a fluorescent protein or gene conferring antibiotic resistance into the bacterial genome and showed these transgenes were functional in mosquitoes. The specificity, flexibility, and simplicity of this editing approach in non-model bacteria will be useful for developing novel symbiotic control strategies to mitigate the burden of arthropod-borne disease.
