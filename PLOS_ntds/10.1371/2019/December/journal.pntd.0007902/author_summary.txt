‘Chagas disease’ (CD) is a Neglected Tropical Disease endemic in 21 American countries that is caused by a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted to vertebrates including humans by triatomine bugs. The main strategy to restrain CD burden consists of spraying insecticides in human dwellings. However, vector control failures and emerging insecticide resistance require complementing strategies. One such strategy could be to change the human associated host community so that the abundance of parasite ‘reservoirs’ decreases and those of parasite ‘dead-ends’ increases. This requires careful quantitative evaluation using specifically tailored mathematical models. By doing so, we showed that reducing the abundance of reservoir dogs and increasing those of avian hosts that cannot be infected by T. cruzi can lower new human infections by up to 56% and 39%. Although such effects take time to manifest themselves, our results suggest that ‘zooprophylaxis’ can be part of an integrated and sustainable disease management.
