There is not much evidence on dengue in Africa, relative to the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. To estimate the proportion of dengue among patients with fever, and to identify clinical features of dengue during outbreak and non-outbreak periods, we studied 2929 patients with non-malarial fever, aged 1–55 years, who attended five primary healthcare centers in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Patients were tested with a rapid test for dengue, and further tests were carried out on paired blood samples taken 10–21 days apart. Overall, a quarter of non-malarial febrile episodes identified between December 2014 and February 2017 were dengue-positive. Dengue-positive cases were 11 times more likely than non-dengue cases to require observation for ≤3 days. During the study period in 2016, there was a dengue outbreak where more than half of non-malarial febrile patients were identified to be dengue-positive. DENV 2 was the main serotype in circulation during the outbreak, whereas DENV 3 was the main serotype before the outbreak. Rash and retro-orbital pain were more frequently found among dengue-positive cases, compared to non-dengue cases, during the outbreak. During the non-outbreak period, rash and nausea/vomiting were more likely in dengue-positive versus non-dengue cases. There was a low level of clinical suspicion of dengue even during the 2016 outbreak. Therefore, a broader use of rapid diagnostic tests and more epidemiologic data would help to improve dengue case detection and surveillance in Burkina Faso.
