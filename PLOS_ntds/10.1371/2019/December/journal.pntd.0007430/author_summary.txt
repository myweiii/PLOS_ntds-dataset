Chagas disease is one of the main neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting vulnerable communities in Latin America where transmission by triatomine vectors still occurs. Access to diagnosis and treatment is one of the remaining challenges for sustainable control of Chagas disease in endemic areas. In this study, we integrated the ecological and social determinants of human infection with the spatial component to identify individuals, households and geographic sectors at higher risk of infection. We found that human infection was more prevalent in indigenous people compared to creoles and increased with the abundance of infected vectors and with household social vulnerability (a multidimensional index of poverty). We also found that the social factors modulated the effect of the abundance of infected vectors: vulnerable-household residents were exposed to a higher risk of infection even at low infected-vector abundance, and human mobility within the area determined a lower and more variable exposure to the vector over time. These results were integrated in a risk map that showed high-priority areas, which can be used in designing cost-effective serological screening strategies adapted to resource-constrained areas.
