Determination of host specificity is one of the most significant themes in the field of infectious diseases. Identification of molecules related to the host specificity of pathogens can lead to new treatment and prevention methods, and prediction of potential host shifts. Entamoeba histolytica is a human parasite that causes hemorrhagic diarrhea, amebic colitis, and liver abscess, which may result in death in severe cases. Entamoeba nuttalli is the closest species to E. histolytica and infects various wild macaques as natural hosts. E. nuttalli might also be a pathogen with a zoonotic hazard because severe inflammatory reactions in hamster livers and an asymptomatic case of human infection have been recorded. Here, we report E. nuttalli genomic data with a quality that allows comparison with genomes from other Entamoeba species. Comparative genomics revealed common proteins shared with other mammalian Entamoeba species, as well as E. nuttalli-specific proteins. Therefore, this study identifies candidate molecules required for host specificity and subsequent pathogenicity of Entamoeba species.
