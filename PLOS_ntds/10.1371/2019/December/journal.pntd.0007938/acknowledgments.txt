We thank Prof. Giulio De Leo and Dr. Susanne H. Sokolow (Stanford University, USA) for their support in the design of snail sampling protocols. We also thank Prof. Jean-Noel Poda (IRSS, Burkina Faso) for insightful discussions and Mohammed Bagayan for supporting our field campaigns. This work greatly benefited from the efforts of the field technicians: Albert Kabore in Lioulgou, and Martin Sanou in Panamasso. We thank the Institut International d’Ingenieurie de l’Eau et de l’Environnement (2iE) in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, for logistical support and for facilitating the use of its Microbiology and Biotechnology Laboratory.
