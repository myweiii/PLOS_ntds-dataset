The ongoing paradigm shift from schistosomiasis morbidity control to elimination will require addressing multiple facets of the disease’s transmission cycle, including control of the snail obligate intermediate hosts of the parasite. In this context the choice of sampling protocol to monitor and understand population dynamics of aquatic snails has practical implications, in particular for studying the strong seasonal fluctuations in their abundance. However, comparative analyses of alternative methods have seldom been carried out since their development in the 1960s-1970s. Here we compare a widely used time-based protocol with a less commonly employed quadrat protocol. Data collected during 3.5 years in three different habitat types in Burkina Faso (West Africa) suitable for the quadrat method show that both protocols agree in the detection of abundance seasonality. By using statistical models to link the outputs of the two methods we also highlight a saturation of quadrat absolute density estimates as well as zero-inflation in the counts. These results provide insight into the snail’s population dynamics with respect to time-based sampling by supporting the presence of density feedbacks as well as small-scale spatial clustering. This work fosters the use of quadrat sampling in other contexts and the comparison of results with other sampling protocols.
