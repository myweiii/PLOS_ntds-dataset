Snakebite envenomation is an important but neglected tropical disease that impacts millions of people worldwide each year. These bites lead to both death and permanent disability. As they occur in tropical and subtropical regions, they primarily impact people from low-income areas of the world. As potential new treatments are being developed, we must understand their potential benefit in humans before they can be widely disseminated. Performing these human studies requires the ability to determine how patients recovered with these treatments. Having people return for evaluation during recovery is difficult in these low-income regions. We evaluated the ability to use a telephone version of an already accepted measurement of recovery in snakebite, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale. This study demonstrates that using this telephone-administered measure is feasible, valid, and reliable. With the results of this study, we now have an important tool to easily measure recovery in areas where snakebite predominates. This tool will help snakebite envenomation researchers evaluate the potential benefit of new treatments and accelerate the process of bringing new effective treatments to those snakebite patients in the most need.
