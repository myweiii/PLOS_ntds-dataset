Onchocerciasis, caused by the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus, is transmitted via the bites of Simulium blackflies. The World Health Organization has proposed onchocerciasis elimination in African countries by 2020/2025. Processes regulating parasite abundance in the lifecycle of helminths are known to influence the endemic prevalence in mathematical models. For example, when transmission intensity is low, a high proportion of incoming parasites may establish within a human host, whilst the opposite may be true when transmission intensity is high, possibly due to immunological processes. These processes may interact with exposure as some people are bitten more than others and receive more parasites. Therefore, regulatory processes that depend on parasite density and inter-individual variation in exposure play a central role in the ability of transmission to bounce back following mass drug administration. The former, because they may increase the success of parasite establishment as treatment progresses; the latter, because a few highly infected individuals may maintain transmission. We developed an individual-based model for onchocerciasis transmission and show that the interaction between these two processes impacts treatment outcomes. We highlight the need to obtain data on exposure to vector bites and to understand how immunological processes potentially regulating parasite establishment change under treatment.
