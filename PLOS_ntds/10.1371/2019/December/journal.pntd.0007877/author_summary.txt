Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It affects ~7 million people worldwide, exerting its highest impact in Latin America. The acute stage of the infection is generally asymptomatic and goes undiagnosed and untreated. It is in the long lasting chronic stage that the life-threatening heart and/or gut tissue disruptions may occur. Then diagnosis is performed by serological detection of T. cruzi-specific immunoglobulins in the patients´ sera, usually upon suspicion of the clinical symptomatology. Such diagnosis may arrive too late for those with advanced tissue damage as there are evidences indicating that the treatment might be ineffective for them. It is thus of huge importance to provide an early diagnosis to get access to treatment. But the use of current conventional serological tools is not possible in many highly endemic regions distant from equipped reference laboratories. Herein we evaluate an alternative algorithm for the conclusive diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease based on the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in a field study made in the Chaco region of Bolivia. Comparison of the RDTs performance with that of the ELISAs “gold-standard” yielded a sensitivity of 97.7% and a specificity of 96.1%. These values justify a wider use of the RDTs in the region under study, and encourage their evaluation in other regions of Bolivia and other endemic countries.
