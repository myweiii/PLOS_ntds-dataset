Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by parasitic protozoa of the Leishmania donovani complex and is lethal in the absence of treatment. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of L. donovani clinical isolates revealed hitherto cryptic population structure in the Indian Sub-Continent and provided insights into the epidemiology and potential mechanisms of drug resistance. However, several biases are likely introduced during the culture step. We report here the development of a method that allows determination of parasite genomes directly in clinical samples, and validate it on bone marrow and splenic aspirates of VL patients in Nepal. Our study sheds a new light on the biology of Leishmania in the human host: we found that intracellular parasites of the patients had very low levels of aneuploidy, in sharp contrast to the situation in cultivated isolates. Moreover, the observed differences in genomes between intracellular amastigotes of the patient and the derived cultured parasites suggests polyclonality of infections, with different clones dominating in clinical samples and in culture, likely due to fitness differences. We believe this method is most suitable for clinical studies and for molecular tracking in the context of elimination programs.
