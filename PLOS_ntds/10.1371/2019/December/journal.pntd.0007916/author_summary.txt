Scrub typhus is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and is popular in the Asia-Pacific area. Nowadays scrub typhus has been widespread and causes a considerable burden on public health and economy in China. We investigated spatiotemporal patterns, diffusion characteristics and regional distribution differences of scrub typhus cases in mainland China from 2006 to 2017. The majority of scrub typhus cases were reported in June to November, and 98.3% of the total scrub typhus cases during 2006â€“2017 were reported in South region, Southwest region and North region. Scrub typhus had been diffused in mainland China except Qinghai. Scrub typhus occurrences were from point to surrounding regions, and from south to north every year. The peak periods of scrub typhus turn longer, and there existed a single peak to a bimodal peak from north to south. Scrub typhus cases were clustered in Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and Anhui during June to November. The scrub typhus epidemics in Guangdong and Yunnan were the most serious.
