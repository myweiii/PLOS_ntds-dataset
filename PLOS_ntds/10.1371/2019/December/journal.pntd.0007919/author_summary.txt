Argonautes are ancient proteins involved in many cellular processes, including innate immunity. Early in eukaryote evolution, Argonautes separated into Ago and Piwi clades, which maintain a dynamic evolutionary history with frequent duplications and losses. The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism proved fundamental to understand the function of Argonautes. However, recent studies showed that the patterns and observations made in D. melanogaster, including the number of Argonautes, their expression profile and their function, are a rarity among Dipterans. In vectors of epidemic arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses, Piwi genes underwent expansion, are expressed in the soma, and some of them appear to have antiviral functions. Besides being an important basic question, the identification of which (and how) Piwi genes have antiviral functions may be used for the development of novel genetic-based strategies of vector control. Here we coupled population genetics models with computational predictions of protein structure and expression analyses to investigate the evolution and function of Piwi genes of the emerging vector Aedes albopictus. Our data support a general antiviral role for Piwi5. Instead, the detection of complex expression profiles with the presence of sites under positive selection in Piwi1/3, Piwi4 and Piwi6 requires tailored functional experiments to clarify their antiviral role.
