Leptospirosis is one of the most prevalent bacterial zoonoses in the world. The main reservoir of the disease is rodents. Fur animals, domestic animals and livestock are an additional reservoir and also pose a threat of infection for humans. Therefore, the profound interest to Leptospira infection among the main and secondary reservoirs is important considering the direct threat for humans to get infection from these animals. We analyzed the official annual reports of the Lviv Regional State Laboratory of Veterinary Medicine of the Chief Administration of the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection in the Lviv Oblast and the Laboratories of Especially Dangerous Infections of the Lviv Oblast Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine for the period of 2001â€“2015 with regard to Leptospira infection rate in rodents, domestic animals and livestock, as well as wild animals in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine (Eastern Europe). During this period, no leptospirosis cases was recorded in cattle and horses. Cattle were infected only in 0.19% of samples, and Leptospira hebdomadis was identified in all cases. In contrast, all cases of infection among pigs (0.51%) and dogs (2.75%), as well as wild fauna (0.25%) were caused by L. icterohaemorrhagiae. Infection rates in rodents during the study period reached 8.74%, with L. grippotyphosa detected the most frequently (85.94%). While testing rats, we determined that almost every fifth rat (18.44%) was infected by Leptospira, and L. icterohaemorrhagiae was found the most frequently (71.83%). The results reveal that the main preventive measure against the potential threat of leptospirosis in humans is connected to eliminating the significant level of infection in rats and other rodents. Therefore, active deratization should remain a priority in the prevention of leptospirosis in Lviv Oblast of Ukraine.
