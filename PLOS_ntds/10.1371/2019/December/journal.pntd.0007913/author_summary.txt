Haemonchus contortus is a gastrointestinal parasitic nematode that causes major economic losses in small ruminants. Here, we investigated the structure and function of a TGF-β type II receptor homologue (Hc-TGFBR2) and its role in regulating H. contortus development. The results showed that the Hc-tgfbr2 gene was transcribed in all developmental stages of H. contortus, with the highest level in L3s and male adults; the encoded protein Hc-TGFBR2 was expressed in the intestine and gonads of adult stages of this nematode. The transcriptional abundance of Hc-tgfbr2 decreased significantly following knockdown by RNA interference in xL3s of H. contortus, which also caused a marked reduction in the number of xL3s developing to L4s in vitro. These findings reveal that the TGF-β type II receptor (Hc-TGFBR2) associates with development of H. contortus, particularly in its transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage.
