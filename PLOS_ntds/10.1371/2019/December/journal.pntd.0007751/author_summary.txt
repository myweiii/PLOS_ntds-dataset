Taenia solium cysticercosis and taeniasis is a zoonotic disease complex which affects thousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa. This parasite has a human-pig life cycle and has been considered a public health problem mainly in rural areas. As African towns and suburbs grow rapidly and disproportionally, adequate infrastructure such as sewage systems and clean water often lack while population density, trade, and travel increase. This may lead to the appearance of parasitic diseases formerly considered `ruralÂ´ in urban settings. In this study, we searched for evidence of T. solium infections in the Kinondoni district of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We focused on people with epilepsy (PWE) since epilepsy is one of the most common and severe disorders associated with T. solium neurocysticercosis and tested all of them serologically for T. solium cysticercosis and taeniasis. We further investigated neurological and radiological characteristics. Our findings show that in our study area in Dar es Salaam 2.65% of PWE had contracted T. solium infection at some stage. Neurocysticercosis, as confirmed by neuroimaging, was found only in 1.99% of PWE. This, in combination with the relatively small number of PWE detected with taeniasis antibodies (1.66%), points towards the fact that active transmission of T. solium seems to play only a minor role in this urban setting, suggesting that infections may mainly be contracted in rural areas. Further large-scale studies are required to investigate the infection pathways and risk behavior related to T. solium infections within urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa.
