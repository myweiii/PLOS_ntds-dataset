Myiasis is an infestation of human tissues and other vertebrates by dipterous fly larvae. Urogenital myiasis is a rare type of myiasis that occurs primarily in poor people with low socioeconomic levels. Accurate diagnosis of this rare form of myiasis is sometimes difficult and requires a detailed study of unfamiliar morphological patterns of the larvae. Based on combined morphological and molecular approaches, our results provided the first set of data on the molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of moth flies, causing myiasis based on the DNA barcoding in Egypt. Such results present more understanding of causative species epidemiology, the vectorial potentiality, and the proper pest management practices.
