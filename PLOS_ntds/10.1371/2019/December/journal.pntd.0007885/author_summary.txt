Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites belonging to the genus of Leishmania and transmitted by the bite of infected female sand flies. Concerns about the effective control of the disease are rising in view of the increasing number of treatment failures that may be related to drug resistance. Monitoring of drug susceptibility in the field should become an essential asset, however, there is still insufficient harmonization in the laboratory assays. This study focused on the standard intracellular amastigote susceptibility assay and compared protocol variables, such as type of macrophage host cell (primary versus cell lines), multiplicity of infection and duration of drug exposure. Primary cells perform best with little difference between cells derived from Swiss mice or BALB/c mice. From a practical point of view, mouse peritoneal exudate cells can be recommended. If mice would not be available, THP-1 cells are the best alternative. For field strains, metacyclic promastigotes should be used at a multiplicity of infection of 10â€“15 parasites per cell with drug exposure starting at 24h post-infection and continued for 120h. Unfortunately, susceptibility testing of clinical isolates will remain problematic because of the reliance on promastigotes which may exhibit variable degrees of metacyclogenesis and infectivity. Opting for cell-based assays may be complicated by the fact that dedicated laboratory infrastructure may sometimes be lacking in disease-endemic countries.
