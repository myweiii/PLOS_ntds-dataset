Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects over 250 million people worldwide and over 800 million are at risk of infection. Of the three main species, Schistosoma mansoni is the most widely distributed and is endemic in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. It causes a chronic disease with severe negative effects on quality of life. Mass drug administration of praziquantel is the only available course of action due to a current lack of vaccines. However, praziquantel does not protect from reinfection. Therefore, a vaccine would be beneficial as a long-term solution to reduce morbidity and transmission of the disease. Our group has repurposed the attenuated YS1646 strain of Salmonella Typhimurium as an oral vaccine vector for the digestive enzyme Cathepsin B of S. mansoni. Oral vaccination followed by an intramuscular dose of recombinant Cathepsin B lead to significant reductions in parasite burden in mice. These animals had the highest titers in serum IgG and intestinal IgA antibodies. This multimodal vaccination approach also elicited both Th1 and Th2 cytokines as seen by the increases in IFNÎ³ and IL-5. Finally, vaccinated mice had reductions in granuloma size along with a higher proportion of morphologically-abnormal eggs. This work demonstrates that a YS1646-based, multimodality, prime-boost immunization schedule can provide nearly complete protection against S. mansoni in a well-established murine model.
