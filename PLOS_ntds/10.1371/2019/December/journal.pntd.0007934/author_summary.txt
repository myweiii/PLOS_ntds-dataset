The seventh cholera pandemic has claimed >250,000 reported cases and 13,078 deaths until 2018 in Tanzania. To understand the epidemiology and to guide control, we used genomics to study V. cholerae O1 isolated in Tanzania during the past three decades. Tanzanian cholera outbreaks were caused by the T5, T10 and T13 sub-lineages of the 7PET lineage of V. cholerae O1 with some strains showing an unusual 100-bp deletion on the CTX prophage. From 1993 to 2017, most sub-lineages found in patients were also found in the aquatic environment and the close phylogenetic relationships between strains from the two niches suggest that the African Great Lakes may act as a reservoir for cholera outbreak strains. Moreover, we reported clonal transmission at regional and global scale favored by population displacements. Regional collaborative efforts are advised for effective cholera control.
