    "Introduction": "Small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are highly susceptible to the health impacts of climate variability and long-term changes in climate [1,2]. Impacts include increased risk of communicable diseases, such as mosquito-borne arboviruses, and noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular complications associated with heat stress. SIDS face similar challenges\u2014small populations who are repeatedly exposed to extreme weather and climate events (e.g., droughts and tropical storms), limited global political power, reliance on imported goods, and difficulty preventing and responding to disasters due to resource constraints [1,3,4]. Caribbean SIDS will likely experience more extreme hydrometeorological events in the future due to climate change, thereby increasing the morbidity and mortality of climate-sensitive health events and increasing the associated social and economic costs.\nDengue fever, chikungunya and Zika fever are arboviral diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Theses diseases among the top public health concerns in the Caribbean region [5,6]. In 2019, the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) issued an advisory for the possibility of a severe dengue epidemic [7], given a rise in dengue activity in Latin America, the increasing burden of arboviruses over the last number of years, and the large gap in time since the last dengue epidemic in the Caribbean region, which occurred in 2009. The Caribbean is the region of the Americas with the highest incidence of dengue [8]. Vector control is the main public health intervention to prevent and control disease outbreaks through insecticide application, elimination of larval habitat sites, public education and community mobilization [9]. Despite these efforts, the annual number of dengue cases in the region increased from an estimated 136,000 to 811,000 cases between 1990 and 2013, with case estimates adjusted to account for underreporting [8]. New tools and management strategies are urgently needed to increase the capacity of the public health sector to prevent and respond to arboviral disease outbreaks.\nChanges in local climate can influence mosquito vector physiology and population dynamics, thereby affecting disease transmission. Warmer ambient temperatures increase the probability of arbovirus transmission by Ae. aegypti, with optimum transmission at 28.5\u00b0C; however, transmission is improbable in extreme heat (>34\u00b0C) [10]. Both excess rainfall and drought conditions can potentially increase mosquito densities, depending on the characteristics of the built environment and anthropogenic water storage [11,12]. In the Caribbean region, studies have documented the effects of climate on dengue and Ae. aegypti in Barbados [11,13\u201316], Cuba [17], Puerto Rico [18\u201320], Jamaica [16,21], Trinidad and Tobago [13,16], and Guadeloupe [22].\nGiven the linkages between arboviruses, vectors, and climate, the World Health Organization (WHO) and experts in the Caribbean have recommended developing climate-driven early warning systems (EWS) and models to forecast arbovirus outbreaks [23,24]. These tools are known as climate services\u2014tailored products for a specific sector that allow decision makers and practitioners to manage the risks posed by climate variability and climate change. For example, an EWS for arboviruses could inform decisions about when and where to deploy public health interventions to prevent an epidemic in the context of an impending anomalous climate conditions [25].\nThe key ingredient for embedding climate services in public health operations is creating an enabling environment for partnership with different stakeholders. This is done by identifying the common priorities, needs for research, and by building necessary capacities for understanding among climate and public health stakeholders and researchers [26,27].\nStakeholders from the health and climate sectors ideally play a central role in the development and implementation of a forecast model through an iterative engagement process with modelers and other scientists [28,29]. These stakeholders and other end-users of climate information are a diverse group of actors with distinct needs and interests [30,31]. Morss et al. [30] report insightful lessons learned as scientists who attempt to communicate flood risk to the public sector. They state, \u201cDecision makers are not a coherent entity, but a collection of individuals, each of whom uses different information to address different goals in a unique context.\u201d Climate services should be developed with a realistic understanding of the present-day public sector capacity, which may be constrained by resources, information, prior experiences, and other actors or institutions [32]. To guide this process, the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) was designed as the policy mechanism to support the development of climate services for the health sector and other key sectors [33]. The GFCS aims for stakeholder engagement between health and climate actors at all levels to promote the effective use of climate information within health research, policy and practice [33].\nPrior studies have focused on health sector perceptions of the effects of climate change and variability on overall health but have not assessed their perceptions of the potential role of climate services. Studies from the United States and Canada analyzed the perceptions and engagement of public health practitioners in the context of long-term climate change and impacts on health in general [34\u201338]. One study from China assessed health sector perceptions of dengue and climate change and identified a gap between climate change perceptions and behaviors/actions to reduce climate change risks [39]. In the Caribbean, a study found that health providers perceived mosquito-borne disease as increasing due to changing seasonal patterns [40], whereas another study found that health practitioners had limited understanding of the effects of climate variability on health [41]. Climate practitioners in Jamaica were generally aware of the health implications of climate change for heat stress, respiratory diseases, and vector borne diseases [42]. However, few studies (primarily for malaria early warning systems, MEWS, e.g. [43\u201345]) address both climate and health sector needs and interests with respect to climate-driven epidemic forecasts.\nTo address this gap, we conducted a study in the eastern Caribbean where we focused on four key areas, based on the GFCS health exemplar goals [33]:\n\nWhat are the perceptions of climate-health or climate-arbovirus linkages?\nWho are the key actors engaged in climate-arbovirus surveillance and control, and how can communication and partnerships amongst these actors be strengthened?\nWhat are the current capabilities of the health and climate sectors to implement a climate-driven arbovirus EWS, and what capacities need to be strengthened so that the health sector can effectively access, understand and use climate/weather information for decision-making?\nWhat climate/weather data are currently used by the health sector for arbovirus control, what added value does it provide, and how can climate/weather data be effectively tailored for arbovirus control operations?",
    "Methods": "Ethical statement\nThe study protocols were reviewed and approved (or deemed exempt) by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the State University of New York Upstate Medical University, the IRB of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, on behalf of the Ministry of Health of Barbados, and the Ministry of Health and Environment of Dominica. No informed consent was required, as all participants were adults (\u226518 years of age), were public sector employees, and no identifying information was gathered.\n\n\nStudy sites\nThis study focused on the perspectives of health and climate stakeholders from the countries of Barbados and Dominica (Fig 1), SIDS in the eastern Caribbean, as well as regional Caribbean stakeholders. There is a high burden of arboviral diseases in both countries [46\u201350] (Table 1). Barbados and Dominica were selected because of the regional and national interest in building on previous projects, wherein the health sector identified climate services as a top priority for the management of arboviruses [51,52].\n(A) Location of the Caribbean region within the Americas, (B) Archipelago of islands making up the Caribbean and their location within Meso-America. (C) Location of Dominica (purple) and Barbados (green) within the islands in the region. This map was created using freely available country boundary datafrom GADM.org, rendered in ArcGIS. Image files were created using GIMP freeware.\nBarbados (pop. 284,996; land area: 439 km2) has a service-based economy, with tourism accounting for 12% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Barbados is a water scarce country. Droughts threaten to reduce the already limited freshwater resources [55], and tourism is a water-intensive sector. The Ministry of Health is responsible for arbovirus and vector surveillance and control.\nDominica (pop. 73,543; land area: 750 km2) is characterized by abundant freshwater resources, forest and rugged terrain. Eco-tourism is becoming increasingly significant to its economy. The country was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, a category 5 hurricane that damaged 90% of buildings, resulting in USD 1.3 billion in damages, the equivalent of 224% of Dominica\u2019s GDP in 2016 [56]. This study was conducted in the months prior to Hurricane Maria. The Ministry of Health and Environment is responsible for arbovirus and vector surveillance and control.\nThe national health agencies of both countries are supported by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the regional arm of the WHO. Each country has its own national meteorological and hydrological service (NMHS) supported by the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), the technical arm of the Caribbean Meteorological Organization (CMO). Details regarding the mandates and capabilities of the public health and climate national and regional organizations, with respect to arbovirus and vector surveillance and control, and climate monitoring and forecasting, are provided in S1 Text.\n\n\nSurveys and interviews\nWe collected data from key stakeholders from the climate and health sectors spanning senior leadership, managers, and expert practitioners. Stakeholders from the health sector were engaged in arbovirus epidemiology, vector control, or environmental health, at national and regional (Caribbean) agencies. Stakeholders from the climate sector were individuals involved in the development of climate services for the Caribbean region and managers/practitioners from NMHSs. Local leaders of the climate and health sectors assisted in identifying initial interviewees. Subsequent interviewees were identified through snowball methodology, whereby interviewees were asked to identify 2\u20133 additional stakeholders. We determined that we had effectively sampled all key stakeholders when no new names were identified; this was feasible given the relatively small size of the climate and health sectors in Dominica and Barbados.\nA survey instrument was developed for health sector stakeholders. Questions were informed by prior large-scale surveys of health practitioner perceptions of climate change impacts on health conducted in the United States, called \u201cAre We Ready?\u201d [35\u201337], as well as studies by Paterson et al. [38] and Gould and Rudolf [34]. We collected basic demographic information and tailored the questions to focus on health sector perceptions of climate variability and arbovirus risk factors, perceptions of the public health sector response to climate variability, current use of climate information, how they prefer to interact with and receive EWS information, the current strengths and weaknesses of their department with respect to the implementation of an arbovirus EWS, and their training needs. In the survey, we defined climate variability as, \u201cshort-term changes in climate that occurs over months, to seasons, to years. This variability is the result of natural, large-scale features of the climate, often related to El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a events. Examples include floods, multi-year or seasonal droughts, heat waves, hurricanes or tropical storms.\u201d\nPrinted surveys were distributed to health sector stakeholders at national vector control, environmental health, and epidemiology offices, as well as those who participated in national workshops on the development of climate services for arboviruses in Barbados and Dominica in April 2017. The workshop in Dominica was organized by the CIMH and the Ministry of Health and Environment (6 health sector participants). The workshop in Barbados was organized by the PAHO and the CIMH (21 health sector participants). Survey responses were entered into an online digital database using Qualtrics and responses were tabulated.\nAn interview instrument was developed for stakeholders from the climate and health sectors. Questions in the interview and survey were similar so that we could triangulate and validate the responses. We also asked which organizations they had partnered with to manage vector borne diseases, which organizations they would like to partner with, how climate and health fit within their current institutional priorities/mandates/competencies, and what strategies would stimulate collaboration between the climate and health sectors. In interviews with program directors, we asked additional questions about available climate and arbovirus/vector data and information, as well as arbovirus and vector surveillance and control strategies (see institutional competencies in S1 Text).\nProject investigators interviewed stakeholders from the climate and health sectors through in-person meetings or via Skype in April and May 2017. Interviews were audio recorded following permission from interviewees. Recordings were transcribed and coded by project investigators to identify responses by research topic, country/region and sector [57,58].\nDuring the Barbados national workshop, we conducted an exercise where health (n = 21) and climate sector (n = 6) participants were divided into small groups that included representatives from both sectors. Groups were asked to respond to different forecast scenarios (2-week, 3 month, and 1-year forecasts of Ae. aegypti larval indices and dengue incidence). They were asked to identify the actions that they would take in response to alerts at each time scale, and they discussed the utility of the different forecasts. As with interviews, responses were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded.\nThe study instruments were reviewed and tested by local collaborators, as well as the research team, prior to implementation. Instruments are available in S2 and S3 Texts.",
    "Results": "We surveyed 32 individuals from the health sector and interviewed 41 individuals from the climate (n = 10) and health (n = 31) sectors. Respondent demographics are shown in Table 2. Several individuals participated in both interviews and surveys; however, the exact number is unknown since identifiable information was not collected from surveys.\n\n\n(1) What are the perceptions of climate-health or climate-arbovirus linkages?\nPerceptions of climate variability and health impacts.In surveys, health practitioners were asked to respond to a series of statements about the effects of climate variability on health in their jurisdiction and their ability to respond to these effects (Table 3). Most agreed that their jurisdiction is experiencing an increased risk of diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti due to climate variability and that the risk will increase in the future. Survey respondents were worried about the effects of climate variability on health, and they agreed that this is an urgent problem in their jurisdiction. Although two thirds agreed that there are options or solutions to reduce the effects of climate variability on health, they disagreed that they had sufficient resources and expertise to assess the impacts of climate variability on health and to protect residents in their jurisdiction.\nResults shown as % (n). This most frequent response per question is highlighted in bold. Adapted from [35\u201337].\n\nClimate and non-climate risk factors for Aedes-transmitted diseases.Survey respondents were asked to identify the relative importance of climate and non-climate risk factors in triggering epidemics of diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti (Table 4). Non-climate risk factors were identified as more important overall than climate risk factors. The key non-climate risk factors, in order of importance (% very important or important), were the introduction of new viruses (100%), water storage (97%), human movement (91%), limited community engagement (91%), insecticide resistance (88%), and insufficient resources (88%). Climate risk factors, in order of importance (% very important or important), were heavy rainfall (91%), El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a events (72%), drought conditions (56%) and warm air temperatures (51%).\nResults shown as % (n) of survey respondents, ranked by risk factors identified as \u201cvery important.\u201d The most frequent responses are marked in bold.\nRegional and national interviewees were also asked to discuss climate and non-climate risk factors for arbovirus epidemics. They indicated that frequent (re)-introduction of viruses and vectors was associated with human movement between the islands due to trade and tourism. In Dominica, interviewees identified human movement between rural and urban areas as a risk factor. With respect to climate, interviewees identified the onset of the hot, rainy/wet season as a risk factor for arbovirus transmission, although they perceived that the linkages between rainfall and dengue fever have become less clear due to water storage practices. Two interviewees highlighted this contradiction,\n\u201cIf the rain falls very heavily, within two weeks [we] expect to have an increase in number of cases. It\u2019s always associated with rainfall.\u201d\n(Health Sector, Barbados)\n\n\u201cWith these droughts, there doesn\u2019t seem to be, in the last few years, a real dengue season.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Barbados)\n\nIn Barbados, interviewees indicated that household water storage was associated with drought conditions and the resulting water scarcity. Another risk factor was the national legislation requiring that all new buildings greater than 1,500 square feet have rainwater storage receptacles as a drought adaptation strategy; however, the receptacles had become potential Ae. aegypti larval habitat. Interviewees indicated that the improper management of public utilities and infrastructure (e.g., telephone junction boxes, manhole covers, public wells, drains) had resulted in cryptic mosquito larval habitats that were difficult to locate and treat with larvicide during the wet season.\nIn Dominica, interviewees commented that water storage had increased following Tropical Storm Erika in 2015. When the storm damaged the piped water systems, people began storing freshwater in 55-gallon drums around the home. This behavior continued despite repairs to water systems. One interviewee described the effects of Erika,\n\u201cAfter the Tropical Storm Erika, everything just got a little more vulnerable than it used to be\u2026 it was just one downpour of rain that caused all of the destruction.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\nIn Dominica, interviewees noted that Ae. aegypti had expanded its range into higher elevation areas, where the mosquito had not been present historically.\n\nOther effects of climate on health.Interviewees identified other ways that climate affected health in their jurisdiction. This included increased risk of morbidity due to the interaction of heat stress and diabetes associated with hotter days and nights, leptospirosis (Leptospira sp.) associated with flooding, and communicable diseases associated with relocation and crowding of people in shelters following tropical storms. Malnutrition was associated with droughts that reduced crop yields and warming ocean temperatures that caused fish kills. Respiratory problems (e.g., asthma) were associated with dry weather, dust and air pollution. Factors unique to Barbados included hypertension due to sea level rise and salt-water intrusion in the groundwater supply, reduced hygiene and Pseudomonas infections due to water scarcity and storage, skin cancer due to UV exposure, and water-borne diseases (e.g., gastroenteritis, Salmonella) associated with flooding. Factors unique to Dominica included loss of lives due to landslides associated with tropical storms, gastroenteritis associated with dry weather, and mental health morbidity in the elderly and other vulnerable populations who were relocated after tropical storms. One informant described the complex cascading impacts of climate on health,\n\u201c[During droughts] people are not able to go to their farms; they don\u2019t have food and their nutrition suffers. They don\u2019t have income \u2026 they cannot get their medications\u2026 So, its just the rippling effect.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\nHowever, due to the lack of local research, interviewees recognized that most of these linkages were anecdotal or hypothetical, as summarized by one interviewee,\n\u201cSo we have not been able to make a direct link between those diseases and climate variability and change; however, we know that there has been an increase as a result of climate variability\u2026 The data to make that linkage\u2026 is not really always available.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\n\n\n\n(2) Who are the key actors engaged in climate-arbovirus surveillance and control, and how to strengthen communication and partnerships amongst these actors?\nPartnerships.Regional and national interviewees identified a network of agencies and funders engaged in climate-arbovirus surveillance and control (Fig 2). The key regional institutions were the PAHO, the CARPHA, and the CIMH. The Red Cross was the most frequently mentioned non-governmental organization (NGO). The health sectors engaged periodically with their respective NMHS on specific projects; however, there were no formal collaborations. Understanding and mitigating the effects of climate on health were relatively high priorities in the health sector, but climate and health was not yet a mandate for the national health or climate sectors (S1 Text). As a result, it was difficult to allocate resources (e.g., personnel, funding) to this area.\nOrganizations that partner with the health sector (in white) in Barbados and Dominica on issues related to vector control and climate services for health. Organizations in black are current functioning partnerships. Organizations in red are partnerships that need to be strengthened with the health sector.\nInterviewees indicated that the key partnerships to be strengthened were the private sector (tourism, vector control companies, media), academic institutions, and civil society organizations. Interviewees proposed that the tourism sector, hotels, could support vector control, given their concern with reducing disease risk for tourists. In Barbados, health interviewees stressed the need to regulate insecticide use by private vector control companies to reduce the risk of insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors. Private media were identified as partners who could assist with public health messaging, and civil society organizations could help with community mobilization during health campaigns. Interviewees identified the need for stronger collaborations with academic partners to generate evidence to inform public health decision-making.\n\nCollaboration strategies.Regional and national interviewees identified six strategies to strengthen the communication and partnerships amongst these actors.\nFirst, they highlighted the importance of an integrated approach to the development of climate services for health spanning research, operations, a platform for data and knowledge sharing, outreach, awareness raising, education, an in-country response, and mitigation plans and policies.\nSecond, interviewees emphasized the importance of engaging senior leaders from the health sector to raise the profile of climate and health on the health agenda, and to ensure that actions are driven from the top-down.\nThird, they highlighted the importance of formal collaboration agreements amongst climate, health, and other sectors. Regional stakeholders mentioned the multi-lateral agreements recently signed amongst the CIMH, the CARPHA and other regional Caribbean agencies (see S1 Text for details). Interviewees indicated that collaboration agreements would allow them to co-develop and co-deliver climate services for the health sector. The agreements signaled a strong commitment from institution directors and an understanding of mutual benefit.\nFourth, they suggested that national committees on climate and health be established to specify the work that would be done jointly, the roles of each partner, a timeline for an operational plan, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) with a framework for communication, and reporting guidelines. Development of data sharing protocols between the climate and health sectors was identified as a priority given the sensitivity of sharing health information.\nFifth, interviewees indicated the importance of creating shared spaces for dialogue between the climate and health sectors, such as regional and national climate and health forums. An interviewee from the regional climate sector stated,\n\u201cJust sitting with people in the sectors makes such a big difference\u2026 Understand them, what drives them, what are their needs? Because we might think they need something they don\u2019t\u2026 Sometimes it\u2019s about forgetting yourself and putting yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes to really figure out what the need is about. That\u2019s true engagement.\u201d\n(Climate Stakeholder, Regional)\n\nThis engagement would facilitate functional working relationships and increase the trust among people in both sectors, allowing sectoral stakeholders to learn about the needs and perspectives of the other, what information can be shared, and the resources available to help each other. One regional interviewee stated,\n\u201cOnce we build the trust, then we build the network, then we can see what the willingness to collect, to centralize, to digitize, and to share the data really is.\u201d\n(Climate Stakeholder, Regional)\n\nFor example, interviewees suggested that the MoH could partner with their NMHS so that new weather stations are placed in areas that are strategic for arbovirus surveillance, and the NMHS could participate in epidemiological surveillance meetings of the MoH.\nThe sixth strategy (proposed by regional climate interviewees) was that climate services for health be framed as a national development priority, increasing buy-in from decision makers and funding from international development agencies. One regional interviewee stated,\n\u201cI think people will embrace climate and health\u2026 [it is] a real sustainable development goal\u2026 Health has always been a critical sector.\u201d\n(Climate Stakeholder, Regional)\n\n\n\n\n(3) What are the current capabilities of the health and climate sectors to implement a climate-driven arbovirus EWS? What capacities need to be strengthened?\nCurrent capabilities.Health sector survey respondents were asked to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their institution with respect to the implementation of an arbovirus EWS (Fig 3). The top strengths were effective public health messaging to communities, effective health surveillance infrastructure, knowledge of the effects of climate on vector borne diseases, strong coordination with other institutions, and community mobilization. The top weaknesses, or areas to be strengthened, were the availability of financial resources and expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, modeling, and computer programming (see S1 Table for software expertise in health departments and S2 Table for preferred training activities). The need for training in data analytics was summarized by a regional health sector interviewee,\n\u201cHaving got the data, how do we use it? What do we use it for?\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, regional)\n\nEWS = early warning system, GIS = geographic information system, VBDs = vector borne diseases. Results shown as the number of health sector survey respondents (n = 32).\nNMHS interviewees confirmed that they had limited resources to implement climate services for health. They emphasized the need to learn more about the health sector end-user needs. In Dominica, the NMHS identified the need for basic resources to increase their monitoring and forecasting capacities, including a staff meteorologist, adequate transportation to and from meteorological stations, financial resources, instrumentation, and improved security to prevent vandalism to the meteorological stations. They stated,\n\u201cWe use our personal vehicles, but some of the areas are a bit challenging, and we are two females, so sometimes \u2026depending on where we are going, we need somebody else to go with us, for security\u201d\n(Climate Stakeholder, Dominica).\n\n\nTraining needs.Regional interviewees highlighted the importance of training, nurturing, and retaining a cohort of practitioners with expertise in climate and health to ensure the sustainability of an arbovirus EWS. National health sector interviewees emphasized the need to increase their skills in modeling and data analysis through technical workshops on how to use climate information, data, models and other tools to predict epidemics. They identified the need for training on climate and health linkages, greater understanding of climate services for health, how to use climate services for health during emergencies/disasters, and how to communicate the effects of climate on health to local communities. National health sector interviewees suggested that training activities be practical and interactive, such as workshops where multisectoral teams respond to simulations of epidemic warnings.\nRegional and national health sector interviewees expressed an urgent need for training on geographic information systems (GIS) to visualize and analyze arbovirus, vector, and climate information. They found that GIS was a highly effective tool that allowed them to use field data to make informed decisions, and to communicate risk information back to the public.\n\u201cIt is so much easier, better, to use maps when you are doing presentations. Especially if you are doing something with the public where you can actually show them their community and say, \u2018There you have breeding sites. There is where you have the problem.\u2019 And they can actually see it. You can actually show it to them.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\nInterviewees from both countries highlighted the need for better data collection and storage practices in the health sector in order to create high-quality, long-term datasets.\n\nThe need for local research.Regional and national interviewees stressed the need to increase local research capabilities, in part by strengthening collaboration with universities (Fig 2). Interviewees from the Barbados NMHS indicated that they had limited experience with climate research, and that this was an area that they were interested in expanding. National health sector interviewees displayed a high level of field experience and local knowledge but indicated that they had little knowledge of local empirical studies that could inform their decision-making and planning processes. As stated by one regional health sector interviewee,\n\u201cWe want more evidence-based decision-making. We want data\u2026 That\u2019s priority #1\u2026 to get the evidence.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Regional)\n\nRegional interviewees recommended conducting case studies or demonstration projects to generate local evidence on climate-health linkages. They suggested focusing these investigations and interventions at the medium-term (climate variability) time scale (e.g., seasonal variation, year-to-year variation in extreme climate events), rather than the long-term (climate change) time scale. Interviewees highlighted that a collaborative research process with investigators from the climate and health sectors would facilitate data sharing, build trust, and foment a culture of research on climate and health.\n\n\n\n(4) What climate/weather data are currently used by the health sector for arbovirus control, what is the added value, and how can climate/weather data be effectively mainstreamed for arbovirus control operations?\nUse of climate information.Health sector survey respondents were asked about their current use of climate information (S3 Table). Two thirds of respondents indicated they had received general information on the effects of climate on vector borne diseases, and half of the respondents confirmed that climate information was used for some level of planning for disease and vector control interventions. They were unsure as to whether an EWS for arboviruses existed in their jurisdiction, but most indicated that climate information was not part of existing epidemiological warning systems.\nNational and regional interviewees confirmed that the arbovirus alert systems in Dominica and Barbados were based solely on epidemiological surveillance. The health sector and PAHO issue an alert when the number of reported cases surpasses a pre-determined threshold established by the historical average for the same week or month (see Lowe et al. [11] for details). They indicated that the current system did not provide sufficient lead-time to effectively reduce the threat of an epidemic.\nNational interviewees described the current use of climate information for arbovirus control. The health sector considers wet/dry seasons and extreme climate events when planning vector control programs, for example, by increasing larviciding efforts at the onset of the wet season or increasing community campaigns on safe water-storage during droughts. Occasionally, the health sector requests climate data from their NMHS (typically shared as Excel files). However, the health sector does not formally incorporate climate information, such as seasonal climate forecasts, into their planning process. Overall, climate information was reported to play a minor role in decision-making, which was instead driven by policies, regulations, and specific competencies of the organizations.\n\nForecast scenarios.At the national workshop in Barbados, health and climate stakeholders were asked to identify the interventions they would implement if they were provided with short (two week), medium (three month) and long-term (one year) forecasts of vector abundance and dengue incidence (S3 Text). They unanimously stated that disease incidence forecasts would be more effective than vector forecasts in garnering the political attention necessary to mobilize resources to implement preventative interventions. With a short-term forecast, the health sector would increase education, community mobilization, and larval source reduction, especially in known hotspots. With a medium-term forecast, the health sector would be better able to plan with stakeholders, mobilize the field team, look at trends, and create bulletins for community mobilization. With a long-term forecast the health sector could better lobby with health sector leadership and the Minister of Finance for the needed financial support, allowing for more effective budgeting. They would be able to monitor and evaluate interventions and conduct a needs assessment to inform planning. They would also be able to procure diagnostic reagents and supplies for the national reference laboratory, a process that can take up to six months in Barbados. Although the workshop participants identified meaningful interventions at each time scale, they preferred the three-month forecast as indicated in the following,\n\u201cA year can feel like a long time away. With three months, there will be a sense of urgency and you can do meaningful activities, although there might not be new resources.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Barbados)\n\n\nAdded value of climate services.Both regional and national health sector interviewees highlighted the ways in which climate services would improve their planning for arbovirus interventions. By integrating climate and/or disease forecasts into their seasonal and annual planning processes, they felt that they could be proactive and effective at preventing outbreaks, as described by this interviewee,\n\u201cWe know we have Aedes, we know we have the threat, but its only when outbreaks happen, we start scrambling around to do things. So I think if we can put mechanisms in place, long in advance, then we can have more success in dealing with outbreaks. Or we can even prevent outbreaks.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\nInterviewees indicated that climate services have to provide reliable information early enough such that the health sector can target control efforts in high-risk areas during certain times of the year. This would result in a more efficient use of limited financial and human resources, as described by this interviewee,\n\u201cWhen you know that there is an impending threat, you would come up with specific activities that you would conduct. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that those activities would be at a higher cost, but you can be more specific\u2026 It will be easier for us to respond to an impending threat, instead of running around.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\nInterviewees indicated that forecasts of disease risk could be used to inform hospitals about staffing needs, stocking of medicines and laboratory diagnostic reagents, and the development of targeted educational materials for the public. They suggested that warnings be communicated to the public through social media and other outlets to motivate community mobilization for preventative practices. Health sector interviewees indicated that they would feel more motivated and inspired in their day-to-day work if they could see how the epidemiological and vector data that they collected was used to inform decision-making.\n\nMainstreaming climate services.Health sector survey respondents were asked how they would prefer to receive information from an arbovirus EWS. The top responses were a climate and health bulletin (91%), an interactive GIS platform (66%) and internal meetings within their departments (59%) (S4 Table). Interviewees were also asked to identify climate services that would improve their day-to-day work related to arboviruses. National health sector interviewees confirmed that they were interested in utilizing the Caribbean Health Climatic Bulletin launched in 2017 by the CIMH, the CARPHA and the PAHO. The bulletin qualitatively summarizes potential health impacts for a three-month period based on seasonal climate forecasts (https://rcc.cimh.edu.bb/health-bulletin-archive/). Health sector interviewees also reiterated that a GIS platform would allow them to integrate, analyze, and visualize real-time information on vectors and disease risk in relation to rainfall, temperature, and other meteorological variables. Wind speed and wind direction forecasts were also identified as useful information to inform insecticide fogging operations. Regional stakeholders highlighted the importance of creating a multi-country health and climate data repository that would allow for a regional epidemic EWS. National interviewees summarized the health sector needs in the following,\n\u201cWe need it [climate services] packaged in such a way that the health professional would understand. Pick it up, and look at it, and understand it.\u201d\n(Health Stakeholder, Dominica)\n\n\u201cDecision makers at the policy level are not healthcare providers. They are administrators, they are politicians, and we need to help them. We need to feed them [decision makers] with the kind of information they can understand, and [so] they can feel comfortable making decisions.\u201d\n(Climate and health workshop participant, Barbados)",
    "Discussion": "A climate-informed epidemic EWS is a potentially powerful tool to guide public health decision making. Our study confirms that an arbovirus EWS would benefit the Caribbean health sector\u2013a region that is highly vulnerable to extreme hydrometeorolgical events and arboviral disease outbreaks. However, we found that the development of climate services for arboviral diseases will require stronger partnerships, strengthening of local capacities, and greater investment in local research on climate-health linkages. Our findings are echoed by Huang et al [59], who emphasize that health sector adaptation to climate change requires both the implementation of adaptation actions (e.g., climate-driven EWS for arboviruses) and adaptive-capacity building.\nIn this study we identified strategies and opportunities to initiate a successful process of joint collaboration between the climate and health sectors (see S4 Text). This partnership is critical to ensure commitment and ownership by different stakeholders and end-users as climate services are developed. We found that the sustainability of these initiatives will require the political will to establish climate services for health as a mandate in the NMHS and health sectors, allowing them to work in interdisciplinary teams. Beyond the climate and health sectors, we identified a complex web of institutional actors who can engage strategically in the development of climate services for health. This finding highlights the importance of intersectoral collaborations, a key element of Integrated Vector Management for arbovirus control [60].\nWe found that health sector stakeholders demonstrated concern, awareness and a high-level understanding of the impacts of climate variability on arboviruses and health in general. People from the health sector identified an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability. In this region, climate variability is associated with droughts and tropical storms; interviewees identified both as having the potential to increase the risk of arboviral disease outbreaks, as confirmed in prior research [11]. With an increasing number of potential arboviral disease threats [61] (dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro) and emerging insecticide resistance [62] in Ae, aegypti, it is possible that health stakeholders perceived that extreme hydrometeorological events and warmer temperatures may have a greater epidemiological impact today and in the future than in the past, when dengue was the only known arbovirus in circulation. It is also possible that survey respondents intermixed the concepts of climate variability and climate change.\nPrior studies suggest that climate-health awareness has increased in the Caribbean over time. Earlier studies found that there was limited knowledge about climate and health linkages amongst nurses and doctors in private and public sectors [41]. More recent studies in the Caribbean confirm a relatively high level of awareness and concern amongst health-care providers [40], similar to studies in the U.S. [35,37]. Several capacity building initiatives undertaken by regional health institutions have likely contributed to higher levels of climate-health awareness over time.\nOur results also highlight the importance of considering non-climatic drivers of arbovirus epidemics (e.g., human movement, insecticide resistance, and community mobilization), which were perceived to be as important or more important than climate factors in determining arbovirus outbreaks. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of human movement in propagating arbovirus transmission [63,64], including in island settings [65]. Insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti is a major challenges for the health sector, given their reliance on chemical control to reduce disease transmission [66] and lack of regulation of private vector control companies in Barbados. Community mobilization for arbovirus control is an ongoing challenge throughout dengue-endemic regions [67], requiring a nuanced understanding of local community perceptions and behavior [68,69]. Following several years of arbovirus epidemic alerts, Caribbean communities may experience message fatigue [70] and be less responsive to future epidemic alerts. While community perceptions and communication were beyond the scope of this study, these elements should be considered in the development of an EWS.\nDespite high levels of awareness, our findings suggest that the climate and health sectors do not feel ready to develop and implement an EWS or other adaptation measures due to limited institutional capacity (resources and expertise). This was also found in prior studies of health care professionals in the U.S. and Canada [34\u201338,59]. Health stakeholders stressed the need to increase analytical capabilities, such as GIS skills. User-friendly analytic tools/instruments that combine health and climate information could be developed for the health sector for use in routine reporting activities. We found that the national climate sectors (NMHSs) also faced severe capacity limitations. Prior studies have noted the embryonic status of the application of climate science in the Caribbean health sector [24], with only one NMHS offering specialized climate information services for the health sector [71]. The capacity of NMHSs is especially limited in SIDS like Barbados and Dominica [71]. In recent research, representatives from the NMHSs recommended transitioning from a designation of NMHS to become \u201cNational Climate Services Centers (NCSC),\u201d which would facilitate the development of climate services at the national level [71].\nOur results confirm that climate information is neither routinely applied nor used in planning arbovirus/vector interventions in Barbados or Dominica, notwithstanding major advances in climate science and climate-health research globally. The operational co-production of tools and products, such as the quarterly Caribbean Health Climatic Bulletin is a noteworthy first step. The bulletin includes qualitative expert statements on probable health risks associated with seasonal climate forecasts (three months ahead). However, there is significant scope for the development of the next generation of climate services that focus on quantitative probabilistic forecasts of disease risk [24]. One of the most promising examples of a climate-driven dengue forecast model framework was recently described by Lowe et al. for Barbados [11]. The study found that dengue transmission in Barbados increased one month after a particularly wet month and five months after a drought event was observed, and the model was able to accurately predict outbreak versus non-outbreak months. Seasonal climate forecasts routinely produced by the CIMH could be incorporated in the model framework as an early warning tool. This could help the health sector to plan interventions that mitigate the impact of mosquito-borne disease epidemics in the region up to three months in advance\u2014the ideal window of prediction identified by study participants.\n\nLimitations\nWhen comparing the results of this study to prior studies on health sector perceptions of climate, one key difference is that our study focused on people working with arboviruses, environmental health, and climate, whereas other studies focused on health-care providers or public health professionals in general. However, given the relatively small size of the health sector in Barbados and Dominica, we interacted with most senior leadership in interviews and national consultations, in particular those involved with overall management of the public health sector, epidemiological programs, environment, climate change and health. Although we did consider a regional perspective, the results of this study may not be generalizable to all of the Caribbean. Country-level studies should be conducted to capture the nuances of local governance structures, disease epidemiology, and climate.\nOur results were skewed towards the health sector perspective rather than the climate sector, given that more health sector stakeholders were interviewed, and only health sector stakeholders were surveyed. In part, this reflected that there were many more people working in the national health sectors than in the national climate sectors. On the climate side, our results were skewed towards the regional perspective, given that regional stakeholders had more experience with climate services for health.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this study provide recommendations to enhance an interdisciplinary dialogue and partnership within an active community of practitioners, decision makers, and scientists [33,72]. This study contributes to a broader effort to work collaboratively with regional and national health and climate stakeholders in the Caribbean to develop decision support models to predict arbovirus risk and to design effective warning and intervention strategies [24]. Overall, the appropriate involvement of stakeholders is a key element to identify users\u2019 needs, to develop users\u2019 capacities and to exploit existing capabilities. More information regarding national and regional policy opportunities are presented in S4 Text.\nOne of the key conclusions of this study is the need to strengthen the provider-user interface, as currently there is only limited consideration of the products needed by health sector users. Climate services for health can only become operational with the will and support of the climate and health sector institutions. At the same time, it is necessary to create appropriate \u2018communities of practice\u2019 and to emphasize the co-design of climate services products [73]. Final recommendations include:\n\nTo engage senior leadership in the establishment of collaboration agreements (MOUs) between the climate and health sectors, with a focus on climate services for health as a national development priority.\nTo strengthen the capacity of NMHS through their designation as National Climate Services Centers (NCSC) [71], allowing them to build capacity around the basic and operative aspects of climate services and to collaborate with health sector partners to promote climate services for health.\nTo strengthen partnerships with key sectors such as tourism (hotels), private vector control, universities, civil society groups, and private media.\nNational Adaptation Plans for Climate Change, including recent regional efforts to create Health National Adaptation Plans, may be an opportunity to include a policy or mandate for the inclusion of climate in health sector decision-making, and may be an opportunity to strengthen climate services, applying long-term scenarios for planning in health and other sectors (see S4 Text).\nTo strengthen health sector engagement in the region through annual forums focused on climate services and capacity building tailored to the health sector. This could build on existing regional climate meetings like the bi-annual Caribbean Climate Outlook Forum convened by the CIMH (see S4 Text).\nTo strengthen analytic capabilities in the health sector, and to develop data visualization tools for non-experts.\nTo support local research on climate-health linkages through stronger partnerships with academic institutions, particularly at the climate variability time scale."
