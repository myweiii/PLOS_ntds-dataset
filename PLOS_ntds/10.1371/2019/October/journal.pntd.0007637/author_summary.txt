This manuscript reports results of an analysis of four clinical trials that were conducted to evaluate best practices for trichiasis surgery. The analysis showed that regardless of type of surgery performed or the skill level of the surgeon who conducted the surgery, similar patterns emerge. The majority of people have good surgery outcomes. Individuals who had eyelashes touching their eye only centrally before surgery were less likely to develop poor outcomes than those who had eyelashes touching at the edges of their eyelids. The findings highlight the importance of making the surgical incision the entire length of the eyelid and paying special attention to how well the edges of the eyelid are rotated at the end of surgery.
