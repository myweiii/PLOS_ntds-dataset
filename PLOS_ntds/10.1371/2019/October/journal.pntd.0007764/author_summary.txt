Reversal reaction (RR) is a major cause of tissue injury and disabilities in leprosy, resulting from the rapid onset of cell-mediated immune responses to the intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. To identify the mechanisms related to the increase in cell-mediated immunity in RR, we measured changes in the whole blood-derived transcriptome of patients with leprosy before, during and after RR. We identified that RRs are associated with an IFN-γ induced inflammatory response including an antimicrobial gene network containing the GBP1, GBP2, GBP3 and GBP5 mRNAs in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, we show that GBP1, GBP2 and GBP5 mRNAs are also upregulated at the site of disease in RR patients. In summary, our study suggests that RR involves a systemic induction of IFN-γ regulated genes that contributes to an antimicrobial response against the pathogen, releasing ligands and antigens that can further amplify the inflammatory response.
