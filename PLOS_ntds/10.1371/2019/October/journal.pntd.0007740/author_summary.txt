Quaternary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids (QBAs) have antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities (anticancer, antibiosic, and antiphlogistic functions) and have been explored for use as bioantibiotics in livestock. Macleaya cordata fruits have a high QBA content. We isolated QBAs from M. cordata to evaluate molluscicidal activity against Oncomelania and to analyze the physiological toxicity mechanisms. Our results showed that QBAs had strong molluscicidal activity, similar to that of niclosamide. The activities of several important detoxification enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, carboxylesterase, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase) in the liver of O. hupensis snails were severely inhibited by QBAs. The detoxification and metabolic liver functions gradually weakened via poisoning, which could be the main cause of death in these snails. In China, there are abundant wild plant resources of M. cordata, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. QBAs comprising a natural combination of sanguinarine and chelerythrine bisulfate in about a 2:1 ratio had stronger molluscicidal activity than sanguinarine alone. This natural composition could serve as a scientific basis for future development of novel biomolluscicides using these active ingredients and proportions, which could provide an environmentally friendly alternative to the problem of contamination with chemical molluscicides used to combat schistosomiasis in endemic areas.
