Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are important diseases that pass to humans only by the bites of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with these viruses. Due to the lack of an effective vaccine and drug to cure these diseases, mosquito control is the only method available to reduce disease risk. Most of the available preventive and control measures involve an application of chemical-based products. The inappropriate use of chemicals causes insecticide resistance and environmental contamination. In this study, we report on the pilot trial of an alternative, safe, and environmental friendly approach to suppress Ae. aegypti mosquito populations. This alternative method involves the release of sterile Ae. aegypti males that were infected with, naturally-occurring, insect bacteria Wolbachia, and were irradiated at low doses to obtain full sterilization. The pilot trial involved the release of 100â€“200 sterile males per household in a treated area over a 6-month period. High efficacy of this approach was evidenced from a significant reduction in the numbers of wild Ae. aegypti females and an increase in sterility by reduction in the egg hatch rate of wild Ae. aegypti females in the treated area. Public awareness through media resulted in public support to conduct trials in wider areas.
