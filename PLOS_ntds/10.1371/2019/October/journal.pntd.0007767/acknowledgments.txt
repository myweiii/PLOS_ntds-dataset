We especially thank the veterinary and entomological technicians for their unflagging efforts to complete the fieldwork, and A. Picado for helpful discussions. We are indebted to B. Krishnakumari for synthesis of the pheromone, to Russell IPM for preparing the slow release dispensers, to Ann Underhill for laboratory validation of the lure activity, and to S. Gokool for field assistance. V. Yardley supplied the initial Leishmania cultures, S. Mason enabled electronic cross-talk between laboratory and desktop hardware, and V. Camargo-Neves helped obtain SUCEN historical canine data records. We also thank four external experts invited by the Wellcome Trust to review the trial design and statistical procedures. Finally, we acknowledge the public health workers and study communities for their compliance and participation.
