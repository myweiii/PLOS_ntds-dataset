Triatomine bugs, the vectors of Chagas disease, feed on vertebrate blood and occupy diverse microhabitats in close association with their hosts. Each bug species is adapted to particular, ‘primary’ microhabitats. Many species, however, also use ‘secondary’ microhabitats, sometimes including man-made structures. Secondary wild microhabitats are probably of lower overall quality than primary microhabitats, whereas human dwellings can be of higher overall quality if they provide a stable and abundant blood supply. This suggests that there may be a ‘hierarchy’ of triatomine microhabitat quality–top-quality dwellings, high-quality primary microhabitats, and low-quality secondary wild microhabitats. To test this hypothesis, we measured the impact of a severe drought on Triatoma brasiliensis populations living in dwellings and wild habitats, both primary (rocks) and secondary (shrubby cacti). Dwelling and rock bug populations remained largely stable during the drought, whereas most cactus-living populations either became extinct or shrunk to an undetectable size. A few cacti, however, supported relatively large bug colonies even during the drought, suggesting that they were of higher-than-average quality. Our findings provide support to the microhabitat-quality hierarchy hypothesis, and show that T. brasiliensis (and perhaps other triatomines) can endure extreme climate by exploiting (natural or man-made) high-quality microhabitats.
