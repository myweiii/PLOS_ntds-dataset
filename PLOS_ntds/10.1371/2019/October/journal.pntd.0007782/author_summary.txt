Non-Typhoidal Salmonella—particularly Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 313—are among the most common causes of bloodstream infection in children in sub-Saharan Africa. To assess transmission and reservoir of this invasive serotype we performed a blood culture surveillance study among children < 15 years (index patients) in Nanoro, rural Burkina Faso. In case of blood culture confirmed invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infection among index patients a household survey was performed, during which stool samples from household members, stool samples from livestock and water samples were obtained and cultured for Salmonella. Salmonella isolates obtained from blood culture of index patients were compared for genetic relatedness with Salmonella isolates obtained from samples taken from their corresponding household. In three households we found Salmonella Typhimurium ST 313 among both index patient and the stool sample of a household member, we found a strong genetic relatedness within each pair. There were no matching serotypes between index patients and livestock samples or water samples within households. Clusters from other serotypes were restricted to stool samples from household members and different species of livestock. Our results support the theory that iNTS has a human reservoir.
