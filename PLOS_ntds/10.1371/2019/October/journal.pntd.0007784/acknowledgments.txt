We thank Sarity Dodson from the Fred Hollows Foundation for her inputs into the research questions. We also thank Berhan Public Health and Eye Care Consultancy PLC (Dr. Aida Abashawl) and The Fred Hollows Foundation Ethiopia (particularly Mr. Nazif Jemal) for coordinating logistics in the field. We are especially indebted to our excellent research assistants: Demitu Legese and Nirgat Bekele. The study would not have been possible without the support of Dr Zelalem Haabtamu and Mr Damtew Yadeta at the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. We are also grateful to Dr. Robert Aunger at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine for reviewing an early draft of our manuscript.
