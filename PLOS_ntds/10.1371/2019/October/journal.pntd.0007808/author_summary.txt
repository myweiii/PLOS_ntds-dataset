Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, caused by parasitic worms, that affects more than 143 million people worldwide. Chronic infections can lead to significant morbidity including kidney damage, anaemia, malnutrition, infertility and growth impairment. School-aged children between six and 15 years are often targeted for regular treatment with praziquantel in large-scale drug delivery programs, because they suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity. On the other hand, a mass drug delivery strategy that treats all members of the community has been suggested in a move towards elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem. In this systematic review, we assess the impact of community-wide versus children-only praziquantel distribution in reducing schistosomiasis infections in school-aged children. We did not detect a difference between mass and targeted treatment strategies, possibly due to factors including insufficient treatment coverage and persistent sources of reinfection. Addressing these factors may assist in optimising control programs.
