Podoconiosis is a disease of the lymphatic vessels of the lower extremities that is caused by chronic exposure to irritant soils. The condition has been reported from 32 countries around the world, and is common in low-resource settings in which people do not wear shoes as protection against the soil. It results in leg swelling, commonly complicated by acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA, or ‘acute attacks’), characterised by severe pain, fever and disability. A low-cost, lay-led treatment package to prevent ADLA and reverse early stages of disease was tested in northern Ethiopia in 2014–2015. The package involves daily foot hygiene, skin care elastic bandaging where necessary, exercises, elevation and regular use of socks and shoes. In this study we report the impact of this package on quality of life and decreasing work productivity losses.
