Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a granulomatous fungal infection with clinically severe forms and serious pulmonary sequelae. The current limited arsenal and prolonged treatment regimen demonstrate the need for new antifungals. This study reveals two fungicidal oxadiazole compounds for PCM treatment. The in vitro assay showed the antifungal activity and the synergic effect with Amphotericin B. The high doses administration in mice showed absence of toxicity, which allowed to demonstrate the in vivo antifungal activity.
