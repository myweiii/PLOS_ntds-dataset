Giardiasis is a major cause of diarrheal disease throughout the world. It is more common in areas with poor sanitation such as in many low-income countries, but it occurs in high-income countries as well. It is the most commonly identified intestinal parasite in the United States and it is endemic in other industrialized countries. The causative agent is the flagellate protozoan Giardia lamblia, and transmission is mainly by the fecal-oral route. The basic method of diagnosis is stool examination. It is usually found through stool microscopy examination which should be performed on fresh stool and repeated in 3 days. Despite some newer diagnostic methods, Giardia is still difficult to detect, often leading to misdiagnoses.
In this study we show that using Giardia microRNA (miR5) as a marker for Giardia infection in duodenal biopsies may be a new method for diagnosis of giardiasis. It appears to be more sensitive than histological diagnosis and also more sensitive than Giardia DNA testing in duodenal biopsies. Interestingly, in our patients, duodenal biopsies were done for persistent abdominal symptoms and the finding of Giardia in their biopsy was unexpected. Thus, testing duodenal biopsies for Giardia miRNA in patients with persistent abdominal symptoms might contribute to diagnosis and prompt treatment for those with giardiasis.
