Infection with Schistosoma results in strong granulomatous inflammation caused by parasite eggs deposited in the liver. Granuloma is defined as a significant number of immune cell infiltration around the eggs intermixed with hepatocytes, which can protect the host against liver damage. But excessive infiltration and inflammation lead to severe liver injury and fibrosis. Here we found that B1 cells accumulated in the liver after infection and released IL-10 to regulate inflammation. B1 cell-derived IL-10 inhibited the expression of chemokines and then restrained excessive infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes into the liver thereby alleviating early inflammation and later fibrosis in the liver. Our study provides insight into the immunomodulation of B1 cells in schistosomiasis and an important step towards the development of therapeutic strategies for Schistosoma-induced liver diseases.
