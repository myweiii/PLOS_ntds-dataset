The environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the cause of melioidosis, an often-fatal but neglected infection prevalent across tropical areas. B. thailandensis is a member of the B. pseudomallei complex, rarely causes disease in humans and is considered a-virulent. Modelling studies have estimated a high prevalence of B. pseudomallei in western Africa. In this study, we performed an environmental surveillance study in the West African country of Sierra Leone. Remarkably, we could not demonstrate the presence of B. pseudomallei in the soil of Sierra Leone. However, by both culture and sequencing methods, we identified multiple B. thailandensis strains and novel genotypes. Patients with debilitating B. thailandensis infection have been occasionally reported in among others Southeast Asia and the US. Environmental and sequencing studies on both B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis are essential to further understand the genetic diversity and evolution of these neglected but emerging organisms.
