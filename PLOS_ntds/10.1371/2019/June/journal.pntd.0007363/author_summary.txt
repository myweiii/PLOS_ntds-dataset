Soil-transmitted helminthiases are among the most prevalent and damaging neglected tropical diseases and have a significant global health impact. Accurate identification and quantitation of STH infection is a cornerstone of effective control. Direct observation and counting of eggs in faeces is the current gold-standard method for diagnosis of infection. This approach is time consuming and has poor sensitivity. As ongoing oral benzimidazole therapy across many endemic regions leads to a reduction in STH prevalence and intensity, these sensitivity limitations become an increasingly relevant issue, particularly with respect to monitoring treatment efficacy, identifying reductions in parasite transmission, and accurately quantifying infection burden in discrete populations in middle-income countries. PCR-based detection has long been proposed as an alternative approach to STH diagnosis and many protocols, including quantitative PCR-based methods, have been developed. However, these methods are largely bespoke and use non-standardized reagents that can greatly impact on the transferability and relative consistency of their performance. In the current study, we evaluate an automated, commercially-produced molecular diagnostic tool for validation of the major soil-transmitted helminths, including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and evaluate its performance in comparison to an established multiplexed qPCR using faecal samples from endemic settings.
