The euthanasia of Leishmania-seropositive dogs has been recommended for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in some countries where this zoonosis is endemic. We assessed the annual screening coverage (i.e., the percentage of dogs living in a given area that are screened for anti-Leishmania antibodies annually) in the municipality of Sobral, Cear√° state, one of the main foci of human VL in Brazil. From 2008 to 2017, nearly 74,000 dogs were screened and 3.8% of them were positive for anti-Leishmania antibodies. No statistically significant correlation was found between the number of dogs culled annually and the incidence of human VL. The annual screening coverage ranged from 11.1% to 45.7%. Our results highlight an inconsistent and relatively low annual screening coverage, indicating that dogs potentially infected with L. infantum have been virtually overlooked by public health workers in the study area.
