Brucellosis is an important zoonosis of worldwide distribution with a heavy impact wherever domestic livestock are bred, including extensive areas of developing economies. The diagnosis of brucellosis is hampered by the absence of pathognomonic symptoms, and thus accurate laboratory tests are essential. Many serological tests have been proposed but most of them are technically sophisticated and expensive and, therefore, unsuitable for laboratories in resource-limited areas. The need for simple and inexpensive tests has been expressed continuously in works dealing with brucellosis in Africa. We present an evaluation of two simple tests, the lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFA) and the Rose Bengal test (RBT), carried out with gold standard sera (i.e, sera from Brucella culture-positive and brucellosis-free unvaccinated animals) from cattle, sheep, goats and swine, in comparison with an indirect ELISA (iELISA). We also performed an evaluation in cattle vaccinated with S19 and RB51 brucellosis vaccines. Moreover, we compared RBT and LFA for assessing the apparent prevalence of brucellosis in cattle in an endemic area of Nigeria. Our results showed similar diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the three tests and disproved the extended misconception that rough brucellosis vaccines do not to interfere in serodiagnosis and that, therefore, are optimal tools for controlling the disease in resource-limited areas. Considering their diagnostic performance and simplicity, we conclude that both RBT and LFA are suitable for laboratories in resource-limited areas. RBT has the additional advantage of its low cost and usefulness for the diagnosis of human brucellosis.
