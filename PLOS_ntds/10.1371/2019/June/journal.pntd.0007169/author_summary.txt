Salmonella enterica is a remarkable bacterial species that causes Neglected Tropical Diseases globally. The burden of disease is greatest in some of the most poverty-afflicted regions of Africa, where salmonellosis frequently causes bloodstream infection with fatal consequences. The bacteria have the ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract of a wide range of animals including reptiles. Direct or indirect contact between reptiles and humans can cause salmonellosis. In this study, we determined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in a collection of African venomous snakes for the first time. We showed that the majority of venomous snakes (91%) in our study carry Salmonella, and used bacterial genomics to assign two thirds of isolates to the S. enterica subspecies enterica which is associated with human salmonellosis. We identified two evolutionary groups of S. enterica subspecies enterica that display distinct metabolic profiles with infection-relevant carbon sources. Our findings could have a broad significance because venomous snakes can move freely around human dwellings in tropical regions of the world such as Africa, and could potentially shed contaminated faecal matter onto surfaces and into water supplies.
