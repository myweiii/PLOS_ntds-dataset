The threadworm, Strongyloides stercoralis, is a highly neglected worm infection, transmitted through infective larvae in the soil. Threadworms occur worldwide, particularly in tropical climates. It may cause long-lasting and potentially fatal infections due to the parasiteâ€™s ability to replicate within its host. This study aimed to assess the risk of threadworm infection at national level in Cambodia. We conducted a nation-wide, community-based parasitological survey of the Cambodian population, aged 6 years and over. The threadworm was diagnosed using a serological diagnostic test that detects antibodies in urine. Data on demography, hygiene and knowledge about helminth infection were collected. The purpose of this study was to predict the risk of S. stercoralis infection in unsurveyed locations, assess risk factors for infection, and map its geographical distribution in Cambodia. About one third (30.5%) of the enrolled study participants (n = 7,246) were infected with threadworms. At provincial level, the lowest and highest infection rates were 10.9% and 48.2%, respectively. Prevalence rates below 20% were found in just five south-eastern provinces. The risk of a threadworm infection increased with age for both men and women. Open defecation was associated with higher risk of infection, while having some knowledge of the health problems caused by worms was a protective factor. Infection risk was positively associated with environmental factors, such as nighttime maximum temperature, minimum rainfall, and distance to water; it was negatively associated with land occupied by rice fields. Threadworm infection is highly prevalent in Cambodia and adequate control measures, including access to treatment, are warranted to address the burden of this Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) in Cambodia.
