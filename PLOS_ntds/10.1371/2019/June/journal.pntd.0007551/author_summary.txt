Snakebite envenomation represents one of the most neglected tropical medical conditions worldwide. Despite high levels of morbidity and mortality associated with snakebite, its neglected nature has compromised the availability and evaluation of antivenom treatment. This review was initiated by Médecins Sans Frontières’ / Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Access Campaign, as the existing antivenom access crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was deepening. This study sought to review the clinical data pertaining to each antivenom product currently available for use in sub-Saharan Africa. 16 different antivenoms were identified. A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Given the heterogeneity of study methodology and quality, data for individual antivenoms are presented in the form of a narrative analysis. Only two studies reported clinical data collected from randomized controlled trials. Consistent monitoring of the side effects of antivenom treatment was lacking. The absence of good quality data for the majority of antivenoms in sub-Saharan Africa is a major concern. Further robust data collection is required, while urgent investments are needed at the global level to ensure a sustained production of safe and effective antivenom treatment, and its affordable access across sub-Saharan Africa.
