Chagas disease is an important public health problem in Latin America showing a wide diversity of clinical manifestations and epidemiological patterns. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is genetically diverse and classified into six main lineages. However, the relationship between intra-specific genetic diversity and clinical or epidemiological features is not clear, mainly because low sensitivity for direct typing on biological samples. For this reason, genetic markers with high copy number are required to achieve sensitivity. Here, we deep sequenced and analyzed a DNA region present in the large mitochondria of the parasite (named as mHVR, 105 copies per parasite) from strains belonging to the six main lineages in order to analyze mHVR diversity and to evaluate its usefulness for typing. Despite the high sequence diversity, strains of the same lineage shared more sequences than strains of different lineages. Curiously, hybrid lineages shared mHVR sequences with both parents suggesting that mHVR (and DNA minicircles from the mitochondria) are inherited from both parentals. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow proposed here is reproducible and, potentially, it would be useful for typing hundreds of biological samples at time. It also provides a valuable approach to perform evolutionary and functional studies.
