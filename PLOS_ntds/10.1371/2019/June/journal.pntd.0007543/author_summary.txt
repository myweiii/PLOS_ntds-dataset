There is an increasing interest on the effect of global changes on the transmission of infectious diseases. Both environmental and anthropogenic changes are expected to promote outbreaks and spread of pathogens. In particular, tropical infectious diseases are expected to move towards more temperate latitudes. Until 2013, urogenital schistosomiasis was restricted to tropical and sub-tropical areas. In summer 2013, a schistosomiasis outbreak has emerged in Corsica (France) with more than 100 cases. Corsica is a French Mediterranean island, which is very popular for tourists from throughout Europe due to the natural beauty of the environment. Surprisingly, in summer 2015 and 2016, the contamination has resumed, and schistosomiasis has been classified in the list of French notifiable infectious disease. In this context it has been hypothesised that reservoir vertebrate hosts, either human and/or animal are at the origin of the maintenance of the local transmission. This paper shows that ruminants (cow, sheep and goats) should not play a role of reservoir host but we found that rodents living in the vicinity of the transmission sites have been infected by the parasite. Considering the low abundance of rodents and the low parasitic prevalence/intensity among rodents, it is unlikely that rats play a significant role in the maintenance of schistosomiasis outbreak in Corsica and that other animals or human could maintain the parasite locally.
