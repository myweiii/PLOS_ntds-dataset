Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic mycosis in Latin America with high incidence in Brazil. The fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (including genetic groups S1, PS2, PS3 and PS4) and Paracoccidioides lutzii are the etiological agents, but little is known about the clinical manifestations of PCM caused by P. lutzii. Regarding eco-epidemiological aspects, the habitat is believed to be the soil due to the predominance of the disease among rural workers and other individuals who work in contact with the land. Paracoccidioides spp. has been isolated from aerosol samples, armadillos and dog food, but more data are needed to better understand the ecology of this fungus. The Middle-West region of Brazil presents the highest number of cases of P. lutzii infection. It is important to note that this species presents particularities regarding the serological diagnosis in patients. Thus, this study aims to verify possible clinical-epidemiological differences in 34 patients from this geographical region. Our results do not point out significant clinical or epidemiological differences between the two species causing PCM. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health has made an effort to include this disease in the list of compulsory notification diseases in order to implement a health policy aimed at an early detection, diagnosis and treatment.
