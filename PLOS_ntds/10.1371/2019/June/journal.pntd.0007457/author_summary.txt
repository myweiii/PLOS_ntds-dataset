India bears the greatest burden of a fatal parasitic disease called visceral leishmaniasis (VL), popularly known as Kala Azar. The disease is confined mostly to hot spots in Bihar and Jharkhand in the eastern part of the country. Amongst factors hampering efforts to eliminate VL are delays from the onset of symptoms to the time patients are diagnosed and treated, where disease transmission is thought to be greatest and longer delays result in poorer outcomes; this is considered to be a particular problem in poorer women living in rural areas. This study found patterns in careseeking: initial self-medication followed by multiple visits to local (unqualified) providers and visits to private facilities, before ultimately reaching the public health facilities where treatment was freely available. Those who did attend public health facilities early in their illness were not tested for VL nor followed up with a possible diagnosis of VL in mind. Female patients tended to under-estimate the severity of their illness, while social and economic reasons also influenced care-seeking behaviour–particularly the lack of a male relative in the house, and a reluctance to utilise already meagre resources. The conclusions of the study were the need to encourage women with persistent fever to seek care without delay, while ensuring that factors that serve as barriers, such as low prioritisation of women’s health by households (and the women themselves) is countered by messages emphasizing the danger of delayed treatment for VL and the low time-cost burden of availing care within the public health sector. Improving awareness of VL amongst informal and formal health providers remains key in this process.
