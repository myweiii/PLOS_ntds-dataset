Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) that can infect cells in the skin and nerves. Despite efforts to eliminate leprosy, the number of M. leprae infected individuals who develop leprosy is still substantial in the world. The diagnosis relies mainly on clinical parameters. Histopathological and bacteriological analysis help to classify clinical forms of patients. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are claimed by health professionals as auxiliary tools, but until now these tests have been used almost exclusively in research, with minor use in leprosy reference centers throughout Brazil. Here, we tested quantitative PCR (qPCR) designed to amplify specific M. leprae targets and ELISA assays to detect antibody response to recombinant antigens (LID-1, ND-O-LID). All results were analyzed by multivariate analysis based in artificial intelligence. We chose random forest as a classification algorithm to aid in the diagnosis and the monitoring of contacts. The results allowed us to diagnose cases of leprosy with high sensitivity and specificity and the early identification of new cases among household contacts.
