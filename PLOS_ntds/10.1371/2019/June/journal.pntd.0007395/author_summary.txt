When novel infectious diseases like chikungunya or Zika emerge and threaten global spread, public health officials worldwide must assess the risk for local introductions and outbreaks. These assessments are made in anticipation of local case data, and officials must draw upon historic evidence from similar diseases or locations. Thus, accurate local risk assessments have most often been limited to retrospective analyses and have been unavailable in real-time during an emerging epidemic. Here we present a method that can harness both historic and current data to produce early risk assessments and update projections in real-time. We demonstrate our approach by estimating local transmission risk for Zika throughout the state of Texas. Our findings suggest that the majority of Texas counties face little risk for sustaining a Zika epidemic, and successfully predict the number of locally transmitted cases across the state. Real-time updating of local transmission risk estimates during an emerging epidemic can thus provide actionable, early insight for public health response as emerging arboviruses expand their global reach.
