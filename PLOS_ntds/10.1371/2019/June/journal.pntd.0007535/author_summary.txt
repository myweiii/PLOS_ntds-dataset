The determinants of the diverse clinical presentations of Plasmodium vivax malaria are not completely understood. Previous studies have reported that P. vivax-HBV coinfection is associated with increased odds of presenting with asymptomatic malaria, but little is known about the immune mechanisms driving such association. To illuminate host pathways associated with protection against malaria, we analyzed multiple cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins in groups of patients from the Brazilian Amazon with different presentations of vivax malaria monoinfection, HBV monoinfection, and P. vivax-HBV coinfection. The results indicate that coinfection is hallmarked by a conjunction of immune responses, related to each one of the monoinfections, that results in a balanced inflammation associated with clinical immunity and absence of symptoms. In biological terms, the readouts are that the combined responses to each pathogen would induce a distinct profile of systemic immune activation, with the hallmarked activity of IL-10, a classical immunoregulatory cytokine, in confluence mainly with CCL2 and IL-4 activity. These multiple pathways would prevent the unbalanced proinflammatory activity associated with symptomatic and/or severe vivax malaria. Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of the immune system in driving disease presentation, raise discussion of immunotherapy in vivax malaria, and how these approaches have the potential to influence clinical outcomes.
