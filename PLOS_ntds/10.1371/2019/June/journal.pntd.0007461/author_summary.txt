The proportion of patients with HIV+ who have at some time been infected with the Leishmania parasite, but who remain asymptomatic, is unknown. It is important to be able to identify such patients to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the HIV+ population, and because these persons are at increased risk of developing symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis. In the present work, a population of HIV+ patients showing a cellular immune response to Leishmania infantum was identified. These subjects all showed a clear Th1-type response when their PBMC or blood were stimulated in vitro with soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). Cytokine release assays and the detection of IFN-Î³, MIG and IL-2 (specific biomarkers for immunity to Leishmania) were found to be useful for detecting this population of HIV+ patients. New studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm the present results.
