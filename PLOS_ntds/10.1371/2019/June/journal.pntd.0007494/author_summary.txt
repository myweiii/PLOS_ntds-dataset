While previous studies in the Philippines indicated an association between STH infection and cognitive development measured by memory and school performance, the contribution of STH infections on the overall functional illiteracy burden in the Philippines is unknown. This study presents the first use of geographical risk models of functional literacy adjusted for a wide array of probable confounders to uncover the associations with STH infections. This study also explores how the application of spatial epidemiology in mapping functional illiteracy provides an evaluation-planning tool for the design and implementation of STH-associated morbidity control intervention strategies, estimating the number of school-aged children with functional illiteracy associated with STH infections, and the number of interventions needed in the Philippines.
