Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection found worldwide in warm, moist climates. In most people, Strongyloides causes a mild and chronic infection with few symptoms. However, some patients, including those infected with the Human T Lymphotrophic Virus 1 (HTLV-1), can get uncontrolled disease called hyperinfection, which can be fatal. To help determine why this infection is so serious in co-infected patients, we studied biopsies obtained from the small intestine from patients with both infections and compared them to control biopsies. The biopsies from patients with both Strongyloides and HTLV-1 had increased numbers of white blood cells in their biopsies. In particular they displayed a type of lymphocyte that downregulates immune responses. Some of them had increased numbers of cells called eosinophils in the intestines. These cells can help eliminate Strongyloides. However, they were not found near the parasite, suggesting that something near the parasite was suppressing the host response that would control infection. These studies provide more evidence that HTLV-1 suppresses the host response that controls Strongyloides and that the suppression occurs at the site of infection in the small intestines.
