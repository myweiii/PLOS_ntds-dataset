Animal plasma-derived antivenoms constitute the most important therapy against snakebite envenoming. Nowadays this critical treatment has been faced by severe shortage due to low sustainability of current productions, which mostly affects developing countries as those suffering from highest morbidity and mortality rates. Antivenoms' safety and efficacy in clinical setting are highly dependent on manufacturing procedure. Its design should be guided by the tendency to refine immunoglobulin G from residual plasma proteins in only a few easy, simple and efficient purification steps, providing antibody-based product of acceptable physicochemical features and good recovery of protective activity. Here, we developed a compact, feasible and economically viable refinement strategy for antivenom preparation which looks promising for large scale production as well. Process design was driven by the imperative of keeping IgGs or F(ab')2 fragments constantly in solution in order to preserve stability of their conformations. In each of three main stepsâ€”caprylic acid precipitation for removal of contaminants, pepsin digestion of IgGs and chromatographic polishing of F(ab')2 active principle, optimal performance conditions were defined. As a result, preparation of completely homogenous and aggregate-free final product with over 75% yield was achieved in the most straightforward way. Also, the novel platform has been supported with process efficiency data, so accurate estimation of the cost-effectiveness is enabled.
