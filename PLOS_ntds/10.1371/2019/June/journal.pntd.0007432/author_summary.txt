Intensive use of pyrethroids has led to the selection of resistance in mosquitoes, and knockdown resistance (kdr) is one of the major mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance. So far, eleven kdr mutations were identified to be associated with pyrethroid resistance in Aedes aegypti. Among the mutations, the V1016I and T1520I substitutions were found to be associated with F1534C but rarely found alone. F1534C confers sodium channel resistance to Type I pyrethroids including permethrin (PMT). However, whether V1016I or T1520I enhances the F1534C-mediated sodium channel resistance remain unknown. In this study, our electrophysiological results confirmed their involvement in kdr and corroborate the previously proposed sequential selection of kdr mutations in Ae. aegypti: F1534C likely emerged first in response to DDT and/or pyrethroids, whereas V1016I and T1520I appeared later under more intensive selection from pyrethroid use.
