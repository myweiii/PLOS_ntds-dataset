The combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (TGC) and ciprofloxacin has synergy in vitro bactericidal activity against V. vulnificus. No clinical study has compared the standard regimen with TGC plus ciprofloxacin therapy for V. vulnificus infection. A total of 218 patients were enrolled who are confirmed to have V. vulnificus septicemia in two medical centers in Korea from 1991 to 2016. The 30-day survival rate was 39% (85/218) for all patients, 38% (16/42) for TGC plus doxycycline and 54% (21/39) for TGC plus ciprofloxacin (log rank test, P = 0.18). A propensity score-matched analysis was performed and 12 per treatment groups were selected. The 30-day survival rate showed no significant difference between the TGC plus doxycycline (50%, 6/12) and TGC plus ciprofloxacin (67%, 4/12) groups (log-rank test, P = 0.46). The outcome of TGC plus ciprofloxacin therapy was comparable to that of TGC plus doxycycline therapy in patients with V. vulnificus septicemia.
