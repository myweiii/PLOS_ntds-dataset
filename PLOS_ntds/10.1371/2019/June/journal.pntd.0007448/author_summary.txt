Mosquito control is the primary method of managing the spread of many diseases transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti). Throughout much of Latin America the transmission of diseases like dengue fever and Zika fever pose a serious risk to public health. The rise of insecticide resistance (IR) is a major threat to established vector control programs, which may fail if commonly used insecticides are rendered ineffective. Public health authorities in southern coastal Ecuador, a high-risk region for diseases vectored by Ae. aegypti, previously had limited information on the status of IR in local populations of mosquitoes. Here, we present the first assessment of IR in adult Ae. aegypti to insecticides (deltamethrin, Malathion, and alpha-cypermethrin) routinely used in public health vector control in four cities along Ecuadorâ€™s southern coast. Observed patterns of IR differed between cities and seasons of mosquito sampling, suggesting that IR status may fluctuate in space and time. The highest overall resistance was detected in Machala, a city with hyperendemic dengue transmission and a long history of intense insecticide use. Monitoring for IR is an integral component of vector control services, where alternative management strategies are deployed when IR is detected.
