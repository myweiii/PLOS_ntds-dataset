We have previously shown that the NlpD lipoprotein, which is involved in the regulation of cell morphogenesis, is essential for virulence of the plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis. To uncover the role of NlpD in Y. pestis pathogenicity, we conducted a whole-genome comparative transcriptome analysis as well as phenotypic and virulence evaluation analyses of the nlpD and related mutants. The study reveals a new role for the Y. pestis NlpD lipoprotein in iron assimilation and Tat system activity.
