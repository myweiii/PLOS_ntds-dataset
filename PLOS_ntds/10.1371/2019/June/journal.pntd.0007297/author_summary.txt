Much remains unknown about the mode of transmission of iNTS or the reservoirs of infection. As such, insight into potential selective pressures on underlying serovars bears importance to public health. Longitudinal studies over the years 2002â€“2012 identified a shift in the proportion of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease caused by S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis in Bamako, Mali. Since S. Enteritidis exhibits a higher rate of fatal cases among the pediatric population than S. Typhimurium, it is important to understand what led to the increased proportion of cases from this serovar. This study examined the genetic changes in S. Enteritidis associated with this serovar shift through comparative genomics and laboratory findings. Through these methods, genes related to tetracycline resistance and arsenic catabolism were associated with the shift in serovars. These findings represent preliminary steps in investigating this underlying shift and determining the long-term repercussions of these changes to the epidemiologic profile of iNTS disease.
