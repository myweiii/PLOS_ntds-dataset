Nipah virus (NiV) infection in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India has been correlated with severe respiratory and neurological disease that led to death in over 50% of known cases. In this study, we used a nonhuman primate model for NiV infection to evaluate the peripheral immune response to virus infection in an effort to identify aspects of the immune response that may be important for survival. An aerosol exposure that targeted virus deposition in sinuses and upper respiratory tract was used in an effort to mimic a probable human exposure route. Following exposure, five of six animals included in the study succumbed to the infection. The survivor developed a virus-specific antibody response and showed clear evidence of cell-mediated immunity. Interestingly, the rate of change in CD4+ and CD8bright T cell populations in the survivor over the course of the acute disease, were the reverse of animals that succumbed to infection. These data suggest that rapid development of virus-specific adaptive immunity is critical for survival of NiV infection.
