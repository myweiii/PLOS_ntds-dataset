Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania, affects at least 12 million people in 96 countries. Peru is one of the most highly endemic countries for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and our previous study identified Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, L. (V.) peruviana, and L. (V.) guyanensis in the tropical rainforest, in the Andean highlands, and in the northern and central rainforest areas, respectively, as the main CL-causative agents. In addition, distribution of L. (V.) lainsoni, L. (V.) shawi, a hybrid of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) peruviana, and Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis has been identified. Of these, one case each of L. (V.) shawi infection was reported from the Departments of Junin and Madre de Dios, while clinical cases due to the hybrid of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) peruviana were recorded only in the Department of Huanuco. To further elucidate the current geographic distribution of causative Leishmania species in Peru, a countrywide survey, including central to southern rainforest areas where little information on causative parasites is available, was performed based on the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequence and PCR-RFLP analysis of the mannose phosphate isomerase (mpi) gene by using FTA (Flinders Technology Associates) card-spotted samples and smear slides as DNA sources. In addition to current epidemiological observations, the current study revealed that 1) A hybrid of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) peruviana was identified, for the first time, outside the Department of Huanuco, 2) L. (V.) lainsoni, an uncommon CL-causative species in Peru, was predominantly found in the Department of Puno, where causative Leishmania species are not well-studied, and 3) New endemic foci of L. (V.) shawi were identified in central to southern rainforest areas of Peru.
