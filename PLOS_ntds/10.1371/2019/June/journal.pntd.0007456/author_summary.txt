Leishmaniasis is endemic in French Guiana under its cutaneous form where Leishmania guyanensis is the principle parasite species. Visceral leishmaniasis is much more severe, although well known in neighbouring countries (Brazil, Suriname, Venezuela), it has not been known in French Guiana until now. Our study presents the result of a ten-year surveillance of Leishmania spp. infections in dogs and bats from French Guiana. We analyzed 92 bats from French Guiana 179 local dogs and 78 additional French military working dogs (MWD), which spent a short stay in this territory. Globally, we found 2.3% (8/343) of Leishmania infected animals. L. infantum infection was detected in 1.7% (3/179) of autochthonous dogs and 5.1% (4/78) of MWD. One of them dates back to 2012, the others were in 2016 and 2018. Low infection rate was detected in bats, only one specimen among 92 being infected (1.1%) and belonging to Carollia perspicillata species. We conclude that L. infantum has been circulating in French Guiana since at least 2012. Dogs and bats could therefore be among the potential reservoirs. Further investigations on potential additional reservoirs among domestic and wild animals, as well as identification of vectors, are required.
