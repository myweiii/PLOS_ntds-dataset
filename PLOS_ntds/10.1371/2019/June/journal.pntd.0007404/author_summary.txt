HTLV-1/2 are retroviruses transmitted by sex, blood products and from mother to child (MTC), mainly through breastfeeding. There is currently no vaccine, treatment or cure. Although it’s mostly asymptomatic it can cause disabling and even lethal diseases in carriers. The prevalence of HTLV-1/2 in pregnant women at the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro is high (0.74%). Our aim was to study the sociodemographic characteristics which may be associated to HTLV-1/2 infection and describe pregnancy outcomes and MTC transmission in the infected population. Apart from being slightly older, there were no differences in the carrier mothers’ sociodemographic profile. Pregnant women with sexually transmitted infections had a 9-fold chance of being HTLV-1/2 positive. Although adverse pregnancy outcomes were not increased, infected mothers had a high rate of ruptured membranes. Among the children of HTLV-1/2-positive mothers there was one fetal death, one infant death and one loss of follow-up. There was one case of MTC transmission (1/9), after one month of breastfeeding. Knowledge about factors associated to HTLV-1/2 infection, its impact on pregnancy, and the MTC transmission rate is important to guide further research and public health policies.
