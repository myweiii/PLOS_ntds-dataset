The Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM), Cambodia, supported the assessment through the provision of staff for data collection. Sumitomo provided the Sumilarv 2MR free of charge for the study. Qualitative data collectors worked diligently throughout the fieldwork and collected high quality data. This project would not have been possible without Community Health Workers, community members, and health center and CNM staff who participated in this study and shared their views and experiences.
