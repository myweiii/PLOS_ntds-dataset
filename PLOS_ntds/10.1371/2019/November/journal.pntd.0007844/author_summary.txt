Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection transmitted through contaminated water that primarily affects the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Previous studies in Tanzania have shown that adult women infected with schistosomes also have a higher risk of contracting HIV. Although it is recommended that people living in areas where they are exposed to schistosomes be treated with praziquantel once a year, the rate of new infections or reinfection after treatment in adult women is not known. We followed a group of schistosome-infected women and an uninfected control group for 12 months. They were tested for schistosomes every 3 months, and treated with praziquantel if they were infected. Over 40% of the women tested positive for schistosome infection at some point during the follow-up period, and the majority of them were from the group that was infected at the beginning of the study. These women may not have fully cleared the infection after one treatment, or they may be more susceptible to reinfection due to variations in their immune systems. Further studies are recommended to investigate whether a higher frequency of treatment is needed to control schistosome infection in adult women, especially given that reducing schistosome infection may help to reduce HIV risk in populations similar to ours.
