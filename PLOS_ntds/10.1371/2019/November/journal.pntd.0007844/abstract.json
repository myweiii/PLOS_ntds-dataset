    "Background": "Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend annual mass drug administration using praziquantel in areas with high schistosome endemicity. Yet little is known about incidence and reinfection rates after treatment in women with frequent exposure to schistosomes. We sought to quantify response to anti-schistosome treatment and incident S. mansoni infections in a cohort of rural women living in a schistosome-endemic area of northwest Tanzania.",
    "Methods and principal findings": "We enrolled women with and without S. mansoni infection into a 12-month longitudinal cohort. Every 3 months, women were tested for schistosome infection using microscopic examinations for ova on filtered urine, Kato Katz slides, and serum Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA). Those with schistosome infection received treatment with praziquantel 40 mg/kg according to the standard of care.",
    "Conclusions": "Our data suggests that annual praziquantel treatment reduces intensity of schistosome infections but is insufficient in providing stable parasite eradication in over a third of women in endemic communities. Furthermore, microscopy lacks adequate sensitivity to evaluate efficacy of treatment in this population. Our work demonstrates that further investigation into treatment efficacy and reinfection rates is warranted and suggests that increased frequency of praziquantel treatment is needed to improve cure rates in high-risk populations."
