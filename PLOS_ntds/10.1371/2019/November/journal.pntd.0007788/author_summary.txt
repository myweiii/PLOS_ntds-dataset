Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which causes chronic skin ulcers and disproportionally affects the poorest of the poor. The current first-line treatment, based on systemic pentavalent antimonials, is quite toxic for patients but also expensive for governments and patients. Given limited budgets, national decision-makers need to know not only the efficacy of alternative treatments, but also how to maximise the population health impact of available resources. To strengthen the evidence base for the scale-up of effective NTD interventions in the era of universal health coverage, we conducted cost-effectiveness analyses and estimations of population-level impact of the implementation of intralesional pentavalent antimonials as first-line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis using realistic scenarios. Our results demonstrate that changing first-line treatment would have considerable economic advantages for patients due to the shorter treatment duration (savings in terms of food, accommodation, transport, productivity loss); and for the national control program due to the reduced use of drugs and staff time. In addition, this change would offer better value for money given that two-and-a-half times the current number of patients could be treated with the current expenditure level if intralesional pentavalent antimonials were offered to eligible patients.
