Skin conditions are very common in many low and middle income settings but there have been relatively few surveys of skin disease conducted using the best epidemiological approaches. We performed two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children in the Bijag√≥s Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, using gold-standard sampling methodologies. Skin conditions were extremely common and almost 30% of children had at least one common, infectious skin condition in both surveys. Fungal skin and scalp infections were the most common conditions followed by bacterial skin infections. Our survey demonstrates that common, easily treatable skin conditions are responsible for a high burden of disease in this population. Skin-health should be considered a key component of the Universal Health Coverage agenda.
