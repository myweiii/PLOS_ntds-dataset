To date there is no approved drug for Ebola Virus infection. Our approach has been to assess drugs that are already approved for other uses in various countries. Using computational models, we have previously identified three such drugs and demonstrated their activity against the Ebola virus in vitro. We now report on the in vitro absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacokinetic properties of one of these molecules, namely the antimalarial pyronaridine. We justify efficacy testing in the mouse model of ebola infection. We also demonstrate that a single dose of this drug is 100% effective against the virus. This study provides important preclinical evaluation of this already approved drug and justifies its selection for larger animal efficacy studies.
