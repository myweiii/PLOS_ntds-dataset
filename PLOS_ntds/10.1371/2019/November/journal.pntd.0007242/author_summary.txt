Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a severe emerging infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) that was first discovered in rural areas of China. Henan province has had the largest number of SFTS cases in China every year since the disease was discovered, however, seropositivity for SFTSV-specific antibodies in healthy people in this region is still not clear. To address this issue, a cross-sectional survey was performed in high endemic areas from April to May 2016. The results showed that SFTSV seroprevalence was relatively high and possibly increasing. Notably, SFTSV RNA, as well as virus itself, was isolated from specimens obtained from healthy people. This study confirmed there are asymptomatic SFTSV infections in humans, and it is the first to report SFTSV isolation from healthy people.
