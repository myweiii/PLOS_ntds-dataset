Tungiasis is a disease caused by the female sand flea which burrows into the skin of the feet and causes intense pain and itching. People in endemic tropical areas do not have access to a simple, effective and safe method for treatment at home. The most common treatment used during clinical outreach activities is a foot bath in a disinfectant. Here we report on a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a mixture of neem and coconut oils to kill the embedded fleas and reduce inflammation, pain and itching. We found the oil mixture reduced the proportion of fleas alive in the foot after 6 days in a similar way as the footbath in disinfectant, which is unavailable to households. However, unlike the footbath, the neem oil treatment caused most of the fleas to rapidly age in the foot and decreased the inflammation, leaving more children pain-free after one week. We conclude the neem and coconut oil mixture could be a promising approach for the treatment of tungiasis but its activity on the fleas might be slower. We need to follow up with longer observation time and test different dosages and application times.
