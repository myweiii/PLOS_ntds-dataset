Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne phlebovirus endemic to Africa and the Middle East, causing devastating outbreaks affecting both humans and animals. The reverse genetics system for RVFV has contributed to the virology, vaccinology, and antiviral screening for RVFV. In this study, we generated the first reverse genetics system for a mosquito-borne nonpathogenic phlebovirus (Arumowot virus; AMTV) endemic to Africa, which is phylogenetically related to RVFV. The generation of recombinant AMTV supports the screening of broad-acting antivirals and vaccine development for RVF. The nonstructural NSs protein is known as a major virulence factor for RVF, yet this study revealed that AMTV NSs protein was rapidly degraded in human cells via cellular proteasomes. In contrast, AMTV NSs protein functioned as an antagonist of interferon-Î² gene upregulation in murine cells. The AMTV can be a nonpathogenic surrogate model for studying phleboviruses including RVFV.
