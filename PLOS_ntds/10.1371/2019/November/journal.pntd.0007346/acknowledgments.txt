We are grateful to the health facility survey respondents, key informants, and to the administrative staff of the NLCP office in Cochabamba for sharing CL local data registers. Additionally, to Ernesto Rojas and Miguel Guzman who helped us with their experiences related to ILPA and to Lars Lindholm for discussions during the conceptualization of this study.
