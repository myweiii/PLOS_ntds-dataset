Mosquito-borne viruses usually only infect humans through the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. Viruses transmitted by the ‘yellow fever mosquito’ Aedes aegypti, including dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus, are causing an ever-increasing number of human disease cases globally. Mosquito-borne viruses have to infect and replicate inside the mosquito before they are transmitted to humans, and the presence of other infectious agents can change the efficiency of virus transmission. Mosquitoes are known to be infected with ‘insect-specific viruses’ that only infect mosquitoes and cannot cause human disease. We have shown here that in laboratory cell cultures derived from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, pre-existing infection with an insect-specific virus called Phasi Charoen-like virus does not affect the infection and growth of the mosquito-borne viruses dengue virus, Zika virus, Sindbis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Our research provides important new insights into whether and how insect-specific viruses may affect mosquito-borne virus replication. Ultimately, this information could inform ongoing research into whether insect-specific viruses could be used to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses to reduce global disease burdens.
