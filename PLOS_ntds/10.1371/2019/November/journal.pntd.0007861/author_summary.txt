The lymphatic filariasis (LF) parasite is highly prevalent in many parts of Zambia, with almost 10 million people at risk of infection. Country wide mapping between 2003 and 2011 showed a high prevalence ranging from 1â€“54% of the circulating filarial antigen, dictating the implementation of mass drug administration (MDA). MDA for LF was first piloted in Kalabo District, Western Province in 2015 and was later scaled up to other provinces in 2016. MDA for LF programmes have reported lots of challenges in attaining required coverage levels in many settings, particularly during the early rounds of implementation. Community engagement processes during MDA for LF programme implementation have a key role to play in driving coverage and participation. However, engagement processes and their influence on participation in MDA for LF programs are rarely documented in most instances. This study was conducted in 2017 with a key focus on the engagement process employed in the first (2016) and second rounds (2017) of MDA for LF and how they influenced participation in the programme. We also sought to identify some key constraints to engagement of local communities in the study site, Luangwa district, Lusaka Province.
