Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease affecting humans. There are no therapeutics for the disease. We developed a novel virus neutralization assay, employing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and viremic blood from dengue patients, to examine the virus-neutralizing potency of 12 human-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that had previously been shown to neutralize DENV in cell-culture systems. Five of the twelve mAbs failed to block dengue virus infections of mosquitoes using our assay. The remaining seven mAbs neutralized at least one serotype of dengue virus. The results demonstrate that some mAbs were functional and potently neutralized DENV in the complex matrix of viremic human blood. These findings advance the understanding of the types of antibodies that would be desirable to elicit using a dengue vaccine or to apply for acute therapy.
