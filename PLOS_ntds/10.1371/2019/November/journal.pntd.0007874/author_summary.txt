Cholera is an acute, secretory diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae O1. There is a growing body of evidence that immune responses targetting the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae are associated with protecton against cholera. Despite this, little is known about immune responses targeting OSP in immunologically naive individals. Cholera affects populations in severely resource-limited areas. To address this, we assessed anti-OSP immune responses in North American volunteers experimentally infected with wild type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961. We found that antibody responses were largely IgM and IgA, cross-reacted to both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes, and correlated with vibriocidal responses. We found no association of responses to severity of disease, but did find that blood group O individuals mounted lower IgA fold-changes to OSP than did non-blood group O individuals. Individuals with blood group O are at particular risk for severe cholera, and are less well protected against cholera following oral vaccination. We also compared anti-OSP responses in previously unexposed individuals to responses in matched endemic zone patients, and found a number of significant differences. Such differences may explain in part the varying degrees of protective efficacy afforded by cholera vaccination between these two populations.
