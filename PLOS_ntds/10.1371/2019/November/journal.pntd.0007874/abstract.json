    "Background": "Antibodies targeting O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae may protect against cholera; however, little is known about this immune response in infected immunologically naïve humans.",
    "Methodology": "We measured serum anti-OSP antibodies in adult North American volunteers experimentally infected with V. cholerae O1 Inaba El Tor N16961. We also measured vibriocidal and anti-cholera toxin B subunit (CtxB) antibodies and compared responses to those in matched cholera patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh, an area endemic for cholera.",
    "Principal findings": "We found prominent anti-OSP antibody responses following initial cholera infection: these responses were largely IgM and IgA, and highest to infecting serotype with significant cross-serotype reactivity. The anti-OSP responses peaked 10 days after infection and remained elevated over baseline for ≥ 6 months, correlated with vibriocidal responses, and may have been blunted in blood group O individuals (IgA anti-OSP). We found significant differences in immune responses between naïve and endemic zone cohorts, presumably reflecting previous exposure in the latter.",
    "Conclusions": "Our results define immune responses to O-specific polysaccharide in immunologically naive humans with cholera, find that they are largely IgM and IgA, may be blunted in blood group O individuals, and differ in a number of significant ways from responses in previously humans. These differences may explain in part varying degrees of protective efficacy afforded by cholera vaccination between these two populations.",
