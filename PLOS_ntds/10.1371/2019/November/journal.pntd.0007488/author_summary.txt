Infection by the soil-transmitted helminths (STH) whipworm and hookworm results from either ingestion of eggs or larvae or through skin exposure to larvae. These eggs and larvae develop in suitable soils contaminated with openly-deposited human faeces. Safe disposal of faeces should reduce transmission of STH, yet evidence of the impact of sanitation on STH transmission remains limited. A large, community-wide survey was conducted in 2015 to measure prevalence of STH infections in Kwale County, Kenya. Here, we used this data and observations made in schools to examine the relationship between sanitation conditions at home, school, and village and the presence of STH infection among 4,104 children who attend school. We found that sanitation access at home and school sanitation coverage (number of usable toilets per enrolled pupil), but not the overall level of village sanitation coverage (percentage of households with reported access to sanitation), was protective against hookworm infection. In contrast, only high village sanitation coverage, but not home or school sanitation, was protective against whipworm infection. Current STH control strategies emphasise periodic deworming of at-risk populations, including school-age children. Our findings highlight the need for continued efforts, alongside deworming, to extend access to good sanitation facilities at homes, schools, and across communities.
