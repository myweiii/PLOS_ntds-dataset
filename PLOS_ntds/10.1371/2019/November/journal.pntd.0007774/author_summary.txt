In many rapidly growing tropical cities, urban livestock keeping are an important provider of food for the urban population, as well as contributing to livelihoods. The high density of both humans and animals in cities can however contribute to diseases being transferred from animals to humans. Less studies have so far been performed on how the urban livestock keeping can contribute to increased number of vectors for diseases that are transmitted between humans in cities, such as dengue fever. In this study we explored the urban livestock keeping in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and the mosquitoes that transfer the dengue virus. We found that more of these mosquitoes were present in the more central homesteads than in the peri-urban areas, and that livestock keeping did not increase the number. The central households had experienced more dengue fever cases, and we also found that the peri-urban households were much more aware about how to protect themselves from the disease. This indicated a need to increase the information campaigns primarily in more central parts of the cities.
