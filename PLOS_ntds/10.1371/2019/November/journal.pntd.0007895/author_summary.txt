Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) are of major significance as human pathogens and have important economic impact worldwide due to considerable losses in livestock and food crops. Drug treatment of nematode infections (anthelmintic drugs) are the pillar of worm control in human and veterinary medicine. Due to the appearance of drug resistant nematodes, there is a need of developing novel drugs, among which phytochemicals, that have environmental sustainability advantages, may constitute potential anthelmintic compounds. As parasitic nematodes are not ideal laboratory animals, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which shares many physiological characteristics with parasites and is sensitive to anthelmintic drugs, has emerged as a model organism for anthelmintic drug discovery. We found that three terpenoid compounds present in essential oil of plants–thymol, carvacrol and eugenol–produce rapid paralysis of C. elegans and inhibit egg hatching, thus mediating both rapid and long-term anthelmintic effects. By testing mutant worms that lack receptor proteins essential for locomotion we identified two different muscle receptors, nicotinic and GABA receptors, as terpenoid targets of the paralyzing effects. Electrophysiological studies from C. elegans cultured muscle cells demonstrated that terpenoids inhibit the function of these receptors. Thus, by modulating two receptors with key roles in worm motility, these terpenoids emerge as novel anthelmintic compounds.
