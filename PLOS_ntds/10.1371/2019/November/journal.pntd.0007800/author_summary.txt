Over two-thirds of the worldâ€™s population lives in regions where rabies is endemic. Each year, more than 15 million people receive multi-dose PEP and over 59,000 people die: one rabies death every 9 minutes. Greater than 75% of rabies victims die at home and these deaths are not included in the total deaths due to rabies. Up to 60% of rabies cases are in children, making rabies the seventh most important infectious disease in terms of years of life lost. Current vaccines regimens that are used to prevent rabies in humans are complicated and costly. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism by which to improve rabies vaccination by incorporating a membrane-anchored molecular adjuvant into the surface of the rabies virus particle. This new vaccine strategy significantly enhanced the speed and magnitude of the anti-rabies antibody responses and has the potential to improve the efficacy of currently used inactivated RABV-based vaccines.
