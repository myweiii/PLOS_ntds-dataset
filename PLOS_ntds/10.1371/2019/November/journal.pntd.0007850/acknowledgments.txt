The authors express gratitude to participating health personnel at the Sangkhlaburi district malaria clinics as well as the patient from whom the sample was obtained. We are indebted to Drs. Maciej Boni, Santhosh Giririjan, and Runze Li for their thoughtful comments on experimental design, and Dr. Chengqi Wang for advice on data visualization. High-performance cloud computing was provided by the Penn State University Institute for CyberScience through their open queue, and Meade Lewis provided additional computational time on an external server. We are also grateful to the Penn State Genomics Core Facility for their assistance with DNA and RNA sequencing.
