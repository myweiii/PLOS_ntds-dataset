Water providers in the wet-dry tropics of Northern Australia face additional challenges to keep drinking water microbiologically safe. The source water is often rich in iron-cycling bacteria leading to excessive biofilm formation in pipes and it can also contain the emerging opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei causing the severe disease melioidosis in humans and animals. We know very little about the ecology of microbes in remote community water supplies, so to start to fill this gap we assessed the microbial composition from the source to the distribution of three remote water supplies. We not only found that the geochemistry of the source water had a substantial impact on the composition of the iron-cycling bacteria but B. pseudomallei was cultured from source water with low organic carbon but elevated iron levels and from a multi-species biofilm linked to iron bacteria. No B. pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, was recovered from treated parts of one water supply. This work lays the foundation for future studies to ultimately improve management guidelines for water supplies in the wet-dry tropics.
