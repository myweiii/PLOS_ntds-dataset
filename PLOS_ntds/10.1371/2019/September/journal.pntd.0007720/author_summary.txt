Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonotic disease with high importance for the public health of several countries. L. infantum-infected dogs can be a domestic reservoir of the protozoan parasite for sand flies, which transmit it from dogs to humans during their blood meals. It is important to diagnose and treat infected dogs as early as possible, so the dissemination of CanL and the transmission to humans can be controlled. The currently commercially available assays present problems, such as cross-reaction with other canine diseases and lack of sensitivity in the detection of dogs that do not present clinical signs of disease. In this work, we tested lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a molecule abundantly found in the protozoanÂ´s surface, as an antigen in an immunodiagnostic platform. We were able to see that the assay using LPG is highly sensitive and specific, showed no cross-reaction with other canine infectious diseases and successfully identified infected dogs with no signs of disease.
