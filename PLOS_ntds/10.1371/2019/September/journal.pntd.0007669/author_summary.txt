Leishmaniases belong among the most important and yet neglected vector-borne diseases, transmitted mostly by bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. To understand role of different reservoir hosts in the transmission cycles, it is important to determine blood meal sources of bloodfeeding females. Most of currently used methods face challenges due to tiny volumes of engorged blood, in case of mammals also enucleated, as well as quick progress of blood digestion which leads to rapid DNA and protein degradation. New approach towards blood source determination presented in this study is based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry that identifies unique peptide sequences of host hemoglobins, showing high precision and sensitivity together with a longer time period for successful host determination when compared to nowadays standardly used DNA sequencing. It was tested and verified on engorged phlebotomine sand flies from both laboratory colonies and natural endemic areas and also on Culex mosquitoes and shall be universal to hematophagous insects. Beside blood meal identification, it allows also the use of both morphological and molecular methods (DNA- or protein-based) for the species identification of the analysed specimen.
