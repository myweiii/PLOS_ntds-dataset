Dengue cases have increased in tropical regions worldwide owing to urbanization, globalization, and climate change facilitating the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors. National surveillance programs monitor trends in dengue fever and inform the public about epidemiological scenarios where outbreak preventive actions are most needed. Yet, most estimations of dengue risk so far derive only from disease case data, ignoring Aedes occurrence as a key aspect of dengue transmission dynamic. Here we illustrate how incorporating vector presence and absence as a model covariate can considerably alter the characteristics of space-time cluster estimations of dengue cases.
