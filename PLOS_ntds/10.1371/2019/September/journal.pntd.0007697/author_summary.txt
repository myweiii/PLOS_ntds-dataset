Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a disabling parasitic disease that affects millions of people in the developing world. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (coordinated by the World Health Organization) uses mass administration of antifilarial medications to cure infections, prevent disease, and reduce transmission. Some individuals develop adverse events (AEs) after treatment, and this can reduce willingness of persons in endemic areas to accept treatment. The purpose of this study was to improve understanding of the cause of AEs following treatment. We hypothesized that parasite antigens released into the blood following treatment trigger inflammatory responses that lead to AEs. To test this hypothesis we collected blood from LF-infected individuals before and after treatment and clinically assessed them for AEs. We measured parasite antigens, cytokines and other components of the immune system in blood samples and compared post-treatment changes in persons with and without AEs. We also assessed changes in transcription profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes that were associated with post-treatment AEs. Post-treatment changes in transcription profiles and in immune proteins and parasite components in plasma suggest that systemic AEs are triggered by death of the parasites following treatment with release of parasite antigens and Wolbachia bacteria into the circulation. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of post-treatment AEs may help to improve messaging related to mass drug administration programs and lead to improved AE management.
