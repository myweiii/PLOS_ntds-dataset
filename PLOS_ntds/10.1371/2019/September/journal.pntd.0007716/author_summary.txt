Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes encephalitis and reproductive disorder in humans and pigs respectively, causing a serious impact on public health and pig industry. In nature JEV life cycle include both vertebrates (birds and pigs) as well as invertebrates (mosquitoes). Phylogenetic studies confirmed that JEV has five geographically and epidemiologically distinct genotypes (GI-V). Genotype III (GIII) was an endemic strain in Asia, but recently genotype I (GI) has displaced GIII as the most frequently isolated virus genotype. It is unclear if mosquitoes play a role in this genotype shift or not. Both genotypes are endemic in China and primarily transmitted by different species of Culex (Cx.) mosquitoes. Cx. Mosquitoes are the most common species in China and their role in this genotype shift was not studied previously. In the present study, we used Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo mosquito model and challenged with GI and GIII JEV strains to explore if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. Our investigation showed that GI and GIII viruses had similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes which highlighted that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in the genotype shift. Although the current data were obtained solely from Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, it is likely that the conclusion drawn could be extrapolated to the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift.
