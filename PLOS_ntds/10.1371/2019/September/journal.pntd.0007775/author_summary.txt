Dengue, among other arboviral infections, is a neglected disease and a major health issue that is re-emerging in tropical countries due to the poor efficacy of conventional vector control methods. Therefore, there is a growing need for more sustainable techniques to control Aedes mosquito species, while reducing the dependence on insecticides. The sterile insect technique, which relies on the mass-production of sterile males, can be used as part of area- wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programmes to reduce the vector population below the disease transmission threshold. Therefore, innovations in mosquito mass-rearing techniques including the development of low-cost adult holding cages are essential in the quest to promote an economical and logistically efficient mass -rearing system for the vectors of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika diseases.
