Infections caused by Gram negative non fermentative bacteria (GNNF), other than the more commonly described Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, constitute an emerging problem. They are not only isolated in nosocomial settings, mainly affecting immunocomprised hosts, but also are opportunistic infections causing invasive disease in rural communities. GNNF bacteria are ubiquitously distributed in the environment and have a high propensity for antimicrobial resistance. Thus, their accurate identification to the species level is important for appropriate patient management. These bacteria are taxonomically heterogeneous, and many isolates are not satisfactorily identified by the standard biochemical assays because of overlapping phenotypic characteristics. In this study we explored using the BD Phoenix automated identification system to improve the identification of GNNF isolates and recognized 92% (187/204) of the previously unidentified isolates; 117 of which were to the species level. Antimicrobial resistance profiles were identified for 50% (94/187) of the isolates identified by the BD Phoenix system. For the remaining 12 unidentified organisms whole genome sequencing was performed. Three web-based programs were used for organism identification and results varied because of differences in the underlying databases used.
