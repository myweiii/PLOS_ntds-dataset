This work is dedicated to Danilo Gonçalves Saraiva, who gave his life in January 2016, while doing field work for this project. We are very grateful to the SESC Pantanal, UFMT, Embrapa Pantanal, and Alegria and São José Farms (Corumbá) for their logistic support during our field work in the Pantanal areas. We are also grateful to the “Departamento de Água e Esgoto de Americana (DAE)” for allowing us to work at the “Estação de Tratamento de Esgoto (ETE) de Carioba”, Americana municipality.
