The 2015 Zika epidemic in Brazil gained international attention with the birth of thousands of babies with severe adverse outcomes, collectively called “Congenital Zika Syndrome” (CZS). Parenting a child with disabilities can be extremely stressful, and in other settings is linked to depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. However, these associations have not been fully explored in the context of CZS in Brazil. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Rio de Janeiro and Recife, two cities in Brazil. We identified 163 caregivers (mostly the mother) of a child with CZS, and 324 caregivers of children of similar ages, but without obvious disabilities. The caregivers were asked a series of questions to gauge whether they were experiencing depression, anxiety or stress. We found that a high proportion of the mothers reported experiencing severe or extremely severe levels of depression (18%), anxiety (27%) and stress (36%). Levels of depression and anxiety were even higher for mothers of children with CZS compared to mothers of unaffected children, especially for those mothers with low social support and those living in Rio de Janeiro.
