Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly parasitic disease, transmitted by the sand fly species Phlebotomus argentipes in the Indian sub-continent. Humans are the only proven reservoir of the parasite, Leishmania donovani. Effective vector control is highly desirable to reduce vector density and human and vector contact in the endemic communities to stop the disease transmission. We evaluated the effect of long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLIN) and bed nets impregnated with slow-release insecticide tablet K-O TAB 1-2-3 (jointly insecticide-treated nets or ITN) on VL incidence in a highly endemic sub-district (upazila) in Bangladesh. The nets were either donated or impregnated between 2004 to 2008 under three studies and defined as “exposed cohort” comparing their effect on VL incidence with “non-exposed cohort” (no donation of impregnated nets) for a 3 year period before and after the intervention. The study identified 1011 VL cases (IR 140.47/10,000 per year [py]) before the intervention, of which 534 and 477 cases in the intervention and control areas respectively. There was a strong and significant overall effect of the ITN intervention, δ = –67.45, p <0.0001. The VL incidence rate was significantly lower in the ITN intervention cohort compared to control in Bangladesh, though some bias cannot be totally ruled out.
