Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium that has a predilection for skin and nerve cells. The chronic course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes known as reactions, despite effective bacterial killing with antibiotics. Reactions aggravate the patientâ€™s clinical status and may become a medical emergency. Type 2 reactions (T2R) only occur in patients with high bacterial burden and are treated with thalidomide and/or corticosteroids. We are interested in understanding how inflammation is triggered and amplified during T2R. In this study we investigated the potential role of extracellular DNA released by neutrophils (known as NETs) in T2R, since they have been shown to cause inflammation. Abundant NETs were found in T2R skin lesions, and increased spontaneous NETs formation was observed in neutrophils present in the blood of T2R patients. Moreover, bacterial constituents were able to induce NETs production. Finally, treatment of T2R patients with thalidomide resulted in decreased NET formation. Altogether, our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of T2R, which, it is hoped, will contribute to the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and emergence of novel alternative therapies in the near future.
