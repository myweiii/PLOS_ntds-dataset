The infection with Cryptosporidium parasite, a condition known as cryptosporidiosis, is a common cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries. We have previously shown that mice infected with C. parvum, one of the main cause of human cryptosporidiosis, develop a more severe infection if given probiotics. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, we fed mice prebiotics and diet lacking plant fiber. We found that fermentable fiber, whether administered as a prebiotic supplement or as part of the diet, has a protective effect against cryptosporidiosis in mice. We also observed a significant association between the severity of infection and the composition of the gut microbiota. A significant inverse correlation was found between severity of cryptosporidiosis and the ratio between the abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the abundance of Firmicutes bacteria. This ratio is frequently viewed as a marker of a healthy microbiota. These results raise the possibility that dietary interventions could be used to alleviate the impact of cryptosporidiosis.
