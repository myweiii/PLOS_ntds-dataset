Guangzhou is the most epidemic area of dengue in China. Massive insecticides have been used to control the vector mosquito Ae. albopictus, as no specific vaccines are available for dengue. Regular monitoring of insecticide susceptibility is essential for insecticide resistance management. In this study, the insecticide resistances of Ae. albopictus in Guangzhou were comparatively analyzed from 2015 to 2017. The results displayed that Ae. albopictus had rapidly generated high resistance to the most commonly used adult insecticide pyrethroid (deltamethrin and permethrin) and larvicide organophosphate (temephos). The combination of malathion for adult mosquitoes and Bti or hexaflumuron for larvae might be a better choice for vector control. Resistance to deltamethrin can be significantly reduced by PBO but may generated cross-resistance to PPF. F1534S and F1534L mutations in the VGSC gene were significantly correlated with resistance to pyrethroids. This study indicated that the insecticide resistances had been generated in Ae. albopictus in Guangzhou which was correlated with the dengue epidemic responses.
