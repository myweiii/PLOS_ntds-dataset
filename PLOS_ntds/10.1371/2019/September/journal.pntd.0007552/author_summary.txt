Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue, is a highly invasive species that is expanding from urban to peri-urban and rural areas throughout the Americas. Previous studies documented the role of human transportation networks in Ae. aegypti long-distance dispersal. We examined whether patterns of Ae. aegypti gene flow are consistent with this observation. Mosquitoes were collected from seven locations, including the large Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru, and six neighboring rural communities, and their genetic relatedness was compared using 8 microsatellite markers. Our results showed ample gene flow among mosquito populations in this region, with greater gene flow observed among sites that are connected by fluvial routes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human transportation networks, especially via boats, are a primary contributing factor to the spread of Ae. aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon.
