We would like to thank all the participants who took the time to engage with us to be a part of this study and shared honest and challenging accounts of highly personal experiences. We would also like to extend our gratitude to the Government of Liberia, Ministry of Health, National NTD programme and the County Health Teams of Nimba, Bong and Maryland who facilitated district and community access and provided ongoing logistical support.
