Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. Due to the limited mobility of the mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus, human mobility can be a key to both understanding an individualâ€™s exposure to the virus and explaining the spread of dengue throughout a population. Accurate disease models should include human mobility; however, changes in human movement patterns due to the presence of symptoms need to be taken into account. We quantified the impact of symptom presence on human mobility throughout the infectious period by analyzing a dataset on the daily movements of dengue virus infected individuals. Accounting for these changing patterns of mobility will improve understanding of the complex relationship between symptom severity, human movement, and dengue virus transmission. Furthermore, dengue transmission models that incorporate symptom-driven mobility changes can be used to evaluate scenarios and strategies for disease prevention.
