    "Abstract": "Mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1(HTLV-1) contributes disproportionately to the burden of HTLV-1 associated diseases. All preventive measures to avoid MTCT rely on the identification of infected mothers. However, the impact of pregnancy on HTLV-1 diagnosis has not been clearly assessed. Paired samples from 21 HTLV-1 infected women taken during pregnancy and while not pregnant were analysed by CMIA and PCR. The signal-to-cut-off values (S/CO) were higher during pregnancy than in the paired non-pregnant samples. HTLV-1 proviral load did not alter significantly by pregnant state. S/CO positively correlated with HTLV proviral load. Pregnancy does not impair the diagnosis of HTLV-1/2, by either immunological (CMIA) or molecular (qPCR/nPCR) tests."
