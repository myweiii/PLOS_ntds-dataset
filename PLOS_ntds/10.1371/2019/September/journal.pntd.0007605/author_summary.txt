The global health community is working to eliminate trachoma, a bacterial disease that causes blindness. The elimination strategy includes offering antibiotics to everyone living in communities with a high prevalence of active trachoma, also known as mass drug administration, and providing surgeries for people with advanced trachoma. The World Health Organization requires that countries conduct surveys to see whether a district has reached the prevalence benchmarks for stopping population-level prevention interventions against trachoma. After stopping these interventions, programs conduct more surveys to make sure that trachoma has remained at bay. Trachoma programs must include the costs of these surveys in their budgets. Although some estimates of the costs of baseline trachoma prevalence surveys already exist, none examine the costs of additional surveys required later in the program. In this paper, we analyze the costs of over 300 of these surveys. We find that they cost about $8,000-$10,000 per survey, varying widely by country. Variations are mostly driven by how much it costs to pay surveyors and transport them to survey sites. Costs did not appear to change over time. With the data that we present in this paper, national programs will be more prepared to plan for monitoring the elimination of trachoma.
