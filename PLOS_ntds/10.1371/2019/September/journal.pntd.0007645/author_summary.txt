The 2014–2016 EVD outbreak has greatly impacted the population health and nutrition of affected countries in West Africa, including that of Sierra Leone. Since this recent outbreak, the humanitarian community acknowledges the need for improved solutions to better prepare for, and respond. Despite the importance of nutrition during outbreaks, there has been little systematic research conducted for understanding lessons learned and improving upon the typical nutrition response options currently available. This study used qualitative interviews to collect in-depth narratives from government officials, front-line health workers, non-government organization management, and community members including local leaders and EVD survivors. Findings reveal the unprecedented magnitude of this outbreak, which had systems-wide impacts not dissimilar to those felt by natural disasters. Interviews with people who lived through this event in Sierra Leone described EVD effects which revealed the importance and fragility of multiple, interconnected systems comprising the food value-chain for optimal nutrition in Sierra Leone. Findings across the food value-chain reveal how this interconnected system was impacted at every level with consequences for population-level nutrition. In preparation for future outbreaks of this magnitude, such a framework may prove useful for policy and planning, including improved guidelines development for employing coordinated nutrition-specific and nutrition–sensitive approaches that address immediate and underlying determinants of nutritional status.
