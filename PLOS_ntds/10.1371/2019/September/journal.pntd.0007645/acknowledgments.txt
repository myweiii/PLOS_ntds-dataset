We would like to first provide our sincere thank you to the study participants who gave us their time and voices to explain their experiences during the EVD outbreak. Also, we want to extend our gratitude to Aminata S. Koroma, the Directorate of Food and Nutrition, as well as the FOCUS1000 team, including but not limited to Paul Sengeh, Baindu Kosia, and Andrew Konneh. Lastly, a big thank you goes to Meagan Harrison who also supported the qualitative data analysis efforts.
