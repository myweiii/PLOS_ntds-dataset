Community-based mass drug administration (MDA) uses volunteers within at-risk communities to distribute preventive chemotherapies en masse for neglected tropical diseases. Treatment rates achieved by community medicine distributors (CMDs) vary widely and can undermine morbidity control. We studied routine community-based MDA in 28 villages near Lake Victoria in Uganda. There were two CMDs per village who were tasked with moving from home-to-home to administer praziquantel, albendazole, and ivermectin for schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. We observed treatment outcomes for 6,148 eligible individuals aged 1+ years. Here we identified the best combination of CMD characteristics for achieving high village-level treatment rates. We found that a more equal division of labour (e.g. 50â€“50 split between how many people each CMD treated) was associated with higher treatment rates when compared to CMDs with an unequal division of labour (e.g. one CMD treating no one). CMDs who were friends were more likely to have a division of labour that was nearly twofold more equal than CMDs who were not friends. The similarity of CMDs with respect to network, demographic, or socioeconomic characteristics did not influence village treatment rates. National programmes should explore interventions that seek to facilitate communication, friendship, and equal partnership between CMDs.
