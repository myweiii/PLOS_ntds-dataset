While the leprosy new case detection has been decreasing worldwide since the introduction of multidrug therapy (MDT) in the 1980s, treatment default remains an important risk factor for leprosy-associated disability and an obstacle to disease control and elimination. Treatment default occurs when an individual with leprosy does not take the prescribed number of doses required for treatment with MDT. We hypothesized that the frequency of defaulting may be influenced by geographic factors, especially as related to access to care, and socioeconomic factors, such as income, education, and household living conditions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated geographic and socioeconomic factors associated with leprosy treatment default among 20,063 new leprosy cases followed as part of the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort between 2007 and 2014. In total, 5.0% of the leprosy patients defaulted from MDT. Among the associated factors, we found that having residency in the North and Northeast of Brazil, black ethnicity, low familial income, lack of formal electricity, and a high household density were associated with higher odds of leprosy treatment default. Overall, these findings highlight the need for tailoring MDT strategies for vulnerable populations in high-burden communities and suggest that social policies aiming to alleviate poverty should be investigated as potential tools for improving leprosy treatment completion.
