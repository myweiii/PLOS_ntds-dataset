Zika virus infection can trigger the development of Guillain Barr√© syndrome (GBS), a neurological autoimmune disorder mediated by antibodies recognizing gangliosides in nerve membranes. Mechanisms such as molecular mimicry have been identified as a cause for GBS development in certain infections, such as Campylobacter jejuni, but the broad self reactivity observed during GBS suggests a role for alternative mechanisms. Our finding that Zika patients with GBS present higher levels of anti-ganglioside antibodies compared to uncomplicated Zika patients in Brazil points to these auto-antibodies as a trigger for GBS in these patients. These findings further support infection-induced autoantibodies as a factor contributing to GBS development, adding novel mechanisms for GBS development beyond molecular mimicry.
