Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonosis with major public health implications in humans. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice, but alternative approved drugs are necessary in cases of TCBZ failure. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an alternative used in such cases. However, the efficacy of NTZ in TCBZ-failure cases among patients in Egypt remains unclear. In this study, the efficacy of NTZ was evaluated in cases of TCBZ failure during an outbreak of human fascioliasis in Assiut governorate of Upper Egypt. This study enrolled 67 patients diagnosed with fascioliasis based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. These patients were referred from the outpatient clinic in Manfalout locality of Assiut governorate in Egypt. All patients received TCBZ at recommended doses as initial treatment. Those failing to respond were treated with NTZ at standard doses; following therapy, lesions in the liver and high eosinophil counts were resolved in 30% and 6.7% patients, respectively, indicating an overall efficacy of 36.6%. Therefore, in this outbreak of human fascioliasis in Upper Egypt, NTZ was found to be partially effective in cases with TCBZ failure.
