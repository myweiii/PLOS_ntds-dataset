In 2010, the WHO Expert Committee recommended liposomal amphotericin B (in single or multiple doses) along with three short combination treatment regimens containing liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), miltefosine (Milt) and/or paromomycin (PM) as preferred options to replace the existing miltefosine monotherapy for kala-azar treatment in South Asia. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) in partnership with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science (RMRI-Regional ICMR institute), State Health Society Bihar, and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) conducted a phase 4 field effectiveness study to determine the effectiveness and to assess the safety and feasibility of using single dose LAmB, and the combination therapies of LAmB+Milt and Milt+PM for the treatment of VL at public healthcare facility settings in India. Based on the provisional results of this effectiveness study at 6 months follow-up, the Indian government revised the national policy in August 2014, introducing SDA as first option and Milt+PM as second option to replace miltefosine monotherapy in the kala-azar elimination initiative. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) expert committee recommended to follow up this large cohort of patients for one year to identify relapses yielding further evidence on new treatment regimens.
