A method used to describe expressed genes at a specific stage in an organism is an EST library. In this method mRNA from a specific organism is isolated, transcribed into cDNA and sequenced. The sequence will derive from the 5â€²-end of the cDNA. The library will not have sequences from all genes, especially if they are expressed in low amounts or not at all in the studied stage. Also the library will mostly not contain full length sequences from genes, but expression patterns can be established. If EST libraries are made from different stages of the same organisms these libraries can be compared and differently expressed genes can be identified. Described here is an analysis of an EST library from the pig cysticerca which is thought to be similar to the stage giving the human neglected disease neurocysticercosis. Novel genes together with putative drug targets are examples of data presented.
