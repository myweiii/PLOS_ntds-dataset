    "Purpose": "To develop an oral formulation of amphotericin B (AmB) that is stable at the temperatures of WHO Climatic Zones 3 and 4 (30–43°C) and to evaluate its efficacy in a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL).",
    "Methods": "The stability testing of four novel oral lipid AmB formulations composed of mono- and di-glycerides and pegylated esters (iCo-010 to iCo-013) was performed over 60 d and analyzed by HPLC-UV. In addition, the four formulations were incubated 4 h in fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid. AmB concentration was measured spectrophotometrically and emulsion droplet diameter was assessed by dynamic light scattering. Antileishmanial activity of iCo-010 was evaluated at increasing oral doses (2.5 to 10 mg/kg) in a murine model of VL.",
    "Results": "AmB stability in the lipid formulation (iCo-010) was >75% over 60 days. After 4 h in fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid, AmB concentration was >95%. iCo-010 demonstrated significant efficacy when orally administered to VL-infected mice bid for five days (inhibition of 99%, 98%, and 83% at 10, 5 and 2.5 mg/kg compared to the vehicle control). In addition, the qd dose of 20 mg/kg provided 96% inhibition compared to the vehicle control.",
    "Conclusions": "The oral AmB formulation iCo-010 is stable at the temperatures of WHO Climatic Zones 3 and 4 (30–43°C). iCo-010 showed excellent antileishmanial activity at both 10 mg/kg po bid for 5 days (<99% reduction in parasitic infection) and 20 mg/kg po qd for 5 days (95% inhibition when compared to control)."
