Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a systemic form of a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by obligate intra-macrophage protozoa of the genus Leishmania. VL is always fatal in humans if left untreated and treatment options are limited. Amphotericin B (AmB), a polyene antibiotic, is the most active antileishmanial agent that currently exists. Liposomal AmB (AmBisome) is used as first-line treatment in developed countries [1], [7], [8], [9], [10]; however, the requisite parenteral administration and the high cost of the liposomal formulation prevents this treatment from reaching the majority of patients in developing nations [3]. A stable, efficacious oral treatment for VL that is able to withstand the rigors of tropical climates would overcome many of the current barriers to treatment that exist in countries with large VL-infected patient populations. In this study we have developed an oral formulation of AmB that is stable in tropical conditions and exhibits significant antileshimanial activity in mice.
