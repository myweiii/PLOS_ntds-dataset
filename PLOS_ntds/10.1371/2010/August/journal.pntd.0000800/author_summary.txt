Onchocerciasis is a chronic and highly debilitating disease of humans caused by a worm called Onchocerca volvulus. This worm can live in the human body for over 15 years. The disease affects mainly the skin and eyes and is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. There is currently no vaccine to prevent the infection. Available drugs can give short-term relief but cannot cure the infection. To prevent infection, a vaccine against the third-stage infective larva, L3, or the developing larva is required. These stages were shown to be the targets of protective immunity that develops in individuals who live in onchocerciasis endemic regions. One type of protective immunity has been shown to develop with age and is called concomitant immunity. In the present study, we have identified a number of larval antigens that may be associated with the development of such immunity. The most prominent of these antigens was Ov-CPI-2, also called onchocystatin, which had previously been shown to be a promising vaccine candidate. This antigen was further characterized and confirmed to be possibly also a target of immune protection that develops in the infected individuals with age and is referred to as concomitant immunity.
