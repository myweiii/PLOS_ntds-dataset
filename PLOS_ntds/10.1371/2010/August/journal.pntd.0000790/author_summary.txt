Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is caused by infection with trematodes of the genus Schistosoma. The disease afflicts over 200 million people, with the bulk of the disease burden focused in some of the world's poorest countries. Schistosomiasis control rests largely on chemotherapy with a single drug, praziquantel, a precarious situation calling for the discovery and development of new antischistosomal agents. One hindrance to the discovery of new drugs is a deficiency of knowledge regarding some basic biological processes of these parasitic worms. Here, we take significant steps toward the elucidation of signaling and pathways involved in schistosome neuromuscular control, a central biological function with proven vulnerability to chemotherapeutic intervention. Neuropeptides are known to be important in flatworm muscle control and here we find that FMRFamide-like peptides act to contract schistosome muscle by enhancing calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels. We also found that the receptor for the myoexcitatory neuropeptides uses a protein kinase C pathway to stimulate the voltage-operated calcium channels. Understanding the molecules involved in the neuromuscular physiology of these worms helps to identify potentially useful targets for a new generation of antischistosomal drugs.
