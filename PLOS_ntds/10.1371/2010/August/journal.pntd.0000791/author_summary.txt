Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a destructive skin disease found predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and south-eastern Australia. The mode of transmission and environmental reservoir remain unknown, but several studies have explored the role of aquatic insects, such as water bugs, and biting insects, such as mosquitoes. In the present study we investigated possible environmental source(s) of M. ulcerans in Victoria, Australia. Our results revealed that although M. ulcerans DNA could be detected at low levels in a variety of environmental samples, the highest concentrations of M. ulcerans DNA were found in the faeces of two species of possums, common ringtails and common brushtails. Possums are small arboreal marsupial mammals, native to Australia, and these particular species occur in both urban and rural areas. Examination and sampling of live captured possums in an area endemic for BU revealed that 38% of ringtail possums and 24% of brushtail possums, respectively, had laboratory-confirmed M. ulcerans lesions and/or M. ulcerans PCR-positive faeces. The finding that large numbers of possums in a BU-endemic area are infected with M. ulcerans raises the possibility that mammals are an environmental reservoir for M. ulcerans.
