Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease caused by Hantaviruses, is characterized by fever, acute renal dysfunction and hemorrhagic manifestations. At present, it is endemic in all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and metropolitan areas in mainland China where human cases account for 90% of the total global cases. Historically Shandong Province bears the largest HFRS burden in Chinaâ€”the cumulative number of human cases accounted for 1/3 of the national total. Here we report a spatiotemporal analysis of human HFRS cases in Shandong using reported case data spanning 1973 to 2005. Through the analysis of seasonal incidences and use of velocity maps, three phases of seasonal shifts of HFRS epidemics and the expansion pattern of HFRS endemic areas were identified over the 33-year period. In addition, precipitation, humidity, and temperature were found to be significantly associated with the seasonal variation of HFRS incidence in Shandong Province. These findings offer insights in understanding possible causes of HFRS spread and distribution and may assist in informing prevention and control strategies.
