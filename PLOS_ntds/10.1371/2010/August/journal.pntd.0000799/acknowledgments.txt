We thank the survey participants and the members of the survey teams who were involved in collecting the data on trachoma prevalence. We also thank Diana Picon for organizing the collection of GPS data for some of the survey sites where these had not been previously collected, and we thank the individuals that spend days travelling, often by foot, to visit and georeference these sites.
