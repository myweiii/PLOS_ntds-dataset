We would like to thank all the volunteers who participated in the experimental hut studies, the team from TTCIH who built the huts, and the people of Lupiro for their continued assistance. The authors owe a debt of gratitude to Nicole Achee and John Grieco who have contributed excellent guidance on hut design and study protocol, and to Bob Wirtz and Peter McElroy for their continued support and advice without whom, the study would not have taken place. We also wish to thank Dr. Eric Mossdorf for his input on Arbovirus cases identified locally. We also thank the reviewers for their enormous input.
