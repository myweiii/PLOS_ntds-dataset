Leptospira is the most common infectious cause of uveitis, a potentially debilitating inflammation of the eye. In our earlier work, we discovered that eye fluids of uveitic horses contain high levels of antibodies directed against novel leptospiral proteins, which we named LruA and LruB (Leptospiral recurrent uveitis associated proteins A and B). Significantly, antibodies raised against LruA and LruB also recognize lens and retinal tissue. We have now identified the cross-reactive eye proteins as alpha-crystallin B, vimentin and beta-crystallin B2. We also demonstrated that ocular fluids from uveitic horses contain high levels of antibodies recognizing alpha-crystallin B, vimentin and beta-crystallin B2. These data suggest that antibodies directed against leptospiral LruA and LruB during infection can also react with eye proteins, alpha-crystallin B, vimentin and beta-crystallin B2, potentially contributing to the severity of this eye disease.
