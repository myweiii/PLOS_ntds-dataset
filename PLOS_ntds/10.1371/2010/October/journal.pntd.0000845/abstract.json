    "Background": "In human leishmaniasis Th1/Th2 dichotomy similar to murine model is not clearly defined and surrogate marker(s) of protection is not yet known. In this study, Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3) profile induced by purified CD4+/CD8+ T cells in response to Leishmania antigens were assessed at transcript and protein levels in 14 volunteers with a history of self-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis (HCL) and compared with 18 healthy control volunteers.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "CD4+/CD8+/CD14+ cells were purified from peripheral blood using magnetic beads; CD4+/CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with autologous CD14+ monocytes in the presence of soluble Leishmania antigens (SLA). Stimulation of either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells of HCL volunteers with SLA induced a significantly (P<0.05) higher IFN-\u03b3 production compared with the cells of controls. Upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 gene expression in CD4+ cells (P<0.001) and CD8+ cells (P\u200a=\u200a0.006) of HCL volunteers was significantly more than that of controls. Significantly (P<0.05) higher fold-expression of IFN-\u03b3 gene was seen in CD4+ cells than in CD8+ cells. In HCL volunteers a significantly (P\u200a=\u200a0.014) higher number of CD4+ cells were positive for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production than CD8+ cells.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Collectively, the volunteers have shown maintenance of specific long-term immune responses characterized by a strong reaction to leishmanin skin test and IFN-\u03b3 production. The dominant IFN-\u03b3 response was the result of expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The results suggested that immune response in protected individuals with a history of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) due to L. major is mediated not only through the expansion of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ Th1 cells, but also through IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8+ T cells."
