Leishmania are intracellular parasites that reside within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) in phagocytes. From within these compartments parasites control the host cell's responses to multiple stimuli. There is limited knowledge of the molecules that Leishmania parasites elaborate in the host cell to target processes therein. Furthermore, the mechanism by which such molecules would access their targets beyond the PV is not known. In the study presented here, we implemented the change mediated antigen technology (CMAT) to identify parasite molecules that are preferentially expressed inside infected cells. The approach was based on the reasoning that parasites express ‘new’ or antigenically modified molecules in the intracellular environment; therefore antiserum that is reactive to infected cells would contain immunoglobulins that are specific to these ‘new’ molecules. After adsorption of the antiserum with axenically cultured parasites, the antiserum was used to screen a parasite genomic expression library to identify genes encoding the molecules that are preferentially expressed in infected cells. We present for the first time evidence that some of these CMAT molecules accumulate in the PV and then traffic into the host cell in vesicles of distinct morphologies. Furthermore, several of these parasite molecules become localized in discrete compartments within the host cell.
