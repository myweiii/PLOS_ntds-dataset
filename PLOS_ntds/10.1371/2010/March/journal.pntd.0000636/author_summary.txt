Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the most common species of tsetse in Uganda, where it transmits human sleeping sickness and nagana, a related disease of cattle. A consortium of African countries dedicated to controlling these diseases is poised to begin area wide control of tsetse, but a critical question remains: What is the most appropriate geographical scale for these activities? To address this question, we used population genetics to determine the extent of linkage between populations of tsetse confined to discrete patches of riverine habitat. Our results suggest that Uganda was colonized by two distinct lineages of G. f. fuscipes, which now co-occur only in a narrow band across central Uganda. Evidence for interbreeding at the zone of contact and movement of genes from the south to the north suggest that this historical genetic structure may dissolve in the future. At smaller scales, we have demonstrated that exchange of genes among neighboring populations via dispersal is at equilibrium with the differentiating force of genetic drift. Our results highlight the need for investment in vector control programs that account for the linkage observed among tsetse populations. Given its genetic isolation and its location at the far edge of G. fuscipes' range, the Lake Victoria region appears to be an appropriate target for area wide control.
