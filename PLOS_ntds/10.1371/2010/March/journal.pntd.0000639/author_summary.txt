Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a vector-borne protozoan disease that is characterized by cutaneous lesions which develop at the site of the insect bite. Lesions can vary in severity, clinical appearance, and time to cure; in a proportion of patients lesions can become chronic, leading to disfiguring mucosal leishmaniasis or leishmaniasis recidvans. Albeit not fatal, cutaneous leishmaniasis can have a significant social impact as it may lead to severe stigmatisation of affected individuals when lesions or scars occur on the face and exposed extremeties. Over the last 10â€“20 years there has been an increase in the number of leishmaniasis cases reported in South Asia, particularly in Afghanistan. Little is known about the household-level risk factors for infection and disease. Here we confirm previous reports that had shown the association of cutaneous leishmaniasis with age and clustering of cases at the household-level. Additionally, we show that risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis is associated with household construction (i.e. brick walls) and design (i.e. proportion of windows with screens).
