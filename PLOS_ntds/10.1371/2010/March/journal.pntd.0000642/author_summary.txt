Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. It is a major concern in South America, Africa, India and the Middle East. Additionally, it has now emerged as an important opportunistic disease in patients coinfected with HIV-1. This is due, in part, to the increasing overlap between urban centers and rural areas endemic for Leishmania. Although more efficient combinatorial antiviral drug regimens for treating HIV-1 infection have been developed, the impact of such therapies on HIV-1/Leishmania coinfection is yet to be explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of nelfinavir, a well-characterized anti-HIV-1 drug, on Leishmania. Treating the parasite with nelfinavir activates events that are hallmarks of programmed cell death (also called apoptosis). Among these are oxidative stress, changes in DNA replication and fragmentation, and release of mitochondrial enzymes. Furthermore, these events occur without the participation of caspases, which are classically linked to apoptosis; however, this atypical apoptosis requires the translocation of endonuclease G from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. These findings provide insights for the design of new anti-parasitic therapies, particularly in the case of Leishmania/HIV-1 coinfections.
