Schistosomiasis is a tropical disease caused by one of the species of the parasitic worm Schistosoma which infects over 200 million people worldwide. Signalling via the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα), which is the common receptor chain for the ligands IL-4 and IL-13, is essential for inducing protective Type 2 immune response and granuloma formation in response to the parasite eggs. In experimental Schistosoma mansoni infection and egg-induced inflammation studies with cell type-specific IL-4Rα deficient mice, the role of IL-4Rα-activated alternative macrophages (aaMφ) and IL-4Rα-responsive T cells was investigated with focus on the control of hepatic inflammation and granuloma formation. Interestingly, aaMφ were not essential for the cellular composition or the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile in liver granulomas. In contrast, IL-4Rα-dependent T cell responses were important for predominant Th2 and IL-10 responses, as well as the presence of aaMφ in the granulomas, avoiding major disruption in the granuloma cell composition. Moreover, a macrophage subpopulation was identified and those cells expressed the two aaMφ markers, mannose receptor- and Ym1 in an IL-4Rα-independent but IL-10-dependent manner. These cells might be involved in the control of inflammation.
