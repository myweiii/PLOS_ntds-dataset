Dengue is the one of the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral diseases in tropical regions of the world. Manifestations may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications. Laboratorial diagnosis is essential to diagnose dengue and differentiate it from other diseases. Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) may be used as a marker of acute dengue virus infection. Our results, based in the comparison of three NS1 antigen capture assays available, have shown that this approach is reliable for the early diagnosis of dengue infections, especially in the first four days after the onset of the symptoms. A lower sensitivity was observed in DENV-3 cases. Serum positive by virus isolation were more often detected than those positive by RT-PCR by all three assays. Only the Plateliaâ„¢ NS1 test showed a higher sensitivity in confirming primary infections than secondary ones. In conclusion, NS1 antigen capture commercial kits are useful for diagnosis of acute primary and secondary dengue infections and, in endemic countries where secondary infections are expected to occur, may be used in combination with MAC-ELISA to increase the overall sensitivity of both tests.
