Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially fatal disease without treatment, characterized by prolonged fever, enlargement of spleen and liver, anaemia and weight loss. Treatment for VL is difficult, as it requires prolonged and painful application of toxic drugs with adverse side effects. It is therefore important to develop alternative satisfactory therapies for VL. Herein, we report the efficacy of a new liposomal formulation of amphotericin-B, Fungisome, and the immunological changes that take place 1-week after treatment. Patients treated with 5 and 7.5 mg/kg (single-dose) and 10 mg/kg (5 mg/kg double-dose) of Fungisome showed 60%, 50% and 90% successful cure at 6-month posttreatment, respectively. Successfully cured patients showed reduced IL-12 and IL-10 levels in the plasma and two-fold or more increase in Th1 type-cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF, and down-regulation of immunosuppressive factors IL-10 and TGF-β in the culture supernatants, 1-week after treatment independent of drug-dose. Insignificant decrease of plasma IL-12 and IL-10, negligible increase of Th1-cytokines, and persistence of IL-10, despite decrease in TGF-β in culture supernatants, correlated with relapse within 6-months of treatment. These interesting results pave the way for further testing of this drug as a new alternative in the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis.
