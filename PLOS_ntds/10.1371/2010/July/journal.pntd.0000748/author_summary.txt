A virulent strain of the vertically-inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis (wMelPop-CLA) from the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster has been established in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti as part of a biological strategy for dengue control. In this medically important disease vector, wMelPop-CLA infection shortens mosquito lifespan and effectively blocks dengue productivity within the mosquito â€“ two powerful effects that could decrease the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations for transmission of dengue viruses. Here, we further characterize the phenotypic effects of wMelPop-CLA on several life-history traits of Ae. aegypti, and report that this infection influences the survival of this mosquito species during sustained periods of embryonic quiescence. From an applied perspective, we suggest that this novel phenotype may be a useful tool to reduce mosquito population size in regions where embryonic quiescence contributes towards survival of this species through seasonal changes in rainfall or temperature, and thus further reduce the probability of dengue transmission at the beginning of each wet season. This study also highlights key fitness parameters needed to accurately model invasion dynamics of this virulent Wolbachia strain.
