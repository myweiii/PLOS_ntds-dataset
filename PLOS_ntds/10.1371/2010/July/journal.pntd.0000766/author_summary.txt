Dengue virus (DENV) is the cause of the most common vector-borne viral disease of humans, and is at particularly high prevalence in parts of Southeast Asia. Most studies of DENV transmission have focused on very local or international movement patterns, and have not explored how DENV moves through an endemic region. To address this issue, we employed newly developed phylogeographic methods to study patterns of spatial spread in 168 full-length DENV-2 genome sequences collected during a hospital-based study in southern Viet Nam, focusing on the Asian I genotype that recently emerged in this region. This analysis revealed that the urban population of Ho Chi Minh City plays a central role in the dispersal of the virus, and that DENV in this city tends to move along a gradient of population density. In addition, human movement between urban and rural areas was the most likely explanation for the rapid diffusion of DENV across southern Viet Nam following its introduction into Ho Chi Minh City. After reaching more rural areas, some virus lineages were maintained there for a number of years. These results therefore indicate that virological surveillance is necessary in both urban and rural populations.
