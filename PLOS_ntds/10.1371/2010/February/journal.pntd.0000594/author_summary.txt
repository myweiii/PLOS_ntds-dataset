Porcine cysticercosis is an infection of pigs caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium, a tapeworm that causes taeniosis in humans. The disease is very common in pigs from many developing countries around the world and poses a serious public health risk and causes significant economic losses in pig production. In Mozambique there is scanty information regarding the occurrence of this disease. Our work conducted in Angónia district, northwestern Mozambique, allowed us to collect important information to evaluate the magnitude and identify the risk factors associated with porcine cysticercosis. This study found that cysticercosis is highly prevalent in pigs and that the free-range husbandry system was by far the main risk factor for the transmission of the disease in the district. These findings should help in the design of control strategies to prevent continuous transmission of this disease in Angónia and in Mozambique.
