We would like to acknowledge the enormous contributions to these studies by Magai Kaare, who tragically died on the 6th of October 2008 as a consequence of a car accident in Tanzania. His work has been highly influential in shaping rabies policy in Tanzania and worldwide. Magai's death is a grave loss and he will be greatly missed.
