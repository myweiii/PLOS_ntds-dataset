The genome sequences of two of the three major species of schistosomes are now available. Molecular tools are needed to determine the importance of these new genes. With this in mind, we investigated introduction of reporter transgenes into schistosome eggs, with the longer-term aim of manipulation of schistosome genes and gene functions. The egg is a desirable developmental stage for genome manipulation, not least because it contains apparently accessible germ cells. Introduction of transgenes into the germ cells of schistosome eggs might result in transgenic schistosomes. However, the egg is surrounded by a thick shell which might block access to entry of transgenes. We cultured eggs in the presence of three types of reporter transgenes of increasing molecular size, and in addition we tried to produce transient holes in the eggs by electroporation to investigate whether the transgenes would more easily enter the eggs. Electroporation of eggs appeared to allow entry of two larger types of transgenes into cultured schistosome eggs, messenger RNA encoding firefly luciferase, and retroviral virions. We anticipate that this approach, electroporation of transgenes into schistosome eggs, will facilitate genetic manipulation of schistosomes for investigating the importance of schistosome genes and gene products as new intervention targets.
