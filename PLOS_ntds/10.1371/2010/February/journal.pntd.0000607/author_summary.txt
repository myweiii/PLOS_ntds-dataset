One possible approach to the control of amoebisis is based on the simplicity of its life cycle involving only humans with no intermediary hosts and reservoirs. The cyst, responsible for the transmission of this parasite, is an ideal target for developing new drugs to eradicate the disease. However, the stimuli that trigger the encystment of E. histolytica and the underlying mechanisms are still mostly unknown. Our study describes the in vitro induction of cyst-like structures when trophozoites cultures are exposed to hydrogen peroxide and divalent cations. Evidence is provided to support the activation of chitin biosynthesis resulting in these chitin-walled round structures that might be intermediates in the formation of infective, tetranucleated, mature cysts. We believe this represents a significant advance for the study of the encystment process in amoebae, and may lead to strategies directed to control the propagation of this parasite.
