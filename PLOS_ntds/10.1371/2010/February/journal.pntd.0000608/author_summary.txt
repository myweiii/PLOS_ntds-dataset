Once infected with dengue virus, a female Aedes aegypti mosquito must survive longer than twelve days before it can transmit the virus to an uninfected person. New dengue control strategies therefore aim to circumvent dengue transmission using entomopathogenic microorganisms that shorten mosquito lifespan. Accurate methods to determine the age of individual mosquitoes are required for these and other mosquito control interventions. We have previously shown that mosquito age can be predicted from the transcription of specific genes. Here we demonstrate that this can be achieved under natural conditions when mosquitoes are uncaged and free to engage in natural behavior. To do this, we produced “free-range” female mosquitoes by releasing 8007 mosquitoes at an isolated location and recapturing the females of known ages. We developed an age prediction model from gene transcription measures of mosquitoes maintained in small “sentinel cages” maintained onsite. We then used this model to predict the ages of the free-range mosquitoes, based on their own transcription measures. Age predictions were robust to physiological changes associated with blood feeding and egg development. We show that the technique could be applied to identify a 50% reduction in mosquito population survival that is expected from infection with entomopathogenic Wolbachia bacteria.
