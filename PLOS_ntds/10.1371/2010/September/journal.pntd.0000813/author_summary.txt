Contrary to the traditional view that immunity in invertebrates is limited to innate mechanisms, recent studies have shown that these several species of protostome invertebrates express putative immune receptors that can be somatically diversified in a way resulting in an analogy with Immunoglobulins or T Cell Receptors of vertebrate species. Other studies have shown the existence of putative antigenic variant counterparts in their specific parasite, as would be expected in an “arms race” between both protagonists. However, the interaction between these immune receptors and antigens was never demonstrated in an interaction involving an invertebrate and its specific pathogen. We demonstrate such an interaction in the present study. We show that a specific set of highly variable immune receptors of the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata forms immune complexes with highly polymorphic and individually variable mucin determinants from its specific trematode parasite S. mansoni. We demonstrate for the first time in an invertebrate host-parasite interaction that a large repertoire of parasite epitopes matched a large repertoire of host immune receptors.
