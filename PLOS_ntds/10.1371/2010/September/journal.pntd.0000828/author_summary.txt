African Animal Trypanosomiasis causes the death of 3 million head of cattle each year. The annual economic losses as a result of the disease are estimated to be 4.5 billion US dollars. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies and can infect a wide range of hosts from wildlife to domestic animals. This study is dealing with Trypanosoma congolense, which is one of the very prevalent parasites affecting livestock of poor African rural communities, decreasing the milk and meat production but also reducing the fitness of cattle that is used as draught power. Infected animals can only be treated by three compounds, i.e., diminazene, isometamidium and ethidium. These three products have been in use for more than a half century and it is thus not surprising to observe treatment failures. In some areas, the trypanosomes circulating have developed resistance to the three drugs leaving the farmers with no further options. As pharmaceutical companies are not keen on investing efforts and money in the development of new veterinary drugs for this low-budget market, our idea was to render an old ineffective drug effective again by combining it with existing potentiating compounds that are available and affordable for the livestock keeper.
