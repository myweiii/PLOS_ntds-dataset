The 2 year follow-up period required after treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients is a major challenge for patients and control programmes alike. The patient should return every 6 months for lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination since, so far, no markers for cure have been identified in blood. The Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) is a simple, rapid test for trypanosome-specific antibody detection in blood that is extensively used in endemic areas to screen for HAT. We examined the value of a normalising CATT as a marker for treatment outcome. We observed that CATT titres decreased after treatment both in patients who experienced treatment failure as well as in cured patients. We conclude that CATT, though a good screening test, is unreliable for monitoring treatment outcome. We also showed that the sensitivity of CATT in relapse cases was as low as 78%, and as a consequence some relapse cases might be missed in screening programs if they have no clinical signs yet.
