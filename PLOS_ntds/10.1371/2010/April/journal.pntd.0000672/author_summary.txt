The spread of dengue (DEN) worldwide combined with an increased severity of the DEN-associated clinical outcomes have made this mosquito-borne virus of great global public health importance. Infection with DEN virus can be asymptomatic or trigger a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild acute febrile illness to classical dengue fever and to severe DEN hemorrhagic fever/DEN shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Progress in understanding DEN disease and in developing effective treatments has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that can reproduce all or part of the disease's clinical manifestations and outcome. Only a few of the DEN virus strains reported so far elicit a virulent phenotype in mice, which results at best in an acute infection where mice die within few days with no, few or irrelevant disease manifestations. Here we describe a DEN virus strain which is highly virulent in mice and reproduces some of the aspects of severe DEN in humans, including the disease kinetics, organ damage/dysfunction and increased vascular permeability. This DEN virus strain thus offers the opportunity to further decipher some of the mechanisms involved in DEN pathogenesis, and provides a new platform for drug and vaccine testing in the mouse model.
