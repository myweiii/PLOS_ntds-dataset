In general, organisms can use two different strategies when confronted with pathogens, tolerance and/or resistance. Resistance reduces the fitness of the invading pathogen, whereas tolerance reduces the damage caused by the pathogen to the host. Mosquitoes that transmit the parasites that cause human lymphatic filariasis generally are tolerant to the parasite, whereas those that do not transmit the parasite are resistant. We examined the effects of filarial worm tolerance and resistance on Armigeres subalbatus by analyzing changes in mosquito gene expression at key stages of parasite development and destruction. Because the gene expression data showed few mosquito transcriptional changes associated with parasite development, we morphologically examined mosquito flight muscle to see if we could identify damage associated with parasite infection. The research described in this manuscript provides a better understanding of the molecular components involved in compatible and incompatible relationships between mosquitoes and the filarial worm parasites that they transmit; and it will provide new insights into the complex biology of vector competence and the origins of host defense, and possibly lead to the functional characterization of previously unknown gene products involved in vector competence.
