Dengue is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries, including Vietnam. Dengue cases occur in children and young adults; however, severe dengue also occurs in infants less than 1 year of age. Prompt recognition of dengue is important for appropriate case management, particularly in infants in whom febrile illness from other causes is common. We describe the clinical picture, virological and immunological characteristics of infants with dengue admitted to three hospitals in southern Vietnam, compared with infants admitted with fever not due to dengue. We show that infants with dengue are difficult to distinguish from those with other febrile illnesses based on signs and symptoms at presentation, and so laboratory tests to confirm dengue virus infection may be useful for diagnosis and management. Conventional diagnostic methods for dengue have low sensitivity early in infection, and we show that an alternative antigen-detection assay that has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in older age groups also performs well in infants. This study will help to inform the diagnosis and management of dengue in infants.
