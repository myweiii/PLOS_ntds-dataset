Most of the 250 million malaria cases outside of Africa are caused by the parasite Plasmodium vivax. Although drugs can be used to treat P. vivax malaria, drug resistance is spreading and there is no available vaccine. Because this species cannot be readily grown in the laboratory there are added challenges to understanding the function of the many hypothetical genes in the genome. We isolated transcriptional messages from parasites growing in human blood and in mosquitoes, labeled the messages and measured how their levels for different parasite growth conditions. The data for 5,419 parasite genes shows extensive changes as the parasite moves between human and mosquito and reveals highly expressed genes whose proteins might represent new therapeutic targets for experimental vaccines. We discover sets of genes that are likely to play a role in the earliest stages of hepatocyte infection. We find intriguing differences in the expression patterns of different blood stage parasites that may be related to host-response status.
