Q fever is a zoonotic disease known since 1937. The disease may be severe, causing pneumonia, hepatitis and endocarditis. Q fever agent has been described as a possible biological weapon. Animals—especially domestic cows, goats and sheep—are considered reservoirs for this infection. They are capable of sustaining the infection for long periods and excreting viable bacteria, infecting other animals and, occasionally, humans. Here we studied the distribution of Q fever in a poorly studied region, Senegal. We studied the agent of Q fever both in ticks parasitizing domestic animals and in humans (antibodies in serum, bacteria in feces, saliva and milk). We found from the studied regions the bacterium is highly prevalent in rural Senegal. Up to 37.6% of five different and most prevalent tick species may carry the bacterium. Humans living in such areas, as other mammals, may occasionally excrete Q fever agent through feces and milk.
