Snakebite accidents by vipers cause a massive disturbance in hemostasis and tissue damage at the snakebite area. The systemic effects are often prevented by antivenom therapy. However, the local symptoms are not neutralized by antivenoms and are related to the temporary or permanent disability observed in many patients. Although the mechanisms involved in coagulation or necrotic disturbances induced by snake venoms are well known, the disruption of capillary vessels by SVMPs leading to hemorrhage and consequent local tissue damage is not fully understood. In our study, we reveal the mechanisms involved in hemorrhage induced by SVMPs by comparing the action of high and low hemorrhagic toxins isolated from Bothrops venoms, in mouse skin. We show remarkable differences in the tissue distribution and hydrolysis of collagen within the hemorrhagic lesions induced by high and low hemorrhagic metalloproteinases. According to our data, tissue accumulation of hemorrhagic toxins near blood vessel walls allowing the hydrolysis of basement membrane components, preferably collagen IV. These observations unveil new mechanistic insights supporting the local administration of metalloproteinases inhibitors as an alternative to improve snakebite treatment besides antivenom therapy.
