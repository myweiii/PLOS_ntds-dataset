Part of this research was performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), a national user facility operated by Stanford University on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences. We thank Clyde Smith for beamline support at the SSRL and Dick Winant at the Protein And Nucleic Acid (PAN) Facility at Stanford University Medical Center for N-terminal Edman sequencing of TbCatB. The authors also thank Dr Mohammed Sajid and Dr Thomas Stout for critical appraisal of the manuscript. All structure figures were prepared using PyMOL [45].
