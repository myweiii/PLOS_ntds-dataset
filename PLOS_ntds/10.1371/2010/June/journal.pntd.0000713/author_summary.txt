Detailed descriptions of the epidemiology of intestinal nematode infections within affected communities remain of considerable importance for the effective design of disease control programmes. We therefore conducted a parasitological survey of 1,803 individuals living in a rural community in eastern Uganda. Two complementary analytical approaches were used to evaluate causes of variation in intensity of hookworm infection in this community, both of which exploit correlation structures between individuals. Infection intensity was higher among older individuals and was also associated with factors influencing environmental exposure to infection, socio-economic indicators and treatment history. After accounting for these risk factors, spatial correlation remained evident between households less than 82m apart. Focusing further on similarities within households, our results suggest that 11% of variation in infection intensity could be explained by genetic differences between individuals and 18% by unmeasured factors associated with the domestic environment. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure-related factors, rather than host genetics, have the greatest influence on variation in infection intensities.
