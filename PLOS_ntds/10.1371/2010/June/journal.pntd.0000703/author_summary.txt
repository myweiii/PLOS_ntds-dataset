Because of its location and function, the liver is continuously exposed to a wide range of antigens. Pathogenic microorganisms must be eliminated while a large number of dietary or commensal organism antigens and hepatic metabolites must be tolerated. Therefore, the liver has developed a specialized immune system that favours tolerance rather than immunity and liver dendritic cells (DCs) act as a major cell subtype in promoting this response. Our work aimed to examine if such immunologic hyporesponsiveness has an impact on the control of the hepatic burden of Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that grows in liver and spleen tissues after infection (called visceral leishmaniasis in South America and Mediterranean basin, and Kala Azar in South East Asia). We first modelized an original model of hepatic DCs and infected them with Leishmania donovani. In contrast to control DCs, infection of hepatic DCs restored the alterate capacity of non-infected liver DCs to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation and IFNÎ³ secretion. Such characteristics were recently shown to favour granuloma formation in mouse liver. This research provides an explanation for the observation that Leishmania parasite growth is controlled in the liver via an efficient granuloma response.
