Visceral leishmanisasis, also known as Kala Azar, is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The L. donovani infectious cycle comprises two developmental stages, a motile promastigote stage that proliferates inside the digestive tract of the phlebotomine insect host, and a non-motile amastigote stage that differentiates inside the macrophages of mammalian hosts. Intracellular parasite survival in mouse and macrophage infection assays has been shown to be strongly compromised in the presence of the inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), which binds to members of the cyclophilin (CyP) protein family. It has been suggested that the toxic effects of CsA on amastigotes occurs indirectly via host cyclophilins, which may be required for intracellular parasite development and growth. Using a host-free L. donovani culture system we revealed for the first time a direct and stage-specific effect of CsA on promastigote growth and amastigote viability. We provided evidence that parasite killing occurs through a heat sensitivity mechanism likely due to direct inhibition of the co-chaperone cyclophilin 40. Our data allow important new insights into the function of the Leishmania CyP protein family in differentiation, growth, and intracellular survival, and define this class of molecules as important drug targets.
