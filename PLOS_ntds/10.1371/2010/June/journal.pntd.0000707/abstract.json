    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse correlation between the incidence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and the incidence of allergies and autoimmunity. However, the interrelationship between LF and type-2 diabetes is not known and hence, a cross sectional study to assess the baseline prevalence and the correlates of sero-positivity of LF among diabetic subjects was carried out (n\u200a=\u200a1416) as part of the CURES study. There was a significant decrease in the prevalence of LF among diabetic subjects (both newly diagnosed [5.7%] and those under treatment [4.3%]) compared to pre-diabetic subjects [9.1%] (p\u200a=\u200a0.0095) and non-diabetic subjects [10.4%] (p\u200a=\u200a0.0463). A significant decrease in filarial antigen load (p\u200a=\u200a0.04) was also seen among diabetic subjects. Serum cytokine levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines\u2014IL-6 and GM-CSF\u2014were significantly lower in diabetic subjects who were LF positive, compared to those who were LF negative. There were, however, no significant differences in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines\u2014IL-10, IL-13 and TGF-\u03b2\u2014between the two groups. Although a direct causal link has yet to be shown, there appears to be a striking inverse relationship between the prevalence of LF and diabetes, which is reflected by a diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine response in Asian Indians with diabetes and concomitant LF."
