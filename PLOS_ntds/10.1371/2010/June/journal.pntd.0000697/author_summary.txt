The encystation process is crucial for survival and transmission of Giardia lamblia to new hosts. During this process, vesicular trafficking and the cytoskeleton play important roles. In eukaryotic cells, intracellular transport is regulated by proteins, including Rab-GTPases and SNAREs, which regulate vesicle formation along with recognition of and binding to the target membrane. Cytoskeletal structures are also involved in these processes. In this study, we demonstrate the participation of Rab11 in the transport of encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs). Additionally, we demonstrate that disruption of actin microfilaments affects ESVs transport. The modification of actin dynamics was also correlated with a reduction in rab11 and cwp1 expression. Furthermore, down-regulation of rab11 mRNA by a specific hammerhead ribozyme caused nonspecific localization of CWP1. We thus provide new information about the molecular machinery that regulates Giardia lamblia encystation. Given our findings, Rab11 and actin may be useful targets to block Giardia encystation.
