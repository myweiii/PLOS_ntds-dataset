Sleeping sickness is a neglected disease with an important impact on public health of many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is transmitted by tsetse fly bites (the vector) and mainly affects remote and rural populations. The chronic form, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, includes almost 90% of reported cases, and it is often misdiagnosed or lately detected after months or years of infection. Many efforts have been carried out to control the disease and interesting advances have been achieved. Although elimination is considered possible, there is an urgent need to understand the disease dynamic, especially in foci with very low rate (or absent) of infection for a long time. We performed a parasite screening in tsetse flies and livestock from Luba focus (Equatorial Guinea), considered to be “controlled” since 1995 (no human cases for fifteen years). The obtained results demonstrate that T. b. gambiense still remains in the environment and entomological data reveal high population density of the vector in some localities. This finding suggests that other intervention ways focused on control of vector populations, combined with the detection of human cases, could be necessary to achieve the total elimination of the parasite in hypoendemic foci.
