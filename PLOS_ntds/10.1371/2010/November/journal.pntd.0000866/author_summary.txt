The continued spread, morbidity and mortality of human leishmaniasis together with the emergence of drug-resistant variants, the failure of epidemiological control based on dog culling and insecticide vector control and the chemotherapy toxicity have spurred attempts to develop an effective vaccine. Leishmaniasis affects 12 million people and another 350 million live under risk worldwide. We developed the first licensed second generation vaccine against leishmaniasis, a canine vaccine that has already reduced the incidence of the human and canine disease in endemic areas. Its main component is the Nucleoside hydrolase of Leishmania donovani (NH36) which in its recombinant and DNA formulation is cross protective against agents of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL). For this work we generated three recombinant peptides covering the NH36 sequence and identified the C-domain of the Nucleoside hydrolase as being responsible for its immunogenicity and vaccine-induced protective efficacy against VL and also for the reduction of lesion size and parasite load against TL. Since all Leishmanias species share high identity in their Nucleoside hydrolases amino acid sequences, our study represents a major step forward in the development of a bivalent synthetic vaccine against leishmaniasis and a potential future multivalent vaccine against pathogens that are dependent on NHs for replication.
