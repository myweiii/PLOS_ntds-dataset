Trypanosoma cruzi, an obligate intracellular protozoan, is the etiological agent of Chagas Disease that represents an important public health burden in Latin America. The infection with this parasite can lead to severe complications in cardiac, liver and gastrointestinal tissue depending on the strain of parasite and host genetics. Recently, we reported a fatal liver injury in T. cruzi infected B6 mice. However, the local immune response against this parasite is poorly understood. This work highlights some of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in liver pathology during the acute phase of infection. Using two mouse strains with different genetic backgrounds and responses to infection, B6 and BALB/c, we found that infected B6 mice develop a strong pro-inflammatory environment associated with high TLR9 expression. Conversely, infected BALB/c mice showed a more balanced inflammatory response in liver. Moreover, higher TLR2 and TLR4 expression were found only in hepatocytes from BALB/c. These data emphasize the importance of an adequate integration of signalling between immune and non-immune cells to define the outcome of infection. In addition, the pre-treatment with TLR2-agonist reverts the strong pro-inflammatory environment in T. cruzi infected B6 mice. These results could be useful in the understanding and design of novel immune strategies in controlling liver pathologies.
