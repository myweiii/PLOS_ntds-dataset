Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of enormous public health importance, infecting over 200 million people worldwide, of which the large majority live in sub-Saharan Africa. Control programmes based on the mass treatment of individuals in infected areas with the drug praziquantel have been shown to be successful in reducing the parasite burden and likelihood of developing morbidity in those individuals who receive treatment. Using data from an ongoing intestinal schistosomiasis control programme in Uganda and through the application of a mathematical model, we show that an additional benefit of mass treatment is a decrease in parasite acquisition, via a reduction in the number of transmission stages in the environment. This leads to a lower rate of infection and reinfection of individuals in those areas. We show that this result is valid in areas of differing average infection intensity. The importance of this finding is that this will benefit untreated as well as treated individuals, and will allow a fuller estimation of the benefits of schistosomiasis control programmes.
