Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes transmit numerous diseases that affect humans and other animals. In many parts of the tropics they transmit Bancroftian lymphatic filariasis caused by the filarial nematode Wuchereria bancrofti. However, in parts of South Asia where Brugian lymphatic filariasis caused by Brugia spp. is endemic, this group of mosquitoes is present but does not play a role in transmission. The differential susceptibility of Cx. p. pipiens mosquitoes for Wuchereria but not Brugia species occurs as a result of the mosquito midgut environment. W. bancrofti larvae ingested with a bloodmeal can penetrate the Culex midgut, however Brugia larvae ingested by Cx. p. pipiens are unable to penetrate the midgut epithelium and die within the lumen. These observations suggest that toxic factor(s) exist within the lumen of the Cx. p. pipiens midgut that physically and lethally damage Brugia parasites. Understanding natural mechanisms of resistance to parasites in arthropod vectors is critical if we are to gain a complete understanding of the transmission dynamics and epidemiology of LF and other vector-borne diseases.
