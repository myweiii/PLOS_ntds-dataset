Dengue fever and the more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are mosquito borne viral infections that have seen a major increase in terms of global distribution and total case numbers over the last few decades. There are currently four antigenically distinct and potentially co-circulating dengue serotypes and each serotype shows substantial genetic diversity, organised into phylogenetically distinct genotypes or lineages. While there is some evidence for positive selection, the evolutionary dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) is supposed to be mostly dominated by purifying selection due to the constraints imposed by its two-host life-cycle. Motivated by a recent genotype replacement event whereby the resident American/Asian lineage of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) had been displaced by the fitter Asian-1 lineage we investigated some of the epidemiological factors that might determine the success and invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype. Our results show that although small differences in viral fitness can explain the rapid expansion and fixation of novel genotypes, their fate is ultimately determined by the epidemiological landscape in which they arise.
