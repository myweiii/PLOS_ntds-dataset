Trypanosoma cruzi the aetiological agent of Chagas disease infects over 8 million people in Latin America. Currently, six genetic groups or DTUs have been identified in this highly genetic and diverse parasite. Many authors have considered that disease installation is induced by this genetic variability in T. cruzi but few comparisons have been made to make an approach of this premise. We performed an analysis including 240 chronic ascertained Chagasic patients evaluating cardiac alterations in electrocardiogram, radiology and echocardiogram. Also, we developed molecular characterisation on samples from these patients showing that in Colombia T.cruzi I is the predominant but others such as TcII, TcIII and TcIV can be found in low proportions as mixed infections TcI/TcII-TcIV. We conclude that TcI is more related to cardiomyopathy than TcII and we show the first report of TcIII and IV in chronic Chagasic patients from Colombia. These results will help to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of T. cruzi in this country.
