Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis). This parasitic infection can cause severe damage to the liver, lungs, and other human or animal organs, which can be fatal if left untreated. The 10-year mortality rate for patients with untreated or improperly treated AE is greater than 90%. Therefore, AE is also called as "worm cancer". Benzimidazoles, including the first-line drug ABZ, are considered the only effective drug against AE. However, ABZ has a low and erratic oral bioavailability due to its low solubility,which has partially led to unsatisfactory clinical efficacy of this oral drug.
In this study, albendazole bile acid derivatives were prepared to improve the anti-Echinococcus multilocularis effect. The synergistic effect of steric hindrance and transmembrane transport increased the equilibrium solubility of ABZ-BA in vitro by nearly 4-fold and the bioavailability in vivo by about 90-fold. The in vivo study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic behavior of the ABZ-BA was superior to that of Albenda. In the pharmacodynamics study, it was also found that the ABZ-BA group had a significant therapeutic effect after 1 month of oral administration. This albendazole bile acid derivative provides an effective and translatable novel approach to oral drug therapy for chronic, fatal, and neglected parasitic infectious alveolar echinococcosis.
