    "Background": "Repeated intranasal exposure to Acanthamoeba has been revealed to induce allergic airway inflammatory responses in mice. Based on the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, TLRs form a link between innate and adaptive immune responses, and play an important role in the activation of various cells in the innate immune system.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "To determine the TLRs that are related to these immune responses, we assessed the expression levels of inflammation-related genes in mouse lung epithelial (MLE)-12 cells treated with excretory-secretory proteins (ES-P) of the Acanthamoeba strain (KA/E2) with or without the TLR antagonists. The expression levels of inflammation-related genes, such as eotaxin, TARC, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and TSLP, in the TLR2 and TLR9 antagonist treatment groups were decreased, compared to those in the ES-P alone or other TLR antagonist treatment groups. In particular, a greater decrease in the relevant gene expression levels was found in the TLR2 antagonist treatment group than in the TLR9 antagonist treatment group. Allergic airway inflammation was evaluated in the wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) groups following KA/E2 exposure. Based on the results, allergic airway inflammatory responses (airway resistance value, inflammatory cell infiltration, Th2-related cytokine expression, mucin production, and metaplasia of lung epithelial cells and goblet cells) by KA/E2 were reduced in the TLR2 KO groups. In addition, TLR2 knockout BMDCs displayed lower activation of surface markers owing to ES-P stimulation than normal BMDCs, and KA/E2 ES-P–treated TLR2-depleted BMDCs produced fewer Th2 cytokine-expressing cells from naïve T cells than WT BMDCs. When ES-P was administered after primary lung cells were obtained from WT and TLR2 KO mice, the expression levels of inflammation-related genes were found to be significantly decreased in TLR2 KO cells compared to those in WT cells.",
    "Conclusions": "These results suggest that TLR2 is involved in lung inflammatory response activation in KA/E2 intranasal infection, especially in airway tissue."
