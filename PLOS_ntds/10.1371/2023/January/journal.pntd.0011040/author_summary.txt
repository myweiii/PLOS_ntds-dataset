This study established that inflammatory monocytes contribute to the visceralization of L. donovani parasites in the malnourished host. We found that the prostaglandin E2 produced during the first 72 hours of infection amplified the parasite burden at the site of skin infection and induced a high expression of CCR7 receptor in inflammatory monocytes. CCR7-bearing inflammatory monocytes carried L. donovani parasites via enhanced migration from the skin infection site to the viscera of malnourished mice. This dissemination of Leishmania parasites was abrogated in CCR7 deficient inflammatory monocytes and in mice treated with a prostaglandin E synthase inhibitor. We conclude that PGE2 contributes to monocyte-mediated parasite dissemination through the expression of CCR7 and its ligands in malnourished mice.
