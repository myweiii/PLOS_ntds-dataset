    "Abstract": "Harris County, TX, is the third most populous county in the USA and upon detection of arboviruses Harris County Public Health applies insecticides (e.g., pyrethroid-based Permanone 31\u201366) against adults of Culex quinquefasciatus to prevent disease transmission. Populations of Aedes aegypti, while not yet a target of public health control, are likely affected by pyrethroid exposure. As this species is a vector of emerging arboviruses, its resistance status to Permanone and the kdr mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) associated with pyrethroid resistance were investigated. We examined females of known genotype at the V1016I and F1534C sites (N = 716) for their genotype at the 410 amino acid position in the VGSC, and for the influence of their kdr genotype on survival to Permanone at three different distances from the insecticide source in field tests. Most females (81.8%) had at least one resistant L allele at the 410 position, being the first report of the V410L mutation in Ae. aegypti for Texas. When only genotypes at the 410 position were analyzed, the LL genotype exhibited higher survivorship than VL or VV. Out of 27 possible tri-locus kdr genotypes only 23 were found. Analyses of the probability of survival of tri-locus genotypes and for the V410L genotype using a multivariate logistic regression model including area, distance, and genotype found significant interactions between distance and genotype. When only the most common tri-locus genotypes were analyzed (LL/II/CC, 48.2%; VL/II/CC, 19.1%; and VV/II/CC, 10.1%) genotype had no effect on survival, but significant interactions of distance and genotype were found. This indicated that the V410L kdr allele increased survival probability at certain distances. Genotypes did not differ in survivorship at 7.62-m, but LL/II/CC had higher survivorship than VL/II/CC at 15.24- and 22.86-m. The model also identified differences in survivorship among the operational areas investigated."
