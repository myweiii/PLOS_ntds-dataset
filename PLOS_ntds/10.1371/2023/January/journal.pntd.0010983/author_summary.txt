There is poor documentation and awareness of the clinical characteristics and significance of Tropidolaemus species bite in Malaysia. This study analysed RECS consultation data from 2015â€“2021 regarding Tropidolaemus species bite cases in Malaysia. By analysing the RECS consultation log, the frequency, geographical distribution, clinical features, clinical management and outcomes of verified Tropidolaemus species bite were documented. The significance of this study is to provide verified and reliable information regarding the clinical characteristics, significance and clinical burden of Tropidolaemus species bite cases.
