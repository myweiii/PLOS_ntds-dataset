Food-producing animals are the major reservoirs for many food-borne pathogens. Milk and meat and their products are important reservoirs for many of the food-borne pathogens. Among food-borne diseases associated with consumption of milk and beef is E. coli O157:H7. On the other hand, the increasing emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant E. coli O157:H7 has become a significant concern globally. Prompt and precise identification of bacterial pathogens in food is critical for tracing bacterial pathogens within the food chain. A total of 384 samples were collected to estimate prevalence and identify associated factors of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 and to determine antibiotic resistance pattern of E. coli O157:H7 from foods of bovine origin in Dessie and Kombolcha towns. Overall prevalence rates of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were 54.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Multidrug resistance was observed among all isolates of E. coli O157:H7. The current study indicated that different foods of bovine origin in the study area were unsafe for human consumption. Hence, preventive measures are required to improve the wholesomeness and safety of foods of bovine origin.
