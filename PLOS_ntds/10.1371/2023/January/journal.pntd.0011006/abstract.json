    "Background": "Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei are both potential biological threat agents. Melioidosis caused by B. pseudomallei is endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, while glanders caused by B. mallei infections are rare. Here we studied the proteomes of different B. mallei and B. pseudomallei isolates to determine species specific characteristics.",
    "Methods": "The expressed proteins of 5 B. mallei and 6 B. pseudomallei strains were characterized using liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Subsequently, expression of potential resistance and virulence related characteristics were analyzed and compared.",
    "Results": "Proteome analysis can be used for the identification of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei. Both species were identified based on >60 discriminative peptides. Expression of proteins potentially involved in antimicrobial resistance, AmrAB–OprA, BpeAB–OprB, BpeEF–OprC, PenA as well as several other efflux pump related proteins and putative β-lactamases was demonstrated. Despite, the fact that efflux pump BpeAB–OprB was expressed in all isolates, no clear correlation with an antimicrobial phenotype and the efflux-pump could be established. Also consistent with the phenotypes, no amino acid mutations in PenA known to result in β-lactam resistance could be identified.",
    "Conclusions": "Analyzing the expressed proteomes revealed differences between B. mallei and B. pseudomallei but also between isolates from the same species. Proteome analysis can be used not only to identify B. mallei and B. pseudomallei but also to characterize the presence of important factors that putatively contribute to the pathogenesis of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei."
