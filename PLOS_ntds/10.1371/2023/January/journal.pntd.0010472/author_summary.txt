EED or environmental enteropathy results in poor gut health and suboptimal child growth, and is considered to play a major role on childhood stunting in the tropics. Growth faltering due to decreased nutrient absorption as a result of alteration of small intestinal histological structure manifested as blunting or atrophy of intestinal villi, hyperplasia or elongation of crypts and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, has been demonstrated as the basic characteristics of EED. The traditional gold standard for the diagnosis of EED is intestinal biopsy and assessment of the histomorphological alterations. There is lack of information on the histological characteristics of the intestinal mucosa in Bangladeshi children. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the intestinal histological characteristics of stunted children aged between 12â€“18 months with possible EED. 110 children with chronic malnutrition who underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy were selected for this study and the biopsy specimens were studied for histopathology. Villous height and crypt depth were measured and the presence and intensity of inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina propria was investigated. More than 90% children irrespective of nutritional status were diagnosed to have chronic non-specific duodenitis. Half of the children from both groups had villous atrophy as well as crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration was present in more than 90% children, irrespective of groups. However, no statistically significant difference was observed when compared between the groups.
