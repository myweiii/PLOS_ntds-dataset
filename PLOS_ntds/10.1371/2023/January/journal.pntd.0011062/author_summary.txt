Clonorchis sinensis is one of the most prevalent and harmful food-borne parasitic diseases in Asian countries and is closely associated with cholangitis, cholecystitis, biliary fibrosis and cholangiocarcinoma. However, the pathogenesis of biliary fibrosis caused by C.sinensis has not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, we established a liver fibrosis model using TLR2-deficient mice and TLR2-normal mice to investigate the role and regulatory pathways of TLR2 in regulating biliary fibrosis induced by C. sinensis. A new role of TLR2 in aggravating C. sinensis-induced parasitic liver fibrosis was identified. C. sinensis ESPs activated TLR2-mediated AKT and p38 pathways to increase the production of IL-6 in mouse BECs in vitro. This result supported the finding that TLR2 triggered TGF-Î²1/Smad2/3 via promoting the production of IL-6 played crucial roles in activating myofibroblasts, which exacerbated liver fibrosis caused by C. sinensis. This study provides a useful mouse model to study the potential mechanisms of parasite-induced liver fibrosis, and explores the role of TLR2 deficiency in liver fibrosis, providing important reference information for understanding liver fibrosis caused by C. sinensis.
