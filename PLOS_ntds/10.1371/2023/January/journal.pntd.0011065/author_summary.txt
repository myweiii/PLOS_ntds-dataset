La Crosse virus (LACV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that can cause neuroinvasive disease (e.g., encephalitis and meningitis), usually in children. In the 1990s, the geographic focus of reported LACV neuroinvasive disease (LACV-ND) shifted from the Midwest into the Appalachian region, and most cases have been reported from a few areas in those regions since then. Here, we used publicly available human disease data to investigate changes in geographic clusters of LACV-ND from 2003â€“2021 and to identify socioeconomic and demographic variables that are associated with disease risk. We found a consistent distribution of areas with elevated disease risk (i.e., clusters), with three persistent clusters in Appalachia and one intermittent cluster in the upper Midwest. In states with persistent clusters, county-level cumulative incidence increased when more of the population was white and when median household income was lower. Public health officials should work to reduce LACV-ND incidence in the areas where disease risk is consistently high.
