Clonorchis sinensis inhabits the bile ducts of mammals, and clonorchiasis is a major public health concern in numerous countries. Infection with Clonorchis sinensis is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. It is unknown whether it changes the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients or contributes to this diseaseâ€™s development. The hepatitis B virus is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, hepatitis B infection is prevalent in many endemic places for clonorchiasis, although the potential interaction between the two diseases has gotten little attention. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of Clonorchis sinensis infection and Clonorchis sinensis combined with HBV infection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy. Our results indicate that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma combined with Clonorchis sinensis infection have a worse prognosis after hepatectomy with or without HBV infection, providing evidence for future studies on the adverse effects of the interaction between the two on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
