Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by M. leprae bacteria. Generally, this disease infects the skin and peripheral nerves. Most of the leprosy cases treatment is delayed, which causes nerve impairment and permanent disability. Sensory ulnar nerve impairment is the most common disability found in leprosy. Earliest signs that could be observed are paresthesia or anesthesia and unable to perceive other sensations. Permanent disability in leprosy cases usually leads to negative stigma and isolation of the patients. Thus, the treatment for nerve impairment has been one of the WHO global leprosy strategy. Adipose tissue were known as source of stem cells and could be processed to be used as a injected treatment, in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). These cells could develop into many kinds of cells, including nerve cells, while also repairing the impaired cells. However, currently there are no available studies on SVF treatment for nerve impairment caused by leprosy. Therefore, this preliminary study aims to determine whether SVF cells of leprosy patients could be used as treatment for nerve impairment caused by leprosy. We report 4 post leprosy patients who underwent SVF injection intradermally on their ulnar area of the hand, with promising results.
