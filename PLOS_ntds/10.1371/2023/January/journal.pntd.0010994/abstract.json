    "Background": "Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) contains a heterogeneous population of mononuclear cells, progenitor cells and about 1â€“10% are mesenchymal stromal cells. These cells are an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine for peripheral neuropathy. Leprosy is a disabling disorder with neuropathy, usually with consequences of permanent disability of the extremities. We conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the cell yield, its characteristics and clinical outcomes after SVF injections in four leprosy patients.",
    "Methods": "Four post leprosy patients were recruited and evaluated for sensory testing (warm detection, cold detection, vibration, pain and sensation) on the ulnar area of the hand. Liposuction was done and adipose tissue was processed into SVF with a closed system and injected to the ulnar area of the hand at the dorsal and palmar side. Evaluation of sensory testing was done after 3 days, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months following SVF injection. SVF was also characterized using flow cytometry, cell counting, sterility and presence of mycobacteria.",
    "Results": "The results showed that leprosy patients had a low count of mesenchymal cells and a high amount of CD34/CD45 positive cells. One patient was positive for mycobacteria from his adipose tissue and SVF. Sensory examination after SVF injection showed an improvement in temperature and pain sensation in the palmar and superficial branch. Meanwhile, touch sensation improved on the dorsal branch, and there was no improvement for vibration in all patients.",
    "Conclusions": "The results showed that SVF had a potential to improve sensory loss in leprosy patients."
