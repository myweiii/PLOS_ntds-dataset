The Leishmania infantum is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most lethal form of the disease in humans. In the domestic environment, dogs are the primary reservoir of this parasite; the infection may present as slimming, extensive skin lesions, excessive nail growth, and others. Treatments for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) are ineffective because treated dogs often re-develop signs and symptoms when the medication is stopped. However, the immune response determines the presentation and cellular immune responses are most effective for parasite replication control. Resistance depends on the inflammatory or microbicidal activity of cytokines. Nevertheless, the suppression of this immune response is evident during CanL and is related to many factors. Recent reports of dogs with CanL found increased small RNAs called microRNAs (miR) that regulate cell function and might be associated with the immune regulation observed during this disease. Therefore, we inhibited and increased levels of a specific miR (miR-148a) in vitro in cells of dogs (Leishmania-infected/sick and uninfected/heathy) and measured immunological markers. We observed a reduction of some essential inflammatory cytokines when the miR was increased and parasite number reduction when the miR was inhibited. These results suggest that this miR influences immunological responses in dogs with CanL related to disease progression. The findings contribute to the understanding of immunological aspects of CanL, facilitating the development of immunotherapeutic approaches.
