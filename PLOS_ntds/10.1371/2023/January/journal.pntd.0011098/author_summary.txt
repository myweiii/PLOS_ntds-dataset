Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV) is becoming endemic in regions previously unreported, including large areas of Europe and Asia. TBEV was also isolated in the UK in 2019, highlighting its potential as a concern to public health. TBEV is spread by ticks and causes severe and often fatal tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). No effective anti-TBEV therapeutics are available. TBEV circulates as three major subtypes that cause disease of varying severity. The reasons for the disparity in disease outcome are largely unknown. TBEV subtypes show high levels of nucleotide conservation at the 5′ non-coding (NC) region that folds to form a Y-shaped stem-loop A (SLA), which is conserved for all flaviviruses. Herein, we describe the identification of stem-loop regions in the SLA that are required for RNA replication and virus infectivity in cell culture, but do not influence viral translation. The observed virus attenuation suggested that the 5′ SLA likely serves as an essential regulatory element for binding to host factors that support viral replication and pathogenicity. These data highlight the complex interactions within specific TBE viral RNA conformations and reveal new targets for the development of much needed anti-TBEV therapeutics.
