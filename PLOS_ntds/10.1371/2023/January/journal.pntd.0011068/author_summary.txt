Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CME), a severe infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans. The high mortality and morbidity rates of this disease in immunosuppressed and HIV+/AIDS-infected individuals necessitate a reliable model for understanding the mechanisms and manifestations of cryptococcosis infection in the CNS. This study presents a mouse model of infection that utilizes a stereotaxic surgical setup to provide a comparative analysis of C. neoformans infection in the brain. Though not typical of infection in humans, this method provides a controlled experimental system to observe the progression of C. neoformans infection in specific regions of the brain. Additionally, this study characterizes murine manifestations of the disease, including GXM deposition in brain tissue and blood vessels, and documents the role of microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, in engulfing fungal cells. Depending on the region of the brain infected, distinct disease pathology can be observed with this model, expanding our understanding of cryptococcosis progression in the CNS. The importance of this work extends to the clinical setting, where many questions regarding cerebral cryptococcosis remain unresolved. Utilization of this model to further understand the mechanisms of this pathogen will provide means to develop new therapies to combat infection in humans.
