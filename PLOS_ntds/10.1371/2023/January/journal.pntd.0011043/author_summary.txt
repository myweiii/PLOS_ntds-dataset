Mapping of schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) is a critical step in understanding where at-risk populations live so as to plan and target available resources in order to achieve maximum impact on disease burden. While there has been progress in mapping of SCH across the world, the current mapping design for SCH is limited in addressing the focal nature of SCH in implementation units. As part of the Breaking Transmission Strategy (BTS) developed by the Kenyan Ministry of Health that focuses on elimination of neglected diseases including SCH and STH, an evaluation was conducted to identify the SCH and STH at-risk population to better target control using a precision mapping approach. The findings from this evaluation provided a comprehensive delineation of the distribution and prevalence of SCH and STH that informed the rollout of community-based mass drug administration for control of SCH and STH at the Kenyan coast.
