Kinetoplastid parasites cause severe infections in humans including African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which are classified as neglected tropical diseases. With the advancement of sequencing technologies, more and more genome sequences are being generated and deposited in archival repositories. TriTrypDB (https://tritrypdb.org), a component database of the VEuPathDB resource (https://veupathdb.org) is a free data mining resource, which currently hosts a subset of these parasite genomes that are of clinical and scientific importance. TriTrypDB also integrates functional genome-scale datasets (e.g. transcript expression, protein expression, genetic variation data) and information predicted from automated bioinformatics pipelines and from manual curation. TriTrypDB provides a user-friendly web interface and a number of tools and functions for users to conduct in silico experiments to ask questions and generate hypotheses. Researchers can also contribute their expertise via the User Comments form and Apollo annotation platform, and utilize our cloud-based workspace to analyze their own data. TriTrypDB has been extensively used by the research community over the last decade and serves as a primary resource for communities working with these organisms.
