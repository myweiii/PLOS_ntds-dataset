Chagas disease- caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomine insects- poses a serious threat to human and dog health, as infection may go undetected and cause heart disease. Systemic insecticide treatment of dogs is one proposed One Health intervention to reduce T. cruzi transmission for both dogs and humans, given that dogs are parasite reservoirs. Fluralaner, a systemic insecticide commonly administered to dogs to prevent ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks, induces mortality of triatomines in laboratory settings. We investigated the efficacy of different fluralaner treatment regimens in three endemic peridomestic transmission environments (high, medium, and low) for lowering triatomine density, T. cruzi infection prevalence, and incidence among dogs using mathematical models. Our simulations suggest that fluralaner treatment is an effective method of reducing T. cruzi transmission to dogs, and the ideal frequency to treat dogs with fluralaner depends on the transmission environment. Given the intervention may increase the abundance of dead vectors in the dogâ€™s environment, empirical data are needed on the duration of parasite viability within dead vectors and frequency of canine consumption of dead vectors for a more comprehensive evaluation of the intervention.
