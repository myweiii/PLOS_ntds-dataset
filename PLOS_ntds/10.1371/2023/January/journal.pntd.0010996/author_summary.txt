Our previous studies on the prevalence of leishmanial infections in wild caught rodents suggested that they represent potential reservoirs of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis in northeast Brazil, supported by showing that laboratory bred rodents that were experimentally infected with L. (V.) braziliensis were infectious to Lutzomyia longipalpis. The present field study reports the abundance of rodent species in different ecotopes, the prevalence of Leishmania infections in a cohort of naturally infected rodent species and the transmission potential of the most abundant species by xenodiagnoses using the primary vector, Nyssomyia whitmani. The results incriminate the local guild of rodents as a collective wildlife reservoir in the zoonotic transmission cycle of L. (V.) braziliensis. The greatest infection risk to rodents, and likely also to humans, is in peri domestic plantations, where N. squamipes, Ne. lasiurus and R. rattus, in particular, occur at high densities; the former species supported the highest infection prevalences and were infectious for extended periods. R. rattus was the only species captured supporting infections in and around households in addition to the other habitats. More than 20% of rodents captured at least twice moved between habitat types. There was a qualitative but not quantitative relationship between L. (V.) braziliensis parasite loads in rodent blood samples and xenopositive sand flies.
