    "Background": "The immunopathogenesis of dengue virus (DENV) infection remains incompletely understood. To increase our understanding of inflammatory response in non-severe dengue, we assessed longitudinal changes in the inflammatory proteome in patients with an acute DENV infection.",
    "Methods": "Using a multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA), we measured relative levels of 368 inflammatory markers in plasma samples from hospitalized patients with non-severe DENV infection in the acute (n = 43) and convalescence (n = 35) phase of the infection and samples of healthy controls (n = 10).",
    "Results": "We identified 203 upregulated and 39 downregulated proteins in acute versus convalescent plasma samples. The upregulated proteins had a strong representation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible effector proteins, cytokines (e.g. IL-10, IL-33) and cytokine receptors, chemokines, pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. granzymes) and endothelial markers. A number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) have not been reported in previous studies. Functional network analysis highlighted a central role for IFNÎ³, IL-10, IL-33 and chemokines. We identified different novel associations between inflammatory proteins and circulating concentrations of the endothelial glycocalyx disruption surrogate marker syndecan-1."
