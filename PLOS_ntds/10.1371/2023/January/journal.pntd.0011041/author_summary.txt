Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common arboviral infection worldwide. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis of dengue, including the changes that occur in the immune and inflammatory responses. In this present study, we used a multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) from Olink Proteomics AB to assess levels of 368 inflammation-related proteins in plasma samples from the acute and convalescence phase of the infection in hospitalized adult patients with non-severe dengue. We show a pronounced increase in interferon (IFN) and IFN-related antiviral proteins, a selection of cytokines and cytokine receptors, members of the CCL and CXCL chemokine family, pro-apoptotic proteins and proteins involved in endothelial integrity in the acute phase of the illness. In addition, we found a large number of significant associations between these proteins and concentrations of the endothelial glycocalyx degradation marker syndecan-1. In summary, our proteome analysis provides a comprehensive insight in longitudinal changes in inflammation-related proteins in non-severe dengue and the association with endothelial glycocalyx perturbation.
