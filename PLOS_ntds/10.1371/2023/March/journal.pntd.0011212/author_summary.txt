Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous or implantation mycosis with hyperendemic levels of zoonotic transmission in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The involvement of the nasal mucosa is uncommon and may occur in isolated or disseminated forms of sporotrichosis, but the number of cases has been increasing. We analyzed 37 cases of sporotrichosis with involvement of the nasal mucosa treated at a reference center for infectious diseases. There was a predominance of males, students and retirees, residents in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, and infected by cats. The median age was 38 years. Disseminated forms of sporotrichosis predominated over isolated involvement of the nasal mucosa. The number of patients with HIV infection also caught our attention. The main characteristics of the nasal mucosa lesions were the presence/elimination of crusts, with an involvement of various structures. Most cases were treated with a combination of antifungal agents and were cured, and two deaths were observed. Immunosuppression directly influenced the prognosis of cure of nasal mucosa sporotrichosis.
