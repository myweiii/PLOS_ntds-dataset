Single-cell eukaryotes in the intestinal microbiota are increasingly gaining attention for their ability to influence microbiota composition. Blastocystis sp. is no exception. This study for the first time demonstrates gut microbiota alteration due to the colonization of Blastocystis sp. ST 3 in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions. Colonization of Blastocystis sp. ST3, regardless of symptoms, significantly alters the diversity and microbiota composition. The abundance of Prevotella sp. was significantly elevated in symptomatic Blastocystis sp. carriage. Inferred metagenomic findings revealed that predicted metabolic functions were altered in Blastocystis sp. carriage in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions. The current study demonstrates a bidirectional influence that seems to be crucial in Blastocystis sp.â€“microbiota interaction. Altering the accompanying microbiota of a symptomatic Blastocystis sp. with bacterial suspension from an asymptomatic condition resulted in the protozoan exhibiting asymptomatic characteristics. This implies, for the first time the effect of accompanying microbiota on Blastocystis sp. phenotypic characteristics. The findings lead to a postulation that a harmless protozoan parasite can be turned harmful by its accompanying microbiota in the gut.
