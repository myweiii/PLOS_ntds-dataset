    "Abstract": "Whilst the influence of intestinal microbiota has been shown in many diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, and aging, investigations are still scarce on its role in altering the nature of other infective organisms. Here we studied the association and interaction of Blastocystis sp. and human intestinal microbiota. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiome of Blastocystis sp.-free and Blastocystis sp. ST3-infected individuals who are symptomatic and asymptomatic. We tested if the expression of phenotype and pathogenic characteristics of Blastocystis sp. ST3 was influenced by the alteration of its accompanying microbiota. Blastocystis sp. ST3 infection alters bacterial composition. Its presence in asymptomatic individuals showed a significant effect on microbial richness compared to symptomatic ones. Inferred metagenomic findings suggest that colonization of Blastocystis sp. ST3 could contribute to the alteration of microbial functions. For the first time, we demonstrate the influence of bacteria on Blastocystis sp. pathogenicity. When Blastocystis sp. isolated from a symptomatic individual was co-cultured with bacterial suspension of Blastocystis sp. from an asymptomatic individual, the parasite demonstrated increased growth and reduced potential pathogenic expressions. This study also reveals that Blastocystis sp. infection could influence microbial functions without much effect on the microbiota diversity itself. Our results also demonstrate evidence on the influential role of gut microbiota in altering the characteristics of the parasite, which becomes the basis for the contradictory findings on the parasiteâ€™s pathogenic role seen across different studies. Our study provides evidence that asymptomatic Blastocystis sp. in a human gut can be triggered to show pathogenic characteristics when influenced by the intestinal microbiota."
