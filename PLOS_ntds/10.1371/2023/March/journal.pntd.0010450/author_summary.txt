Shigella spp. causes gastroenteritis and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Australia, largescale shigellosis outbreaks have been reported in First Nations communities and among men who have sex with men in recent years. We undertook an analysis of the trends in shigellosis cases in Australia over a 19-year period to understand the epidemiology of the disease, including which population groups were primarily impacted, and when and where cases were occurring. We also analysed trends in the diagnostic methods used to detect shigellosis over time, to determine whether changing detection methods had any impact on the surveillance of shigellosis cases at the national level. We found that notification rates of two species of Shigella, i.e. S. boydii and S. sonnei, significantly increased over the study period; the highest notification rate of shigellosis was in young children; and that First Nations Australians were disproportionately impacted by shigellosis. We also observed a shift in the testing methods used to diagnose shigellosis, with culture independent methods increasing from 2014. Our findings will assist in targeting prevention and control interventions to the most impacted groups and highlight the continued importance of culture dependant testing for national surveillance of shigellosis.
