    "Abstract": "Shigellosis is an increasing cause of gastroenteritis in Australia, with prolonged outbreaks reported in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter “First Nations”) communities and among men who have sex with men (MSM) in major cities. To determine associations between Shigella species and demographic and geographic factors, we used multivariate negative binomial regression to analyse national case notifications of shigellosis from 2001 to 2019."
