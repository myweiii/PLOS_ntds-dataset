This paper sampled individuals who experienced an AE during community-wide MDA (cMDA) with albendazole for soil-transmitted helminths in the DeWorm3 trial in India to understand their intention to participate in future cMDAs. This study utilized the theory of planned behaviour, which postulates that an individualâ€™s intention to change a behaviour depends on their attitude, perceived expectations of people around them (social norms), and their perceived behavioural control to adopt the behaviour (self-efficacy). This study indicated that positive attitude towards cMDA and their perceived behavioural control in cMDA participation positively influences their intention to participate in future cMDAs. Other factors associated with intention to participate in cMDA were caste, family structure, occupation, and participation in community sensitisation activities. In-depth interviews revealed that while many individuals participate in subsequent cMDAs after an AE because of the presumed health benefits of deworming, some are likely to refuse treatment due to fear of AEs, particularly fears of AEs among children. To increase participation rates in cMDA programs where AEs undoubtably do occur, targeted counselling of groups at risk of non-participation and assuring care and support during AEs may be important strategies to improve coverage.
