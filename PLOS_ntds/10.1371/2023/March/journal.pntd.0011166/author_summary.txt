Cholera is a major cause of diarrheal illness that can lead to severe dehydration and death within hours if left untreated. Kenya has experienced cholera outbreaks repeatedly in different parts of the country, including the refugee camps and informal settlements. To eliminate local transmission, a targeted approach to areas that are cholera prone is recommended. The findings of the hotspot mapping provide a better understanding of the smaller geographical areas in different parts of the country that have reported cholera outbreaks during the five years (2015â€“2019). The mapping also includes areas that have low access to improved water sources and improved sanitation facilities. The mapping findings documented here provide a rationale for prioritization of hotspots in the deployment of resource-intensive interventions, such as preventive vaccination campaigns and investment in water and sanitation infrastructure, that are key interventions to control cholera transmission.
