Cryptococcal meningitis is an infectious disease of global importance with high morbidity and mortality, especially among individuals with HIV/AIDS. While there have been improvements in the last two decades in the diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans, the methods presently employed are problematic for public hospitals in Brazil and other locations due to their extreme cost. In this study, we present a low-cost option for detection and identification of C. neoformans in noninvasive serum sample in immunosuppressed individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. A nested PCR (5.8SrDNA-ITS) associated with the latex agglutination test has high precision in detection of suspected Cryptococcus spp.
