As an obligate intracellular parasite, T. cruzi needs to gain access to the host cell cytosol, where replication and differentiation takes place. The process of invasion is mediated by the activation of different signaling pathways in the host. Activation of cAMP signaling has been implicated in invasion, with high intracellular levels of cAMP associated with an increase in invasion. In this regard, we have recently shown that Epac (Exchange protein activated by cAMP), and not PKA, mediates the effect of the cyclic nucleotide on parasite internalization. In this work, in order to shed some light into the detailed mechanism of invasion mediated by cAMP/Epac, we have explored the activation of downstream effectors of this pathway during host cell infection. Our results established that Rap1b, a known effector of Epac, and MEK/ERK, are downstream effectors of the pathway. In addition, we found a PKA-dependent inhibition of infection, presumably by phosphorylation of Rap1b, and potentially of Epac.
