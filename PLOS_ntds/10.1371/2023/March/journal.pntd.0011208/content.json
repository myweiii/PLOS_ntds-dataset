    "Introduction": "Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Krauss, 1848) is a freshwater planorbid gastropod widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, with populations also found in the Sahara and southwest Asia [1,2]. The impetus to undertake this study comes from the role this snail plays as the major intermediate host species for the human-infecting blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, the world\u2019s most common causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis [3].\nSchistosomiasis remains entrenched as one of the world\u2019s most prevalent and debilitating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), infecting over 200 million people, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa [4]. At a time when the world\u2019s attention has been understandably focused on emerging viruses, endemic neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis have continued to exact their usual, greater-than-appreciated toll on human health [5], aided by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which has disrupted or delayed ongoing efforts to treat infected individuals as part of control or elimination efforts [6].\nThroughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, the underlying conditions that have always favored the transmission of schistosomiasis remain prevalent. Poverty, associated with poor sanitation, use of surface waters from natural habitats for basic needs, and limited access to health services, continue to enable the transmission of schistosomiasis [7]. Although complex, the life cycle of schistosome parasites is inherently difficult to perturb. Sexually-reproducing and potentially long-lived adult worms exploit ubiquitous and mobile human hosts and diverse species of reservoir hosts. The asexually reproducing schistosome larval stages live in particular and abundant species of freshwater snails like B. pfeifferi, and release multitudes of free-swimming cercariae into the water that are remarkably effective in finding and penetrating the skin of human hosts. Aquatic habitats and the vector snails living in them lie at the heart of schistosomiasis transmission and as the world\u2019s demands for shrinking aquatic resources increase, there will be profound changes in store for snails and the schistosomes they host [8\u201310].\nApproximately 18 of the world\u2019s 34 species of Biomphalaria are known to be susceptible to S. mansoni infection [11]. In addition to B. pfeifferi, the related species B. glabrata is particularly noteworthy, not only because it serves as an important vector of S. mansoni in the Neotropics, but also because genome resources are available for it [12]. Additionally, B. straminea, for which a genome sequence has also recently been produced [13], plays a role in hosting S. mansoni in South America, and has proved to be invasive, having colonized southeast Asia where its role as a potential host for S. mansoni has become a concern [14,15]. A genome sequence for Bulinus truncatus, a related planorbid snail that hosts Schistosoma haematobium, the causative agent of urinary schistosomiasis, has also recently been provided [16].\nBiomphalaria pfeifferi is notable among Biomphalaria species for two reasons. Across its broad geographic range, individuals highly susceptible to S. mansoni infections are present, regardless of the geographic origin of the S. mansoni isolate being tested [17\u201320]. This may relate to the peculiar nature of its presumed origins from a trans-Atlantic Biomphalaria colonist, and its potential role as an ancestral host for S. mansoni as the latter arose in Africa [11,21]. Secondly, the population biology of B. pfeifferi is distinctive because, although capable of out-crossing, it is a strong preferential self-fertilizer [22,23]. This gives rise to natural populations comprised of mixtures of identifiable lineages derived from selfing that in aggregate are limited in genetic diversity relative to populations of outcrossing relatives. Different natural populations are also relatively divergent from one another. Their proclivity for selfing is generally explained as an adaptation for rapidly colonizing fast-changing freshwater environments, such as streams subject to repeated cycles of flooding and drying [23]. The colonization by one or a few lineages of B. pfeifferi of freshwater habitats on a large area of land reclaimed for agriculture as a result of construction of the Diama dam on the Senegal River contributed to an epidemic of S. mansoni occurring in the region thereafter [24]. Thus, the rarity of outcrossing in B. pfeifferi populations may also help explain the high susceptibility of at least some lineages of B. pfeifferi to potentially fast-evolving parasites like S. mansoni, but also to several additional trematode species, at least 19 of which are known to infect this snail [25].\nSchistosomiasis control efforts are still remarkably unidimensional and rely heavily on treatment of people with praziquantel both to improve individual health and to diminish transmission. The molluscan vectors of schistosomes have long been recognized as a much-needed alternative target for schistosomiasis control efforts, but efforts in this sphere have not proceeded past basic approaches such as the use of molluscicides, habitat modifications or introductions of potential snail predators or competitors [26]. To make any real headway in this endeavor, a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the underlying biology of the vector snails is needed, including of what lies within their genomes, and how the genetic resources of snails like B. pfeifferi might be exploited to achieve control.\nStudies of the transcriptomics responses of B. pfeifferi exposed to S. mansoni and molluscicides have been undertaken [27,28], but the genomic resources currently available for B. pfeifferi are surprisingly limited compared to some other schistosome snail vector species (Table 1). This is particularly noteworthy given the widespread involvement of B. pfeifferi in transmission of S. mansoni across its broad regions of endemicity in the Afrotropical region and southwest Asia.\nOur hope is additional genomic information for B. pfeifferi might be exploited by the scientific community in several ways, to better understand: 1) the nature and consequences of its peculiar population structure, and how it differs from other Biomphalaria species in this regard, and how we might manipulate it to our advantage; 2) how B. pfeifferi responds rapidly to environmental change and how it might respond to looming long-term environmental changes like warming climates or increased pollution; 3) how we might devise specific ways to disrupt snail reproduction or selectively kill schistosome-infected snails; 4) the symbiont community supported by B. pfeifferi, including potential snail pathogens or essential metabolic partners; 5) how we might alter or enhance the ability of B. pfeifferi to overcome its susceptibility to schistosome infection, such as by diminishing its attractiveness for schistosome infectious stages or by enhancing immune responsiveness; and 6) add to the growing database of molluscan genomics that will provide increasing general insights into the many unique features of the Phylum Mollusca.\nBelow we detail the results obtained from application of PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing technology to obtain a high quality and fully annotated genome for B. pfeifferi, one which has been interrogated for its representation of several gene families believed to be relevant to its role in serving as an intermediate host for S. mansoni. Furthermore, we provide comparisons where possible with other schistosome snail hosts for which genome information is available, as part of an ongoing process to develop more extensive genome resources that will aid in answering the many daunting questions, we have posed above.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThis project was undertaken with the approval of Kenya\u2019s National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (permit number NACOSTI/P/15/9609/4270), National Environment Management Authority (NEMA/AGR/46/2014), and snails were exported with the approval of the Kenya Wildlife Service permit numbers 0004754 and 0001680.\n\n\nB. pfeifferi snail sampling, breeding history\nIn 2017, B. pfeifferi specimens were collected along the vegetated margins of Kasabong Stream (-0.15190, 34.33550) and Asao Stream, Kenya (-0.31810, 35.00690). Snails were brought to the Center for Global Health Research, Kisian, Kenya, where they were checked for trematode parasites, and uninfected snails were pooled and used to establish a colony. Survivors were subsequently transported to and maintained at the University of New Mexico in 20 L plastic containers filled with 5 L of artificial spring water with high aeration using airstones. A Weco Wonder Shell was placed in snail tanks monthly for additional calcium. Snails were fed twice weekly with veggie sticks and snail growth sticks, AquaticBlendedFoods Super Freshwater Snail Mix #2. Plastic plants were added to the snail containers to allow the snails more surface area for egg laying. Algae were allowed to grow on the plastic sides of the snail tanks, and the water was changed every 1\u20132 months. Snails were maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle (25\u201327\u00b0C).\n\n\nB. pfeifferi snail extraction prep and whole genome sequencing\nOne B. pfeifferi (8 mm shell diameter) was crushed with shell in liquid nitrogen. The crushed snail was moved to a tube containing 5 ml of 30 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS (pre-dissolved in 50 ml of water). Proteinase K (50 \u03bcl, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added and the solution was placed in 55\u00b0C water bath for an hour. DNA was precipitated from the SDS solution with 2x ethanol. Precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 4500 x g and resuspended in 5 ml of QIAGEN G2 solution (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Another 50 \u03bcl of Proteinase K was added. Once the precipitated DNA was fully dissolved in G2 solution, a Qubit assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA) was used to measure DNA concentration and the sample was loaded onto a Qiagen genomic tip column and the Qiagen Genomic DNA Preparation protocol was followed. Once the DNA was eluted from the column it was precipitated with 2x ethanol. The precipitated DNA was resuspended and dissolved in 500 \u03bcl of Elution Buffer. The Qubit assay indicated a DNA yield of 33.8 ng/\u03bcl. Genomic DNA was sheared using the Diagenode Megaruptor 2 (DNA LINK, Inc., South Korea) and checked on an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) to determine the size of the sheared DNA. Once sheared, the sample was cleaned using 0.5x AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and resuspended in 90 \u03bcl of PacBio EB buffer. A Qubit assay then measured 140 ng/\u03bcl of DNA. DNA (10 \u03bcg) was used in PacBio\u2019s HiFi library preparation protocol (Procedure & Checklist\u2014Preparing SMRTbell Libraries for HiFi Long Read Sequencing on Sequel and Sequel II Systems (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA), Version 02 (May 2019)), then the sample was 1x AMPure cleaned, and 4 \u03bcg of DNA was loaded on the SageElf (ACCELA). The top 4 elution fractions from the SageElf were run on the Fragment Analyzer. The best fraction of DNA was from well 3. A final clean-up was applied with a 0.5x AMPure cleanup and eluted in 12 \u03bcl of EB buffer before proceeding to the binding and annealing step.\nThe prepared DNA sample was loaded in a PacBio Sequel II\u2013SMRT Cell instrument (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) for whole genome sequencing. HiFi reads centered at 15\u201320 kb were obtained after 30 hours of sequencing.\n\n\nB. pfeifferi genome size analysis\nMeasurement of nuclear DNA content (2C) was performed at Lifeasible, Shirley, NY (www.lifeasible.com). B. pfeifferi, B. glabrata BB02 and iM line were investigated. In each species or strain, 3 individual snails were used separately for the measurement. The garden plant hosta (Hosta plantaginea) (Praying Hands\u2019 2-2-2) was used as control DNA. The hosta DNA was calibrated using tomato Solanum lycopersicum, in which the seeds were collected from Ohio State University and the DNA content (2C) was determined to be 2.02 Gb [29,30]. After calibration, the amount of DNA (2C) of the hosta was 23.33 Gb. The reason we did not use tomato as the control is our preliminary study revealed that genome size of tomato is close to that of the snails, which will lead to overlap of the fluorescence signals between hosta and snail samples. Briefly, after removing shell and ovotestis from a live snail, somatic tissues were chopped using a double-edged razor blade and filtered with a 50 \u03bcm CellTrics filter (www.wolflabs.co.uk). After extraction and staining of nuclei, the measurement was conducted in a BD Accuri C6 cytometer (BD Biosciences), using 20-mW laser illumination at 488 NM, FL-2 585/40-nm bandpass filter. Tested snail DNA content = hosta DNA content x fluorescence intensity of the tested snail / fluorescence intensity of control hosta.\nGenome size estimations by K-mer analysis were performed using GenomeScope 2.0 [31], and K-mer plots were created using Merqury [32] with PacBio HiFi reads (for B. pfeifferi) and Illumina paired end reads (BB02) downloaded from NCBI sequence Read Archive (SRA) PRJNA12879 [12].\n\n\nB. pfeifferi genome assembly\nInitial genome assembly was performed on PacBio HiFi subreads using Hifiasm 0.16.1-r375 [33] with default settings. Genome assembly quality assessments were performed for initial and final genome assembly using assembly-stats v1.0.1 (https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/assembly-stats), Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog assessment tool BUSCO 4.1.4 [34], and QUAST v5.0.2 [35].\nThe genome assembly was cleaned and filtered based on supportive read depth, GC content, and sequence similarity search results using BLAST [36] and DIAMOND [37] and visualized using BlobTools v1.1.1 [38]. The assembled contig sequences were first split into 10 kb fragments, which were submitted as queries to search against NCBI non-redundant nucleic acid (NT) and protein databases (NR) [39] with corresponding options: for BLASTn against NT \u201c-max_target_seqs 20 -max_hsps 1 -evalue 1e-5 -perc_identity 60\u201d; for DIAMOND BLASTx to NR \u201c-f 100\u2014max-target-seqs 20\u2014masking 1\u2014tmpdir /tmp/\u2014evalue 1e-5\u2014salltitles -b 60.0\u201d. Taxonomy classification at phylum level, contig coverage, and GC content of contig sequences were collected and visualized in Blobplot. Contig sequences with top blast hit to Acidobacteria, Bacteria-undef, Bacteroidetes, Microsporidia, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Viruses-undef were filtered. Contigs with no BLAST hits or with Mollusca hits were kept. Contigs were sorted from longest to shortest and renamed in that order.\n\n\nB. pfeifferi genome annotation\nA typical eukaryote genome annotation workflow contains three stages: repeat masking, gene model prediction, and functional annotation (Fig 1). We started genome annotation with repetitive elements which are known to occupy more than 40% of snail genomes [12,16,40]. Repeat sequence models were built with a cleaned genome assembly using RepeatModeler 2.0.1 [41] in Dfam transposable elements TE Tools v1.2 [42]. Genes from large gene families could be mistakenly interpreted as repeats during the repeat modeling. Therefore, the predicted repeat models were searched against InterProScan database 5.45 [43], to retain models with either no domain or only retrotransposon domains and to exclude any other functional domains. Finally, the clean genome assembly was soft masked (repeats in lower-case letters) with clean repeat models using RepeatMasker 4.062 [44].\nThe workflow contains three stages (boxes): repeat-masking (green), gene model prediction (blue) and functional annotation (purple). The intermediate and final results were labeled in boxes with red frames. The analytical processes were marked out in black-colored text and bioinformatics tools marked in orange-colored text.\nGene models were predicted using EVidence Modeler 06/25/2012 [45], which incorporates weighted evidence from ab initio predictions, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, and sequence similarity-based searches against known transcript sequences.\nThe ab initio prediction evidence is comprised of core single copy orthologs identified using BUSCO customized HMM models built from tBLASTn [36] and AUGUSTUS predictions [46]. Evidence from spliced alignments of expressed transcript sequences was generated by mapping de novo assembled B. pfeifferi transcripts [27] to the cleaned masked genome assembly, using the \u201cProgram to Assemble Spliced Alignments\u201d (PASA) pipeline [47].\nRNA sequence evidence was generated from genome mapping of RNA-Seq data (NCBI PRJNA383396) from B. pfeifferi schistosome infection studies [27,28,48] using HISAT2 version 2.2.1 [49]. A total of 1,186,204 transcripts were obtained from the RNA-Seq study by Buddenborg et al., 2017 [27]. Transcripts sequences were cleaned up in the PASA pipeline, to obtain non-redundant coding transcripts using SeqClean and Transdecoder, and 158,095 clean sequences were generated. PASA utilized two alignment methods to align 158,095 clean transcripts to the B. pfeifferi genome. The mapping rates are 82.6% for BLAT (130518/158,095) and 83.0% for GMAP (131232/158,095). Raw RNA-Seq sequences were first downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using the prefetch program, then converted to FASTQ format using the fastq-dump program in SRA toolkit 2.9.6 (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software). Low quality sequences in FASTQ reads were filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.36 [50]. A sliding window of 4 bases was used to identify and remove the part of reads where average quality dropped below a score of 20. For samples recovered from snails infected with S. mansoni, schistosome sequences were filtered out by mapping cleaned RNA-Seq reads to Schistosoma mansoni Puerto Rico strain genome V7 PRJEA36577 obtained from WormBase Parasite (WormBase web site, http://www.wormbase.org, release WBPS15, date Mar. 20, 2021). Clean reads were mapped to the cleaned, repeats-masked B. pfeifferi genome assembly using HISAT2. The alignments of RNA-Seq reads and assembled transcripts were used as input for the BRAKER 2.1.1 annotation pipeline [51], in which GeneMarker-ET [52] was used to generate hints to train AUGUSTUS separately, then merged training as described in the BRAKER2 pipeline was followed.\nWith the evidence described above, EVidence Modeler was used to predict gene models. BRAKER2 evidence was given weight 10 and all other evidence weight 1 based on BUSCO reports of source evidence and results of different weights combinations. The predicted gene models were sorted, renamed based on contig order and gene start location. Transcript, coding and protein sequences were extracted using GffRead 0.9.12 [53] with options \u201c-V -H -B -w transcripts.fna -x cds.fna -y protein.faa -g../genome.fasta\u201d.\nFunctional annotation for predicted gene models was performed by sequence similarity searches. Extracted coding sequences and protein sequences were searched as queries against reference databases: 1) BLASTp to UniProt [54] database with minimum identity of 30%, minimum aligned length 10 aa, and max E value 10\u22125; 2) BLASTp to the NCBI non-redundant protein database (NR) with the same cut off as above; 3) BLASTn to the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (NT) with minimum identity of 60% and maximum E value 10\u22125; 4) conserved functional domain by InterProScan 5.45 [43]. Biomphalaria specific IgSF domains were predicted by a B. glabrata specific HMM model [55] with minimum length of 40 aa, and max E value of 0.00165.\n\n\nB. pfeifferi RNA prediction (tRNA, rRNA, microRNA, long-noncoding RNA)\nTransfer RNAs (tRNAs) were predicted using tRNAscan-SE 2.0.9 [56] with standard parameters. Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) were predicted using Barrnap 0.9 (https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap) with options \u201c\u2014kingdom euk\u2014threads 40\u201d.\nFor microRNAs (miRNAs), conserved RNA sequence similarity sharing sequence and/or structural similarities within the genome were identified. Sequence profiles containing covariance models (CMs) of known non-coding RNAs were downloaded from the Rfam database, and used as queries to search within the assembled genome using Infernal (INFERence of RNA ALignment) software [57], with options \u201ccmscan\u2014cpu 40\u2014rfam\u2014cut_ga\u2014nohmmonly\u2014tblout mrum-genome.tblout\u2014fmt 2\u2014clanin Rfam.clanin Rfam.cm\u201d. miRNA sequence similarity identified in the B. pfeifferi genome were extracted. Additionally, a highly automated pipeline with classified miRNA CMs, named mirMachine pipeline 0.2.11.2, was used to find miRNAs with the node set to Mollusca. The miRNAs predicted from the two methods were merged and duplicated records with overlapping location were removed. miRNAs in B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata were grouped using cd-hit-est 4.8.1 [58].\nThe annotation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was initiated by mapping known RNA-Seq reads to the clean B. pfeifferi genome assembly. The genome-guided transcriptome assembly was based on the RNA-Seq read-to-genome alignment using Trinity 2.8.5 [59]. Assembled transcripts were filtered, and only sequences longer than 200 nt (length in nucleotides) were kept. The sequence coding potential of each transcript sequence was checked by Coding Potential Calculator version 2 (CPC2) [60]. Possible coding protein sequences were further filtered by BLASTx search against the NCBI NR database with options \u201c-f 100\u2014max-target-seqs 20\u2014masking 1\u2014evalue 1e-5\u2014salltitles -b 60.0\u201d. Other ncRNAs were filtered based on hits to Rfam CMs using Infernal (INFERence of RNA ALignment) tools described above. Finally, clean RNA-Seq reads were mapped to transcripts, and only transcripts with transcripts per million (TPM) values between 3 and 2000 were kept.\n\n\nComparison of overall genomic structures of B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi\nTo facilitate a whole genome alignment, the cleaned contig sequences of the B. pfeifferi genome assembly were aligned to the B. glabrata iM line genome sequences using minimap2 program [61] with options \u201c-ax asm5\u2014eqx\u201d. Genomic differences, including syntenic path (longest set of co-linear regions), structural rearrangements (inversions, translocations, and duplications), local variations (SNPs, indels, CNVs etc) within syntenic and structural rearrangements, and un-aligned regions were predicted using the comprehensive tool SyRI [62] with suggested options \u201c-c out.sam -r refgenome -q qrygenome -k -F S\u201d. Visualization of structural variations (SV) were plotted using ggplot2 v3.1.0 [63] and ShinySyn [64] in the R environment [65].\n\n\nInferred linkage groups for B. pfeifferi derived from synteny comparisons with B. glabrata linkage groups\nUsing the whole genome alignment information generated above, the B. pfeifferi contigs that best matched to B. glabrata iM line with the largest non-redundant scaffold\u2019s coverage were identified. These best-matched B. pfeifferi contigs were sorted according to iM line and scaffolds per iM line\u2019s 18 linkage groups. Inferred linkage groups (18) were assigned to B. pfeifferi contigs according to their best matched iM line linkage group. Data transformations were processed using in house Linux scripts and R tidyverse package [66].\n\n\nSplit time estimation\nProtein sequences were obtained from NCBI for species with annotated genome assemblies: B. glabrata iM line (International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) genome ID JAKZJL000000000), Bu. truncatus (JAGDYQ000000000), and Elysia marginata (BMAT00000000). For out-group Radix auricularia (MUZC00000000), no annotated genes in NCBI were available, so the protein sequences for core Mollusca orthologs were predicted from the genome sequences using BUSCO.\nWith all protein sequences, orthologs were identified using OrthoFinder 2.5.4 [67], and a species tree was generated using algorithm Species Tree from All Genes (STAG) [68], with tolerance for few or no complete sets of one-to-one orthologs present in all species.\nThe timetree was inferred by applying the RelTime method [69,70] to the estimated species tree with branch lengths in MEGA X [71]. The split time of B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata was calculated based on one fixed calibration constraint on the time tree: the appearance of Bulinus in the fossil record at least 19\u201320 Mya [72].\n\n\nGene families of interest in the B. pfeifferi genome\nBased on the predicted gene models with InterProScan, UniProt, DeepTMHMM [73] in the B. pfeifferi genome, we further classified and analyzed a list of immune response-related gene families of interest, including fibrinogen-related domain-containing proteins (FReDs) [12,55,74\u201378], C-type lectin-related proteins (CREPs) [79,80], and galectin-related proteins (GREPs) [79], AIG (avrRpt2-induced gene) family of GTPases (AIGs) [81], biomphalysins [82,83], G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) [12] and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [12,84,85]. We also searched for chemosensory communication pheromones, including the four described in the Aplysia californica/brasiliana pheromonal complex, attractin, seductin, enticin, and temptin [86,87].\nBasic gene family classification was based on sequence similarity search using the BLASTn or BLASTp program mentioned above against NCBI database, and Uniprot databases with a minimum of 85% identify and coverage. Higher level gene family classification was based on conservative domain structures, e.g., fibrinogen-related proteins (FREP) containing immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and fibrinogen (FBG) domains [12,55]; AIGs/GIMAPs containing an AIG1 domain [73,81]; biomphalysins containing an aerolysin domain, and pore-forming transmembrane domains (TMDs) predicted with the PRED-TMBB server (PREDiction of TransMembrane Beta Barrels proteins) [88,89]; HSP70s were characterized by the conserved HSPA -nucleotide-binding domain (HSPA1-A, -B, -L, HSAP-2, -6, -7, -8), and similar proteins (cd10233) and nucleotide-binding domain of the sugar kinase/HSP70/actin superfamily (cd17037) [12]; C-type lectin-related proteins (CREP) containing C-type lectin/C-type lectin-like domains (CLECT domain) [80]; galectin-related proteins (GREP) containing galectin domains (GLECT domain) [80]; and conservative Ca2+ binding EGF-like domain, DSDXD in temptin [87,90].\n\n\nMaximum likelihood tree of B. pfeifferi FReDs\nFull-length protein sequences of all identified B. pfeifferi FReDs in this study were used to construct a maximum likelihood tree through IQ-TREE [91] with standard model selection followed by 1000 bootstrap replicates. The best substitution model was WAG+F+I+G4 chosen according to a minimal Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score using ModelFinder tool [92] in IQ-TREE.\n\n\nB. pfeifferi FReDs nomenclature\nA systematic nomenclature is presented in this study (Fig 2) for the B. pfeifferi fibrinogen-related domain-containing proteins (FReDs) family, one that complements and does not conflict with the nomenclature developed for the B. glabrata FReDs family. This is important because of the immunological role of FREPs (one of the core groups of FReDs) in host responses in B. glabrata to parasites [76,93,94], and because it is a complex gene family, with both familiar and new FReDs identified in B. pfeifferi.\nThe FReD family is an inclusive, more general group containing the following subgroups: 1) sFReDs, or single FBG FReDs (containing FBG domain only); 2) FREPs, with 1 or 2 IgSF(s) joined via an interceding region (ICR) to a single FBG domain; and 3) FReMs (consisting of an epidermal growth factor domain (EGF) and a FBG domain. FREPs are therefore a sub-category within the FReD family. The domain structures for three main classes of known FReDs (green for sFReDs, yellow for FREPs and purple for FReMs) are summarized on the left, edited from Lu et. al (2020). The nomenclature logic process was displayed as a decision tree on the right. Naming convention tests (yes, no, or other) were made based on the test questions in pink boxes with gray frames. Final names were assigned into 5 classes: FReM, FREP1-14, FREP15-24 (novel FREPs), sFReD1-14, and sFReDn1-n29 (new sFReDs).\nB. pfeifferi FREPs were assigned based on IgSF and FBG domain verification and the presence of a signal peptide. FREP1 to FREP14 have been reported in B. glabrata studies [12,55,95,96]. Following the same naming system, B. pfeifferi sequence similarity BpFREP1 to BpFREP14 were identified (\u2265 85% sequence identity at nucleotide level) to known B. glabrata FREPs. Additionally, for some BpFREPs, an additional numeral was added to distinguish individual variants (sequence similarity between 85% to 100%), e.g., BpFREP12.1, 12.2, and so on. Several BpFREPs had no obvious similarity to the known FREPs in the B. glabrata genome. Such new BpFREPs were named starting with BpFREP15, and so on.\nNaming of B. pfeifferi sFReDs (single Fibrinogen-Related Domain-containing proteins) and FReMs (fibrinogen-related molecules containing an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like region) was also made in reference to sequence similarity to the fibrinogen domains in B. pfeifferi FREPs; sFReDs and FReMs were assigned names following the BpFREPs with the closest fibrinogen sequence. For instance, BpsFReD12.1 shows closest similarity to the fibrinogen domain in BpFREP12.1, and BpsFReD12.4 shows high sequence similarity to the fibrinogen domain in BpFREP12.4. For B. pfeifferi sFReDs that have no similarity to any known FReDs [55], they were named as \u201cnew\u201d sFReD, with \u201cn\u201d representing \u201cnew\u201d, with format BpsFReDn1, BpsFReDn2, and so on. Similar nomenclature was applied for B. pfeifferi FReMs, e.g. BpFReM1, BpFReM2, and so on.\n\n\nAllelic variation analysis in several FREPs among B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata strains\nSeveral single nucleotide variants (SNV) have been identified among BgFREP 2,3, and 4 derived from different strains or isolates of B. glabrata (BB02, BS90 and M line), including strains varying in susceptibility to S. mansoni [55]. It was of interest to include similar FREPs from B. pfeifferi in such comparisons. Therefore, BpFREP 2, 3, and 4 transcript sequences were aligned and blasted against B. glabrata sequence similarity. For each FREP gene of interest, protein sequences from the B. glabrata BB02 genome [12], similar B. glabrata BS90 and M line strain transcript sequences [55,97], and similar B. pfeifferi transcript sequences (this study) were aligned together using the multiple sequence alignment program MAFFT [98] and visualized using JalView 2.11.0 [99].\n\n\nAlphafold2 analysis of several B. pfeifferi FREPs\nThe three-dimensional (3D) structures of selected B. pfeifferi FREPs were predicted based on the protein sequences using the Alphafold2 algorithm [100] integrated in ColabFold software [101], a platform with optimization to speed up the sequence search and the prediction process. The protein sequences of identified FREPs were submitted via command colabfold_batch with options \u201c\u2014amber\u2014templates\u2014num-recycle 3\u2014num-models 1 input.fasta outdir\u2014cpu\u201d. The predicted Protein Data Bank (PDB) format files were visualized using the molecular graphics program Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) [102]. To provide some comparison, the protein sequence of BgFREPs from the B. glabrata genome was submitted and processed with the same Alphafold2 analysis.\n\n\nSequence similarity in the B. pfeifferi genome for possible schistosome resistance-related genes identified in previous genome-wide association studies in the B. glabrata genome\nSeveral B. glabrata genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been undertaken to identify candidate genes in particular chromosome regions associated with resistance (or susceptibility) to infection with S. mansoni [40,103\u2013106]. It is of interest to know if sequence similarity of the identified GWAS genes, and the relative positions and composition of the resistance complexes identified in B. glabrata, can be found in the B. pfeifferi genome. The gene sequences from the previous GWAS studies were extracted [97] and were used as subjects to be BLASTed against, to obtain the closest sequence similarity in B. pfeifferi, with query sequence coverage and identity \u226585% as a cutoff value.\n\n\nOther analyses\nSignal peptide searches were performed using SignalP 4.0 [107]. Venn diagrams were generated using R package VennDiagram v1.6.20. Summarized tables and figures were generated using R base packages [65] and ggplot2 v3.1.0 [63].",
    "Results": "B. pfeifferi genome assembly\nThe B. pfeifferi haploid genome size assembled from PacBio HiFi reads is 772 Mb, smaller than observed for other related schistosome vector snails, including two other species of Biomphalaria and Bu. truncatus (Table 2). The estimated genome size for the Brazilian field-derived B. glabrata BB02 is 916 Mb, this being the first schistosome vector snail genome obtained [12]. Because the BB02 genome was largely pieced together using different methods, it is not included in this table; its genome size is comparable to two B. glabrata representatives sequenced more recently, iM line and iBS90, the former shown in Table 2. The summary of complete and fragmented BUSCOs of B. pfeifferi and related snail genomes is in S1 Table.\nAn independent estimation of genome size based on fluorescence cell sorting intensity in comparison with known standards (Lifeasible) yielded a value of 913 Mb for B. pfeifferi, again notably smaller than values obtained for B. glabrata BB02 (1,020 Mb) or B. glabrata iM line (1,090 Mb) using the same technique (Table 3). The consistently higher values obtained from fluorescent cell sorting relative to those from sequencing approaches is probably a consequence of the latter technique underestimating the amount of repetitive DNA [108].\n\n\nThe B. pfeifferi genome is relatively homozygous\nThis observation is supported by three lines of evidence. First, the relatively high peak of the 1-copy k-mer curve and the limited area under the 2-copy k-mer peak (see blue) in B. pfeifferi are indicative of a homozygous genome [109] (Fig 3A). By comparison, the more extensive 2-copy k-mers peak (blue) in B. glabrata is indicative of a greater degree of heterozygosity (Fig 3B).\nHistograms were colored by copy numbers: k-mers present in reads but missing in genome assembly were in grey; k-mers present in both raw reads and genome assemblies were colored in red (1x), blue (2x), green (3x), purple (4x) and orange (>4x). A single peak (red) was found in (A) PacBio HiFi reads for B. pfeifferi, whereas both a red and blue peak were obtained in (B), the Illumina paired end reads for B. glabrata.\nSecondly, k-mer analysis using GenomeScope showed the B. pfeifferi genome heterozygosity rate to be 1.01% (PacBio HiFi reads), which is lower than 1.52% for outbred B. glabrata BB02. For comparisons sake, the deliberately inbred iM line with a history of 70+ generations of forced selfing had a heterozygosity rate of 0.197% [40].\nThe third line of evidence of high homozygosity in the B. pfeifferi genome derives from RNA-Seq data (S1 Fig). The percentage of homozygous SNPs found in field-derived B. pfeifferi is about 80%. Remarkably, this is higher than the 60% value for homozygous SNPs identified from the B. glabrata M line strain which, though originally derived from a cross between Brazilian and Puerto Rican snails, has been maintained in laboratory colonies for nearly seven decades [110].\n\n\nGenome annotation: coding gene model prediction and functional annotation\nA total of 31,894 protein-coding gene models were predicted for the B. pfeifferi genome. The predicted genes scored varying numbers of similarity hits against four available databases (Fig 4): 1) Uniprot manually curated high-quality protein database 14,160 (44%); 2) NCBI non-redundant nucleotide NT database 21,875 (69%); 3) NCBI non-redundant protein NR database 22,342 (70%); and 4) InterProScan database 21,478 (67%), the latter being an assembly of 14 conservative protein domain databases. From the total of 31,894 gene models, 13,447 (42.16%) were annotated by all four databases and 25,923 (81.28%) were annotated from at least one of the four sources. For comparison, the recent annotation process for the Bu. truncatus genome estimated that 83.5% of protein-encoding genes had been annotated by one or more methods [16].\n\n\nAnnotation of repetitive elements in the B. pfeifferi genome\nThe overall portion of the genome occupied by repetitive elements for B. pfeifferi is 329 Mb (S2 Table), smaller than for B. glabrata iM line (374 Mb) or B. glabrata iBS90 (391 Mb). Additionally, the proportion of the genome occupied by repetitive elements is slightly smaller in B. pfeifferi (42.73%) than in either B. glabrata strain (42.95% and 44.17%, respectively).\nAs noted in S2 Fig, the types of repeats less represented in B. pfeifferi are Gypsy/DIRS1 (6\u201317 Mb), simple repeats (5\u20136 Mb) and RTE/Bov-B iM line (17 Mb). In contrast, the hobo-Activator family, a type of DNA transposon, was increased in representation by 1.4\u20132 Mb in B. pfeifferi compared to the B. glabrata genome.\n\n\nComparisons of B. pfeifferi to B. glabrata iM line genome\nThe 18 inferred linkage groups (LGs, representing the 18 haploid chromosomes) for B. pfeifferi were determined by comparison with the 18 LGs of B. glabrata iM line, which were genetically determined using F2 offspring bred from two lines of B. glabrata [40]. Overall, 430 of the 505 scaffolds representing 99.09% of the 771,836,736 bases in the B. pfeifferi genome assembly were assigned to 18 LGs (Fig 5). The order of contigs within LGs and the detailed size of the 18 inferred linkage groups are listed in S3 Table.\nA) Parallel synteny view between B. pfeifferi (query in orange color) and B. glabrata iM line (reference in blue color). Reference and query genome were marked in blue and brown colors. Regions with synteny and structure variations detected by SyRI were highlighted in colored lines: Syntenic (grey), Inversion (orange), Translocation (green), and Duplication (blue). B) Length distribution in violin plots for structural variation (> 1Kb) of B. pfeifferi in comparison to B. glabrata iM line. SV types were highlighted in different colors. CPG: Copy gain in query, CPL: Copy loss in query, DEL: Deletion in query, DUP: Duplicated region, INS: Insertion in query, INV: Inverted region, INVDP: Inverted duplicated region, INVTR: Inverted translocated region, TDM: Tandem repeat, TRANS: Translocated region. Inside violin plots, box plots were placed to indicate mean, quartiles and outliers (black dots). C) Sequential synteny view between B. pfeifferi (query in orange color) and B. glabrata iM line (reference in blue color). Separated scaffolds inside each linkage group were marked out as grey and black boxes. Synteny blocks between two genomes are laid out in grey blocks in the background. Particularly noteworthy is the inversion indicated on LG 9.\nA total of 12 types of structural variation (SV) of >1Kb were identified and summarized from a whole genome comparison between B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata iM line. These SVs occupied 8% of the B. pfeifferi genome (S4 Table). SVs had a median length of 2,051 bp, a mean of 2,997 bp, and the largest SV was an inversion of 2,259,716 bp in length. This inversion was located near the middle of LG9 (Fig 6) and consisted of 2,259,716 bp and 69 coding genes and 3 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in B. pfeifferi, whereas in B. glabrata iM line consisted of 1,875,396 bp and 78 protein coding genes. According to BLASTp results, 24 of these genes are reciprocal best hits. Several interesting genes locate in the inversion region, such as: inactive phospholipase C-like protein 2, putative ammonium transporter 1, serpin B3-like, syndetin-like and vinculin. They are large genes that collectively occupy 92% (650/707 Kbp) of the inversion in B. pfeifferi, and 87% (784/901 Kbp) of the comparable region in B. glabrata iM line. Further details can be found in S5 Table.\nA) A 2.3 Mbp size inversion region was identified. The scaffolds covering the linkage groups are BP005 and BGM004, respectively. B) Dot plots show the inversion area was between large flanking synteny blocks. C) ShinySyn plot showing the sequence similar genes connected by blue ribbons, revealing the reverse order within the inverted region. Genes were marked in colored boxes along the x axes, purple boxes for positive strand and green boxes for negative strand. Boxes without connections are genes with no sequence similarity identified between the two species.\nDuplicated region changes (DUP and INVDP) are the major SVs detected, accounting for 22.5 Mb (2.9%) of the B. pfeifferi genome. The duplicated regions may relate to the expansion of the FReD (fibrinogen-related domain-containing proteins) family, the size of which is increased in comparison to B. glabrata. The genes affected by the SVs would be good candidates to explore with respect to explaining the phenotypic differences between the two species.\n\n\nSplit time estimation for B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata\nAnnotated protein sequences were obtained for B. glabrata iM line (35,016), B. pfeifferi (31,894), Bu. truncatus (26,279), Elysia marginata (23,871), and Radix auricularia (4,731), and the time tree (Fig 7) was estimated using Orthofinder. When the Bulinus emergence time was fixed as the constraint point to 20 Mya based on fossil evidence [71], the split time of B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi shown in Fig 7 was determined to be 3.01 Mya (95% CI 2.62\u20133.47 Mya).\nThe International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) genome IDs on NCBI were listed in the brackets beside each species.\n\n\nComparison of annotated genes among B. pfeifferi, and three B. glabrata strains\nA total of 12,421 ortho-groups were shared among the 5 genomes sampled in S3 Fig, all of which are representatives of the family Planorbidae, including two genera (Bulinus and Biomphalaria), and two congeneric species, B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata, the latter represented by two isolates originating from Brazil, BB02 and iBS90, and one mixed ancestry isolate, iM line. The category of \u201cshared among all five genomes\u201d far outweighed the number of Biomphalaria-specific ortho-groups (n = 1,924). The large number of ortho-groups shared by iM line and iBS90 (n = 2,021) and the relatively large number (n = 1,117) shared by Biomphalaria representatives exclusive of B. glabrata BB02, may reflect differences in sequencing techniques. The number of ortho-groups unique to each of the taxa examined ranged from 164 to 485, not surprisingly with the value for Bu. truncatus being higher than for the more-closely related Biomphalaria representatives.\nA total of 7,054 single copy orthologs were detected in common to all five genomes. These comprise the core set of genes among these extant species. These universal single copy genes serve as good bench markers for expected gene content in genomes or transcriptomes. As a reference, the Mollusca Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) single copy orthologs number is 5,295. The higher number of 7,054 we observed among our five genomes is no doubt influenced by their relatively high degree of relatedness as compared to relatedness among all molluscs as a whole.\n\n\nNon-coding RNA prediction and annotation summary\nWe systematically annotated the key types of non-coding RNAs in B. pfeifferi and were able to obtain 514 tRNAs (with one being a selenocysteinyl tRNA, or tRNA_sec), 757 rRNAs, 77 miRNAs, and 2,954 long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs (Table 4). The presence of tRNA_sec in B. pfeifferi is indicative of its ability to synthesize selenoproteins [111]. Numerous ribosomal RNAs were predicted, likely due to the fact that more repetitive regions were successfully assembled using PacBio accurate long reads.\nFor the miRNAs, 59 of 77 predicted B. pfeifferi miRNAs show at least 90% identity to B. glabrata BB02 sequences, leaving 18 miRNAs unique to B. pfeifferi and 32 unique to B. glabrata. The shared and unique miRNAs identified in the B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata genomes are listed in S6 Table.\n\n\nFReD genes in the B. pfeifferi genome\nFollowing the decision tree presented in Fig 2, and criteria for finding FReDs previously established [55], 103 B. pfeifferi FReDs were identified, including 55 FREPs, 45 sFReDs and 3 FReMs (S7 Table). Most B. pfeifferi FREPs (49/55) have a signal peptide. Of the 55, 8 had one IgSF loop and 47 had two IgSF domains. The interceding region (ICR) in FREPs refers to the sequence between the IgSF and FBG domains; it forms coiled coils and is usually <150 aa in length. However, we found 21 B. pfeifferi FREPs with a longer ICR (152~322 aa) and 34 BpFREPs with an ICR of more typical length of <150aa (S7 Table).\nCompared with the congener B. glabrata BB02 and the planorbid Bu. truncatus with available annotated genomes (Table 5), more FREPs and FReMs were identified in the B. pfeifferi genome, including two new FReMs (BpFReM2 and BpFReM3, partial). A more detailed overview of B. pfeifferi FReDs is in S7 Table.\nTo compare FReD genes in the B. glabrata BB02 and B. pfeifferi genomes, a Maximum Likelihood tree was generated (Fig 8). Overall, it is striking regarding the extent to which FReDs from the two species are interleaved on the tree, indicative of the close relationship between the South American B. glabrata and the African B. pfeifferi. Nonetheless, there are noteworthy divergences between the two species. Note the expansion of BpFREP5, 7, 12, 13, 18 and 22 clusters relative to what is present in B. glabrata. For example, the 11 members of the BpFREP12 cluster (BpFREP12.1\u2014BpFREP12.11) seem to represent an expansion from a shared ancestral sequence, 17_tig_2702_BGLB000021 being the counterpart in B. glabrata BB02. Conversely, note the FREP4 cluster in B. glabrata BB02 that is lacking in B. pfeifferi.\nThe ML tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed with full length FReDs protein sequences from B. pfeifferi (this study) and B. glabrata BB02. Bootstrap values equal or greater than 75% are represented by black squares on the internal nodes. For nomenclature of B. pfeifferi FReDs see descriptions in this study. Nomenclature of B. glabrata BB02 FReDs was described in previous studies [12,55,74,75,77,78].\nBecause of their responsiveness to schistosome infection shown in previous studies [96], we further examined the sequences of FREP2 and 3 genes from B. glabrata BB02, BS90 and M line with representatives from the B. pfeifferi genome, looking for single nucleotide variants (SNV). Similar transcript sequences for FREP2, 3.1, 3.2 were identified (S4 Fig) in the B. pfeifferi genome (S7 Table). Not surprisingly, for each of these FREPs, the B. pfeifferi version was more divergent in sequence than the divergences noted among the representatives obtained from the three B. glabrata isolates. FREP2, containing a single IgSF domain (see also AlphaFold2 structure predictions below), was relatively conserved between species with SNVs particularly noted in the B. pfeifferi FBG domain which was also shorter than the corresponding domain in B. glabrata. Both FREP3.1 and 3.2 contain two IgSF domains (S4 Fig). For FREP3.1, the interceding region (beginning at position 306) was substantially shortened in B. pfeifferi, and numerous SNVs were identified, once again particularly in the FBG domain, both between strains of B. glabrata and for B. pfeifferi in particular. For FREP3.2, overall similarities in sequence were greater between B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata, but once again the FBG was somewhat more variable but less so than seen in FREP3.1.\nThe 3D structures of BpFREPs were predicted using the AlphaFold2 algorithm and visualized using VMD software (Fig 9). Key functional domains of BpFREPs and the start amino acid (1MET) are indicated in subfigure C. For BpFREP2, note the presence of a single IgSF domain and the relatively short interceding region (alpha helix) that brings the FBG domain close to the IgSF domain. BpFREP3.1 features two IgSF domains but has an interceding region that is truncated in length as compared to other FREPs. For BpFREP3.2, notice the long interceding region more typical of two-IgSF domain containing FREPs. For comparison, Fig 9D shows the AlphaFold2 predicted structure for BgFREP3.2.\nAbbreviations: SP, signal peptide; IgSF, immunoglobulin superfamily; ICR, interceding region; FBG, fibrinogen domain. Secondary structures were marked in colored cartoons: alpha helices (3.6 residues per helix turn and 13 atoms ring) in purple, beta sheet in yellow, coils in light grey, beta turn in light blue, and 3(10) helices (3 residues per helix turn and 10 atoms ring) in dark blue.\n\n\nVariable immunoglobulin and lectin domain containing molecules (VIgLs) in the B. pfeifferi genome\nProteins with lectin domains are often implicated in defense responses in gastropods [80] and their transcription in B. glabrata has been found to be responsive to exposure to trematodes like S. mansoni [97]. By BLAST analysis, we found evidence for 63 C-type lectin domain-encoding genes with the length of 53\u2013207 aa in B. pfeifferi (S8 Table). We focused further attention on two particular categories of lectins, C-type lectin-related proteins (CREP) and galectin-related proteins (GREP) [79].\nCREPs have one or two IgSF domains (IgSF1 and IgSF2) and a C-terminal domain CLECT, characteristic of C-type lectins. Based on the gene structures, 20 of the 63 C-type lectin encoding genes contain one or two IgSF loops, thereby fitting the criteria of CREPs (Table 6). Among the 20 CREPs, 11 contain an N-terminal signal peptide and were considered as complete CREPs and 9 were deemed partial CREPs due to missing a signal peptide (S8 Table). One unusual CREP gene (BP27735) contains one IgSF loop, the CLECT domain, and N-terminal repeats with a glutamate-aspartate symporter signature (PR00173). In comparison, only 4 CREPs have been identified in B. glabrata [79].\nThe 43 remaining C-type lectin domain-encoding genes either contain the CLECT domain only or the CLECT domain in combination with some other conserved motif, such as an Apple-like domain, Rhodopsin 7-helix transmembrane protein, or Trimeric LpxA-like superfamily member (S8 Table).\nWith respect to GREPs which are comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide, one or two IgSF domains, IgSF1 and IgSF2, and a C-terminal galectin domain GLECT, none were found in B. pfeifferi as compared to one known from B. glabrata [79]. However, a gene (BP09483) containing an N-terminal signal peptide and a galectin/galactose-binding lectin (cd00070) was identified.\nWe explored the location within the whole genome of the VIgLs gene families in the B. pfeifferi genome (S5 Fig). The genes encoding FREPs (IgSF + FBG), free-standing IgSFs, sFReDs, CREPs (IgSF + C-type lectin) and GREPs (IgSF + galectin) were identified in different scaffolds in the B. pfeifferi genome (in S5 Fig).\nWith the exception of a few scattered members, FREPs in B. pfeifferi were found clustered within hotspots on two scaffolds (BP014 and BP029), both of which reside tin linkage group LG13. These two scaffolds are 8.2 Mb apart, separated by scaffolds BP031 and BP062. No obvious clustered hot spots were found for other VIgLs like CREPs, or isolated IgSF or sFReDs.\n\n\nAIG genes in the B. pfeifferi genome\nThe AIG (avrRpt2-induced gene) family are characterized by the presence of an AIG1 domain. Members of the AIG gene family are frequently represented as GIMAPs (GTPase of the immunity associated protein family), characterized by presence of the AIG1 domain along with coiled-coil domains. AIG family members first attracted attention in B. glabrata because some were found to be constitutively highly expressed in snails resistant to S. mansoni as compared to schistosome-susceptible snails [113]. An expanded AIG gene family with 91 members (64 GIMAPs and 27 AIG genes without coiled-coils) was discovered in the B. glabrata genome [81].\nIn the B. pfeifferi genome, 69 AIG genes were identified (S9 Table), of which 62 have sequence similarity in the B. glabrata BB02 genome (47 GIMAPs and 15 AIGs). The remaining 7 which are distinctive to B. pfeifferi include 2 GIMAPs and 5 AIGs. As is the case with B. glabrata, most of the B. pfeifferi AIGs contain only 1 AIG1 domain, but a few contain two AIG1 domains, or a special domain, such as a Death domain, or a Hedgehog/Intein domain. More details can be found in S9 Table.\n\n\nSequence similarity searches in the B. pfeifferi genome for schistosome-resistance complexes identified from B. glabrata genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\nSeveral B. glabrata GWAS studies published prior to 2022 [103\u2013106] predicted candidate genes in particular chromosome regions associated with resistance to S. mansoni. Using the list of potential candidate resistance genes summarized from these studies by Lu et al., (2022) [97] and shown in S4 Table, similarity searches were undertaken in the B. pfeifferi genome with the query sequence coverage and identity \u226585% as cutoff values. We also searched the recently published GWAS study of B. glabrata iM line and iBS90 genomes by Bu et al., 2022 [40]. Results are detailed in S10 and S11 Tables.\nThe general synteny and composition of genes within the B. glabrata GWAS resistance regions can be confirmed for B. pfeifferi. For instance, three B. pfeifferi fructose-bisphosphate aldolase genes similar in sequence to genes (Bg26681, Bg24773, and Bg23696) of the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex [114] were identified though their exact location and size differ. Similarly, multiple histone H4 genes [114], multiple palmitoyltransferase [104], and zinc finger protein-encoding genes [104] were identified and located in different scaffolds of the B. pfeifferi genome (S10 Table). In reference to the resistance loci from iM line/iBS90 genomes [40], multiple genes with similar sequences were again verified to be present in the B. pfeifferi genome, for instance: 39S ribosomal proteins, DNA ligase 1, kinesin-like proteins, potassium voltage-gated channel protein Shaw-like, retinol dehydrogenase proteins, thioredoxin domain-containing proteins 12-like isoform X2, transcription elongation factors, transcription factors, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1-like isoform X1, and transmembrane proteins (S11 Table). More detailed analyses will be required to determine if and how the sequences of individual genes within the resistance complexes may vary from B. glabrata to B. pfeifferi (see discussion), and the functional roles genes identified by GWAS studies might actually play in schistosome resistance.\n\n\nBiomphalysins in the B. pfeifferi genome\nBiomphalysins are proteins averaging 575 residues in length containing an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion (17\u201323 amino acids), an aerolysin domain consisting of 5 \u03b2-strands with an insertion loop corresponding to the pore-forming transmembrane domain (TMD) [82]. Twenty-three biomphalysins have been reported from B. glabrata and are of particular interest because they represent toxin genes acquired by horizontal transfer from bacteria, and they have been shown to be toxic to schistosome sporocysts so have potential relevance in immune defense [82,83].\nUsing criteria provided for B. glabrata biomphalysins, the transmembrane domains were searched using the PRED-TMBB server (PREDiction of TransMembrane Beta Barrels proteins) [88,89], and 14 putative biomphalysins were identified in the B. pfeifferi genome (S12 Table), 8 of which had a predicted signal peptide for secretion. Six B. pfeifferi biomphalysins were considered as complete using the criteria by Pinaud et al. (2021) [82]. Interestingly, the transcript BP08351-RA (coding gene ID: BP08351) contained a signal peptide and sequence of 178aa which lacks intact aerolysin or pore-forming domains. However, it did match 178aa of B. glabrata biomphalysin 10 (partial, QUJ23862.1, 575aa) with 97.8% of identity and 100% coverage. It\u2019s possible either a downstream aerolysin domain was missed during genome assembly, or a deletion occurred within this gene. Therefore, BP08351 is included in the B. pfeifferi genome as a partial biomphalysin (S12 Table).\n\n\nHeat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the B. pfeifferi genome\nHeat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to play a vital role in the synthesis, transport and folding of proteins. HSP70s are unique in the HSP family due to their high degree of conservation [115]. They have been repeatedly identified in molluscs and in B. glabrata (11\u201321 HSPs) [116\u2013118], and have been implicated in B. glabrata defense reactions [119,120]. Several (41) HSP70s were found in the B. straminea genome [13].\nEleven HSP70s with the conserved HSPA domain (cd10233, or PTHR19375) were identified in the B. pfeifferi genome (S13 Table), four of which (BP17603, BP17604, BP17605 and BP17606) were in tandem. Considering their similar overall structures and areas of large sequence overlap, three of these genes (BP17603, BP17604 and BP17605) may have a common originating sequence.\n\n\nG-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the B. pfeifferi genome\nG-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) play an important role in environmental sensing [48,121] and 241 seven transmembrane domain GPCR-like genes belonging to 14 subfamilies and clusters were found in the B. glabrata BB02 genome [12]. We have previously noted remarkably different patterns of GPCR expression in B. glabrata snails susceptible or resistant to S. mansoni infection [97]. In this study, we applied massive BLAST analysis of the B. pfeifferi genome to NCBI databases, combined with InterProScan and Uniport for GPCR domains prediction, and identified 219 putative GPCRs (S14 Table). There were 16 different types of GPCR domains identified within the GPCR family by domain prediction and NCBI annotation, four of which were prominently represented among B. pfeifferi GPCRs. For instance: 96 GPCRs contained the domain of \u201cRhodopsin 7-helix transmembrane proteins\u201d (G3DSA:1.20.1070.10); 39 GPCRs had a \u201cRhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily signature\u201d (PR00237); 31 GPCRs contained \u201cG_PROTEIN_RECEP_F2_4 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN\u201d (PTHR45902), and 10 GPCRs contained \u201cMYOSUPPRESSIN RECEPTOR 1, ISOFORM B-RELATED\u201d (PTHR46273). Considering the number and complexity of GPCRs revealed in B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi, and their responsiveness to schistosome infection, the GPCRs would seem to comprise a fruitful subject for future investigation.\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to be important pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) responding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules or PAMPs, triggering activation of immune signaling pathways [12,122\u2013124]. In the B. glabrata BB02 genome, 27 complete, 9 partial, and 20 TLR pseudogenes were identified [12]. TLRs have been implicated in the response of B. glabrata to S. mansoni infections [84,125]. In B. pfeifferi, by BLAST analysis, 43 TLRs were identified. Of these 43, 17 are considered as complete TLRs with an N-terminal signal peptide, a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The remainder are categorized as TLR partials because they lack one or more of the conserved domains (S15 Table).\n\n\nGenes possibly involved in sexual attraction in the B. pfeifferi genome\nSecreted protein pheromones involved in sex recognition, aggregation, spawning, and larval metamorphosis are known from molluscs [86,126\u2013130], including the Aplysia californica/brasiliana pheromonal complex of attractin, seductin, enticin, and temptin. Similar to previous observations for B. glabrata [12], we found evidence for the presence of only temptin in B. pfeifferi [27]. As in B. glabrata BB02 and iBS90 genomes, we found 12 predicted partial temptin-like genes in B. pfeifferi (that did not contain a signal peptide), whereas B. glabrata iM line had 11 (S6 Fig and S16 Table). Additionally, one temptin-like gene was found in B. pfeifferi, that contained a signal peptide (S16 Table). All 13 B. pfeifferi genes contained a conserved Ca2+ binding EGF-like domain (DSDXD). All 13 predicted temptin-like (including ones without signal peptides) genes also grouped closely with B. glabrata temptin-like gene, including Bp30710RA with XP_013086708.1 from B. glabrata, a recombinant form of which was shown to attract B. glabrata in T-maze experiments (S6 Fig). Considering the preference of B. pfeifferi for selfing relative to outcrossing for B. glabrata, we considered there might be notable differences in their temptin genes, but did not find this to be the case. More T-maze experiments might reveal functional differences among temptins from the two species not obvious from their sequences.\nWe found two hits (gene IDs BP16290 and BP22349) to Aplysia attractin, XP_012937027.2. However, the inferred proteins are much larger than Aplysia attractin proteins which are < 100 aa in length, and do not have key conserved attractin residues. It is likely that these B. pfeifferi proteins have other functions not related to sexual attraction or aggregation.",
    "Discussion": "The B. pfeifferi genome sequence greatly increases our knowledge base for this understudied species, one that plays a pivotal role in maintaining schistosome transmission across much of the Afrotropical region and in southwest Asia. B. pfeifferi is well-known for its widespread involvement in S. mansoni transmission, and in broad terms should be considered a highly relevant vector species representing remarkable compatibility with schistosome infection.\nThe genome sequence was obtained using PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing technology which generates accurate long reads (up to median 25Kb, accuracy exceeding 99.9% or >Q30) [131]. HiFi sequencing provided the resolution needed to separate high similarity repeats and alleles across large genomic regions [131]. This enabled us, for example, to identify additional rRNAs in the genome.\nSurprisingly, the B. pfeifferi genome is smaller (772 Mb) than known genomes for other Biomphalaria or Bulinus species, and it contains proportionately about the same amount of repetitive DNA as genomes of close relatives (S2 Table and S2 Fig). The number of gene models (31,894) is comparable to other known members of its gastropod family Planorbidae (range of 26,729 to 43,340). Due to the limitation of current sequencing technology, repeats (especially long repeats) can collapse during the de novo genome assembly process, thereby resulting in a smaller assembled genome size than expected. However, in this study, the reduction of genome size in B. pfeifferi could not be explained only by assembly challenge from repeats or limitation of sequencing technology. As results above have shown, two independent non-assembly-based genome size estimation approaches (K-mer method and fluorescence methods) returned consistent results that the B. pfeifferi genome size is smaller than the B. glabrata genome. Additionally, the PacBio HiFi reads in this study have a mean length of 18Kbp and 37x depth, which leaves less opportunity for collapsing repeats. Therefore, despite the caveat that the B. pfeifferi genome might have a reduced genome size due to repeats collapsing during the assembly process, we have reached the conclusion that the B. pfeifferi genome size is just naturally smaller than the B. glabrata genome.\nGenome-based k-mer analysis (Fig 3) suggested a relatively low degree of heterozygosity in B. pfeifferi as compared to other planorbid genomes. This is also supported by heterozygosity of SNP genotypes from RNA-Seq data: for B. pfeifferi, this ranged from 7\u201328%, whereas for outbred B. glabrata M line the value was 39%. The values for B. pfeifferi were closer to the 6% value noted for B. glabrata iM line which had been deliberately inbred for 81 generations. The low degree of heterozygosity for B. pfeifferi is consistent with the strong, but not exclusive, predilections for self-crossing as opposed to out-crossing for this snail species [132], a trait not shared by B. glabrata which is naturally a preferential out-crosser [133]. In nematodes and plants, there is a trend for selfing species to have smaller genomes than closely-related out-crossing representatives, with one explanation being the loss of genes associated with mating [134]. So, for B. pfeifferi, even though it is not an exclusive selfer, both diminished heterozygosity and smaller genome sizes may be consequences of its relative reliance on selfing. Sequencing of additional individuals of B. pfeifferi, and of different schistosome vectors also known to be selfers (e.g. Bulinus forskalii relative to its out-crossing congeners) [1], will be of interest in revealing the extent to which representative of different selfing lineages share the trait of limited heterozygosity, and the extent to which they differ in their genome size.\nBuilding on the pioneering work of the genome project for field-collected B. glabrata BB02 [12] and of subsequent PacBio long reads sequencing projects for commonly used B. glabrata M line and BS90 lab strains [40], 18 well-supported linkage groups have been inferred for B. pfeifferi, matching the known haploid number of 18 chromosomes for this and other species of Biomphalaria. A total of 53.5% of the B. pfeifferi genome exhibits synteny with the B. glabrata iM line genome assembly [40], as might be expected given the hypothesized origin of B. pfeifferi and the remaining 11 species of African Biomphalaria from the trans-Atlantic colonization of a B. glabrata-like ancestral snail [11]. Based on rates of sequence divergence among available genomes for relevant gastropod species, we estimated a divergence time between B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi of 3.01 million years, a rate that falls into the range of 2.62\u20133.47 million years proposed earlier as the separation time for these two species [2]. Our estimate is based on the oldest known presence of Bulinus in the fossil record which does not necessarily reflect the earliest appearance of this genus in evolutionary history. We return to a discussion of the implications of this study with respect to relationships between Biomphalaria species and schistosomes and other trematodes below.\nAs compared to other available schistosome vector snail genomes, we provide a relatively comprehensive list of the non-coding RNA genes found, including rRNAs, tRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. In the B. glabrata BB02 genome, two lncRNAs were predicted [12] as compared to 2,954 lncRNAs predicted for B. pfeifferi. As our knowledge of genome regulation improves, the significance of the many lncRNAs identified will become more apparent: they will provide insights into regulation of gene expression at multiple levels (epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional).\nAmong the many gene families identifiable in Biomphalaria genomes [12], we chose to focus attention on those that were most familiar to us, and that have been implicated in previous studies for a role in immune defense. Prominent among these is the FReD family. In general, B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi had similar overall FReD profiles, with comparable numbers of sFReDs, FReMs and FREPs. By contrast, Bu. truncatus was found to have only a single FREP and relatively more sFReDs. The number of FREPs found in B. pfeifferi (55) exceeded that found in B. glabrata (39). The sole FREP from Bu. truncatus possesses two IgSF domains which are relatively dissimilar from the IgSF domains found in B. pfeifferi or B. glabrata BB02/iM line/iBS90. In fact, IgSF domains in Bu. truncatus FReDs were only retrieved from predicted 3D protein structures showing the typical 8-beta sheets featured in IgSF domains. It will be of particular interest to chart the expansion or contraction of FReDs across the Planorbidae as more data become available. Bulinus is a relatively early diverging genus in the family and is even placed by some in a separate family, the Bulinidae. In contrast, Biomphalaria represents a more derived lineage [135,136]. Provision of sequence data for species representing other major planorbid lineages will be revealing in this regard.\nThe three-dimensional structures predicted by Alphafold2 for B. pfeifferi FREPs were striking, notable both for their differences from Alphafold2 predictions for Bu. truncatus FREPs, and for how impactful the interceding region is in dictating their overall structure. With respect to four FREPs noteworthy in B. glabrata for their responsiveness to S. mansoni infection [55], FREPs 2, 3.1 and 3.2 and 4, we found the first three to have identifiable sequence similarity in B. pfeifferi. Generally, the versions from B. pfeifferi were more divergent in base composition than were the various B. glabrata representatives. It was somewhat surprising that the fibrinogen domains appeared more prone to variation than the IgSF domains. Further analysis of the functional roles of FREP IgSF and fibrinogen domains will be facilitated by use of 3-dimensional structures such as those shown in Fig 9, enabling their roles in available models of interaction with S. mansoni [137] to be more thoroughly defined. This may in turn lead to rational development of schistosome resistance factors that might be engineered for expression in transgenic snails [138].\nIt was noteworthy that no sequence similar to FREP4 was found in B. pfeifferi. This gene was found to be down-regulated early during the course of S. mansoni infection in schistosome-susceptible B. glabrata M line snails, but was persistently overexpressed in S. mansoni-resistant BS90 snails following exposure to infection [97]. This may reflect that susceptibility to S. mansoni, if linked to FREP4, might result from two different processes: down-regulation in susceptible strains of B. glabrata, or loss of the gene in B. pfeifferi. In contrast, FREP2 and 3 have the same copy numbers in the two related Biomphalaria species, suggesting their stable maintenance is significant. Furthermore, not only has FREP4 disappeared in B. pfeifferi but a novel FREP, FREP12, is present, indicative of the dynamic nature of the FReD gene family, exhibiting both loss and expansion.\nWith respect to other molecules with IgSF domains, CREPs have both an IgSF domain and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain [79]. More CREPs were found in B. pfeifferi (20) than in B. glabrata (4). Their role in schistosome interactions requires more study, but proteins with sequence similarity to CREP IgSF sequences have been found adherent to S. mansoni sporocysts [12]. Previous transcriptome studies comparing the responses of B. glabrata susceptible or resistant to S. mansoni have also found distinctive response profiles for C-type lectins which normally lack an IgSF domain [97]. The number of C-type lectins has not been determined for B. glabrata although 111 lectins representing multiple categories are known to be present [97]. B. pfeifferi has 43 C-type lectins and Bu. truncatus has 101 mostly C-type lectins [16]. Further comparative study is needed to learn if consistent patterns in lectin transcription occur in parasite-exposed snails, particularly in snails actively shedding schistosome cercariae, as was noted by Lu et al. [97].\nAnother gene family known from Biomphalaria is the AIG gene family, which is expanded in B. glabrata with 91 members, with some members known to be expressed at constitutively high levels in snails resistant to S. mansoni [81]. B. pfeifferi also has an expanded AIG family containing 69 members. The presence and size of this gene family in other planorbid snails is as yet unknown, as is the role they might play when up-regulated in schistosome-resistant snails.\nB. glabrata has 23 pore-forming-encoding biomphalysin genes [82], and B. pfeifferi was found to have 14 representatives, strongly suggesting these horizontally acquired genes of bacterial origin have survival value for Biomphalaria. Biomphalysins have been shown to adhere to and damage schistosome larvae [139,140]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are believed to play a key role in defense of invertebrates from pathogens by serving as sensors that can activate signaling pathways leading to the production of immune effectors. A role for TLRs in defense against S. mansoni sporocysts has been noted by [84]. In B. pfeifferi, 43 complete, partial or pseudogene TLRs were recovered, whereas B. glabrata was found to have 56, and Bu. truncatus 123.\nAnother prominent group of molecules implicated in Biomphalaria defense from schistosomes are HSP70 genes [12,120]. The invasive schistosome vector species B. straminea has an enriched complement of HSP70s (41) relative to B. glabrata (11\u201321) and B. pfeifferi with 11. In molluscs, particularly bivalves, HSP70s are among the most frequently investigated molecules and are believed to play an important role in protection from thermal stress [141]. It will be of interest to learn if increased complements of HSP70 genes facilitate the invasiveness shown by B. straminea or other invasive gastropods. The role of several of these gene families in snail-schistosome interactions remains to be more fully investigated, and the perspective offered by comparative genomics will prove to be an insightful way forward.\nOne of the most distinctive features of the biology of B. pfeifferi is its strong preference for self-fertilization, often viewed as an advantageous way to quickly re-populate fluctuating habitats [142]. One possible factor influencing this behavior is the extent to which they produce proteins known to influence aggregation or mating behavior. Four different categories of proteins have been shown to affect the aggregation and mating behavior of Aplysia: temptin, attractin, seductin, and enticin [85,128,143]. Only temptin is known to be produced by B. glabrata [12,144]. We found 12 partial temptin-like genes (and 1 that contained a signal peptide) in B. pfeifferi, comparable in number to the outcrossing B. glabrata with 12 temptin genes.\nIn the B. glabrata transcriptomic study of Lu et al. [97], five temptins were overexpressed in unexposed schistosome-resistant snails as compared to unexposed susceptible snails. It was also noticed that for susceptible snails shedding S. mansoni cercariae, four temptin genes were up-regulated while one was down-regulated relative to unexposed controls. Why snails effectively castrated by S. mansoni would be producing more temptins is somewhat baffling if their role is only in attraction of conspecifics. In B. pfeifferi exposed to S. mansoni [27], some temptin-like genes were highly expressed early in the course of infection and then down-regulated once the snails began shedding cercariae, a pattern that seems more compatible with what might be expected from a castrated snail. Transcription of some B. pfeifferi temptin-like genes was unaffected by S. mansoni infection, suggesting they might have other functions unrelated to reproduction, a supposition supported by other studies [87,145,146], including a role in biomineralization in freshwater mussels [89]. Further studies are needed to determine the function of each of the B. pfeifferi temptin genes and how they differ from other Biomphalaria species. Differences in mating behavior between species might be influenced by expression of distinctive suites of temptins, or by sequence differences among the encoded proteins, hypotheses deserving additional study.\nAnother group of molecules with a largely unappreciated impact on the biology of freshwater gastropods are the membrane-associated signal-receiving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Not surprisingly, several GPCRs are present in B. pfeifferi (219), though fewer than reported from B. glabrata (241) or Bu. truncatus (709). Further specific analysis of the complements of GPCRs present in the different schistosome vector snails is clearly a topic deserving additional study, not only with respect to how they respond to the presence of schistosome parasites per se, but also how it might relate to differences in their ability to perceive a huge range of environmental cues. Transcriptomic results [97] highlight how responsive GPCRs seem to be upon exposure to schistosome infections, both in snails susceptible or resistant to infection.\nThe schistosome-resistance gene complexes identified by genome-wide association studies in B. glabrata [40,103\u2013106] offer another relevant point of comparison with B. pfeifferi. Not surprisingly, comparable regions with similar gene composition were found in the B. pfeifferi genome. Nonetheless, both B. glabrata and B. pfeifferi are comprised of individuals that largely, but not necessarily exclusively, exhibit a natural state of susceptibility to S. mansoni across their respective geographic ranges [147]. So, under natural circumstances it seems resistance to this parasite has not been strongly selected for. It is also pertinent that S. mansoni is just one of several species of castrating digenetic trematodes known to infect either snail species: both support diverse communities of trematodes [25,148\u2013150]. Whether this results in more generic responses to minimize the impact of all trematodes, or produces more tailored trematode-species specific responses is a topic that requires further study. For some species like B. pfeifferi that occupy habitats subject to rapid change, the threat imposed by parasites and the presumed benefits offered by regular out-crossing may be offset by the advantages of rapid colonization achieved by selfing, especially if the risk of trematode infection is small.\nLastly, consider the peculiar colonization history of a B. glabrata-like ancestor from South America to Africa in an interval, as again suggested by this study, probably less than five million years ago. Some caution is required in interpreting this date because, although it is agreement with other estimates of the divergence\u2019s times of the two species [2], our present calibration used as an anchor point a 19\u201320 Mya divergence time for Bulinus, and this may underestimate the actual origin time of demonstrable Bulinus snails. Similar issues have been reported by others in attempts to estimate divergence times [69,70]. It would be the case that the descendants that subsequently diversified in Africa, with B. pfeifferi being the first-diverging African Biomphalaria species among them [2,11], would have benefitted by their colonist ancestor\u2019s experience to trematode exposure in South America, but that exposure history would not have included exposure to mammalian schistosomes like Schistosoma, which were Afro-Asian in origin and distribution. A snail species likely to have encountered the progenitor of S. mansoni or the related S. rodhaini in Africa is B. pfeifferi. The susceptibility shown by B. pfeifferi to S. mansoni today may reflect this early period of intimate association. Interestingly, any specific accommodation B. pfeifferi and related African snails may have made to S. mansoni and its relatives would be independent from whatever specific accommodation B. glabrata may have made with S. mansoni (they may have shared a general accommodation strategy to trematode given their relatedness, however). This would be because S. mansoni did not encounter B. glabrata until 400\u2013500 years ago, when S. mansoni-infected people were first transported from Africa to the New World. It would prove interesting to learn if the accommodations made (if any) by B. pfeifferi to S. mansoni prove to have any resemblance to those made independently by B. glabrata to S. mansoni at a later time. In other words, how prominent might schistosome resistance genes be in either species in nature, and to what extent might selection have converged on the same genes in each species as they independently encountered S. mansoni? Also, resistance may be manifested very differently between the two species, being present in distinct largely self-propagating lineages in B. pfeifferi, whereas resistance traits might segregate more freely among out-breeding B. glabrata. Once again, comparative genomics as offered by this and other forthcoming genome studies, as for species like the African out-crossing species Biomphalaria sudanica, will help us delve into these and related subjects in depth."
