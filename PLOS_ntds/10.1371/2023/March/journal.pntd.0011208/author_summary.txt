Biomphalaria pfeifferi is the world’s most widely distributed and commonly implicated vector snail for the causative agent of human intestinal schistosomiasis, Schistosoma mansoni. Understanding the basis of host-parasite compatibility relies on functional genomic resources, which will be helpful for developing genetic-based control of schistosomes and their vector snails. Here we report a high-quality, de novo–assembled whole genome for B. pfeifferi (PacBio High-Fidelity long reads), with in-depth gene model annotation for protein-coding and nonprotein-coding genes. Using these enriched molecular data, a divergence date of 3.01 Mya was calculated for B. pfeifferi and B. glabrata, consistent with the idea of Biomphalaria colonization of Africa from South America, and placing an upper boundary on the age of S. mansoni in Africa. The spread of S. mansoni was likely favored by its high degree of compatibility with B. pfeifferi-like snails. In addition, our evidence supports the idea that B. pfeifferi is a preferentially self-crossing species with a more homozygous and smaller genome than related species like B. glabrata known to be preferential out-crossers. Furthermore, several immune-related gene families have expanded differently between B. pfeifferi to B. glabrata. Resources provided here will deepen our general knowledge of molluscan biology, host-parasite co-evolution, vector biology, and genomics.
