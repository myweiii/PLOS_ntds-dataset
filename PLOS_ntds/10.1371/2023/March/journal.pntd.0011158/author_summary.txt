Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was first reported in 2011 and 11.2â€“30% of patients die of multiple organ failure. Previous prognostic models for SFTS are mostly based on single-center data and lack validation. Moreover, the drug efficacy of ribavirin and gamma globulin is controversial. Here, we developed a simple model for predicting the mortality and help to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs in patients with SFTS. In this study, the data of three hospitals were used to establish and verify the model. Based on neurologic symptoms and the joint indices score, which considered age, gastrointestinal bleeding, and SFTSV RNA, patients were divided into double-positive, single-positive, and double-negative groups, which had mortality rates of 79.3%, 6.8%, and 0% in the modeling groups, respectively. Validation yielded similar results. Subgroup analysis revealed that ribavirin had a significant effect on mortality in the single-positive group but not in the other two groups. In the single-positive group, prompt antibiotic use was associated with reduced mortality, even in individuals without significant granulocytopenia and infection, and early prophylaxis was associated with reduced mortality.
