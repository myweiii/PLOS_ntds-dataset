Many different methods are used and new methods are evolving to control nuisance and vector mosquito populations across the world. Implementation of such control methods at the optimal time has been identified as critical to maintaining the populations below unacceptable levels. The establishment of evidenced-based action thresholds is thus encouraged to achieve maximum results under available resources. This review was conducted to identify different action thresholds published worldwide since 2010 and to understand the associated surveillance characteristics. Only 87 publications filtered through the initial database identification of 1,485 publications were included in the review. Thirty inclusions reported originally generated thresholds, 13 inclusions reported a statistical method with a computable action threshold model, and 44 inclusions mentioned only previously generated thresholds that were used in their study. Overall, the inclusions with thresholds that directly related to disease transmission conditions (“epidemiological thresholds”) outnumbered the inclusions with thresholds that directly related to mosquito abundance (“entomological thresholds”). The majority of the thresholds originated in Asia targeting dengue and dengue vectors. The review discusses the associated surveillance characteristics such as the possibility of using external data (previously recorded data), spatial and temporal variations in data used, and the importance of an adequate lead time to initiate control interventions that would help guide to plan better surveillance programs for the development of action thresholds.
