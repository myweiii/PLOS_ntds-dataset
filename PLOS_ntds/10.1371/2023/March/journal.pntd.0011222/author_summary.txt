The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main species responsible for urban transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. Control measures, including source reduction and insecticide treatment, have historically struggled to provide sustained control of this species to limit disease. An alternative approach involves releasing mosquitoes harbouring Wolbachia bacteria. Wolbachia inhibits virus transmission by Ae. aegypti and preliminary evidence indicates that dengue incidence is reduced in locations where it has been deployed. In this study, we found that Wolbachia significantly upregulates gene expression in Ae. aegypti at least 8 years after field deployment compared with uninfected controls, although some gene downregulation was also observed. We observed a more ‘muted’ response in mosquitoes from populations with older release histories, with far fewer genes being differentially regulated versus those from the most recent releases. Irrespective of release history, immune response and metabolism genes were significantly upregulated, and to a lesser extent genes related to behaviour. Our results, combined with previous studies that have revealed few changes in the Wolbachia genome post release, provide further evidence of the long-term stability of the effects of Wolbachia on introgressed mosquito populations in the field.
