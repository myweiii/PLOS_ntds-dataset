Over the past decades, several viral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes—dengue, chikungunya, Zika—have spread outside of tropical areas. To limit the transmission of these viruses and preserve the environment and human health, the use of mosquito traps has been developed as a complement or alternative to other vector control techniques.
This review supports the efficacy of mass trapping in combination with classical integrated vector control on the reduction in mosquito vector populations within several weeks of deployment. However, this research highlights gaps in the demonstration of the efficacy of mass trapping of mosquitoes in reducing viral transmission and disease. Thus, further studies are needed to establish the scientific evidence for the reduction of viral transmission risk by mass trapping targeting gravid and/or host-seeking female mosquitoes.
