We are grateful for the support of the coordinators and professionals who work in the Alto Solim√µes River Indigenous Health District, who collaborated in the articulation with indigenous caregivers for the collection of data. We would like to thank the technicians of the Health Research Coordination of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (COSAU/CNPq) and the National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) for providing the permits to carry out this study.
At present, an unprecedented health crisis is ongoing among the Yanomami Indigenous people, a native population in the Brazilian Amazon. We thank all health professionals (those from the Indigenous districts and volunteers), Indigenous leaders and social movements, and Indigenous caregivers, who never abandoned these peoples and who occupy these territories to maintain Indigenous healing practices.
