Ticks carry and transmit a variety of pathogens, and their host animals are widely distributed in nature with diverse epidemic links, so that several tick-borne diseases can coexist in the same foci, and even one type of tick or one tick can carry a variety of pathogens at the same time, these factors pose a serious public health threat. In our study, we summarized the regional differences in tick infection and co-infection rates outcomes in all Inner Mongolia of China, and found that pathogen diversity varied with ecogeographic differences such as gobi desert, grassland and forest. A variety of tick-borne bacterial pathogens were identified, with an overall high prevalence rate (61.4% of ticks infected), among infected ticks, 24.3% were co-infected. An unexpected high infection and co-infection rates of ticks collected from the Forest region of eastern Inner Mongolia (sample area 1) was detected. Geographical differences affect tick species and tick-borne pathogens, so the potential threat to humans or animals is also different. In particular, that that knowledge of co-infections is important as they do not just present diagnostic challenges, but the pathogens might play different roles within their respective hosts, thus modulating disease severity.
