Neglected tropical diseases that mainly affect low-income populations living in developing tropical regions. Examples include dengue fever, malaria and Chagas disease. Brazil is currently one of the countries most affected by these diseases. Research efforts seek solutions to control these diseases around the world, but resources used for this purpose are scarce. In addition, it is still necessary to further investigate the behavior of these diseases in the population, as well as develop new treatments and forms of diagnosis. The present study investigated research funding for neglected tropical diseases by the Ministry of Health between 2004 and 2020, demonstrating its evolution during this period, the diseases most studied and the relationship between the disease, its health situation and research funding in Brazil. This information is essential to diagnose the status of research funding for neglected tropical diseases in Brazil, indicating the need to increase or not the financial resources and which diseases require further research.
