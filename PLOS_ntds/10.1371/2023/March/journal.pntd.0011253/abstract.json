    "Background": "In Reunion Island, dengue outbreaks have been occurring since 2018. The healthcare facilities are facing the problem of managing a massive influx of patients and a growing care burden. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo rapid diagnostic test in adults consulting at an emergency department during the 2019 epidemic.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This retrospective study of diagnostic accuracy included patients over 18 years old, suspected of dengue, who were admitted to emergency units of the University Hospital of Reunion between the 1st of January and 30th of June, 2019, and were tested for dengue fever with the SD Bioline Dengue Duo rapid diagnostic test and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Over the study period, 2099 patients were screened retrospectively. Of them, 671 patients matched the inclusion criteria. The overall rapid diagnostic test performance was 42% for sensitivity and 15% for specificity. The non-structural 1 antigen component had a good specificity of 82% but a low sensitivity of 12%. The immunoglobulin M component had a sensitivity of 28% and a specificity of 33%. Sensitivities were slightly improved beyond the 5th day of illness compared to the early stage for all components, but only the non-structural 1 antigen component had a better specificity of 91%. Furthermore, predictive values were low and post-test probabilities never improved pre-test probabilities in our setting.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "These results suggest that the SD Bioline Dengue Duo RDT did not achieve sufficient performance levels to rule in, or discard, an early point of care dengue diagnosis in the emergency department during the 2019 epidemic in Reunion."
