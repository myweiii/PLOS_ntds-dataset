Dengue fever is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease. Most often mild, it can progress to a severe form that can lead to death. Since 2018, dengue outbreaks have occurred in Reunion Island, a French overseas territory, with an increasing number of confirmed cases and related deaths reported over these years. The care burden of dengue during epidemics often exceeds the capacity of health care facilities. To optimize the management of cases, it is necessary to diagnose infected patients early. However, clinical diagnosis is difficult as dengue occurs as an influenza-like illness with broad spectrum and non-specific symptoms, and laboratory confirmation is expensive, not immediate and not always available. Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) have been developed and could serve as a sensitive, specific, robust point of care diagnostic tool. Although promising, RDT performance is variable depending on the setting. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo RDT in emergency departments of Reunion during the 2019 epidemic. Results suggest that the SD Bioline Dengue Duo RDT did not achieve sufficient performance levels to rule in or discard an early point of care dengue diagnosis in our setting.
