Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are arbovirus with a wide geographic distribution that can cause serious diseases. The three pathogens are transmitted by the same vector and can present similar symptoms, hindering their identification and register. Despite the great efforts to control arboviruses diseases, Brazil still registers frequently epidemics. Scientific evidence of the association of the environment, vectors, humans, and their behaviors in the arbovirus transmission is vast, but little in know about those association in adolescents. This study focused on adolescents, a part of the population whose relationships with the social environment are different from those of adult and child populations, implying different types, and degrees of exposure to the vector, particularly in the school context. For this reason, this study aims to identify sociodemographic and environmental factors associated with Zika, dengue, and chikungunya disease in adolescents in Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza municipalities in Brazil from 2015 to 2019. The results obtained in this study highlight factors that may be influencing the transmission of Zika, dengue and Chikungunya, enabling effective measures to be implemented in the school context to control these arboviruses.
