The abundance of snake species and snakebites is a prominent issue in many tropical and subtropical developing countries. Thus, rapid diagnosis and selection of appropriate and effective antivenoms are the concomitant challenges that must be addressed. Neurotoxic snakebites, such as BM bites, usually occur late at night or accidentally, and local symptoms are not obvious after the bite, which results in difficulty in identifying the biting species. Administering a specific antivenom remains the most effective treatment for snakebite envenoming, thereby necessitating reliable, sensitive, and rapid diagnostic kits for BM bites. We constructed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a lateral flow assay (LFA) using two antibodies from different species to increase the sensitivity for venom detection and specifically identified BM venom. We found the device to be highly effective in samples of experimentally envenomed rats. The application of LFA will be conducive to appropriate antivenom administration and prevent adverse reactions.
