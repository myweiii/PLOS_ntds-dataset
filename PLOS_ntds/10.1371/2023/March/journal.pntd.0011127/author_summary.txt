Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Antibodies produced during dengue infection can cross-react with several self-antigens to the tissues of the body and contribute to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and vascular leakage in severe dengue. Autoimmunity might occur after dengue infection and cause some autoimmune diseases. Previous studies suggested some autoimmune diseases might be associated with dengue infection. Contrary to previous studies, our findings showed that dengue was associated with an increased short-term risk of a rare complication, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but not associated with other autoimmune diseases.
