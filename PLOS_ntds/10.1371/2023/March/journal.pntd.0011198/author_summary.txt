Toxoplasmosis, a zoonotic disease caused by a ubiquitous protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is usually asymptomatic. However, maternal infection during pregnancy can cause congenital toxoplasmosis with potentially severe neurologic or ophthalmological sequelae. Prevalence varies from country to country depending on socio-economic conditions, dietary habits and hygiene and the prevalence is higher in resource-poor countries. In Mayotte (a French overseas territory), recommendations for toxoplasmosis prevention and screening are partially applied. Indeed, many women donâ€™t speak French, serological follow up is generally irregular and responsible for delayed introduction of treatment and consequently more congenital toxoplasmosis cases. To our knowledge, few published data were available on maternal and congenital toxoplasmosis for this territory. A better understanding of the epidemiology of this parasite would allow surveillance, information and limitation of maternal-fetal transmission to reduce the number of congenital toxoplasmosis cases and improve the management of toxoplasmosis in Mayotte.
