We conducted a trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin based mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of scabies. We found that no reduction in scabies prevalence in either the one or two dose arms. However there was a reduction in the severity of scabies and prevalence of impetigo in both arms, to a similar degree.
