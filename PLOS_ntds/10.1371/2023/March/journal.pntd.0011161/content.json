    "Introduction": "Dengue, a global public health concern, is a mosquito-borne viral infection mostly in warm and tropical regions [1]. Dengue is transmitted through a human-mosquito-human cycle, with Aedes aegypti as the primary vector and followed by Aedes albopictus [2]. Dengue cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) have increased 10-fold during the past 20 years, from 0.5 million cases in 2000 to 2.4 million cases in 2010 and 5.2 million cases in 2019 [3]. Dengue is the only neglected tropical disease whose mortality rose from 1990 to 2019 [4], which is likely due to the interaction of climate change [5], traffic [6], population density [7], extreme poverty, and inadequate sanitation [8]. Dengue has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats by the WHO in 2019, which was confirmed by recent outbreaks in many countries [1], such as the 2019 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh [9]. Salje estimated that about a quarter of Bangladesh\u2019s population (about 40 million) was infected with dengue, with an average of 2.4 million infections per year [10]. In severe dengue, which may cause bleeding, organ dysfunction, and plasma leakage, there is a higher risk of death if it is not treated correctly, which has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death for children and adults [3]. As reported by Stanaway, dengue caused about 1.14 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2013 [11].\nThere is no specific antiviral therapy for dengue infection, but the symptoms can be managed [1]. According to the WHO, coordinated processes for early detection, classifying, treating, and referring severe dengue lower mortality to less than 1% [3]. Vector control is the main strategy for dengue control [12], but recent studies show that existing control measures have achieved little in curbing the rising incidence of dengue infection globally [13]. Finding biomarkers that can reliably predict the development of severe dengue in symptomatic individuals is one of the main focuses of current research efforts [6]. During the transition from the febrile period to the critical period, WHO highlights several clinical warning signs as potential signs of impending exacerbation [14]. However, predictive models using clinical warning signs are lacking [14]. Establishing an early warning system for severe dengue based on these factors is essential for triaging in endemic areas and optimizing resource utilization [6].\nOur previous study used the data to initially explore clinical symptoms of severe dengue among children during the 2019 outbreak in Bangladesh and suggested dengue was more severe in children, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms [9]. However, this study has not explored the high-order and combinative effect on different features. The classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) models are nonparametric statistical methods that do not rely on assumptions about data distribution to handle multiple independent variables interacting [15]. In this study, we aimed to use both CART and RF to explore the possible combination patterns of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue, eventually providing opportunities for early treatment and prevention of severe dengue and providing a reference for clinicians.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAll participants gave written informed consent. The protocol of the survey was approved by the Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of the Biomedical Research Foundation (Memo no: BRF/ERB/2019/017). In case of child participants, formal consent was obtained from the parent/guardian. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline for cross-sectional studies (S1 STROBE Statement).\n\n\nStudy site and data collection\nThis study was conducted in the Dhaka megacity (population = ~20M) of Bangladesh where a massive dengue outbreak occurred in 2019. We used convenience sampling technique to enroll hospitalized dengue cases from eight hospitals (five government and three private hospitals) between 15 August 2019 and 30 September 2019. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically by the positivity of antibodies against the dengue nonstructural glycoprotein 1 (NS1). Trained medical students and doctors collected the data via face-to-face interviews with a structured questionnaire. Data were collected at a one-time point at the convalescent phase to record all the clinical and laboratory complications patients developed during their hospital stay. The questionnaire was developed based on previously published literature and discussions with interdisciplinary teams (e.g., epidemiologists, clinicians, and public health workers), and details of the investigation can be found in the published literature [9]. A total of 1,283 patients with dengue were investigated by a structured questionnaire. Finally, 1,090 dengue cases were included in this study after excluding the incomplete data on age, sex, and type of dengue (missing rate: 14.18%) (S1 Fig).\nStandardized questionnaires (S1 Questionnaire) were used to collect information on demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers. Demographic characteristics included age (categorized as <18, 18\u201339, or \u2265 40 years), sex (dichotomized as men or women), education (categorized as illiterate or children, primary, secondary and high secondary school, or graduate), monthly income (categorized as <1,5000, 1,5000\u20132,5000, 2,5000\u201350,000, or \u2265 50,000 Bangladeshi taka), type of residence (categorized as flat, single storied house and other, or tin shade house), history of infection (categorized as dengue, chikungunya, or none), and history of comorbidity (dichotomized as yes or no). Clinical symptoms were asked about the presence of these symptoms [16], which included fever, rash, joint pain, dehydration, itchiness, plasma leakage, hemorrhage (dichotomized as yes or no), and muscle pain, vomiting, headache, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, cough, back pain, dyspnoea, lethargy (categorized as yes, no, or can\u2019t remember). In addition, biochemical markers included platelet counts, hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC, dichotomized as reduced or within normal), and alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) (categorized as raised, within normal, or not done). As per the National Guideline for Clinical Management of Dengue, symptomatic dengue cases were initially divided into three groups: dengue fever (group A), dengue fever with warning signs (group B), and severe dengue (group C). In this study, group A and group B were treated as the non-severe dengue group, while group C was treated as the severe dengue group [17].\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were employed to describe the counts (percentages) of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers grouped by severe dengue and non-severe dengue. Chi-square tests were used for group comparisons. Pairwise spearman\u2019s rank correlations were used to detect the inter-correlations between demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers. In this study, the missing values were less than 5% among most of the covariates. We used a listwise deletion method to deal with the missing data [18]. The logistic regression model was used to explore the associations between demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, biochemical markers, and the risk of severe dengue. We used the variance inflation factor (VIF) to estimate multicollinearity in the multiple logistic regression models.\nThe CART model was used to examine the combinative effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue and to identify the high-order no-linear pattern of developing severe dengue. To get the probability of severe dengue, dengue was treated as a scale factor in CART model. CART model was used to split the data into two parts that were as homogeneous as possible for the dependent variable. We conducted split-sample validation by using random assignment, which allowed the model to be generated using a training sample (80%) and tested on a hold-out sample (20%) [19]. For the minimum number of cases, we set the parent node to 30 and the child node to 10. To avoid overfitting the model, we also pruned the tree. Other parameters were set as default.\nThe RF model was used to find more important factors among demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers of severe dengue. In this study, the method of mean decreased accuracy was applied to compute the feature importance on permuted out-of-bag (OOB) samples [20]. Higher mean decreased accuracy implied more important features. Data were analyzed using R version 4.1.3 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The CART model was employed in SPSS 27.0. (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A two-sided P value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the RF model was performed using the \u2018randomForest\u2019 and \u2018rfPermute\u2019 packages in R software [20].",
    "Results": "Basic characteristics of the study participants with dengue\nA total of 1,090 dengue cases (158 severe and 932 non-severe) were included in this study. Overall, 652 (59.8%) were men, 553 (50.7%) aged 18\u201339 years. Compared to patients with non-severe dengue, patients with severe dengue were younger (aged <18 years) and more likely to be illiterate. There was no statistically significant difference between severe and non-severe dengue in other demographic characteristics (Table 1).\nOut of 1,090 dengue patients, 1,034 (94.9%) had fever, 691 (63.4%) muscle pain, 837 (76.8%) vomiting, 901 (82.7%) headache, 631 (57.9%) abdominal pain, 651 (59.7%) back pain, and 869 (79.7%) decreased appetite. Compared to patients with non-severe dengue, patients with severe dengue were more likely to have abdominal pain (P value = 0.04) (S1 Table).\nAmong 1,090 dengue patients, 972 (89.2%) appeared low platelet level, 315 (28.9%) had low hemoglobin level, 404 (37.1%) had low WBC, 183 (16.8%) raised ALT, and 148 (13.6%) raised AST (S2 Table).\n\n\nAssociation of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers with the risk of severe dengue\nLogistic regression model.In the crude logistic regression model, age, education, headache, abdominal pain, back pain, dyspnoea, plasma leakage, hemorrhage, and WBC were statistically significantly associated with severe dengue (S3 Table). Pairwise spearman\u2019s rank correlation showed that the coefficients among significant factors in the crude logistic regression ranged from -0.16 to 0.32 (S2 Fig). The factors significantly associated with the crude logistic regression model were included in the multiple logistic regression model. All VIF values were under 10 in the multiple logistic regression model, implying no substantial issue in multicollinearity (S4 Table). The results showed that patients with hemorrhage (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.73), plasma leakage (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.12 to 6.15), and dyspnoea (OR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.72 to 4.77) were positively associated with the risk of severe dengue (Table 2). The hemorrhage mainly occurred in the gum, hematochezia, and menorrhagia, and plasma leakage mainly in abdomen and chest (S5 Table). Furthermore, severe dengue in the non-DSS group was significantly higher in participants with plasma leakage or hemorrhage than in those without plasma leakage or hemorrhage (S6 Table). Compared to illiterate, primary education was associated with a lower risk of severe dengue (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.85). Compared to patients aged <18 years, patients aged 18\u201339 years (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.36) and >40 years (OR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.35) had less likely to have severe dengue (Table 2).\n\n\n\nCART models\nModel I: Demographic characteristics.The CART analysis showed that age (threshold: 11.5 years old) was the main associated factor, explaining 43.1% of severe dengue. S3 Fig shows that the prevalence of severe dengue was 55.2% for women aged between 1.9 and 11.5 years and with monthly income <25,000 BDT. Among patients aged >51.5 years, a higher education level (over primary education) and comorbidity explained 42.9% of severe dengue.\n\nModel II: Clinical symptoms.The prevalence of severe dengue was 76.5% for patients with plasma leakage, dyspnoea, and hemorrhage (S4 Fig). Patients without plasma leakage had 10.7% of severe dengue.\n\nModel III: Biochemical markers.S5 Fig shows that the prevalence of severe dengue was 54.3% for patients whose lowest platelet levels were between 71.5*109/L and 78.5*109/L. The lowest platelet (threshold: 71.5*109/L) was associated with factors for non-severe dengue (93.1%).\n\nModel IV: Combination of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers.The final CART model showed that age, dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and lowest platelet contributed to the predictive power of the CART algorithm. The prevalence of severe dengue across nodes ranged from 7% (age >12.5 years without plasma leakage) to 92.9% (age \u2264 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage). The prevalence of severe dengue was 60.0% among people aged > 12.5 years with plasma leakage, and the lowest platelet level was more than 126.5*109/L (Fig 1).\n\n\n\nRF model\nFig 2 shows that age was the most important variable (mean decrease accuracy = 23.6%) in predicting severe dengue, followed by education (11.6%), plasma leakage (9.9%), platelet (8.5%), and dyspnoea (7.2%) (S7 Table). The accuracy of RF model was 86.5%, and the OOB estimate of error rate was 13.5%.",
    "Discussion": "In this study, we have assessed the potential risk factors of severe dengue during the largest outbreak in Bangladesh in 2019 and detected the high-order combinative effect of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers for developing severe dengue. We found that dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and hemorrhage were the independent risk factors of severe dengue. The predictive probability of occurrence of severe dengue achieved 92.9% among people aged \u2264 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage. Furthermore, age was the most crucial variable in predicting severe dengue, followed by education, plasma leakage, platelet, and dyspnoea.\nOur research found that age was associated with the risk of severe dengue. A piece of evidence from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 showed that the age-standardized mortality rate and disability-adjusted life years for dengue in children were higher than in older people [4], which might relate to fragile capillaries in children than adults [21]. As previous studies reported, we found that the prevalence of severe dengue increased in specific populations, such as the older with comorbidities [22]. However, the degree of severity of dengue may differ from the different diseases [23], the type of comorbidity should be investigated in the future study. Additionally, our study found that patients who received higher educational levels were less likely to be infected with severe dengue, possibly because patients with higher educational attainment may be better aware of dengue infection and seek professional help promptly [24]. Moreover, women were more likely to be infected with severe dengue than men in this study. Results from several studies supported that men were likely to be infected with dengue in dengue epidemics, but women were more likely associated with severe dengue [25]. Sex-specific may be related to differences in visit time and type of care [26]. Therefore, educational public health campaigns might target lower-income areas, individuals with comorbidities, and families with children.\nThe most common characteristic of severe dengue is plasma leakage followed by hemorrhage [27], which supported our findings. Interestingly, we found that plasma leakage occurred mainly in children, which may be related to the lower leakage threshold in children than in adults [28]. Furthermore, we found that plasma leakage occurred mainly in the abdomen and chest, and that people with ascites and pleural effusion were more likely to develop severe dengue. Plasma leakage is an important outcome for dengue, as most complications occurred in this group. Identifying all plasma leakage is an important factor in preventing complications, but neither WHO classification fully covers the plasma leakage subgroup [29,30]. In addition, the definition and development of criteria for diagnosing plasma leakage have long been neglected, resulting in challenging and underreporting of plasma leakage. It is recommended that standardization of diagnosis and reporting of plasma leakage should be a research priority for dengue [31]. Moreover, we found that patients with hemorrhage were more likely to develop severe dengue than those without hemorrhage. Hemorrhage during dengue infection ranges from self-limiting epistaxis and bleeding gums to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, previous studies have found that hemorrhage is often attributed to thrombocytopenia [32], which is consistent with our findings. Thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage in dengue may result from cytokine-induced immune dysfunction and platelet destruction following the binding of dengue-specific antibodies to virus-infected platelets [32]. Lower platelet counts were more common in severe dengue [33] and were considered a risk factor for bleeding [34]. During dengue fever, platelet counts declined until fever subsides, then recovered rapidly [35]. Furthermore, we found that dyspnoea was a vital sign of severe dengue. Published research showed a significant association of dyspnoea with shock, which may result from fluid overload due to pulmonary congestion caused by capillary leakage [36]. Early recognition and treatment of dyspnea are essential for preventing severe dengue.\nFurthermore, clinicians should be vigilant in identifying dengue patients, as prompt identification and early treatment of dengue remain the cornerstone of reducing morbidity and mortality [37]. In recent years, climate change, environmental pollution, poor health systems, and population growth have been exacerbating the dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh [38]. Clinicians should be aware of the different presentations of severe dengue in children versus adults and carefully evaluate the children for plasma leakage, which may be more challenging to identify than severe bleeding. As reported, if detected early and with appropriate medical care, the mortality rate of dengue was less than 1% in Bangladesh [39]. To reduce mortality from severe dengue, clinicians need to be trained in managing severe dengue [40] and focus on the high-risk populations of dengue-affected areas [41]. The results of our study identified possible combinations of severe dengue, which would provide an essential reference for the early identification, and treatment of severe dengue fever, especially for patients without DSS.\nIn the research, we used machine learning algorithms, including CART and RF, to find key risk factors and to identify the combined effect of risk factors on all severe dengue cases, which include cases with key symptoms such as hemorrhage and plasma leakage etc, and without these key symptoms. Our results will provide very useful warning signals for all dengue cases for clinical doctors. However, there are some limitations to this study. First, our results need to be confirmed by further prospective studies due to the cross-sectional design. Some risk factors, especially biomarkers and clinical symptoms, may be affected by the process of dengue. Second, the biomarkers, such as platelet counts, were only measured once in this study. However, the levels of biomarkers were more likely to be affected by the status and treatment of diseases. The changes in biomarkers (particularly platelet counts) may carry meaningful information, and developing models incorporating repeatedly measured longitudinal data will improve the accuracy of risk prediction. However, results from the present study have provided new evidence on the high-order interactive effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, biochemical markers, and severe dengue. The finding will provide enhanced insight into clinical treatment and inform prevention programming for severe dengue. Third, due to regional differences, the results of this study may not be generalizable to other regions. Fourth, patients were interviewed during the convalescent phase; therefore, some recall biases are inevitable in this study. However, this should be negligible as most of the dengue patients reach convalescent within 7\u201310 days of starting symptoms [29]. Lastly, given that the risk of developing severe dengue could be associated with secondary infections [42]. The study did not explore this relationship because of lack of detailed data on IgG (an indicator of secondary infection) and dengue virus serotypes.\nIn conclusion, combined with socio-environmental factors, early recognition and treatment of dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and hemorrhage are vital to the prevention of severe dengue. The research provides new evidence to identify key risk factors that contribute to severe dengue cases, which would add new evidence for the early identification and treatment of severe dengue fever. Future research is required to further explore the progression and shifting from non-severe dengue to severe dengue based on the research finding."
