Scrub typhus is an understudied disease caused by the intracellular bacterium O. tsutsugamushi. A hallmark of scrub typhus is the unexplained, non-durable immunity after infection. While cellular immune responses are known to be important for controlling this infection, our understanding of B cell and GC responses remains limited. In this study, we examined B cell activation and GC responses using our recently established murine model of severe scrub typhus. We measured bacterial antigen-specific antibody titers and identified IgG2c, an IFN-Î³-driven isotype, as the major IgG subtype. We also found that O. tsutsugamushi infection disrupted spleen morphology, exemplified by randomly dispersed T cells and lost GC structures. Transcriptomic analysis of purified splenic B cells demonstrated reduced expression of genes encoding critical adhesion and co-stimulation molecules, including GC-adhesion gene S1PR2, at severe stages of infection. Several humoral immune response pathways relevant to B cell receptor signaling, B cell activation and differentiation were significantly downregulated during infection. This study is the first report describing humoral immunity in a scrub typhus mouse model and provides detailed evidence that B cell and GC responses are impaired during acute infection.
