Melanin as an important virulence factor for Sporothrix globosa, analysis of the effects on host immunity, is of great significance for guidance regarding future directions of studies on the mechanism underling fungal pathogenesis. In recent years, accumulating evidence supports a role for autophagy as a host defense mechanism to counteract the evasion strategies of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of melanin on autophagy in macrophages, with particular attention in Sporothrix spp. to explore the mechanism of melanin interaction with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced pathways. In addition, this work also served as an important theoretical supplement for our previous research on S. globosa melanin. We believe that our research makes a significant contribution to the melanin pigment in fungi because although a lot of progress is being made in the field of pathogenic fungi, most studies are in animal macrophages in vitro studies; exploring the macrophage autophagy will provide a novel immune defense ability of S. globosa melanin to inhibit macrophage.
