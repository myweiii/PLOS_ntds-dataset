    "Abstract": "Understanding the transmission of Schistosoma hæmatobium in the Senegal River Delta requires knowledge of the snails serving as intermediate hosts. Accurate identification of both the snails and the infecting Schistosoma species is therefore essential. Cercarial emission tests and multi-locus (COX1 and ITS) genetic analysis were performed on Bulinus forskalii snails to confirm their susceptibility to S. hæmatobium infection. A total of 55 Bulinus forskalii, adequately identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, were assessed. Cercarial shedding and RT-PCR assays detected 13 (23.6%) and 17 (31.0%), respectively, Bulinus forskalii snails parasitized by S. hæmatobium complex fluke. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified S. hæmatobium in 6 (11.0%) using COX1 and 3 (5.5%) using ITS2, and S. bovis in 3 (5.5%) using COX1 and 3 (5.5%) using ITS2. This result is the first report of infection of Bulinus forskalii by S. hæmatobium complex parasites in Senegal using innovative and more accurate identification methods to discriminate this snail and characterize its infection by S. hæmatobium."
