Bunyaviruses cause a significant number of human infections, and while most are relatively benign, in severe cases encephalitis and/or meningitis can develop. Little is known about the biological processes that allow bunyaviruses to enter the brain, and why this results in neuropathology in some cases. Available models are frequently based on direct intracranial infection in animals with impaired or underdeveloped immune systems. Here we have infected subadult hamsters via either the intraperitoneal or the subcutaneous route with one of three different bunyaviruses: Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), Batai virus or Ngari virus. Only BUNV infection resulted in clinical disease, with infected animals exhibiting weight loss, lethargy and neurological signs of disease. Consistent with these observations pathological abnormalities and viral antigen were found extensively throughout the brain. The establishment of this new model is significant because it makes use of immunologically competent animals and relies on an inoculation route that more closely mimics the natural route of infection through insect bites. As such, it provides an important basis for studying neuroinvasion and the development of neuropathology during bunyavirus infection as well as for the testing of antiviral approaches targeting these viruses.
