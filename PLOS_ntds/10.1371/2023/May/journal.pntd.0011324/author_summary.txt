Thiamine is an essential micronutrient with a pivotal role in mitochondrial energetics and oxidative and nonoxidative carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine deficiency is a frequently neglected problem of significance across Southeast Asia, where beriberi is endemic. There are multiple reports of infantile beriberi, gastric beriberi, high-output heart failure and postpartum neuropathy from Kashmir, a northern Indian state. The reports of infantile beriberi in exclusively breastfed infants suggest maternal thiamine deficiency during pregnancy. Additionally, pregnancy puts a physiological strain on micronutrient physiology to fulfil the demands of the mother, placenta, and fetus. Although recent studies have reported thiamine deficiency-related diseases in the region, this is the first representative data assessing the biochemical evidence of thiamine deficiency in pregnant women from Kashmir. We conducted a cross-sectional explorative study to describe the prevalence of thiamine deficiency in pregnant women of Kashmir and its perinatal outcome. A total of 492 women across three trimesters of pregnancy were enrolled for the study. We found a high prevalence (38.2%) of thiamine deficiency among pregnant women of Kashmir. The low thiamine status was associated with poor socioeconomic status, poor nutritional status and higher consumption of staple polished white rice, and tea. Our study also reported poor perinatal outcome in association with the low thiamine status of the mother, suggesting a possibility of thiamine deficiency in the early neonatal period.
