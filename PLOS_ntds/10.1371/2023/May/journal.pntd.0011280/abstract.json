    "Background": "Blood meal and infections cause redox imbalance and oxidative damage in mosquitoes which triggers the mosquitoâ€™s system to produce antioxidants in response to increased oxidative stress. Important pathways activated owing to redox imbalance include taurine, hypotaurine and glutathione metabolism. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of these pathways during chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.",
    "Methodology": "Using a dietary L-cysteine supplement system, we upregulated these pathways and evaluated oxidative damage and oxidative stress response upon CHIKV infection using protein carbonylation and GST assays. Further, using a dsRNA based approach, we silenced some of the genes involved in synthesis and transport of taurine and hypotaurine and then evaluated the impact of these genes on CHIKV infection and redox biology in the mosquitoes.",
    "Conclusions": "We report that CHIKV infection exerts oxidative stress in the A. aegypti, leading to oxidative damage and as a response, an elevated GST activity was observed. It was also observed that dietary L-cysteine treatment restricted CHIKV infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes. This L-cysteine mediated CHIKV inhibition was coincided by enhanced GST activity that further resulted in reduced oxidative damage during the infection. We also report that silencing of genes involved in synthesis of taurine and hypotaurine modulates CHIKV infection and redox biology of Aedes mosquitoes during the infection."
