Urbanization is a major trend in human evolution. By 2050, over 2/3 of the world population will live in urban areas. A key challenge associated with such a global trend is to protect urban residents against infectious diseases, while their environment may provide favourable conditions for parasites and other pathogens. The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a typical vector borne pathogen whose transmission to human is expected to be facilitated in urban environments, where mosquitoes transmitting the virus are favored. Here, we looked at the barely known effects of changes in the host bird community on the risk of WNV outbreak in humans. By designing empiricaly informed mathematical models of WNV transmission in the city of Merida, Mexico, we identified a 3-weeks summer period during which the virus circulation in urban birds lead to a risk of outbreaks in humans. Further analyses showed that changes in the bird community could increase the risk period up-to 6-fold and rise the daily risk by 40%. Such variations are primarily driven by the increase in a key reservoir species, Quiscalus mexicanus, whose effects are 4â€“5 times larger than those of other changes in the bird community. To control the current and future risks of WNV outbreaks in Merida requires reducing the mosquito population by 13% and up to 56%, respectively. These results strongly call for an epidemiological monitoring and preemptive measures targeting both C. quinquefasciatus and Q. mexicanus populations, as they are expected to have synergistic effects.
