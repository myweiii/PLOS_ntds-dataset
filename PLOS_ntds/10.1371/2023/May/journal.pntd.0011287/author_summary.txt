Although Entamoeba genus consists of many different species, not all are pathogenic. Entamoeba histolytica is the only species recognized as a definite pathogen associated with intestinal and extraintestinal infections. Nowadays, the importance of other morphologically identical Entamoeba species, like amphizoic E. moshkovskii is increasing, as it has been reported in human patients over the years from different countries. Investigations into the pathogenic potential of E. moshkovskii are ongoing, and only limited studies have been conducted on genetic characterization from India. This study reveals the epidemiology and population structure of E. moshkovskii in diarrhoeal patients from eastern India. Our study showed that the prevalence of E. moshkovskii in diarrhoeal patients is higher than E. histolytica in the studied region. In addition, there was a unique seasonal pattern, found for the infection. The high prevalence rate of sole infection in patients suggests that it is one of the definite etiological agents for diarrhoeal disease in eastern India. The further study identified two SNPs in the 18S rRNA locus, significantly associated with the sole infection cases and hence they can be regarded as a marker for identifying pathogenic isolates of E. moshkovskii. Many novel genotypes were obtained in the study indicating high genetic diversity in E. moshkovskii population conferring adaptability in a changing environment. Further research is needed to ensure proper control measures for this infection for better health care.
