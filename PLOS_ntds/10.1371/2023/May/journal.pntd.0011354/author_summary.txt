Lassa virus is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa and yet to date there is limited information on its epidemiology in pregnancy. Information obtained from epidemiology studies is important because such information facilitates the design and costing of disease control programs and the design of clinical trials. Our study evaluated the epidemiology of Lassa fever in pregnant women specifically we looked at the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for infection in pregnant women in South Nigeria. We found that 49.6% of pregnant women had antibodies to Lassa virus suggesting about 50% of pregnant women were at risk of Lassa infection. Additionally, while, the evidence was not conclusive, we found an appreciable risk of contracting Lassa fever during pregnancy. Given that, Lassa fever has high case fatality in pregnancy, our data supports the need for vaccines and drugs against Lassa fever. Our study also suggests that 35.0% of infections might be preventable by avoiding rodent exposure and conditions which facilitate rodent infestation and the risk of human-rodent contact. This suggests that public health measures such as proper sanitation and hygiene, improved housing and health education may be beneficial in reducing the risk of infection.
