Our review summarizes the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of non-viral co-infections in leprosy patients, including tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, chromoblastomycosis, and helminths. By conducting a systematic literature search, my colleagues and I identified 89 studies and found a male-dominated pattern of co-infections among working-age individuals with multibacillary leprosy. Our findings suggest that co-infections with tuberculosis and leishmaniasis may reduce the occurrence of leprosy reactions, which is in contrast to prior studies reporting increased reactions in chronic viral co-infections. Additionally, we observed that the occurrence of leprosy reactions varied from 37% to 81% across studies, depending on the type of helminth co-infection, which is higher than the general population. Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding the potential impact of co-infections on leprosy patients, as it may affect their disease outcomes and treatment. This information is relevant not only to researchers and healthcare providers but also to the general public, as leprosy is still a significant public health problem in many parts of the world. Our review adds to the growing body of knowledge in the field of infectious diseases and underscores the need for further research on this topic.
