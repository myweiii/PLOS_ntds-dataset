Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by Simuliidae black flies. This disease is most common in Africa and South America. Onchocerca volvulus is thought to infect approximately 35 million Africans these days. Adult female worms infect people and form subcutaneous nodules, releasing thousands of microfilariae per day, causing itching, dermatitis, blindness, and epilepsy. Despite the fact that the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy was already mentioned in a study from Mexico in 1938, this association was only reported around 1991 in Africa in the Mbam valley in Cameroon. Onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) is characterised by seizures that start between the ages of 3 and 18 years in previously healthy children with a high degree of O. volvulus infection. Raising awareness about OAE will increase adherence to community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), particularly in high-prevalence areas, while also motivating funders and stakeholders to keep fighting onchocerciasis. Here, we create an OAE model within the framework of ONCHOSIM that is parametrized using South Sudan data and investigate how different control measures such as CDTI and vector control might help reduce OAE in the future.
