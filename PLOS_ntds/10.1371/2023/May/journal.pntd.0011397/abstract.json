    "Background": "The study assessed the risk of transmission of Aedes-borne arboviruses in a community at Cape Coast during the Covid-19 restriction period in 2020 based on entomological indices. The spatial distribution of insecticide resistance was also assessed in Ae. aegypti population from Cape Coast.",
    "Methods": "Three larval indices were calculated from a household larval survey in 100 randomly selected houses. WHO susceptibility bioassay was performed on female adult Ae. aegypti that were reared from the larvae collected from household containers and other receptacles located outside houses against four insecticides. The mosquitoes were also screened for F1534C, V1016I, and V410L kdr mutations.",
    "Results": "The estimated larval indices in the study community were House index– 34%, Container index– 22.35%, and Breteau index– 2.02. The mosquito population was resistant to Deltamethrin (0.05%), DDT (4%), Fenitrothion (1%), and Bendiocarb (0.1%). A triple kdr mutation, F1534C, V410L and V1016I were detected in the mosquito population.",
    "Conclusion": "The study found the risk of an outbreak of Aedes-borne diseases lower in the covid-19 lockdown period than before the pandemic period. The low risk was related to frequent clean-up exercises in the community during the Covid-19 restriction period. Multiple insecticide resistance couple with three kdr mutations detected in the study population could affect the effectiveness of control measures, especially in emergency situations. The study supports sanitation improvement as a tool to control Ae. aegypti and could complement insecticide-based tools in controlling this vector."
