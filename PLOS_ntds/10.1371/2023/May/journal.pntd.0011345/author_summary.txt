Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) remain a public health problem in endemic areas even though they are among the five preventive chemotherapy controlled neglected tropical diseases which benefit from regular mass distributions of antiparasitic drugs. Equatorial Guinea is known to be endemic for STH. However, epidemiological data on these infections needed for an effective control program are scarce or inexistent. For deworming implementation, passive strategies consisting of deworming of young children during vaccination campaigns and systematic treatment of children consulting at hospital for helminth-like symptoms are being implemented, as well as distribution of albendazole during lymphatic filariasis community mass treatment. In the present work, we provide current epidemiological data on STH infection in Bata district, which is the largest and most populated among the nineteen districts of Equatorial Guinea. We reported a high prevalence of STH infections of low to moderate intensity in the study areas, where school age children are more at-risk age group, and periâ€“urban area the more at-risk area. Our findings highlight the need to implement the WHO recommendations for control of STH infections in the country, such as mass drug administration of anthelminthic twice a year with great attention to pre-school-age children and school aged children. Health Education and other preventive measures such as WASH should be taken in consideration.
