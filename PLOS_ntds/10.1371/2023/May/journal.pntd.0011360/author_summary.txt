Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL) is an important disease affecting dogs in several regions of the world. Of great zoonotic importance, it is caused by the protozoon L. infantum that is transmitted through the bite of insect sandflies. The treatment of this disease has been considered a challenge and currently, there are no drugs able to promote a complete parasitological cure. In this study, we evaluated an immuno-therapeutic treatment administered intranasally (IN) in dogs naturally infected with L. infantum at stage 2. Interestingly, two IN administrations were as efficient as 28 administrations of the Miltefosine treatment to reduce the skin and bone marrow parasite burden, as well as clinical scores. Interestingly, the IFAT decreased sharply, and no side effects were observed. These results demonstrate that the immuno-therapeutic treatment herein used may be a promising tool for the treatment of dogs, and consequently the protection of humans.
