Why was this study done?

Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic round worms. The infective worm larvae are transmitted by black flies that breed near rivers in sub-Saharan Africa. The parasites cause severe skin disease with itching and ocular disease; the common name for the infection is “river blindness”. WHO has targeted onchocerciasis for elimination and mass drug administration is the key intervention strategy.
There is an urgent need for improved treatments to kill or permanently sterilize the adult parasites. This study tested a combination drug treatment that is quite effective for treating other related worm infections.


What did the researchers do and find?

We performed a randomized clinical trial that compared a triple drug combination with a standard of care two-drug treatment that is widely used in Africa. We found that the new treatment was as safe as the standard treatment.
More importantly, analysis of adult female worms surgically removed from study participants suggested that the new treatment might be more effective than the standard treatment for killing or permanently sterilizing the parasites. However, this first study was too small to provide conclusive results.


What do these findings mean?

An improved treatment could improve chances for eliminating onchocerciasis in Africa.
Results from this study can be used to better plan follow-up studies to explore the value of this and other new combination treatments for onchocerciasis.
