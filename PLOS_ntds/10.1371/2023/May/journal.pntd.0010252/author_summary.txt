Infectious communicable diseases are currently one of the main burdens for human beings and public health. The comprehension of their spread and maintenance is one of the main goals to facilitate their control and eradication, but due to the complexity of their cycles and transmission processes, obtaining this information is often difficult and demanding. The control of vector-borne diseases in particular represents an important and very complex challenge for public health. Mathematical models are suitable tools to investigate disease dynamics and their transmission mechanisms and processes. To build a suitable model that can simulate transmission dynamics, a reliable and precise estimate of parameters for measuring transmission mechanisms is fundamental. We thus propose a sensitivity analysis of four unknown epidemiological parameters (bird recovery rate, mosquito biting rate, avian susceptibility to infection and avian competence to infection) that play a crucial role in driving West Nile virus (WNV) infection to determine which of them have the greatest impact on infection spread. This analysis suggests that the infectious period in birds and mosquito biting rate are the parameters to be prioritised in investigation to increase our ability to model WNV spread.
