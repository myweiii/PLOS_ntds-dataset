Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical and zoonotic disease, infecting over 230 million people and millions of animals worldwide. The potential contribution of livestock schistosomiasis to disease transmission in human populations has implications for the design of effective disease management and elimination programmes. However, our understanding of the true prevalence and impact of animal schistosomiasis is severely limited, in part due to a lack of accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. This need for sensitive and specific tools for animal schistosomiasis diagnosis has been recognised in the most recent WHO Guideline and NTD roadmap. As a point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) diagnostic test is now available to assess intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni in humans, we hypothesised that POC-CCA could be used to detect livestock intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of POC-CCA for the detection of intestinal livestock schistosomiasis in Senegal. POC-CCA sensitivity varied by ruminant group and by parasite species/location, while POC-CCA specificity in small ruminants, at least, did not vary across populations. We conclude that, whilst the currently-available POC-CCA does represent a potential diagnostic tool for schistosomiasis in cattle, the factors determining test performance warrant further investigation and further livestock-specific assays would be ideal.
