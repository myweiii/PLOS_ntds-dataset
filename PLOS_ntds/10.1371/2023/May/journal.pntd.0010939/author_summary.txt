Sri Lanka records a high annual incidence rate of leishmaniasis. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis are crucial to reduce complications and infection transmission and to facilitate a speedy recovery. Delayed healthcare-seeking in cutaneous leishmaniasis hinders effective disease management leading to a significant burden for the affected people and the healthcare systems. Therefore, this study explored how people with cutaneous leishmaniasis describe and interpret early symptoms of the disease and behave in a certain way leading to a substantial time gap between the notice of symptoms and seeking healthcare. Our study findings are important for three primary purposes; 1) for designing awareness-raising and public health campaigns related to cutaneous leishmaniasis for the general public, 2) for healthcare professionals to conduct an early and accurate clinical diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis and initiate prompt treatment following laboratory confirmation, leading to much-improved disease management and 3) for policymakers to revisit and tailor the national and regional level guidelines and programmes related to leishmaniasis toward successful prevention, early diagnosis, effective treatment and control of the disease.
