Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a neglected but important risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. It is necessary to decipher the mechanism of cognitive deficits induced by the parasite and develop intervention therapy. Here, we showed that chronic T. gondii infection induces the deficits of the goal-directed behavior, which is associated with the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the global expression pattern in the brain area of the infected mice is characterized by the downregulation of the genes associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity, and the upregulation of the genes related to neuroinflammation including the activation makers of microglia and astrocytes. Interestingly, the ACOD1-itaconate axis, a key node modulating immunity and metabolism, is activated post infection. We reported that dimethyl itaconate (the derivative of itaconate) effectively prevents and treats the goal-directed cognitive deficits induced by T. gondii, which was proved by the improvement of the synaptic ultrastructure impairment and neuroinflammation. Overall, these findings provide a novel insight for understanding the mechanism of cognitive deficits induced by T. gondii and developing a therapeutic strategy against the parasite-related neurodegenerative diseases.
