Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) have long been recognized as public health problems in Angola, including Huambo, Uige and Zaire provinces. To address these neglected tropical diseases, the Angolan Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the MENTOR Initiative and END Fund have been implementing school preventive chemotherapy (PC) from 2013 for STHs and 2014 for schistosomiasis. Additionally, the school PC program has been complemented by a school WASH program in a subset of schools from 2016. To assess the impact of the school program on the prevalence and burden of schistosomiasis and STHs, parasitological surveys were conducted in 2021 that included 17,880 schoolchildren from 599 schools in the schistosomiasis survey and 6,461 schoolchildren from 214 schools in the STH survey. Access and use of WASH interventions was also assessed via questionnaires for each school participating in the parasitological surveys, and compared between WASH supported and unsupported schools. When compared to the results of the 2014 survey there has been limited reduction in the prevalence of schistosomiasis and STHs across the three provinces. A higher proportion of schools that received WASH support provided schoolchildren with better WASH conditions.
