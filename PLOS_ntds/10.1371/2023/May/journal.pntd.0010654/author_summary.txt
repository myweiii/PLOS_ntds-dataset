Both HIV and schistosomiasis (bilharzia) remain public health threats especially in fishing communities along the Great Rift Valley in Africa. HIV remains generalized in fishing communities with up to 20% of fishing communities living with HIV. Similarly, although schistosomiasis is focal fishing communities often have very high prevalence of active schistosomiasisâ€“range 5% to 55%. Fishing exposes individuals to schistosomiasis due to ongoing contact with fresh water and HIV due to economic empowerement brought by catching fish. In this study we found that most fishermen did not know their HIV status and that uptake of free schistostomiasis prophylactic treatment was very low in Mangochi Malawi. However, we found that fishermen who engaged with health services were more likely to know their HIV status and also to take schistosomiasis treatment. We further found extremely high willingness to engage with mobile clinics offering HIV and schistosomiasis integrated services that would be made locally available to the fishing communities.
