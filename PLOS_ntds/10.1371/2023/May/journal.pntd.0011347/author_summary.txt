Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a parasitic disease caused by infection with filarial worms and is currently endemic in 72 countries. Mass drug administration (MDA) is used to interrupt LF transmission, in order to reduce LF prevalence below a target threshold set by the World Health Organization. When prevalence is below said threshold, continued LF transmission is believed to be unsustainable. American Samoa implemented seven rounds of MDA from 2000–2006 and, more recently, a further three rounds of MDA in 2018, 2019, and 2021. Despite these recent interventions, American Samoa has not yet reached elimination targets. In this study we use GEOFIL, a LF transmission model specific to American Samoa, to investigate the most efficient interventions for LF elimination—whether to continue with MDA or instead try targeted surveillance and treatment strategies. We find that, without further intervention, LF prevalence will rise, but further rounds of MDA have the potential to eliminate LF. Household-focused targeted surveillance and treatment interventions also have the ability to eliminate LF using far fewer treatments than MDA; however, they require testing a large number of people. Furthermore, we found that reducing antigen prevalence below threshold targets does not necessarily guarantee successful long-term elimination.
