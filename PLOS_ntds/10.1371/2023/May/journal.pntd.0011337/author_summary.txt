Sarcoptes scabiei is a permanent obligate ectoparasite causing contagious disease in humans and other mammals worldwide. Sarcoptes mites undergo three molts in their lifetime, however, there is limited information on their molting process. Oral ivermectin is widely used for the treatment of Sarcoptes infection in humans and animals. To investigate whether ivermectin is active against molting Sarcoptes mites, we first explored the molting process of Sarcoptes mites in vitro, and then assess the activity of ivermectin. We demonstrated that the average molt period lasts for about 2 days. When exposed to ivermectin, one-third of molting mites survived whereas all active mites died. The present study suggests that mites may survive after two doses of ivermectin 7 days apart due to the resistance of mites during the molting process.
