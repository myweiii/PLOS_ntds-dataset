Intestinal parasitic infections remain a public health concern in poor-resource areas in Ecuador, primarily affecting paediatric populations. Our results indicate that mass drug administration programs targeting intestinal helminths, including STH, are insufficient to effectively control the spreading and perpetuation of these pathogens in deprived communities. These interventions must be complemented with measures directed to improve household quality and living conditions, sanitation, and health education for schoolchildren and their families. Together with access to safe drinking water, these measures are necessary to reduce infections with STH and GP in poor communities in Ecuador. Under the One Health approach, more research should be conducted to ascertain to which extent the animal reservoirs (livestock, wildlife) and contaminated environmental (water, soil, grass) contribute to the burden of human disease caused by intestinal parasites.
