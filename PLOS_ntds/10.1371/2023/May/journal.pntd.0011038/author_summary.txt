A potentially fatal disease, neuroangiostrongyliasis, is caused by the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). The parasite migrates into the spinal cord and brain of accidental hosts, such as humans and dogs, after ingestion of infective larvae, for example by eating snails in garden fruit or vegetables. Recently, an ultrasensitive molecular assay which can detect tiny fragments of the parasite’s DNA was developed and has been used to establish a diagnosis. Although this assay outperforms previously developed assays, it requires clean DNA with specialised equipment in a laboratory setting. There is an urgent need for an alternative diagnostic method which is sensitive and portable, for deployment in the field and in hospitals in remote areas or in low-income countries. The authors developed a fast and portable loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that compares favourably to the ultra-sensitive PCR assay when tested using cerebrospinal fluid from dogs on the Australian east coast with presumptive neuroangiostrongyliasis. Considering a ‘One Health’ approach to diagnostics, this assay enables portable emergency diagnostics equally suitable to humans, dogs and wildlife. The newly developed assay will also enable water supplies to be screened, as well as crustaceans and molluscs used as potential food sources, for presence of the parasite.
