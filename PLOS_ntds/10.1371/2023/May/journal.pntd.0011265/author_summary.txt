Schistosoma (S.) japonicum was once hyper-endemic in southern China. Jiangling County is one of the key endemic areas of schistosomiasis in Hubei Province, P.R. China. Although the prevalence of schistosomiasis in Jiangling County has decreased significantly, the geographical location of Jiangling County is suitable for snails breeding due to the crisscrossed ditches, so the risk of schistosomiasis transmission is still widespread. This study analyzed the schistosomiasis transmission risk in different regions in Jiangling County from 2005 to 2021, and targeted transmission risk intervention strategies can be adopted in different endemic areas after schistosomiasis transmission interruption. The areas with high risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Jiangling County were mainly distributed in the central part of Jiangling County near the west main ditch and the eastern part of Jiangling County. It is suggested strengthen schistosomiasis risk monitoring in Jiangling County, especially snails monitoring and snails elimination. In addition, health education intervention should be strengthened in key areas to prevent the spread of transmission risk to surrounding areas, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as soon as possible.
