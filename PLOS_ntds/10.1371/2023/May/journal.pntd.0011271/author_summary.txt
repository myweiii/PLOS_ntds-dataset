A high incidence of scorpion sting affects several Mexican states, including Guerrero, sometimes resulting in death. This cross-sectional study in seven highly marginalized communities of Chilapa Municipality administered a household survey to collate information on 4,898 people. Analysis focused on scorpion stings and risk factors related to the work processes of women and men, including cooking and housework. Men were at greater risk due to their agricultural work. Other factors like keeping poultry and storing firewood in the home also carry higher risks. Targeted low cost local actions could reduce the risks substantially.
