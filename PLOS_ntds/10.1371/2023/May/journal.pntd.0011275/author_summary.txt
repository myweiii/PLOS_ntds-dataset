Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy has the potential to cause vision abnormalities even in the absence of overt ocular structural abnormalities or congenital Zika syndrome. We were able to classify infants’ ZIKV exposure status by applying a serological algorithm of Zika antibodies in maternal and umbilical cord blood samples. We evaluated the ophthalmological abnormalities in children born in Nicaragua during the American ZIKV epidemic of 2015–2017 with no clinical abnormality detected at birth. We performed eye examinations on the children at 16–21 months of age, and neurocognitive testing by the Mullens Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) was performed at 24 months of age. Visual impairment, a composite measure of abnormal visual function and/or visual reception score was significantly more common in ZIKV-exposed than in unexposed children. We found a nonsignificant trend for a higher proportion of children exposed to ZIKV in utero had abnormal visual function and abnormal contrast testing than unexposed children. The visual reception score from the MSEL was also higher in Zika-exposed children, but these relationships did not reach statistical significance. These impairments could have implications for later academic performance, specifically reading. Early intervention may limit the morbidity associated with congenital ZIKV exposure.
