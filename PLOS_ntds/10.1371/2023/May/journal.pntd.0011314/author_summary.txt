Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) with skin manifestations are a group of nine infectious diseases with skin manifestations, either as the primary symptom or as an associated clinical feature. They are often co-endemic and harbor similar clinical signs.
We evaluated the implementation of an integrated approach to the early detection and rapid treatment of skin NTDs based on consultations using mobile teams in the départements of Ouémé and Plateau in Benin.
In total, 5,267 patients with various skin conditions consulted. We saw 646 (12.3%) patients presenting NTDs with skin manifestations and among them, 571 (88.4%) had scabies, 37 (5.8%) had Buruli ulcer, 22 (3.4%) had leprosy, 15 (2.3%) had lymphatic filariasis and 1 (0.2%) had mycetoma.
Consultations using mobile teams constitute a very efficient strategy for the integrated screening of skin diseases and especially of NTDs with skin manifestations. This sustainable approach could help to decrease the burden of NTDs in resource-limited countries.
