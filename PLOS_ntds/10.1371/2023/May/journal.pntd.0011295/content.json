    "Introduction": "The burden of Histoplasma capsulatum is sparsely documented in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Kenya where histoplasmosis has been recognised as a priority disease of national public health concern [1,2]. Histoplasmin skin sensitivity surveys conducted in a limited number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa have recorded test positivity rates between 0.0 and 35.0% in populations with variable demographic and clinical characteristics [3–11]. These findings indicate that H. capsulatum is present within this geographic region. However, further research is warranted to explore the factors contributing to varying prevalence between different geographic areas and environments, the risk factors for exposure and infection, and the incidence and clinical outcomes of histoplasmosis.\nThe limited research in this area is confounded by multiple barriers to the identification and management of human histoplasmosis, which comprise: (i) case under-reporting; (ii) case mis-diagnosis; (iii) limited access to clinical facilities for case diagnosis or treatment; (iv) limited access to anti-fungal treatments; (v) cost-prohibitive diagnostic or treatment methods; and (vi) poor definition of transmission routes and risk factors for exposure [12–15]. These barriers present a significant challenge to histoplasmosis surveillance, treatment, and infection control and thus limit our understanding of how H. capsulatum exposure or infection impacts the Kenyan population.\nA number of risk factors for histoplasmosis are widely acknowledged; however, evidence of contextual factors relevant to sub-Saharan Africa remains limited. Disseminated histoplasmosis has been identified as a major AIDS-defining disease presentation of HIV-infected patients [16]. In contrast to disease course in immunocompetent hosts, which is typically characterised as asymptomatic and self-limiting [17], patients with H. capsulatum and HIV co-infection have demonstrated significant morbidity and mortality rates in the absence of appropriate treatment [18,19].\nOccupational and recreational activities speculated to increase risk of aerosolisation and inhalation of infective H. capsulatum microconidia have been described in histoplasmosis case and outbreak reports and hospital-based case series. Tunnel work [20], land excavation [21], bat habitat exposure during cave and tunnel visits [22,23], and exposure to bird faeces and roosts [24,25] have been reported as plausible risk factors for H. capsulatum exposure. H. capsulatum has been identified in soil and water samples [26–28], bats [29], and bat and bird faeces [30–34] by direct microscopy, mouse inoculation and culture technique, or molecular detection. In the rural Kenyan context, humans can live in close proximity with domestic and wild animals, and previously recognised reservoirs of Histoplasma could be present within household environments.\nThe current study utilised serum samples and data on demographic and animal exposure variables previously collected during a cross-sectional household survey in Busia county, western Kenya [35] to explore levels of exposure to H. capsulatum. The primary objectives of the study were as follows:\n\nEstimate the human seroprevalence of anti-Histoplasma antibody in Busia county, using a latex agglutination test (LAT);\nExplore associations between H. capsulatum seropositivity, and non-clinical demographic and environmental variables in Busia county; and\nIdentify limitations in current data with regards to identifying the burden of H. capsulatum exposure in the Kenyan context and thus highlight future research activities required to address gaps in evidence.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nEthics approval for serum sample collection and storage for future processing was granted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Ethics Review Committee (ERC; reference SSC/1701). Permission to re-analyse data and test bio-banked serum samples was provided by KEMRI and supported by Scantlebury Wellcome Trust ISSF Fellowship (reference 204822/Z/16/Z).\nWritten informed consent was obtained for all adults (>15 years) and assent was obtained on behalf of children (5–15 years) by their legal guardian. All survey respondents were ≥5 years.\n\n\nOriginal study\nA cross-sectional household survey was conducted from 2010–12 in Busia county, western Kenya, for the People, Animals and their Zoonoses (PAZ) project, supported by the Wellcome Trust [36]. The study region was selected as it broadly represents the wider Lake Victoria Crescent ecosystem, namely that of a smallholder, mixed crop-livestock production system, with previously poorly understood burden of zoonotic infection [35]. Project outputs included epidemiologic data on the prevalence of neglected zoonotic diseases amongst 2113 survey respondents, from randomly selected households stratified by sub-location (n = 143) [35,37]. For complete methodology of household selection, refer to Fèvre et al. (2017) [35].\n\n\nSerum sample selection\nA sub-set (n = 942) of samples was selected from the PAZ dataset and represents respondents who received a question on bat observation. The data sub-set was collected between May 2011 and July 2012. Within this time period, the following criteria were applied to select the study sample of 670 survey respondents (n = 670/942, 71.1%). Serum samples were selected to include survey respondents reporting variable HIV status at the time of sampling (positive: n = 48/670, 7.2%), and absence or presence of bats around the home during the 12 months prior to survey delivery (bats observed: n = 348/670, 51.9%) (Table 1). All respondents with a HIV positive status and all those reporting the presence of bats were selected, in addition to systematically selecting every eighth respondent across the dataset. Selected survey respondents represented 178 households within 102 sub-locations.\n\n\nSerological testing\nOne IMMY Latex Agglutination Histoplasma test was performed as per manufacturer guidelines for each thawed, heat-treated serum sample. In accordance with IMMY guidelines, a graduated scale of reaction strengths was used to assign test results from negative (-) to four plus (4+) (S1 Fig). Positive and negative controls had to demonstrate 2+ or greater, and less than 1+ reaction strengths, respectively [38]. Samples assigned a 2+ or greater reaction strength were considered to be presumptive evidence of active or recent H. capsulatum exposure. For the purpose of this study, no serum dilutions were performed as a measure of antibody titer.\nThe LAT provides a measure of agglutinating anti-Histoplasma antibody, predominant during the early IgM antibody response. Antibody responses in individuals with acute histoplasmosis have been characterised by an initial peak in IgM mean concentration at 14 to 27 days, before returning to pre-clinical levels by one year [39–41]. Thus, a positive LAT reaction can indicate acute infection from 2 weeks post-exposure. Furthermore, IgM levels have demonstrated a significant decrease between acute and convalescent phases 5–6 and 10–12 weeks post-exposure, respectively [42]. Implications of these test limitations for estimating true seroprevalence are discussed further.\n\n\nSeroprevalence estimation\nThe apparent prevalence of H. capsulatum seropositivity in the sample population was determined based on the IMMY Latex Agglutination Histoplasma test results. True seroprevalence was estimated using published sensitivity and specificity values for a histoplasmin sensitised LAT of 62% and 97%, respectively [43]. Epitools interface and Clopper-Pearson (exact) test were employed to determine 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) (https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/trueprevalence [44]).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nHousehold survey data and LAT results were stored in a protected Microsoft Excel file. Data variables encompassed non-clinical demographic and environmental factors and were selected for analysis if identified as either an established risk factor for H. capsulatum exposure in current literature, or a theoretically plausible risk factor for exposure based on current evidence of H. capsulatum life cycle and transmission dynamics (S1 and S2 Tables). Re-coding of variables is described in S2 Table.\nDescriptive statistics were used to analyse respondent- and household level-characteristics of the selected sub-set of respondents and to compare this sub-set with the original sampled population. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare distributions of categorical variables between the original sample and the sub-set and to determine the statistical significance of differences.\nUnivariable associations between H. capsulatum seropositivity and individual selected variables were examined by constructing 2xN contingency tables and using Pearson Chi-squared test of association (χ2). Odds Ratios (ORs) with 90% CIs and associated p-values were calculated.\nPhi coefficient was employed to analyse suspected correlations between categorical variables with a binary outcome. A coefficient value of >0.7 with an associated p-value <0.05 was interpreted as evidence of an association between variables. Identification of an association and subsequent comparison of p values on univariable analysis supported exclusion of variables from further analysis, whereas those with stronger p-values were retained for further analysis.\nVariables with a χ2-associated p-value <0.20 on univariable analysis were selected for testing in a multivariable logistic regression model with seropositivity as the binary outcome. The model was built using a manual backwards-stepwise approach [45]. As the study is exploratory and designed to generate hypotheses about potential risk factors for H. capsulatum exposure a conservative cut-off value of p<0.10 was applied to include variables in the final model. Final versions of the model were assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow test statistic, and Delta Betas were explored for variables within the final model to examine the effect of any influential data points. Random effects were included to explore the effect of clustering of respondents at both household and sub-location levels. Regression coefficients, estimate p-values, and z-ratios were compared between single and multi-level models. Proportion of variance attributed to individual levels was calculated using the latent-variable approach described by Goldstein et al. (2002) [46].\nStatistical analyses and multi-level modelling were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25, and MLwiN 3.05 software, respectively.",
    "Results": "Study population\nSelected respondents (n = 670/942, 71.1%) represented 178 households, with a median number of occupants of 7.0 per household (range: 1–30). The sample comprised respondents aged 5 to >85 years and displayed a positively skewed age distribution (S2 Fig). Modal and median age categories were 5–14 years (n = 272/670, 40.6%), and 15–24 years (n = 133/670, 19.9%), respectively. The sample comprised 350 females (52.2%). The gender ratio per age category was approximately 90–125 females per 100 males, with the exception of age category 25–34 years which demonstrated a greater gender gap of 213 females per 100 males. The majority of respondents were teachers or students (n = 341/670, 50.9%) or within animal management or contact roles (n = 244/670, 36.4%). A positive HIV status was recorded in 7.2% (n = 48/670) of respondents, with the highest prevalence of HIV positive status among respondents aged 35–44 years (n = 18/670, 23.7%), and females (Female: n = 33/350, 9.4%; Male: n = 15/320, 4.7%). A minority of respondents reported smoking behaviour (n = 17/670, 2.5%) (Tables 2 and S3).\nFrequencies (n), percentages (%), Odds Ratios (OR), 90% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values, were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software.\nContact with dogs (n = 582/670, 86.9%), cats (n = 563/670, 84.0%), and poultry (n = 597/670, 89.1%), and observation of rats (n = 609/670, 90.9%) in and around the household environment were reported by the majority of respondents. Examination of indirect animal contact activities demonstrated that the majority of respondents were involved in manure preparation (n = 436/670, 65.1%), in contrast to animal burial and skinning activities which were not frequently reported (Table 2). The most common manure preparation activities were described as preparation for fuel and use as a building material.\nAt a household level (n = 178 households), spring water (wet: n = 93/178, 52.2%; dry: n = 92/178, 51.7%) and borehole sources (wet: n = 73/178, 41.0%; dry: n = 74/178, 41.6%) were most frequently reported in the previous wet and dry seasons. Houses within the study area tended to be constructed of: iron (n = 128/178, 71.9%) or thatch (n = 121/178, 68.0%) roofs; mud walls (n = 160/178, 89.9%); and earth floors (n = 156/178, 87.6%). The majority of households reported using firewood as the main cooking fuel (n = 136/178, 76.4%) (Table 2).\nNo statistically significant differences were found in the demographic and behavioural variables between the original sample and the sub-set of respondents selected for this study, with the exception of observation of bats around the home which was significantly higher in the sub-set (p<0.001) due to the selection criteria applied for sub-setting (S4 Table). We therefore consider the sub-set selected for this study to be appropriately representative of the underlying population, enabling population inferences to be made with regards to seroprevalence and risk factors being explored.\n\n\nSeroprevalence results\nA total of 104 serum samples were interpreted as positive on LAT (a reaction strength of 2+ or greater), of which the majority displayed a reaction strength of 2+ (n = 68/104, 65.4%) (Fig 1 and Table 3). This related to an apparent seroprevalence of 15.5% (n = 104/670, 95% CI 12.9–18.5%). The estimated true seroprevalence in this sample, adjusting for published LAT sensitivity and specificity results [43], was calculated as 21.2% (95% CI 16.8–26.2%) [44].\n43.3% of households (n = 77/178) contained at least one occupant with a seropositive result. Of these households, the percentage of occupants demonstrating seropositivity ranged from 7.7% (n = 1/13 occupants) to 100.0% (n = 1/1 to 3/3 occupants) (Fig 2A and 2B).\n(A) Household locations (n = 178) within 102 sub-locations and (B) study area in Busia county, western Kenya. Key: red = households with ≥1 occupant seropositive for H. capsulatum; blue = households with zero seropositive occupants. Geodata were downloaded from DIVA-GIS (https://www.diva-gis.org/gdata). DIVA-GIS software is a free and open access source (https://www.diva-gis.org/docs/DIVA-GIS5_manual.pdf). Maps were generated using QGIS 3.12.\n\n\nUnivariable analysis\nUnivariable logistic regression analysis identified a statistically significant association (p<0.05) between LAT result and age category 15–24 years (OR = 2.80 90% CI 1.28–6.15, p = 0.03; reference category 25–34 years). Variables which met the multivariable model inclusion criteria at a higher p-value cut-off (p<0.1) were as follows; observation of rats around the home in the previous 12 months (OR = 2.80 90% CI 1.17–6.68, p = 0.05), use of spring water in the previous dry season (OR = 1.47 90% CI 1.02–2.13, p = 0.08), and age category ≥45 years (OR = 2.41 90% CI 1.08–5.39, p = 0.07; reference category 25–34 years) (Table 2).\nFor each water source variable, a statistically significant association (phi >0.7, p<0.05) was measured between reporting the use of the water source in the last wet season and reporting use of the same water source in the last dry season. Thus, only water source variables for the last dry season, specifically tap, spring, well, river and borehole sources, were included in further analyses, and the seasonal element of the variable was excluded. Findings from univariable logistic regression analysis are available in Table 2.\n\n\nMultivariable logistic regression analysis\nThe final multi-level multivariable model contains two statistically significant main effects; observation of rats around the home in previous 12 months (OR = 2.99 90% CI 1.04–8.55, p = 0.04), and age category 15–24 (OR = 2.70 90% CI 1.04–6.97, p = 0.04; reference category 25–34 years), as variables associated with presence of anti-Histoplasma antibody (Table 4). The final model also included variables which met the inclusion criteria at a p-value cut-off of <0.1, as follows; age category ≥45 years (OR = 2.60 90% CI 0.98–6.89, p = 0.06; reference category 25–34 years) and mud walls in the household (OR = 2.50 90% CI 0.85–7.36, p = 0.097) (Table 4).\nOdds Ratios (OR), 90% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values, were calculated using MLwiN 3.05 software.\nThe model yielded a Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared value of 2.091 (p = 0.970). On delta beta analysis, no data points were determined to be influential on the model outcome.\nClustering by household (variance = 0.02, SE 0.18) and by sub-location (variance = 0.18, SE 0.17) were demonstrated. These outcomes indicated that only 0.6 and 5.2% of variance in seropositivity is due to household and sub-location respectively, using the latent-variable approach. Regression coefficients, z-ratios and p-values, of model variables in single-, two- and three-level models were comparable.",
    "Discussion": "The study describes the human seroprevalence of anti-Histoplasma antibody, and explores associations between seropositivity and potential risk factors for H. capsulatum exposure in a community and household setting, in Busia county, western Kenya.\nThe recent recognition of histoplasmosis as a priority disease in Kenya [1] and apparent seroprevalence of H. capsulatum exposure demonstrated by survey respondents (n = 104/670, 15.5%), highlight the need for surveillance at national and regional levels. A previous histoplasmin skin test survey in Kenya reported a positivity rate of 8.5% (n = 65/768) in adult males [9]. The age distribution of the study population was not reported, and participants were miners or prisoners from Lake Victoria (western Kenya), and within or west of the Rift Valley, respectively. Skin test positivity is lower than our apparent measured seroprevalence of 15.5% (n = 104/670) which could be attributed to variable environmental conditions influencing survival of the saprophytic mycelial form of H. capsulatum, or variable exposure risk factors in the study populations under examination, including contact with animal reservoirs. In addition, the study described employs a histoplasmin skin sensitivity test as opposed to the LAT described in this study, which measure IgE-mediated reactions versus IgM agglutinating antibody responses, respectively.\nWith the exception of case reports [47–52], and limited prevalence studies in select socio-demographic groups [9,53,54], there is a paucity of recent epidemiologic data examining the burden of H. capsulatum exposure in the general population and in variable community and household settings in Kenya, the surrounding region, and more widely across sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, two cross-sectional studies examining histoplasmin skin sensitivity across variable regions, demonstrated positive tests in 4.4% (n = 32/735) [8] and 10.5% (n = 69/660) [6] of participants. The latter study was conducted in proximity to a bat cave, and a sub-sample of this study population identified as farmers, cave guides and traders in the vicinity of the cave (35.0%, n = 14/40). Thus, the higher overall test positivity measured could be attributed to these study design factors.\nVariables tested in the univariable and multivariable logistic regression models encompassed both established and theoretically plausible epidemiologic risk factors for H. capsulatum exposure. A significant association was identified between H. capsulatum seropositivity and the observation of rats within the household (OR = 2.99 90% CI 1.04–8.55, p = 0.04). In Kenya, H. capsulatum has been isolated from soil, including samples enriched with chicken and bat faeces [55–57]. Although evidence exists for the role of rats as environmental reservoirs, current literature is limited to North America, where H. capsulatum was identified in wild rats and soil samples proximal to rat burrows [26,58,59]. Additional research is warranted in the community setting in western Kenya to explore any associations between H. capsulatum exposure and the following variables: frequency and routes of human exposure to rats and their habitats, the location of rat burrows, isolation of H. capsulatum from rats and rat burrows, and the household and environmental factors maintaining rat populations.\nThe multivariable model presents an association (p<0.1) between H. capsulatum seropositivity and housing constructed with mud. Exploration of potential associations between building materials and the isolation of H. capsulatum in the household environment is warranted. One might hypothesise that mud walls may provide better substrate to maintain the saprophytic mycelial form of H. capsulatum in comparison to brick or cement. Furthermore, different building construction methods might present variable H. capsulatum exposure risks, for example construction of mud walls with handheld tools might increase exposure risk from soil. The variables presented may also be proxy indicators of socioeconomic factors that increase risk of H. capsulatum exposure, and could be indicative of the sociodemographic differences between regions, and availability of building materials. As stated, due to the exploratory nature of the study a conservative cut-off p-value was applied for inclusion of variables in the final model. Thus, strong conclusions should not be made based solely on these analyses and identified associations can contribute to generating hypotheses for future research.\nBat habitat exposure has been reported as a risk factor for H. capsulatum exposure [22,23], and H. capsulatum has been isolated from bats using molecular techniques [29]. The variable describing bat observation was not included in the final multivariable model. However, the purposeful selection of respondents reporting observation of bats around the home should be considered, which might increase overall seropositivity compared to a randomly selected sample. The difference between distributions of respondents reporting observation of bats in the study sample and in the original sub-set of respondents was statistically significant. Further investigation is warranted to examine the role of rats, bats and environmental reservoirs of H. capsulatum within this context. In addition, studies employing molecular methods may support current literature on phylogenetic characterisation of Histoplasma isolates and comparison to regional and global isolates from human, animal and environmental sources [60–62].\nThe multivariable logistic regression model demonstrates increased odds of seropositivity amongst age category 15–24 years (OR = 2.70 90% CI 1.04–6.97, p = 0.04) and an association (p<0.1) between seropositivity and age category ≥45 years (OR = 2.60 90% CI 0.98–6.89, p = 0.06), in comparison to respondents aged 25–34 years. Investigation of whether the outcome reflects variable immunocompetence between age categories, or age-related exposure to potential risk factors, is warranted. The sub-set of household survey respondents under examination demonstrated a positively skewed age distribution. At the time of data collection, in 2010, the age group 0–14 years represented 43.4% of the general Kenyan population [63]. This proportion is comparable to that of the sample population, of which 40.6% of selected respondents were 5–14 years (n = 272/670). Although representative of the general population, the effect of a skewed population structure on the frequency distribution of other variables under investigation, including reported occupations and involvement in animal contact roles, should be considered. For example, these variables may not be sufficiently powered to explore risk factors in older age categories. In comparison to studies exploring demographic or clinical risk factors for H. capsulatum infection in susceptible patient cohorts, the current study highlights potential environmental risk factors amongst the general population which may be confounded to a lesser extent by age.\nFurther targeted research is warranted to explore the impact of potential confounders such as age, gender and occupation. Investigation of associations between dwelling maintenance activities, building materials including mud walls, and presence of wild or domestic animals in occupied dwellings, would provide further objective insight into the interactions of described household and environmental variables, and their impact on H. capsulatum exposure risk.\nAlthough the described associations do not infer direct causality, nor encompass the unknown lifestyle and socioeconomic confounding factors, the variables presented contribute to the complex epidemiological picture influencing H. capsulatum exposure status at the human-animal-environment interface in western Kenya.\nThere was no evidence for significant clustering at household- nor sub-location levels, however further investigation is warranted to identify the potential socio-demographic and geoclimatic variations between defined areas that have not been explored in this analysis and to quantify their impact on the odds of seropositivity.\nH. capsulatum was not a focus of the original PAZ study [35], thus questions posed by the survey were not designed to capture risk factors relating specifically to H. capsulatum exposure nor to capture temporal information which might be related to the timing of exposure. Factors that contribute to whether inhalation of H. capsulatum microconidia results in symptomatic disease include the quantity of airborne inoculum and the immunocompetence of the host. A robust T cell response and subsequent activation of macrophages can prevent progression of H. capsulatum infection [64], in contrast to the progressive nature of infection in immunocompromised individuals [65–67], however it should be noted that infection can become clinically apparent many years after first exposure.\nWith the exception of data on respondent smoking behaviour (yes: n = 17/670, 2.5% [seropositive: n = 4/17, 23.5%]) and HIV status (positive: n = 48/670, 7.2% [seropositive: n = 4, 8.3%]), clinical variables were excluded from analyses. The cross-sectional nature of data collection and absence of associated temporal data meant it was not possible to examine associations between reported clinical symptoms or disease and H. capsulatum seropositivity. Implementation of prospective, longitudinal research in community and household settings would enable more accurate inferences to be made about associations between H. capsulatum seropositivity and clinical signs or co-infections in the general population.\nHospital-based case series in Central and South America have examined morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients with confirmed disseminated histoplasmosis [68–70], and histoplasmosis is now widely recognised as a leading co-morbidity amongst AIDS patients [16]. An overall HIV prevalence of 7.7% of the general adult population was reported in Busia county in 2018 [71]. These individuals represent a potentially susceptible sub-set of the population to H. capsulatum co-infection. Clinical data with regards to individual immunocompetence of HIV-positive respondents at the time of survey delivery was not available, including access to and management of antiretroviral therapy. Among selected respondents, 48 (7.2%) demonstrated positive HIV status; however, no statistically significant association was identified between HIV positive status and H. capsulatum seropositivity. An examination of the impact of HIV infection on immunodiffusion and complement fixation test results, revealed detection of anti-Histoplasma antibodies was significantly lower (p<0.05) in disseminated histoplasmosis cases with, as opposed to without, AIDS [72]. Thus, we speculate that measured seropositivity amongst HIV positive respondents in this study could be an underestimate due to the inability of these individuals to mount an immune response detectable by LAT and subsequent false negative results. The effect of HIV co-infection on anti-Histoplasma antibody detection by LAT should be examined and quantified to improve our understanding of test performance and limitations and to increase the accuracy of seroprevalence estimates made on the basis of these test results. In addition, false positive results have been reported among patients with tuberculosis [73].\nThe possibility of cross-reactions with other systemic mycoses namely, Aspergillus, Candida and Paracoccidioides [74] should be acknowledged with the use of this LAT test. In the Kenyan context, Aspergillus flavus is documented as a major contaminant of maize crops, resulting in significant aflatoxin exposure [75]. Thus, the potential for cross-reactions with Aspergillus, specifically in a rural setting and in a maize-producing region, should be considered.\nThe LAT provides a measure of the presence of anti-Histoplasma antibody [38]. Only one LAT was performed per serum sample for the purpose of this study. Serum dilutions could also be performed as a semi-quantitative measure of antibody titer. The IMMY LA-Histoplasma test [38] references previously published overall sensitivity and specificity values [43]. However, test sensitivity ranged from 45.7 to 100%, for cases of chronic and acute primary pulmonary histoplasmosis, respectively [43]. Thus, the estimated true seroprevalence measured in the current study might vary significantly from 12.9% (95% CI 10.2–16.0%) to 29.3% (95% CI 23.2–36.2%) [44]. As the IgM antibody response to Histoplasma is mounted in 2–6 weeks, the LAT may present false negative results in individuals tested prior to 2 weeks post-exposure and after the IgM antibody response has diminished [39,41,42]. The samples were maintained temporarily at -20 degrees Celsius, prior to long term storage at -80 degrees Celsius. Freeze-thaw cycles were minimised and samples have not undergone any freeze-thaw cycles since 2016, thereby maintaining the integrity of samples for serological testing.",
    "Conclusions": "Results from the current study suggest that exposure to H. capsulatum occurs frequently within this population and promotes the need for further longitudinal research to investigate the incidence of H. capsulatum exposure and infection in Kenya. The seroprevalence reported here may provide a baseline for sample size approximations to support future epidemiologic studies of the burden of histoplasmosis.\nExploration of theoretically plausible risk factors has highlighted areas for further investigation. Future research might focus on further examination of the significance of associations identified here, and consider how health, demographic, and socio-economic factors impact on H. capsulatum transmission at the human-animal-environment interface."
