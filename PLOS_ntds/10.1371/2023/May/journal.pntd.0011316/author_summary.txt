The transmission dynamics of leishmaniasis are complex due to the variety of sand fly species, parasites and hosts involved. Although Colombia is considered an endemic country for the disease, the biology, ecology, and identification of blood-feeding sources of sand flies in some endemic areas remain unexplored. For this reason, this study aimed to analyze parameters related to the ecological interactions of the elements of the transmission cycle of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Interactions were detected through parasite and vertebrate DNA identification in sand flies collected intra- and peridomiciliary. Our findings show relevant information on distinct transmission patterns and the participation of different sand fly species in the maintenance of Leishmania panamensis in those environments, suggesting Nyssomyia yuilli yuilli as its primary vector and Psychodopygus ayrozai as a bridging species between wild and peridomiciliary cycle.
