Dengue is a major public health challenge and a growing problem due to climate change. The release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is a novel form of vector control against dengue. However, there remains a need to evaluate the health and economic benefits of such an intervention at a large scale, as well as its value for money. In this paper, we evaluate the potential economic impact and cost-effectiveness of scaled Wolbachia deployments as a form of dengue control in Vietnamâ€“targeted at the highest burden urban areas. Ten settings within Vietnam were identified as priority locations for potential future Wolbachia deployments (using a population replacement strategy). We assumed that the effectiveness of Wolbachia deployments in reducing the incidence of symptomatic dengue cases would be 75%. We found that targeting high burden cities with Wolbachia deployments would be a cost-effective intervention in Vietnam and generate notable broader benefits besides health gains. Overall, this work highlights the value of investment in the scaled implementation of Wolbachia deployments as an effective and cost-effective tool for dengue control in Vietnam, and more generally for addressing the global challenge of dengue control.
