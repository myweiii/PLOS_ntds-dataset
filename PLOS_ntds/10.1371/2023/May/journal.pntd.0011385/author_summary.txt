Schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitic disease affecting over 250 million people in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the common pathogenic species, Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni mainly cause hepatic schistosomiasis, which is mainly attributed to liver-trapped schistosome eggs, leading to granulomatous inflammation and liver fibrosis. HSC activation is the central driver of liver fibrosis during hepatic schistosomiasis. Macrophages (Mφ) are tightly connected to HSC activity. Currently, much evidence supports the pivotal role of Mφ-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the potential involvement of Mφ-derived EVs in HSC communication and modulation in hepatic schistosomiasis remains largely unknown. In this study, the authors illustrate that S. japonicum infection utilizes Mφ-derived EVs to promote HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Briefly, schistosome egg antigen (SEA) induces Mφ to secrete abundant miR-33-enriched EVs, which are transferred to enhance autocrine TGF-β1 production by targeting SOCS3 in HSCs, thereby promoting HSC activation and liver fibrosis. These discoveries provide a previously unrecognized Mφ-EVs-based therapeutic target regarding HSC activation, which can be manipulated to prevent liver fibrosis during hepatic schistosomiasis.
