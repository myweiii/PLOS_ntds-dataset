    "Abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a serious and neglected disease with a high prevalence in tropical and subtropical countries. The primary pathology of hepatic schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) or Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection is egg-induced granuloma and subsequent fibrosis in the liver. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the central driver of liver fibrosis. Macrophages (M\u03c6), making up 30% of cells in hepatic granulomas, directly or indirectly regulate HSC activation by paracrine mechanisms, via secreting cytokines or chemokines. Currently, M\u03c6-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are broadly involved in cell communication with adjacent cell populations. However, whether M\u03c6-derived EVs could target neighboring HSCs to regulate their activation during schistosome infection remains largely unknown. Schistosome egg antigen (SEA) is considered to be the main pathogenic complex mixture involved in liver pathology. Here, we demonstrated that SEA induced M\u03c6 to produce abundant extracellular vesicles, which directly activated HSCs by activating their autocrine TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Mechanistically, EVs derived from SEA-stimulated M\u03c6 contained increased miR-33, which were transferred into HSCs and subsequently upregulated autocrine TGF-\u03b21 in HSCs through targeting and downregulating SOCS3 expression, thereby promoting HSC activation. Finally, we validated that EVs derived from SEA-stimulated M\u03c6 utilized enclosed miR-33 to promote HSC activation and liver fibrosis in S. japonicum-infected mice. Overall, our study indicates that M\u03c6-derived EVs play important roles in the paracrine regulation of HSCs during the progression of hepatic schistosomiasis, representing a potential target for the prevention of liver fibrosis in hepatic schistosomiasis."
