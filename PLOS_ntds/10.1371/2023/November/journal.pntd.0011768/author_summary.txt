Snakebite is a life-threatening situation in sub-Saharan Africa, especially for rural and poor populations. Despite being preventable and treatable, it receives little attention from policymakers. The goal of this study was to estimate the financial losses experienced by snakebite victims due to treatment costs and lost work. Interviews with 732 snakebite victims from Eastern Province, Rwanda, indicated that a typical adult lost 12.0% of their annual income due to a single bite. Moreover, caregivers lost time and income when caring for a sick family member. Patients preferentially sought care from traditional healers rather than Community Health Workers, nurses or physicians, even when they qualified for free hospital care. Consequently, victims in our study group paid five times more to traditional healers (3.4 million RWF or 3 537 USD) than to all other care providers combined. Altogether, our analysis suggests that Rwandese lose 7.4 million USD each year in treatment costs and lost work due to snakebite. These results serve as evidence to policymakers that investments to prevention and treatment programs will not only reduce pain and suffering, but also contribute to national goals targeting poverty reduction.
