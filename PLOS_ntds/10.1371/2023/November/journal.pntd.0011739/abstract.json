    "Objective": "Precision interventions have been proposed in transmission-interrupted areas to further reduce the potential transmission risk of schistosomiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different interventions modes for potential transmission risk control.",
    "Methods": "Three groups of schistosomiasis-endemic villages were selected in Jiangling county, Hubei province. After baseline surveys in 2020, three intervention models were employed in 2021 and 2022. In Model 1, Oncomelania hupensis snail control in key settings and an integrated strategy with an emphasis on the infectious sources managing was employed. In Model 2, an integrated health education-led strategy with an emphasis on infectious source management was employed. In Model 3, only the integrated strategy with an emphasis on infectious source management was employed. The effects of the different intervention models were examined with multiple indicators after 2 years of intervention using the entropy-weighted technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), rank-sum ratio (RSR) and fuzzy combination model of entropy-weighted TOPSIS and RSR.",
    "Results": "Entropy-weighted TOPSIS modeling showed that the Ci values of Model 2 were 0.4434, 0.2759, and 0.3069 in the three pilot villages, Ci values were larger, with top comprehensive ranking. The results of the RSR method showed that the RSR values of Model 2 were 0.75, 0.708, and 0.736 in the three pilot villages, with top comprehensive ranking. The results from the fuzzy combination model of entropy-weighted TOPSIS and RSR showed that implementation of Model 2 resulted in the highest comprehensive ranking among the three models in the three pilot villages under Ci: RSR = 0.1: 0.9, Ci: RSR = 0.5: 0.5 and Ci: RSR = 0.9: 0.1.",
    "Conclusion": "The integrated health education-led strategy with an emphasis on infectious source management was the optimal model to manage the risk of transmission of schistosomiasis during the post-transmission interruption phase."
