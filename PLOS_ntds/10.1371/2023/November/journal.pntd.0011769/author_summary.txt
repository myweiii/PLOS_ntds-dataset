Pediatric CNS infection is a high burden for public health in many developing countries including Indonesia where diagnostic capacity is limited. In this study we identify the clinical characteristics and etiology of CNS infection in 50 pediatric population from two hospitals in Indonesia. The data identified cytomegalovirus, dengue, Salmonella Typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the etiology of infection while 80% of cases remain unidentified. The results are expected to raise awareness for policy makers to improve management and laboratory diagnosis of CNS infection in children. Further studies are required to identify contributing factors to the burden of CNS infection.
