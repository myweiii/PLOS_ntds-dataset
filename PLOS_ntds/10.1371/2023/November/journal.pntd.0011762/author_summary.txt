Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) occurs in the fetuses of mothers infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. The main findings are microcephaly and other neurological defects; however, several systemic effects have also been reported. Cardiac manifestations have rarely been evaluated. In this study, we compared cardiac anatomy and function between 52 children with CZS and 25 healthy children using electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and biomarkers. We also assessed the degree of cerebral palsy and neuroimaging findings in the affected group. The hearts of the CZS patients were smaller and demonstrated functional alterations in comparison with those of the control individuals. Neurological impairment in the CZS patients was severe. The early detection of cardiac alterations highlights the need for cardiac evaluation and follow-up in this patient group.
