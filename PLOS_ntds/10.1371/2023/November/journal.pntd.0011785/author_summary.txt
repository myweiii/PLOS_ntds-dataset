Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is an important human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated opportunistic pathogen in Southern China, and its infection is a leading cause of HIV-associated death. Properly and early antifungal treatment and timely antiretroviral therapy (ART) would reduce the mortality. Currently, the gold standard of diagnosis for talaromycosis is culture. The Mp1p antigen assay, the detection for a T. marneffei-specific protein, would be a reliable biomarker of T. marneffei infection in clinical practices. The CD4+ counts are an indicator of human immune system. The less CD4+ counts the weaker immune function and much possible the infection of opportunistic pathogen. In this study, we found that HIV patients with talaromycosis had a lower CD4+ count and more advanced disease compared to those without. The prevalence of talaromycosis based on the Mp1p antigen detection was significantly higher in patients with low CD4+ count than those with without. What’s more, the Mp1p antigen screening was an effective tool to motivate the diagnosis for talaromycosis in patients with CD4+ ≤ 50 Nr/μl, and in turn to drive the initiation of antifungal treatment and ART, which would help the reduction of mortality and the improvement of treatment outcome.
