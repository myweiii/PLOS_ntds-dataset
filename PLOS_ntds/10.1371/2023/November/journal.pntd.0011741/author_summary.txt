Insecticide resistance limits our ability to control vectors of human diseases. Resistance to widely used pyrethroid insecticides can occur by mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) and alleles with these mutations are collectively known as knockdown resistance (kdr). The frequency of resistance alleles is driven by selection with pyrethroid insecticides, but kdr alleles decrease in frequency in the absence of insecticide. The relative fitness of different kdr alleles to each other is largely unknown. We show that the 1534C allele is favored in the absence of pyrethroid, but that the 410L+1016I+1534C allele is favored when deltamethrin selection occurs. These results help to explain the relative frequency of these alleles that have been detected in field collections.
