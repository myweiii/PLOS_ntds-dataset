Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) is prevalent in China, Korea, and Vietnam, and 15â€“20 million people are estimated to be infected by this fluke, creating a socio-economic burden in epidemic regions. It is generally believed that excretory-secretory products from C. sinensis (CsESPs) can directly interact with the biliary epithelium and induce host inflammatory response. Our previous studies have manifested that CsNOSIP as a component of CsESPs can trigger nitrative and oxidative stress by enhancing the release of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophage. In the current study, we identified rCsNOSIP-binding proteins by HuProt microarray. In addition, we demonstrated that ASPSCR-1 and Sirt-5 could interact with rCsNOSIP by pull down assay. Moreover, rCsNOSIP could increase the production of NO and ROS and promote the migration of human CCLP-1 cells by using NO assay, detection of ROS assay as well as wound-healing assays. Our study provided new information about rCsNOSIP in promoting CCA invasion and metastasis as well as a novel protective role of SIRT5/ ASPSCR1 against adverse stimulus and support a basis for further discovery of drug targets for prevention and control of clonorchiasis.
