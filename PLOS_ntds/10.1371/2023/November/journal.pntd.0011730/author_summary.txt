The presence of wild and domestic healthy carriers is an obstacle to the control and elimination of animal and human trypanosomosis in Africa. Domestic pigs are receptive to infection by most trypanosomes, and may act as a reservoir of parasites for livestock and humans. Indeed, field studies highlighted that pigs are often positive for different diagnostic tests for trypanosome infections. However, the performances of these tests are poorly known in pigs, while accurate diagnosis of pig trypanosomosis is essential for epidemiological surveillance and implementation of control measures. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of one parasitological, two molecular and four serological diagnostic tests to detect Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection in experimentally infected pigs. The results showed a high specificity of most tests, except for the serological tests CATT and HAT Sero-K-Set Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). The sensitivity varied highly depending on the tests.
While the choice of a test or a test combination depends on the objectives of a given study and the available resources, parasitological observation can be proposed for quick field screening in conjunction with a RDT, provided that RDT performances are confirmed in a larger study, and indirect antibody-ELISA and PCR are suited for epidemiological investigations.
