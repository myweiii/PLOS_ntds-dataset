Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, which is among the most neglected of tropical diseases, affecting millions of people in South and Central America along with immigrant populations around the world. T. cruzi is related to other important pathogens such as Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp, which have been the subject of molecular and cellular characterizations that have provided an understanding of how these organisms shape their cells and undergo division. Work in T. cruzi has lagged due to an absence of molecular tools for manipulating the parasite and the complexity of the original published genome; these issues have recently been resolved. Building on work in T. brucei, we have studied the localization of key cell cycle proteins and quantified changes in cell shape during division in an insect-resident form of T. cruzi. This work has uncovered unique adaptations to the cell division process in T. cruzi and provides insight into the range of mechanisms this family of important pathogens can employ to colonize their hosts.
