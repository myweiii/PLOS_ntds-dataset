Human sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes still affects the poor community of Campo in the South Region of Cameroon. During routine activities of farming, fishing, and hunting in the forest, villagers are in close contact with tsetse flies which bite them and transmit the disease. The tsetse fly display high densities in Campo, increasing the risk of disease transmission to the population. Recently, deltamethrin-treated blue-black fabric screens called Tiny Targets were developed to reduce tsetse densities when installed in the environment. These Tiny Targets significantly contributed to decrease sleeping sickness cases in many countries. In this study, baseline data were collected on tsetse densities in Campo and after population sensitization, around 2000 Tiny Targets were installed and maintained for two years with help of 10 villagers who received prior training. The Tiny Targets were replaced every six months and monitoring activities showed that tsetse density decreased by 73% after one year with a slight recovery in the second year. Trypanosome infections in tsetse flies also decreased by 75%. This study showed the positive impact of Tiny Targets in Campo in limiting trypanosome circulation and suggested to scale up the area covered by the tsetse control, to improve its efficiency.
