Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of preventable and treatable diseases common in tropical countries primarily affecting poor rural communities. Myanmar is a tropical country in Southeast Asia in which 70% of the population live in rural areas. It is one of the top ten countries with a high burden of NTDs in term of incidence and prevalence. We conducted a systematic review of all available literature on infectious NTDs in Myanmar to collate all reported NTDs published in international as well as local journals including theses and dissertations. Our review found bacterial and viral NTDs being the most commonly reported NTDs followed by helminthiasis and protozoal NTDs. More than half of the studies were located in two out of fifteen states and regions of Myanmar. This review summarises reported NTDs in Myanmar over 100 years and indicates gaps in knowledge about certain diseases to inform future research directions related to NTDs in Myanmar.
