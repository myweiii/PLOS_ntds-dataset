    "Background": "There are limited longitudinal data on the acquisition of Giardia lamblia infections in childhood using molecular assays to detect and type assemblages, and measure effects of infections on diarrhea risk and childhood growth.",
    "Methods": "We analysed stool samples from a surveillance sample within a birth cohort in a rural district in tropical Ecuador. The cohort was followed to 8 years of age for the presence of G. lamblia in stools by quantitative PCR and A and B assemblages by Taqman assay or Sanger sequencing. We explored risk factors associated with infection using generalized estimating equations applied to longitudinal binary outcomes, and longitudinal panel data analysis to estimate effects of infection on diarrhea and growth trajectories.",
    "Results": "2,812 stool samples collected between 1 month and 8 years of age from 498 children were analyzed and showed high rates of infection: 79.7% were infected at least once with peak prevalence (53.9%) at 5 years. Assemblage B was accounted for 56.8% of genotyped infections. Risk factors for infection included male sex (P = 0.001), daycare attendance (P<0.001), having a household latrine (P = 0.04), childhood (P<0.001) and maternal soil-transmitted helminth (P = 0.029) infections, and exposures to donkeys (age interaction P = 0.034). G. lamblia was associated with increased risk of diarrhea (per episode, RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01â€“1.06, P = 0.011) during the first 3 years of life and a transient impairment of weight (age interaction P = 0.017) and height-for-age (age interaction P = 0.025) trajectories between 1 and 4 years of age. There was no increased risk of either assemblage being associated with outcomes.",
    "Conclusion": "Our data show a relatively high edemicity of G. lamblia transmission during childhood in coastal Ecuador, and evidence that infection is associated with a transiently increased risk of diarrhea during the first 3 years of life and impairment of weight and height between 1 and 4 years."
