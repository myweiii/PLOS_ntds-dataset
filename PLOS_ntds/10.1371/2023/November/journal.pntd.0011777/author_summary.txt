Giardia lamblia is an intestinal protozoal pathogen that is estimated to infect annually over 200 million people worldwide. The infection typically causes a self-limiting diarrheal illness, but which occasionally may be severe and persistent. The infection is most common in children living in poor regions of the tropics in conditions of inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. In endemic settings, associations of infections with diarrhea in children are variable and there is evidence that subclinical infections may cause growth stunting. Here, we analyzed stool samples collected for a surveillance cohort of children followed up from birth to 8 years of age in a rural district of tropical coastal Ecuador. Stool samples were analyzed for the presence of G. lamblia infections using a highly sensitive molecular test (quantitative PCR) and positive samples were genotyped for G. lamblia assemblages. G. lamblia was detected in almost 80% of children during follow-up and about half the cohort was infected at 5 years of age. Assemblages A and B were detected with B being the most frequent assemblage. Risk factors for infection included male sex and factors associated with increased early contacts with other children (i.e., daycare attendance), poor sanitation (having a household latrine and infections with other enteric parasites), and exposures to donkeys as a potential source of zoonotic infections. There was evidence that early G. lamblia infections were associated with effects of increased diarrheal risk up to 3 years and reduced linear and ponderal growth between 1 and 4 years of age. We did not see any relative effect of assemblage (i.e., B vs. A) on disease. Our data, from a longitudinal birth cohort showed a relatively high prevalence of infection in this rural tropical setting that was associated with the possible onset of adaptive immunity against (diarrheal) disease and transient effects on growth trajectories.
