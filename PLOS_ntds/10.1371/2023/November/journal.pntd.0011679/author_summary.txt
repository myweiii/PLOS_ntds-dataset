Trachoma, caused by ocular Ct, is targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for elimination by 2030. The WHO recommends the SAFE strategy to be implemented in all endemic countries. Ethiopia bears the highest trachoma disease burden globally. In Oromia, the biggest region of Ethiopia, the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) among children age 1–9 (TF1-9) was >30% in 46% of the 2016 GTMP surveyed districts. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 247 households in Shashemene Rural district in southeastern region of Oromia to explore risk factors for trachoma in this setting. Prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) was 9.3% overall and 20.2% among children aged 1–9 years. Ct infection among individuals with active trachoma (TF and/or TI) was 12.7% overall. Seventy-eight percent (18/23) of those with Ct detected were children aged 1–9 years. In this setting, active trachoma was associated with younger age, the poorest households, presence of flies on the face, and ocular discharge, emphasizing the importance of the continued implementation of SAFE strategy in addition to poverty reduction interventions.
