Snakebite from venomous snakes is a medical emergency requiring immediate critical care by a medical team. Failure to correctly manage a snakebite can lead to permanent disability or even death. The dearth of data on the frequency, location and populations affected by snakebite, as well as the outcomes of snakebite, in many regions of the world means that this tropical disease remains one of the most neglected. We studied snakebite over two years in Eswatini using data on hospitalisations, snake locations, habitat, environmental and socioeconomic factors to develop two nation-wide risk maps: one estimating the probability of snakebite and the other one the probability of poor outcomes in the case of a snakebite. The results of this study can enable national policy makers and health programmes to better plan and allocate resources, as well as implement targeted prevention strategies to meet the global goal of halving deaths and disabilities caused by snakebite envenoming.
