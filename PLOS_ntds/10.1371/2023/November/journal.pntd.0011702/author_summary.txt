The quality of mosquito larval habitats (breeding sites) is one of the most important determinants of the distribution and abundance of mosquito species. Cities offer a heterogeneous landscape with a gradient of temperature, vegetation, built infrastructure (piped water access, water storage) which can vary in microclimate at fine spatial scales.
Entomological surveys are often biased towards locations or houses with high mosquito densities. Sampling strategies for mosquito surveillance must include urban environments with non-residential locations. Understanding the linkages between environmental conditions (e.g., hydrology, microclimate), land use, climate change, increasing urbanization are some of the key factors modulating the mosquito life-history traits which influence epidemiologically relevant behaviors and their ability to transmit diseases. Our longitudinal study shows that a combination of manmade larval habitats and landscape ecology drives mosquito diversity and abundance even at a small spatial scale which could be affecting the incipient disease outbreaks. From science to policy perspective, this is the first comprehensive study from Bengaluru, India which shows that sampling strategies for mosquito surveillance must include urban environments with non-residential locations. We demonstrate that dengue transmission reduction programmes should focus on ‘neighbourhood surveillance’ as well to prevent and control the rising threat of Aedes-borne diseases.
