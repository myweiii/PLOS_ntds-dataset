Monitoring the susceptibility of insect populations to chemical insecticides provides vital information for resistance management. New chemicals are being tested and added to the arsenal used for malaria prevention. As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard operating procedure for testing insecticide susceptibility in adult mosquitoes has been updated to include new active ingredients. To evaluate their susceptibility to clothianidin, a neonicotinoid or to flupyradifurone, a butenolide, adult mosquitoes are not exposed to the active ingredient alone, but to a mixture containing a surfactant which helps to solubilize the pesticide. In the present study, we report that surfactants such as vegetable oil esters or soap can enhance the potency of some active ingredients. Because of this synergistic action, the actual level of susceptibility of the insect populations tested can be largely overestimated. However, the results also reveal that some affordable products such as soaps can enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoids against mosquitoes. Although it remains unclear how soaps can be used as an adjuvant in insecticide formulations applied against mosquitoes, their potential utility warrants further investigations.
