Lassa fever is a viral disease prevalent in West Africa, with Mastomys natalensis serving as the primary reservoir. In Nigeria, annual outbreaks occur from December to March. Using a novel model and data from 2018â€“2020, we demonstrate that the population dynamics of the reservoir contribute to spikes in human cases. Specifically, spillover transmission increases drastically during this period, highlighting the need for concentrated efforts and interventions. Understanding the seasonal dynamics of the reservoir is crucial for effective Lassa fever control and prevention strategies in Nigeria.
