Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly parasitic disease with a primary focus in north-eastern India. Control of the sand fly, Phlebotomus argentipes, vector of VL in India, is primarily reliant upon spraying the internal walls of houses and animal shelters with residual pyrethroid insecticide. Spray programmes depend upon well-controlled spraying and effective insecticides to which the targeted insects are susceptible. Changing insecticides is logistically challenging, therefore early detection of insecticide resistance is crucial. As part of a wider programme of entomological surveillance we used molecular resistance assays of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations to investigate evidence for changing resistance profiles, and possible links with the spraying programme across a system of eight districts in north-eastern India. Mutant frequencies varied substantially in space and time, with a major change across the first two years of the study, but stability for the remainder. Resistance-associated kdr alleles were positively associated with indices of spray coverage and with under spraying, suggesting that this creates vulnerability to development of pyrethroid resistance. However, the most strongly resistance conferring mutant genotype was rarely detected, suggesting overall that notable resistance is not yet emerging, despite wide coverage of the spray programme. This is an encouraging result for the VL elimination programme but with apparent advantage of resistance alleles in sprayed areas it would be wise to seek alternative insecticides for spraying.
