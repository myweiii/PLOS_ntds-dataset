Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and is an increasing public health concern globally. A novel evidence-based tool for dengue control involves the release of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with a naturally-occurring insect bacteria called Wolbachia (wMel strain). wMel significantly reduces the mosquito’s ability to transmit dengue and other viruses and can establish long-term in local Ae. aegypti populations following short-term releases. Previous studies have shown that establishment of wMel in local mosquito populations significantly reduces local dengue incidence. In Colombia, wMel-infected Ae. aegypti were released throughout the cities of Bello, Medellín, and Itagüí in the Aburrá Valley between 2015 and 2022, covering a population of 3.3 million people. The rate of dengue case notifications in the three cities declined by 95–97% after Wolbachia releases, compared to the prior decade, and dengue case numbers since 2020 have been the lowest in twenty years. A case-control study in Medellin in 2019–2021 showed that laboratory-confirmed dengue incidence was significantly lower in neighbourhoods with Wolbachia releases compared to untreated neighbourhoods. These results confirm the real-world effectiveness of the Wolbachia method, and show that it can be implemented at a city-wide scale to protect communities against dengue.
