Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical antigen-presenting cells that link between innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens. However, their role in the pathogenesis of human leptospirosis remains unclear. This study provides the first evidence of the impact of leptospires on MoDC-CD4+ T cell responses. We observed that pathogenic leptospires partially impaired MoDC maturation, potentially compromising their ability to induce CD4+ T cell proliferation while inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs). Notably, pathogenic leptospires upregulated the PTGS2 gene expression, resulting in elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, which may contribute to Treg activation. Furthermore, pathogenic leptospires trigger more MoDC apoptosis, partly through a caspase-3-dependent pathway, compared to non-pathogenic strains. These findings might reveal the mechanisms that pathogenic leptospires used to evade the host immune response, facilitating their dissemination within the host. Conversely, non-pathogenic leptospires promote MoDC maturation and stimulate the proliferation of IFN-Î³-producing CD4+ T cells, potentially eliciting a Th1-type response. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel strategy employed by pathogenic leptospires for immune evasion while highlighting the immune-activating effects of non-pathogenic strains.
