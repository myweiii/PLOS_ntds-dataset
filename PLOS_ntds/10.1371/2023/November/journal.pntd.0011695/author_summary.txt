The existing diagnostic tools for STH infections can be time consuming, expensive, less sensitive and some require trained personnel. These techniques are therefore not feasible for large scale programmatic surveillance. Novel surveillance tools that can be easily scaled up to guide mass drug administration (MDA) for communities at risk remain a priority. This study investigated the role of NIRS as a potential large scale surveillance tool for soil transmitted helminths using Trichiuris muris experimental mouse model. The technique is environmentally friendly because it neither requires reagents nor sample processing procedures to operate and it only takes 5â€“10 seconds to analyse a sample allowing thousands of samples to be assessed in a day by unskilled personnel. Our results demonstrate for the first time that infrared light coupled with machine learning has the potential to be developed into a large-scale surveillance tool for STH infections to assess impact of interventions and guide future elimination efforts.
