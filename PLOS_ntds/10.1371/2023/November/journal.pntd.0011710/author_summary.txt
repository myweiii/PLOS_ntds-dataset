Although dengue is a disease known for years in the world and has been affecting several continents, some aspects remain unclear. One of them is about the possible factors that may influence the development of severe forms of the disease. Much has been discussed about the influence of a previous dengue episode, but the global spreading of other flaviviruses to areas where dengue was already circulating has aroused interest regarding a role like the other dengue serotypes. In this sense, the recent spreading of the Zika virus has become a factor of interest. In this study, the prior Zika virus infection was associated with a higher frequency of more severe forms in subsequent dengue. Preliminary findings did not suggest that the mechanism is the same one triggered in secondary dengue, known as antibody-dependent enhancement. These findings are a stimulus to develop further research that can understand the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis.
