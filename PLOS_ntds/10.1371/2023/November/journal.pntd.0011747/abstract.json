    "Abstract": "The road to malaria elimination for low- and middle-income countries is paved with obstacles, including the complexity and high costs of advanced molecular methods for genomic analysis. The usefulness of PCR-RFLP as less complex and affordable molecular surveillance tool in low-endemic malaria regions was assessed in a cross-sectional study conducted in Suriname, currently striving for malaria elimination, but plagued by recent P. vivax outbreaks. Molecular analysis of two highly polymorphic genes Pvmsp-1 F2 and Pvmsp-3α was performed for 49 samples, collected during October 2019 through September 2021 from four different regions with varying malaria transmission risks. RFLP-profiling revealed that outbreak samples from three indigenous villages, almost exclusively, harbored a single clonal type, matching the “Palumeu” lineage previously described in 2019, despite multiple relapses and drug pressure exerted by mass drug administration events, suggesting a limited P. vivax hypnozoite reservoir in Suriname. In contrast, isolates originating from Sophie, a mining area in neighboring French Guiana displayed a highly heterogeneous parasite population consistent with its endemic malaria status, demonstrating the differentiating capacity and thus the usefulness of PCR-RFLP for P. vivax genetic diversity studies. Outbreak reconstruction emphasized the impact of undetected human movement and relapses on reintroduction and resurgence of P. vivax malaria and PCR-RFLP monitoring of circulating parasites guided the roll-out of targeted interventions. PCR-RFLP seems a suitable molecular alternative in low-endemic areas with restricted resources for outbreak analysis, for monitoring the spread or containment of circulating strains and for identification of imported cases or potential foci."
