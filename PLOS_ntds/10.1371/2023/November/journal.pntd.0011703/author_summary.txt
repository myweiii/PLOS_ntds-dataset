Aedes aegypti is an important vector of many arboviruses that profoundly affect human health. Despite its importance as a vector, the impact of field-realistic Ae. aegypti feeding behavior on virus transmission is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the physiological impacts of blood meal size and number on vector competence. We found that partial blood meals—common when mosquitoes feed on defensive hosts—are sufficient to increase mosquito midgut basal lamina damage and dengue virus dissemination. Nevertheless, virus dissemination still occurred in the absence of heightened midgut damage, suggesting that mosquito midguts are not impermeable to virus escape. We also observed that frequent successive blood feeding results in slightly higher levels of midgut damage with each instance of feeding. These experiments more closely mimic mosquito feeding behavior in field settings and suggest that current studies often underestimate the impact of mosquito feeding behavior on virus dissemination and transmission dynamics.
