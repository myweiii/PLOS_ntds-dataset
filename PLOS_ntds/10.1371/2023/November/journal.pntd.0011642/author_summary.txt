The introduction of the naturally occurring wMel Wolbachia strain into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has been shown to reduce the ability of the mosquitoes to transmit dengue and other viruses. Following engagement with communities to gain acceptance and support, a series of large-scale releases of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes that contained wMel Wolbachia, were undertaken across the cities of Bello, Medellín and Itagüí in Colombia. These releases were undertaken under operational conditions with the aim of rapidly scaling the intervention in response to the Zika virus crisis. Mosquito populations were monitored during and after releases to determine the levels of Wolbachia and whether it persisted in the local mosquitoes. Wolbachia was found to be stable and established at consistent levels in local mosquito populations in the majority of areas. On-going monitoring in these areas will determine whether Wolbachia persists and also whether it establishes at a high level in the remaining areas. This intervention forms the basis of an epidemiological study to assess the impact of operational deployment of wMel Wolbachia on the reduction of the incidence of notified dengue cases and virologically-confirmed dengue.
