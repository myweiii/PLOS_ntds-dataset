Intestinal helminth infections including schistosomiasis and T. solium are among the major neglected tropical diseases affecting communities with poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene. T. solium taeniasis is also associated with communities practicing free range pig management. These infections are common in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia, where they negatively impact on the health, education, nutrition and economic development of the affected population. Our study aimed to estimate the prevalence of intestinal helminthiasis, including T. solium taeniasis in Chiparamba area of Chipata district in the Eastern province of Zambia. We found that 7.1% of the stool samples examined microscopically, were infected with at least one intestinal parasite. The most common parasites found were hookworm (3.0%) and S. mansoni (2.4%) while 0.4% were Taenia spp. We also found that 8.7% of the stool samples examined were positive for Taenia spp. antigens. Males were more associated with having intestinal parasites. Village level differences for infection with intestinal helminths as well as being positive for Taenia spp. antigens were also observed. The study shows that intestinal helminths including T. solium are present in our study community and require public health interventions for surveillance and control.
