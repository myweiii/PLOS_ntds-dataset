    "Background": "Intestinal helminth infections are among the most common infections worldwide and have a negative impact on the health, education, nutrition and economic development of affected populations. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of intestinal helminthiasis, including T. solium taeniasis, using a large-scale community-based study in Chiparamba area of Chipata District in the Eastern province of Zambia.",
    "Methods/Principal findings": "A cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2019 and December 2022 in a rural community of 25 randomly selected villages known to be at risk for T. solium infection. Stool samples were examined for intestinal helminths using the formol-ether concentration technique and further tested for taeniasis by copro antigen-ELISA (copro Ag-ELISA). Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and associations between the disease prevalence of active infections and individual- and village-level variables were determined using the chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact test. Predictors of an individual being positive for either taeniasis or other soil-transmitted helminths were determined using binary logistic regression. A total of 2762 stool samples were examined. One hundred ninety-five (7.1%) tested positive for at least one helminthic parasite on microscopy, with hookworm being the most frequent 84 (3.0%), followed by S. mansoni, 66 (2.4%). For taeniasis, 11 (0.4%) participants were positive for Taenia spp. microscopically, while 241 (8.7%) tested positive via copro Ag-ELISA. On bivariate analysis, male sex was significantly associated with the prevalence of intestinal parasites (p = 0.012) but not with that of taeniasis based on copro Ag-ELISA results. Village level differences were significant for infection with intestinal helminths as well as for taeniasis positivity on copro Ag-ELISA (p <0.001).",
    "Conclusion": "Intestinal helminths, including T. solium taeniasis, are prevalent in Chiparamba area of Chipata district in the eastern province of Zambia, supporting the clear need for further targeted public health interventions for surveillance and control."
