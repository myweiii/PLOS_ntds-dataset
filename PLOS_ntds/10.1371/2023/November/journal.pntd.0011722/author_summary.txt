This article investigates the ongoing presence of the plague in Iran and stresses the importance of continuous monitoring in the western region, a major area for endemic plague. Rodents are the primary carriers of diseases in their natural habitats and contribute significantly to the ongoing presence of infectious cycles. The study focuses on the presence of Yersinia pestis, the bacteria responsible for the plague, in guard dogs, rodents, and fleas in the historical center of western Iran. The research confirms the presence of Y. pestis infection in rodents, specifically Meriones persicus, in western Iran through serological evidence. Given the new discoveries in Iran and the resurgence of the plague in neighboring countries, ongoing monitoring of plague infections in wildlife across various regions of the country is crucial for public health outcomes.
