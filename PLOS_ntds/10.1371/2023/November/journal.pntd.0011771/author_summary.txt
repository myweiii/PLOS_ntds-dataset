Temperature is one of the main factors affecting BD incidence. Due to the largely different temperature ranges between regions, the classic multi-region time series studies could only explore the relative temperature-BD association and showed that BD incidence is positively associated with relative temperature (i.e., temperature percentile), which does not conform to the laboratory knowledge that both high and low temperatures interfere with the survival of bacteria. The relative-scale association also limits the intuition of epidemiological meanings. In this study, we proposed a novel two-stage strategy to characterize the association between BD and original temperature in 31 provinces, China. We examined an inverted U-shaped association, but not a monotonically increasing shape obtained using the classic strategy. This new finding conforms more to the laboratory knowledge and the original-scale association also provided an intuitive perspective and an easily explanatory result. Another advantage is that the novel strategy can extrapolate the province-specific association outside the observed temperature ranges by utilizing information from other provinces, which is meaningful considering the frequent incidences of extreme temperatures.
