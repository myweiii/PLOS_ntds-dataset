    "Background": "Bedaquiline (BDQ), by targeting the electron transport chain and having a long half-life, is a good candidate to simplify leprosy treatment. Our objectives were to (i) determine the minimal effective dose (MED) of BDQ administered orally, (ii) evaluate the benefit of combining two inhibitors of the respiratory chain, BDQ administered orally and clofazimine (CFZ)) and (iii) evaluate the benefit of an intramuscular injectable long-acting formulation of BDQ (intramuscular BDQ, BDQ-LA IM), in a murine model of leprosy.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "To determine the MED of BDQ administered orally and the benefit of adding CFZ, 100 four-week-old female nude mice were inoculated in the footpads with 5x103 bacilli of M. leprae strain THAI53. Mice were randomly allocated into: 1 untreated group, 5 groups treated with BDQ administered orally (0.10 to 25 mg/kg), 3 groups treated with CFZ 20 mg/kg alone or combined with BDQ administered orally 0.10 or 0.33 mg/kg, and 1 group treated with rifampicin (RIF) 10 mg/kg. Mice were treated 5 days a week during 24 weeks.",
    "Conclusion": "We demonstrated that the MED of BDQ administered orally against M. leprae was 3.3 mg/kg in mice and BDQ did not add significantly to the efficacy of CFZ at the doses tested. BDQ-LA IM was similar or less active than BDQ administered orally at equivalent dosing and frequency but should be tested at higher dosing in order to reach equivalent exposure in further experiments."
