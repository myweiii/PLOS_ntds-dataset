    "Introduction": "Malaria is one of the significant parasitic diseases. Host genetic and environmental components during malaria infection significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe [1,2]. Among the five species of plasmodial parasites in humans, Plasmodium falciparum infection is the main causative parasite of severe disease and malaria-related deaths [3,4]. The spectrum of clinical severity of symptoms can range from asymptomatic, uncomplicated, to severe malaria [4,5]. According to the recent World Health Organization Malaria Guidelines, uncomplicated malaria is defined as a patient who has a febrile illness and a positive parasitological test (microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) without features of severe malaria. In contrast, severe malaria involves the central nervous system (cerebral malaria), pulmonary system (respiratory failure), renal system (acute renal failure) and/or hematopoietic system (severe anaemia) [5,6]. There is evidence showing clinical manifestations of malaria and fatality depends on the host’s immune status, which is mainly orchestrated by inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [7,8]. In patients with malaria, the cytokine response was found to be responsible for elevated fever symptoms following the onset of blood infection and clinical feature [9]. TNF-α levels has been found to be positively correlated with the severity of malaria [10–12].\nTNF-α is produced by macrophages, neutrophils, activated lymphocytes, and natural killer cells [2]. The major role of TNF-α in inflammatory responses is a yardstick of patients’ reactivity towards malaria infection [13]. Gene variation can regulate gene transcription, protein expression, and thus the biological function of these cytokines. The TNF-α gene lies within a region of ~7 kb in the center of the primary histocompatibility complex locus on the short arm of human chromosome 6 [14]. Most extensive studies investigated the correlation between the TNF-α gene polymorphism in the -308 promoter region and disease status [15–19]. A point substitution at position –308 (in relation to the TNFα transcription start site) of the TNF-α gene [20] defines the TNFα alleles *1 (G at –308) and *2 (A at –308). This polymorphism (rs1800629) appears to be important in TNF-α production [21–23]. The circulating TNF-α level was found to be higher in TNF-α rs1800629A homozygous (AA) compared to TNFα rs1800629G homozygous (GG) individuals [24]. Moreover, the activation potential of the TNF-α rs1800629A allele is more significant than TNF-α rs1800629G allele in producing TNF-α [25].\nSeveral case-control groups among primary studies have examined the association between rs1800629 polymorphism and disease severity. However, the results of these studies [26–33] are conflicting, probably because of small sample sizes and low statistical power. Although recent meta-analysis [34] reported a significant association between TNF-α -308G >A polymorphism and predisposition to severe P. falciparum malaria in the allele and dominant model, there were some obvious limitations in their meta-analytic procedure. First, the subjects in the control group consisted of heterogenous phenotypes, including asymptomatic malaria [35], uncomplicated malaria, and other illnesses [36]. Second, additional five component studies were not included in their meta-analysis even genotype frequencies could be obtained. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was not performed in the different populations. Based on the above reasons, the present meta-analysis on the association of TNF-α -308G >A and severe malaria was performed to obtain a more precise estimate. Meta-analysis is helpful for detecting associations that may be obscured in studies of limited sample sizes, particularly in those evaluating rare allele frequency polymorphisms. The current study aimed to update the meta-analysis of the published studies to ascertain whether the polymorphisms of TNF-α -308G >A increases susceptibility to severe P. falciparum malaria and assess their possible association between ethnically diverse populations.",
    "Materials and methods": "Case-control definition Patients with severe P. falciparum malaria were included as the study populations (cases). Intervention or exposure was not applied in this case. The control group included patients who manifested uncomplicated malaria’s clinical symptoms as described by the World Health Organization [6].\n\nPublication search and selection of studies\nThis meta-analysis was performed by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [37]. We searched the electronic MEDLINE database using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and MedNar (deep web search engine) for association studies as of April 1, 2023. The search terms applied were “Tumor necrosis factor-alpha”, “TNF-α -308”, “TNF-α-308G/A”, “polymorphism”, “malaria”, and “rs1800629”, with no restriction of language. The cited references of full-text and review articles were manually scanned to increase additional studies. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) original case-control design that examined the associations between TNF-α-308G >A polymorphism and risk of uncomplicated or severe P. falciparum malaria; and (ii) provision of genotype frequency data that allowed calculation of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Exclusion criteria were (i) review or systematic review articles; (ii) studies that did not cover the polymorphisms TNF-α -308G >A or disease in question; (iii) non-human subjects; (iv) studies without controls or studies whose genotype or allele frequencies were unusable or absent; (v) not uncomplicated malaria control type; (vi) not P. falciparum malaria; and (vii) articles whose genotype data originated from the same group of the population (duplicated genotype data).\n\n\nData extraction and study quality\nTwo investigators (PK and NP) independently extracted data. Disagreements were adjudicated by a third investigator (PT) and arrived at a consensus. Key information from the selected articles included: the first author’s last name, year of publication, country of origin, ethnicity, age of case and control, genotyping method, and malaria type of case and control. Quantitative features from the articles were also extracted. These included numbers of cases and controls, the sum of which generated the sample size, statistical power, genotype frequencies (GG, GA, and AA), and those of the minor allele and the HWE. Using the application in https://gene-calc.pl/hardy-weinberg-page., the HWE was assessed, and the P-value of the controls from Pearson’s goodness-of-fit χ2-square test was reported. The potential impact of HWE-non-compliant studies was examined to ascertain genotyping quality. The Clark-Baudouin scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies [38]. Criteria for the evaluation included P-values, statistical power, multiple-comparison correction, comparative sample sizes between cases and controls, genotyping methods, and the HWE. On this scale, the scores of < 5, 5–6, and ≥ 7 were considered low, moderate and high quality, respectively.\n\n\nData distribution and statistical power\nThe distribution of the data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks test [39] using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Gaussian (normal) distribution (P > 0.05) warranted descriptive and inferential expressions of the mean ± standard deviation (SD) as well as the parametric approach. Otherwise, the median with interquartile range (IQR) and non-parametric tests were used. The statistical power was assessed using the statistical software G*Power [40], assuming an OR of 1.5 with a genotypic risk level of α = 0.05 (two-sided), where power was considered adequate at ≥ 80%. With complete linkage disequilibrium for all the TNF-α polymorphisms, only the rs1800629 (-308G>A) polymorphism was focused, which best represented all included articles.\n\n\nMeta-analysis\nThe risk for severe P. falciparum malaria (using raw data for frequencies) was estimated for each study, and comparing the effects on the same baseline. Pooled ORs and 95% Cis were calculated with a significance threshold of P ≤ 0.05 (two-tailed). TNF-α associations with OR were estimated for each study. The presence of zero genotype values warranted applying the Laplace correction, which involves adding a pseudo-count of one to all data set values [41]. This method could be used in the current study because MAF of all included studies are approximately less than 2%, indicating a low prevalence of mutation probability. Pooled ORs with 95% CIs were calculated for the following genetic models: (a) homozygous: AA and GG genotypes compared with GG; (b) recessive: AA versus GA + GG; (c) dominant: AA + GA versus GG; and (d) codominant: A versus G. Heterogeneity of the study was estimated using χ2-based Q test, where significance was set at P ≤ 0.10 [42] and quantified with the measure of variability (I2) statistic [43]. Either the presence of heterogeneity or not warranted using random and fixed-effects models of analyses, respectively [44,45].\nSubgroup analysis was performed with respect to ethnicity, including Africans and Asians.The probability of differential risk associations between comparisons warranted testing for the presence of interactions [46]. Sensitivity analysis, which involves omitting one study at a time and recalculating the pooled OR, was used to test for the robustness of the summary effects. Tests for publication bias were used to evaluate the influence of small-study specific effects [47] and were applied on comparisons that met two conditions: (i) associatively significant (Pa < 0.05), and (ii) ≥ 10 studies [48].\nData were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK), SIGMASTAT 2.03, and SIGMAPLOT 11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).",
    "Results": "Characteristics of the included studies\nThe flow chart of the study selection was outlined in Fig 1 according to PRISMA guidelines. The initial search of four databases and four search strings yielded 13,087 citations, which were further reduced to 115 after reviewing titles and abstracts and removing duplicates (S1 Table). After full-text evaluation, 107 articles were excluded because of not conforming to the inclusion criteria. A manual search of the cited reference list yielded no additional articles. Table 1 lists the eight case-control studies included in the meta-analysis [26–33]. Of them, five [26,27,29,32,33] were not included (new) in a recent meta-analysis [34]. The year range of the articles was 1994–2019 and comprised 1,448 severe P. falciparum malaria cases and 1,371 uncomplicated malaria control. Patients in three studies were Africans (843 cases/718 controls), and five studies were Asians (605 cases/653 controls). The age of the subjects was heterogeneous (children to adults). The mean and SD values of the normally distributed Clark-Baudouin scores (Shapiro-Wilks: P = 0.139) were 6.38 ± 1.69, with most (62.5%) of the articles scoring ≥ 7. These values indicate the high methodological quality of the included studies.\nTable 2 shows the quantitative traits of the included studies. Sample sizes ranged from 67 to 819 and the statistical powers ranged from 12.4 to 80.1%, in which only one study [26] had power of more than 80%. The mean and SD of the minor allele frequency in Africans (0.13 ± 0.02) were not significantly different (Unpaired t-test, P = 0.73) from those in Asians (0.11 ± 0.04). The control group in one article (12.5%) [33] showed a significant deviation from HWE. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines checklist provides detailed description of this meta-analysis (S3 Table).\n\n\nMeta-analysis outcomes\nTable 3 shows 16 comparisons between TNF-α -308G >A and risk for severe malaria. Two of the 16 were significant (Pa = 0.01–0.03), both derived from stratification analysis by ethnicity. The overall analysis showed no significant association in the four genetic models (ORs 1.14–1.52, 95% CIs 0.74–2.79, Pa = 0.24–0.55). A similar result was also observed in the HWE-complaint analysis (ORs 1.10–1.32, 95% CIs 0.68–2.37, Pa = 0.36–0.68).\nIn the Asians population, there were two significant associations between the TNF-α -308G >A polymorphism and the risk SM in the dominant (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.06–3.61, Pa = 0.03) and codominant model (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.15–2.92, Pa = 0.01) comparisons. However, when one HWE non-compliant study was excluded [33], only codominant model was retained significant association (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.25, Pa = 0.002) (S2 Table). The heterogeneity of the two main outcomes was significant (Pb = 0.01–0.05) with a high percentage of variation (I2 = 58–68%). The random-effects model was therefore, employed in the OR calculations.\nFig 2 illustrates the forest plots of the association between TNF-α -308G >A gene polymorphism and the severity of falciparum malaria showing the differences in outcome between Africans and Asians in the dominant and codominant models.\n(A) African dominant (B) Asian dominant (C) African codominant and (D) Asian codomiant. CI: confidence interval; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; CI: confidence interval; df: degree of freedom; I2: measure of variability; UM: uncomplicated malaria; SM: severe malaria.\n\n\nTests of interaction\nInteraction tests were calculated on the significant ethnic subgroup outcomes. Table 4 shows that of 2 comparisons subjected to these tests, the two non-significant African effects (dominant: OR 0.72, Pa = 0.30; codominant: OR 0.73, Pa = 0.34) compared with that of the two significant Asian effects (dominant: OR 1.95, Pa = 0.03; codominant: OR 1.83, Pa = 0.01) resulted in significant interaction (dominant: Pinteraction = 0.023, codominant: Pinteraction = 0.026) suggesting improved association. This comparative outcome strengthens the statistical evidence favoring the Asian effect.\n\n\nSensitivity analysis and publication bias\nSensitivity analysis was performed using a modified protocol that confined this treatment to the significant findings. Pooled effects that retained (P < 0.05) or lost (P > 0.05) significance were considered robust and not robust, respectively. The results indicate the robustness of two significant outcomes (Table 3). Since there was a limited number of studies (< 10), a test for publication could not be conducted in this meta-analysis.",
    "Discussion": "Examination of the association between -308G >A (rs1800629) and the risk of severe P. falciparum malaria relied on the literature’s usable data, which paved the way to use the arsenal of meta-analytical processes, including modifier (HWE-compliant), subgrouping, sensitivity, and test of interaction. This is the second meta-analysis to address the association between TNF-α —308G >A polymorphisms and the risk of severe P. falciparum malaria and the first meta-analysis to unravel this association in different populations. Contrary to the previous meta-analysis [34], the study failed to reveal an association between TNF-α -308G >A polymorphism and susceptibility to severe P. falciparum malaria in the overall analysis under all genetic models. Moreover, the modifier analyses (excluding the HWE-deviated study) further validated the non-significant association. Interestingly, after stratification by ethnicity, significant associations were found in dominant and codominant carriers in Asians favoring SM, which is the principle finding of the current meta-analysis. Also, both important outcomes showed statistically significant subgroup differences by interaction test as well as the stability of the outcomes.\n\nTNF-α -308G >A and malaria\nThe diversity of clinical manifestations of malaria reflects a diverse pathophysiological mechanism depending on factors such as the degree of infection and host immunity [49]. TNF-α is a crucial proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis and control of P. falciparum infection [30]. Physiologically, the inappropriate or excessive production of TNF-α can contribute to severity and mortality [50,51]. The underlying mechanism can be involved in toxicity and inflammatory processes such as promoting extravasation of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocyte to endothelial cells, affecting immune responses by controlling T cell activation. These result in inducing the synthesis of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of different cell types, increasing malaria severity as well as other complications [50,51]. The rare allele (A) for TNF-α (-308G >A) polymorphism produces a higher level of TNF-αmessenger ribonucleic acid and thus, a high TNF-α phenotype, compared to that of major allele G [23]. Therefore, the blood TNF-α level based on the genetic background may partly contributable to the intensity of the host immune response.\nPrevious meta-analysis indicated that patients with UM had higher TNF-α levels than those with asymptomatic malaria [52]. However, there was no difference in TNF-α levels between fatal and non-fatal cases, suggesting that TNF-α levels are not associated with mortality. In turn, the diverse genetic background likely impacts the progression of clinical severity. Moreover, the severity of malaria symptoms may involve the contribution of multi-genes encoding vital host proteins. Previous investigations reported interactions between the TNF-α and other genes [53,54], suggesting that multiple functional polymorphism’s effects seem more vital than a single polymorphism’s effects. Of note, half of the included articles in the meta-analysis addressed haplotype analysis [27,28,30,32].\nThe subgroup analysis of the current study showed that Asians significantly favor SM. Meanwhile, Africans favor UM, although there was non-significance in statistics. The finding of different associations is somewhat surprising. A possible explanation for TNF-α -308G >A playing a different role in different ethnic could be a result of genetic and clinical heterogeneity between the different populations. Whole-genome linkage studies on severe P. falciparum malaria have shown genetic heterogeneity [55]. Although the frequency of TNFα -308G >A in Asian populations such as Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, and Vietnam was found to be low (0.06–2.00%), the association between TNFα -308G >A polymorphism and malaria clinical outcomes remains evidently clear. The homozygous AA of TNFα at -308 was associated with severe malaria in Sri Lanka [32], but no association was found in Myanmar patients [33]. As well, it was of interest that different linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns may contribute to the discrepancy. The polymorphism may be in LD with a nearby causal variant in one ethnic group but not in another. Because Africa is the origin of modern humans, there is a high level of genetic diversity and weak LD in African compared to non-African populations [55]. However, the chance of type I error from multiple testing could not be ruled out. It is unlikely that the discrepancy arises from the number of articles. Fewer studies in Africans (n = 3) generated more total patients in case and control than Asians (n = 5). Further investigation could be performed to strengthen the current results.\n\n\nNovelties of the present meta-analysis\nMeta-analyses are confronted with a host of epidemiological heterogeneities (different ethnic backgrounds of sample populations) and methodological issues, e.g., diagnostic criteria, inclusion/exclusion criteria, lack of uniformity in how outcomes are measured, poorly defined phenotypes as well as population stratification, which may contribute to difficulties in detecting significant allelic association with phenotypes [56].\nOur study delineates the role of TNF-α -308G >A polymorphism and the severity of P. falciparum malaria, showing there was no statistically significant association for all genetic models. Instead, the significant association was only observed in the racial subgroup. A recent meta-analysis [34] found a significant association between the -308G >A polymorphism and predisposition to the P. falciparum clinical severity in the allele comparison and dominant model. There are several possible reasons for such different results. First, the current meta-analysis included five more published studies that were not included in the previous one. In this study, 8 eligible studies with 1,448 cases and 1,371 controls to yield summary statistics, however, Sarangi et al. (2023) analyzed data with 982 cases and 773 controls. Second, the malaria phenotype in the control group was not uniform in previous meta-analyses [34]. The control subjects from two studies [35,36] were asymptomatic malaria and other illness, while the remaining were UM. Third, the present analysis included a subgroup analysis of ethnically diverse populations.\n\n\nStrengths and limitations\nPointing out the limitations and strengths contextualizes the interpretation of the present meta-analysis results. There are still some limitations that could be addressed in this study. First, the majority (7/8: 87.5%) of published studies were underpowered (< 80%) to prove authentic associations. Second, the number of patients and studies was not sufficiently large, particularly for subgroup analyses. Third, the present analysis included only English articles. It may have articles in other languages or in local journals. Fourth, the effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were not addressed due to inadequate data. Fifth, the influence of TNF-α -308G >A did not preclude effects from other polymorphisms in proximity to TNF-α given the complete LD between them. Sixth, publication bias was not analyzed (number of studies < 10), which may have distorted the results. Seventh, the fact that Laplace correction was applied to the genotype frequencies may have distorted our results, possibly highly sensitive modification of a SNP that already has a low MAF. However, this method improves algorithms’ exploring power and is not likely affected the results when the variance loss at maximum value of 0.5. Eighth, great disparity of minor allele A among the Asians studies may affect the outcome of overall and Asian subgroup. On the other hand, our main results showed that two significant associations were retained in the domianant and codominant model after excluding the highest MAF study (S2 Table). Despite these limitations, the strength of present meta-analyses include (i) the most control group in the selected literature (7/8, 87.5%) were distributed in compliance with HWE, indicating the high genotyping quality of the component studies; (ii) the type of malaria parasite in all patients was homogenous, i.e., P. falciparum; (iii) all of the included articles were population-based which facilitates extrapolation of our findings to the general populations in Africans and Asians; (iv) most of the quality of the case-control studies included in the current meta-analysis (7/8, 87.5%) had moderate to high Clark-Baudouin scores indicating good methodological quality; and (v) modifier analysis was performed, which excludes non-HWE compliant study. The outcome of the non-association of TNF-α -308G >A polymorphism and SM remains.",
    "Conclusions": "The present meta-analysis suggests that the TNF-α -308G >A polymorphisms significantly increased susceptibility to SM in Asians but not in the African population for the dominant and codominant models. The significant association was achieved by various meta-analysis procedures, including modifier (HWE), subgrouping, and test of interaction. Further large-scale and well-designed studies taking into account different ethnic groups remain to be required to confirm these findings."
