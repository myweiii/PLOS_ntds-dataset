    "Abstract": "Mycetomas are endemic diseases in tropical and sub-tropical countries of Africa, Asia and America, mainly affecting rural populations living below the poverty line. We report a particular case of a mycetoma associated with pregnancy whose evolution was good, but at the cost of significant financial expenses. This was a 39-year-old woman who developed a fungal mycetoma due to Madurella mycetomatis from the ingunocrural region. The patient had to develop several previous pregnancies on this site of mycetoma, the outcome of which was favorable. The last pregnancy was accompanied by an aggravation of the mycetoma in the form of polyfistulized inflammatory swelling of the right inguino-crural region emitting black grains. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the region showed invasion of the adductor muscles at the level of the root of the thigh on its antero-internal side with no sign of pelvic extension or underlying bone lesion. The patient was treated by surgery associated with antifungal treatment. The evolution was favorable for pregnancy and mycetoma."
