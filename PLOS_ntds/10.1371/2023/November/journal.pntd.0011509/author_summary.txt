Plague is an infectious disease that, despite affecting humans for more than 5000 years, has historically been the subject of limited drug development activity. In fact, the drugs currently used to treat plague have been approved based on experimental data aloneâ€“no major clinical trials have yet been completed that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of one treatment over another in humans. A major barrier to accomplishing this is that few research studies have taken place to date that can meaningfully inform the design of a clinical trial. We conducted this systematic review to gather and summarise all the existing information on the clinical profile of plague patients to understand whether sufficient information exists on which to design informative clinical trials that would provide clinicians and policy-makers with the information needed to make treatment decisions for patients.
This study however found that, based on the existing literature, there is insufficient data that can be used to develop methodologies for future trials. Either time must be invested in to collecting robust clinical data or innovative trial designs need to be identified that can simultaneously collect much-needed observational data while also evaluating much-needed interventions.
