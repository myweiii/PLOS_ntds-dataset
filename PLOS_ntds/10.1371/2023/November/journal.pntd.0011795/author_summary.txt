Our study suggests the repurposing of epetraborole for the treatment of the often rapidly progressing and fatal disease melioidosis is warranted. Melioidosis is caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, commonly found in Southeast Asia, Australia, Central and South America, Mexico, and recently in the Southern United States. The current clinical treatment of melioidosis involving multiple drugs is extensive, and a portion of infections will persist or relapse after the completion of treatment. Resistance to the majority of antibiotics limits the ability to treat and manage the disease effectively. However, Burkholderia pseudomallei is an under-recognized emerging pathogen with a general lack of resources and interest to drive research for new treatments. Epetraborole was initially identified with in vitro and in vivo activity against various medically important Gram-negative bacterial infections and was advanced to treat complicated urinary tract infections. Accordingly, we have assessed the use of epetraborole to treat melioidosis in a mouse model when administered alone or in combination with the current clinically used drug ceftazidime.
