Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are neglected tropical diseases caused by parasitic filarial nematodes. Current efforts to eliminate these diseases are hindered by a lack of drugs that permanently sterilize and/or kill the adult worms. Antibacterials, including doxycycline, have been shown to deplete Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium essential to the fertility and development of the adult worms, leading to their permanent sterilization and death. However, doxycycline is contraindicated in women of child-bearing age, breastfeeding women, and children, and must be given for 4â€“6 weeks to be effective. There is a need for agents with fewer contraindications and a shorter treatment regimen. Flubentylosin is an antibacterial with demonstrated anti-Wolbachia activity in several animal models of filarial disease. The present first-in-human Phase-I clinical study investigated the safety and pharmacokinetics of flubentylosin in healthy male and female subjects after single and multiple ascending doses, as well as the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of flubentylosin, in order to identify appropriate regimens for Phase-II studies. Treatment regimens with 400 mg flubentylosin for 7 or 14 days were selected for further investigation.
