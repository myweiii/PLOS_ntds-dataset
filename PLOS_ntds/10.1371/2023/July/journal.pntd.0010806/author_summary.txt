China has the highest number of people infected with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the world, and Shenyang, located in the northeast, is a high prevalence area for infection in China. Previous studies have found that there are several analytical methods on outbreak prediction and that HFRS infection is climate-related. However, HFRS has been less studied in terms of comparative time series prediction, and the link between outbreaks and atmospheric pollution and the identification of the joint effects of meteorological factors affecting this link have not been studied. These are the two main focuses of this study. A synchronous periodicity and seasonality between pollutants, climate change and HFRS infection were found throughout the study area, both located in spring-summer and winter-related. Specifically, on the one hand, high sulfur dioxide concentrations increase the risk of developing HFRS. On the other hand, the combined effect of climate and pollutants on HFRS became increasingly sensitive over time, showing as the highest risk of contracting HFRS when increasing daily sulfur dioxide and decreasing humidity. Time series analysis showed that seasonal SARIMA models are more suitable for prediction, and the association between climate and pollution and HFRS infection has been confirmed within the time series analysis. The above findings help to improve the understanding of the transmission effects of HFRS in different meteorological and pollution levels and the prediction of HFRS outbreak epidemics.
