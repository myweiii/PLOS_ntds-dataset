Trachoma remains a public health problem in 43 countries in 2022, including 26 countries in the African region. During the 72nd Session of the World Health Organization Regional Committee for Africa held in Lomé, Togo, from 22 to 26 August 2022, World Health Organization has honored Togo for becoming the first country in the world to eliminate four neglected tropical diseases in only 11 years namely dracunculiasis (Guinea worm), lymphatic filariasis, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and trachoma, the last of which was eliminated in May 2022. Between 2006 and 2016, different surveys were conducted to identify trachoma endemic areas, scree n and manage Trachomatous trichiasis cases. Final epidemiological surveys conducted in 2017 confirmed that there was sufficient evidence to show that elimination should be achieved in all endemic areas prompting the formal submission of the country’s elimination dossier to the World Health Organization.
By reaching this milestone, Togo has improved the quality of life of people living in former trachoma endemic areas by avoiding visual impairment and eventual blindness due to this disease. Post- validation monitoring and surveillance is essential to detect the resurgence of the disease because elimination as a public health problem is a reversible state.
