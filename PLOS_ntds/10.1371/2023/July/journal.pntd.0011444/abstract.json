    "Background": "As of May 2022, 15 countries have declared that they have reached their trachoma elimination targets, but only 13 of them, including Togo, have been validated by the World Health Organization as having eliminated the disease as a public health problem. The aim of this study was to describe the broad interventions that have supported the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem in Togo from its inception in 2006 to the validation of its elimination in 2022.",
    "Method": "A review and compilation of data and information contained in the country\u2019s submission to World Health Organization for validation of trachoma elimination as a public health problem was conducted. Data from national and local surveillance systems and reports on actions taken after achieving the elimination target were also included.",
    "Results": "Togo has achieved the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem by 2022. The prevalence of follicular trachoma among children aged 1\u20139 years is <5% in all nationally defined administrative units suspected of having trachoma after stopping mass treatment for at least 2 years. The prevalence of trichiasis among persons aged 15 years and older is less than 0.2% in all administrative units previously endemic for trachoma and evidence of the ability to manage incident cases of emerging trichiasis in the community has been demonstrated. The key of the success in the elimination process was primarily the political commitment of the health authorities with financial and technical support from various international organizations.",
    "Conclusion": "The elimination of trachoma as a public health problem in Togo is a real success story that can serve as an example for the elimination of other neglected tropical diseases in Africa. But regular monitoring and surveillance is essential to avoid the re-emergence of such disease in the country."
