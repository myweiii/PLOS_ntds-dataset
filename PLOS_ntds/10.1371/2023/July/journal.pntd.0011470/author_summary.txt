P. cynolmogi is zoonotic protozoa that cause malaria in both macaques and humans. In the past few years, the human infection rate from this parasite has risen throughout Southeast Asia. We have developed molecular testing for diagnosing P. cynolmogi based on a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a lateral flow (LF) strip. The rapid, sensitive, and portable of our testing represents a promising assay for the P. cynomolgi diagnosis method.
