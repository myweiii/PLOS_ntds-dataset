Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a common cause of chronic lung disease. It mimics tuberculosis (TB), and can occur during or after TB treatment, mainly in patients with lung cavities. Since nearly 40% of TB cases worldwide are undiagnosed microbiologically, CPA may be the most common cause of symptoms in patients treated for TB without a microbiological diagnosis. Understanding the burden of CPA using the Aspergillus antibody test is an important initial step in addressing this persistent and chronic neglected disease in low-resource settings and presents an opportunity for healthcare workers to acquire the skills needed to reduce unnecessary CPA-related mortality. This study assessed the prevalence of Aspergillus seropositivity and CPA and found that 20.8% of patients were positive for Aspergillus antibodies and 11.6% had CPA. Common symptoms were cough, weight loss, difficulty breathing and fever and TB was an independent predictor of Aspergillus seropositivity and CPA.
