V. vulnificus is one of the deadliest waterborne pathogens in the world. It is a bacterium that is transmitted in aquatic settings and causes a serious human infection that can often end in death. Even though V. vulnificus has attracted recent attention from the public health sector, little is known about the environmental forces that contribute to outbreaks. In this study, we use data on V. vulnificus cases from the Florida Department of Health, and data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to identify the meteorological factors that are associated with both cases and fatalities from V. vulnificus. We find that warmer air and water temperatures are associated with severe cases of V. vulnificus. In addition, our results suggest that decreasing wind speed and air pressure were associated with a higher probability of a V. vulnificus case. In the future, these kinds of data may help public health agencies mobilize resources in preventing outbreaks. Further, these results highlight the potential connection between the forces associated with climate change and infectious disease outbreaks.
