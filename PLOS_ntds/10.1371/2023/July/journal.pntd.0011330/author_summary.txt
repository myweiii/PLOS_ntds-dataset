Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan infection that can be transmitted to humans by triatomine insects, endemic from 21 Latin American countries. It can also be transmitted vertically (mother to child) and by blood transfusions, among other less frequent methods. T. cruzi infection is called Chagas Disease (CD) when causing organ damage, such as Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CC) and digestive involvement in 30â€“40% of cases. The large migration flows from Latin America to Europe have globalized the distribution of T. cruzi infection. Thus, screening is recommended for Latin Americans living in non-endemic countries. We have retrospectively analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics of individuals from endemic countries screened for T. cruzi infection in Barcelona over 17 years, revealing a great number of working-age women coming from highly endemic areas for T. cruzi infection, which reflect the migration movements of the last decades and help us to focus the screening and health promotion programs. We have also analyzed the initial organ damage assessment, which revealed a great proportion of right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, considered typical CD lesions (although unspecific). We also found an important proportion of patients with an altered echocardiogram but having a normal ECG, which reinforces the echocardiogram as an essential test for the assessment of CC.
