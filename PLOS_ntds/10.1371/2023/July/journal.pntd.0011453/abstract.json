    "Background": "Candida haemulonii complex-related species are pathogenic yeasts closely related to Candida auris with intrinsic antifungal resistance, but few epidemiological data are available.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We analyzed clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with fungemia due to C. haemulonii complex and related species (C. pseudohaemulonii, C. vulturna) reported in France during 2002–2021, and compared them to data of C. parapsilosis fungemia, as they all can be commensal of the skin. We also conducted a study on adult inpatients and outpatients colonized by C. haemulonii complex, managed at the University Hospital of Martinique during 2014–2020. Finally, we performed a literature review of fungemia due to C. haemulonii complex and related species reported in Medline (1962–2022).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Multidrug-resistant C. haemulonii complex-related species are responsible for fungemia and colonization in community and hospital settings, especially in tropical regions, warranting closer epidemiological surveillance to prevent a potential C. auris-like threat."
