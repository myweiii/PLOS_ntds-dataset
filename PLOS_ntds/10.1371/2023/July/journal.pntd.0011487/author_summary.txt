Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, the latter including, hookworms, roundworms, and whipworms, are the most widespread parasitic neglected tropical diseases. As is the case in many sub-Saharan African countries, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis are endemic in Côte d’Ivoire. Mass drug administration is the mainstay of the global control strategy against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis and has been implemented in Côte d’Ivoire since 2013. The new road map put forward by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the control of neglected tropical diseases aims to eliminate schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis as a public health problem by 2030. In light of WHO’s goals, this study updates prevalence data for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis and provides a deeper understanding of risk factors that drive transmission in the northern part of Côte d’Ivoire. The findings showed very low prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis and hookworm. Participants aged 16–20 years and fishermen had the highest prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, with both males (2.3%) and females (1.3%) at risk of infection. The results corroborate findings from other investigations in sub-Saharan Africa, which confirm that current efforts to control schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis are successful. Nevertheless, further investment is still needed to reach elimination. In particular, a surveillance-response system would be a valuable tool in a low-prevalence context such as northern Côte d’Ivoire.
