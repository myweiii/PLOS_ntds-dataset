    "Background": "Schistosomiasis is of great public health concern with a wide distribution and multiple determinants. Due to the advances in schistosomiasis elimination and the need for precision prevention and control, identifying determinants at a fine scale is urgent and necessary, especially for resource deployment in practice. Our study aimed to identify the determinants for the seropositive rate of schistosomiasis at the village level and to explore their spatial variations in local space.",
    "Methodology": "The seropositive rates of schistosomiasis were collected from 1714 villages or communities in Human Province, and six spatial regression models including ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), geographically weighted regression (GWR), robust GWR (RGWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) were used to fit the data.",
    "Principal/Findings": "MGWR was the best-fitting model (R2: 0.821, AICc:2727.092). Overall, the nearest distance from the river had the highest mean negative correlation, followed by proportion of households using well water and the annual average daytime surface temperature. The proportions of unmodified toilets showed the highest mean positive correlation, followed by the snail infested area, and the number of cattle. In spatial variability, the regression coefficients for the nearest distance from the river, annual average daytime surface temperature and the proportion of unmodified toilets were significant in all villages or communities and varied little in local space. The other significant determinants differed substantially in local space and had significance ratios ranging from 41% to 70%, including the number of cattle, the snail infested area and the proportion of households using well water.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our study shows that MGWR was well performed for the spatial variability of schistosomiasis in Hunan province. The spatial variability was different for different determinants. The findings for the determinants for the seropositive rate and mapped variability for some key determinants at the village level can be used for developing precision intervention measure for schistosomiasis control."
