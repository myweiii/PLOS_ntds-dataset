Schistosomiasis mansoni is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection from parasitic worms of the species Schistosoma mansoni. Due to the complexity of the mechanism of transmission and maintenance of schistosomiasis, several preventive actions on diverse conditioning factors can promote disease control. Active search, timely treatment of cases, stool tests, and epidemiological investigations are the initial actions under programs for epidemiological surveillance of the disease. Thus, national surveys on prevalence of the disease covering a large time span can provide valuable information about its epidemiological pattern over the years. Our study addressed three national surveys with historical coverage (1947–1953, 1975–1979, and 2010–2015) that mapped the prevalence of the disease in children aged 7–14 for nearly seven decades. We also employed statistical models to investigate which environmental, economic, or demographic factors are associated with the disease at municipal level. The results showed that the decrease in schistosomiasis from the 1950s to the 2010s was statistically significant and suggests that improvements in water supply and sanitation require structured and systemic approaches for controlling the transmission of schistosomiasis.
