Cysticercosis is a serious, yet neglected disease caused by the larval stage of a zoonotic tapeworm, prevalent in many developing countries, including Burkina Faso. Being able to predict where the disease occurs is essential for running targeted prevention and control activities. In our study, we aimed to describe whether human cysticercosis cases in three provinces in Burkina Faso were clustered, and investigated whether there was a link between this clustering and some land and weather variables. Finally, we aimed to generate high-resolution prediction maps for the occurrence of the infection. We found that there was clustering at 45 meters for the individual- and 28.2 km for the village-level datasets, respectively. Increasing rainfall and proximity to a river were linked with this clustering. The generated prediction maps indicated there were important cysticercosis hotspots in the study area, especially in the extreme south and north-west, where the disease is thought to be more important. Further research should expand the use of spatial techniques to predict the occurrence of cysticercosis, the results of which can aid in the design of intervention programmes.
