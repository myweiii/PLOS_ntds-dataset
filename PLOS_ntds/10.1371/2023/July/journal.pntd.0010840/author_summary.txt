The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic filariasis (LF) aims to interrupt transmission by implementing mass drug administration (MDA) of antifilarial drugs in endemic areas; and to alleviate suffering of those affected through improved morbidity management and disability prevention. Significant progress has been made in the global efforts to eliminate LF. One of the main challenges faced by most LF-endemic countries that have implemented MDA is to effectively undertake post-validation surveillance to identify residual hotspots of ongoing transmission. American Samoa conducted seven rounds of MDA for LF between 2000 and 2006. Subsequently, the territory passed transmission assessment surveys in February 2011 (TAS-1) and April 2015 (TAS-2). However, the territory failed TAS-3 in September 2016, indicating resurgence. We implemented a Bayesian geostatistical analysis to predict LF prevalence estimates for American Samoa and examined the geographical distribution of the infection using sociodemographic and environmental factors. Our observations indicate that there are still areas with high prevalence of LF in the territory, particularly in the north-west of the main island of Tutuila. Bayesian geostatistical approaches have a promising role in guiding programmatic decision making by facilitating more specific targeting of post-MDA surveillance activities and prioritising those areas at higher risk of ongoing transmission.
