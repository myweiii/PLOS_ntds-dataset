The nature of disease caused by snakebite amongst children in rural Africa is poorly understood. All children presenting to Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya with snakebite between 2003 and 2021 were recruited into a study that was nested in an ongoing hospital and community surveillance study. 584 children presented following snakebite and the incidence was 29.1/100,000 person-years amongst children aged 6â€“12 years. The incidence remained consistent over the course of the study despite the population increasing by over 50%, highlighting that the burden of disease is increasing in-line with population growth. Many children initially sought traditional therapies, which was associated with delayed presentation to hospital. The mortality rate was low, and most children had local, rather than systemic, envenoming. Predictors of severe local envenoming at the time of admission included a high white blood cell count, low haemoglobin, and an upper limb bite site. The findings of this study highlight the need to strengthen strategies to prevent snakebite in children, to overcome barriers to attending hospital, and to develop therapeutics that better treat local envenoming.
