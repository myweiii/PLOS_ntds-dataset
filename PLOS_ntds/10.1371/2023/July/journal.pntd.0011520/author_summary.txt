Liver fibrosis is one of the histopathological features during Echinococcus multilocularis infection. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a key event in the development of liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism of HSC activation in the liver fibrosis induced by E. multilocularis infection remains largely unknown. In recent years, there is increasing evidence indicate that the abnormal expression of miRNAs is closely related to the occurrence and development of liver fibrosis. The expression profile of miRNA in hepatic fibrosis induced by E. multilocularis infection has been widely characterized, but the roles of miRNAs in liver fibrosis are largely unexplored. Herein, we identified a set of differentially expressed miRNAs in the activated HSCs induced by E. multilocularis, mmu-miR-342-3p of which was dominantly expressed in HSCs. This study signifies the important role of mmu-miR-342-3p in the HSC activation, which will help us to better understand the mechanism of liver fibrosis induced by E. multilocularis infection.
