Nocardiosis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Nocardia and potentially lifethreatening infection. Despite increasing attention towards the Nocardia infections, the overall epidemiological information and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical Nocardia species remains limited for China. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using data of 42 qualified publications. Our pooled analysis of these studies demonstrated that N. farcinica and N. cyriacigeorgica are the most frequently isolated species, which are widely distributed in China. Totally, 70.4% (223/317) Nocardia were cultured from respiratory tract specimens. Susceptibility varied by species of Nocardia. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can still be the preferred agent for initial Nocardia infection therapy due to the low resistance rate, linezolid and amikacin could be an alternative to treat nocardiosis or a choice in a combination regimen.
