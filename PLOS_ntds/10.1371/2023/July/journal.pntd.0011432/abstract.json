    "Background": "Nocardia species can cause local or disseminated infection. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of nocardiosis are required, because it can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of local species distribution and susceptibility patterns is important to appropriate empiric therapy. However, knowledge on the epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical Nocardia species remains limited in China.",
    "Methods": "The data of isolation of Nocardia species were collected from databases such as Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase as well as Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and VIP). Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Random effect models were used and tested with Cochran\u2019s Q and I2 statistics taking into account the possibility of heterogeneity between studies.",
    "Results": "In total, 791 Nocardia isolates were identified to 19 species levels among all the recruited studies. The most common species were N. farcinica (29.1%, 230/791), followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (25.3%, 200/791), N. brasiliensis (11.8%, 93/791) and N. otitidiscaviarum (7.8%, 62/791). N. farcinica and N. cyriacigeorgica were widely distributed, N. brasiliensis mainly prevalent in the south, N. otitidiscaviarum mainly distributed in the eastern coastal provinces of China. Totally, 70.4% (223/317) Nocardia were cultured from respiratory tract specimens, 16.4% (52/317) from extra-pulmonary specimens, and 13.3% (42/317) from disseminated infection. The proportion of susceptible isolates as follows: linezolid 99.5% (197/198), amikacin 96.0% (190/198), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 92.9% (184/198), imipenem 64.7% (128/198). Susceptibility varied by species of Nocardia.",
    "Conclusions": "N. farcinica and N. cyriacigeorgica are the most frequently isolated species, which are widely distributed in China. Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common type of infection. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can still be the preferred agent for initial Nocardia infection therapy due to the low resistance rate, linezolid and amikacin could be an alternative to treat nocardiosis or a choice in a combination regimen."
