Leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, is a zoonotic sand fly-transmitted disease endemic in southern Europe, of great medical and veterinary importance. Environmental and human-related changes affecting the risk of exposure to vectors, such as travelling of infected animals, urbanization of endemic rural areas and climate change are some examples of drivers of the epidemiology of leishmaniasis. In this paper, we review the distribution and assess the evidence of emergence of human and animal leishmaniasis between 2005 and 2020 in endemic European countries. We found autochthonous infections in every Mediterranean and Balkan countries with a highly variable incidence. However, we detected no evidence of a widespread increased incidence across Europe. Notwithstanding this, underreporting is very high for animal and cutaneous human leishmaniasis. Moreover, human hospital discharges are the most accurate source of data for estimating the incidence of severe human visceral leishmaniasis, and this could be used to identify hotspots of leishmaniasis in animal reservoirs of infection. Consequently, we encourage integrated surveillance and accurate notification of cases following the One Health approach to adopt effective strategies resulting in a better control of leishmaniasis.
