Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of single-dose albendazole is the main strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth infections including hookworm, but these infections remain common in many settings where MDA has been implemented for several years. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of dual-dose versus single-dose albendazole, with and without fatty food co-administration, against hookworm infection in Mayuge district, Uganda. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial among school children with hookworm infection. The cure rate was found to be significantly higher in the dual-dose group compared to the single-dose group, with no significant difference in the cure rate or egg reduction rate observed between the groups that took albendazole with or without fatty food. The study suggests that dual-dose albendazole is a feasible alternative for improving drug effectiveness against hookworm infection and minimizing drug resistance. Although the study did not demonstrate any benefit with the use of avocado co-administration against hookworm infection, further exploration is warranted due to the biological rationale for improving albendazole efficacy to treat intraluminal hookworm infection.
