    "Background": "Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is the main strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, with single-dose benzimidazole (albendazole or mebendazole) the principal MDA option. In Mayuge district, Uganda, an MDA programme has been in place for over fifteen years but hookworm infection remains common and there is concern that the effectiveness of single-dose albendazole as currently used for MDA may be sub-optimal. This study aims to assess the efficacy of dual- versus single-dose albendazole, with and without fatty food co-administration against hookworm, the dominant form of STHs in Mayuge district, Uganda.",
    "Methodology": "This was a 2x2 factorial randomised controlled trial to investigate two interventions simultaneously; 1) dual-dose versus single-dose albendazole, 2) taking albendazole with or without fatty food (200 grams of avocado eaten directly after medication). School children with hookworm infection were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the four possible treatment groups. Three weeks after the treatment, stool samples were collected from trial participants to evaluate trial outcomes: cure rate and egg reduction rate (ERR).",
    "Principal findings": "A total of 225 participants were enrolled, and 222 (98.7%) seen at 3 weeks. The cure rate in the dual-dose group was 96.4% (95% CI: 90.9–99%), higher than 83.9% (95% CI: 75.7–90.2%) in the single-dose group (OR: 5.07, 95% CI:1.61–15.96, p = 0.002). The ERR was 97.6% and 94.5% in the dual-dose group and single-dose drug group, respectively (ERR difference 3.1%, 95% CI: -3.89–16.39%, p = 0.553). The cure rates among participants taking albendazole with and without avocado were 90.1% and 89.1%, respectively, with no statistical difference between the two groups (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.51–3.03, p = 0.622). The ERR was 97.0% and 94.2% in the group receiving albendazole with and without avocado, respectively, and the difference in ERR between the two groups was 2.8% (95% CI -8.63–14.3%, p = 0.629).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In Ugandan school children, dual-dose albendazole improves the cure rate of hookworm compared to single-dose albendazole. However, there was no significant improvement in cure rate or egg reduction rate of hookworm with fatty-food co-administration. Dual-dose albendazole is a feasible alternative for improving drug effectiveness against hookworm infection and minimising drug resistance.",
