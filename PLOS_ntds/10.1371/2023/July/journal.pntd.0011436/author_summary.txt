The early diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis decreases morbidity and avoids long-term complications. We have developed a smartphone-based test for cutaneous leishmaniasis combining recombinase polymerase amplification with LFA using [(Sr0.625Ba0.375)1.96Eu0.01Dy0.03]MgSi2O7 nanophosphors as reporters. The nanophosphor-based LFA shows 50 to 100-fold greater sensitivity than gold nanoparticle-based LFAs in detecting Leishmania RPA products. Furthermore, this method can achieve high sensitivity using a minimal volume (2 Î¼L) of RPA reaction, significantly reducing reagent usage and cost. This approach is promising for the rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective point-of-care diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis, especially in resource-limited settings.
