In a drive to eliminate human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT or “sleeping sickness”) from Chad following a peak in cases in 2002, the National Sleeping Sickness Control programme and its partners focused on making substantial changes to interventions within the high prevalence setting of Mandoul. These included the use of vector control starting in 2014 and improved screening in health facilities starting in 2015. To explore whether these interventions were an efficient use of resources we carried out a retrospective analysis using a dynamic transmission model fit to epidemiological data from Mandoul combined with a cost model. Our analysis indicated that improvements to passive screening enabled more rapid diagnosis and accessible treatment in Mandoul, and furthermore the addition of vector control was good value-for-money and substantially increased the probability of reaching the 2030 elimination of transmission target for gHAT set by the World Health Organization. Looking forwards, our prospective analysis also considers the health economics of future strategies and concludes that the scaleback of vertical interventions appears cost-effective if passive screening remains operational in Mandoul. This could therefore enable the shifting of resources to tackle other remaining foci in Chad.
