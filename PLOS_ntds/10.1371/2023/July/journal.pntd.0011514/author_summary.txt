Significant efforts to control gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) have drastically reduced the prevalence of the disease and elimination of transmission (EoT) is targeted for 2030 by the World Health Organization (WHO). This reduction was particularly challenging in Côte d’Ivoire as it still faced epidemic episodes in the early 2000s. This large epidemiological transition to very low prevalence necessitated the adaptation and evolution of both medical and vector control strategies described in this article. A mathematical model was also used to retrospectively analyse case reporting results, indicating with high probability that local EoT has already been achieved in the four health districts analysed.
With nine gHAT cases detected in two health districts between 2015 and 2019 and less than one case per 10,000 people per year in all health districts at a national level over this five-year period, Côte d’Ivoire received validation by WHO for the achievement of the elimination of the disease as a public health problem in 2020. These results, combined with the modelling, offer encouragement towards the verification of EoT by 2025 in Côte d’Ivoire on condition of maintaining a multidisciplinary, one-health approach including research activities to continuously adapt strategy in the epidemiological transition to zero incidence.
