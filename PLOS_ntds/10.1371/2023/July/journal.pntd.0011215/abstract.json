    "Background": "Praziquantel (PZQ) has been the first line antischistosomal drug for all species of Schistosoma, and the only available drug for schistosomiasis japonica, without any alternative drugs since the 1980s. However, PZQ cannot prevent reinfection, and cannot cure schistosomiasis thoroughly because of its poor activity against juvenile schistosomes. In addition, reliance on a single drug is extremely dangerous, the development and spread of resistance to PZQ is becoming a great concern. Therefore, development of novel drug candidates for treatment and control of schistosomiasis is urgently needed.",
    "Methodologys/principal findings": "One of the PZQ derivative christened P96 with the substitution of cyclohexyl by cyclopentyl was synthesized by School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Shandong University. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo activities of P96 against different developmental stages of S. japonicum. Parasitological studies and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the primary action characteristics of P96 in vitro. Both mouse and rabbit models were employed to evaluate schistosomicidal efficacy of P96 in vivo. Besides calculation of worm reduction rate and egg reduction rate, quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the in vivo antischistosomal activity of P96 at molecular level. In vitro, after 24h exposure, P96 demonstrated the highest activities against both juvenile and adult worm of S. japonicum in comparison to PZQ. The antischistosomal efficacy was concentration-dependent, with P96 at 50Î¼M demonstrating the most evident schistosomicidal effect. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that P96 caused more severe damages to schistosomula and adult worm tegument compared to PZQ. In vivo, our results showed that P96 was effective against S. japonicum at all developmental stages. Notably, its efficacy against young stage worms was significantly improved compared to PZQ. Moreover, P96 retained the high activity comparable to PZQ against the adult worm of S. japonicum.",
    "Conclusions": "P96 is a promising drug candidate for chemotherapy of schistosomiasis japonica, which has broad spectrum of action against various developmental stage, potentially addressing the deficiency of PZQ. It might be promoted as a drug candidate for use either alone or in combination with PZQ for the treatment of schistosomiasis."
