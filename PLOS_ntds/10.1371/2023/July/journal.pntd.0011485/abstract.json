    "Background": "The indigenous populations of Brazil present poor health indicators and a disproportionate prevalence and case-fatality rate of neglected tropical diseases, including snakebite envenomations (SBEs). This study aims to estimate access to medical care for SBEs and analyze the barriers that prevent victims from accessing healthcare in indigenous communities in two health districts located in the Western Brazilian Amazon.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This cross-sectional study used semi-structured interviews to collect data from individuals who experienced SBEs in the Upper Rio Solim천es and Upper Rio Negro indigenous health districts. Of the 187 participants, 164 (87.7%) reported that they had access to healthcare and received assistance in a hospital in the urban area of the municipalities. Frequency was 95.4% in the Upper Rio Solim천es SIHD, and 69.6% in the Upper Rio Negro SIHD (P<0.0001). The study found that the availability of indigenous medicine as the only choice in the village was the main reason for not accessing healthcare (75%), followed by a lack of financial resources and means of transportation (28.1%). Four deaths were reported from SBEs, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 2.1%.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In the study areas, there are records of SBE patients who did not receive medical attention. Availability of pre-hospital emergency transport using motorboats, a greater number of hospitals and better navigability of the Solim천es River and its tributaries would make access easier for indigenous people living in the region of the Upper Solim천es River. The implementation of cross-cultural hospital care needs to be considered in order to reduce the resistance of indigenous populations in relation to seeking treatment for SBEs."
