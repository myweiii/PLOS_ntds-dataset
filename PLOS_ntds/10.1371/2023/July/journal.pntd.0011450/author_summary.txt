An understanding of the response of disease vectors to anthropogenic activities can aid in the control of mosquito-borne disease transmission. However, regional assessments of these responses are lacking, especially in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging. We assembled a synthetic dataset of mosquito abundance and species richness across multiple land-use types in Latin America and the Caribbean, using data from peer-reviewed published studies. We then used this dataset to explore whether mosquito abundance and species richness changed, compared to a baseline of minimal anthropogenic activity, depending on the type of land use. Overall, we observed a decline in mosquito biodiversity in urban areas. We detected distinct species-specific responses in abundance to land use, with some important disease vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, increasing in abundance in anthropogenic environments. Finally, we also demonstrated by coupling our dataset with forest loss data that the abundance of dominant malaria vectors in the region increases with deforestation.
