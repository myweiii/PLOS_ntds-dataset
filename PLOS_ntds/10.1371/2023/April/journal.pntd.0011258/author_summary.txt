Bladder cancer was found to be associated with S. haematobium infection which is an endemic parasitic infection in many tropical and subtropical areas including Egypt. Toxic products released by Schistosoma eggs serve as antigenic triggers for the immune response. Several studies discussed the function of both resident and recruited immune cell response in BCa as the process of immunoediting in tumor progression is crucial in modulating the clinical course of tumors together with the characteristics of the tumor itself. This study is the first to report the immune cell profile at both epithelial and hematological levels in S. haematobium-related BCa patients in Upper Egypt to explore their immune status. This study would provide evidence of the changes in the proportions of T and B lymphocyte populations in cancer patients relative to the current infection state along with the proinflammatory cytokine profiles of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Î±. This study emphasized the role of T helper immune response in schistosomal BCa even under conditions of general immune suppression elicited by cancer and the inhibition of the cytotoxic immune response (CD8+) and generation of Tregs (CD4+CD25highFoxp3), resulting in the suppression of antitumor immunity. Additionally, significant Breg expression in patients seems to be closely linked to increased Treg cell production either peripherally or in the tumor microenvironment (TME), enhancing the conversion of nonactivated CD4+ cells into Tregs, with a decline in cytotoxic T-cell response in tumor tissue. At the TME, the past chronic inflammation elicited by schistosome egg antigens could be postulated to affect the suppression that occurred in T-cell subsets, thus promoting tumor progression. Also, the profound increase in the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlates with the intensity of schistosomal infection in bladder tissue and suggesting a possible role in malignant transformation.
