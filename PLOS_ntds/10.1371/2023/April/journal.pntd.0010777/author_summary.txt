The worm Strongyloides stercoralis causes infectious disease in people throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions, leading to an extensive reduction in quality of life and even death. Millions of people are at risk of infection with this parasite and improved diagnostic and control methods and technologies are urgently required. Currently, most diagnosis is carried out through methods involving visual inspection of patientâ€™s faeces, which has a number of drawbacks, particularly its poor sensitivity. This paper presents a new method to develop improved diagnostic tests for S. stercoralis, by computational analysis of publicly available gene and protein sequences to predict proteins that may be detectable in faeces. This would enable the development of rapid diagnostic tests in the form of lateral flows or dipsticks, with better predictive ability and fewer drawbacks than current diagnostic methods. A number of potential proteins, predicted to have all the desired characteristics for use in such tests were found through the new method and have been presented in this paper. With validation, new diagnostic tests for S. stercoralis could be developed from these results and the computational approach could be used to target other parasitic diseases.
