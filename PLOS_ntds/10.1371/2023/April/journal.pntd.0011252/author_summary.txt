The Gran Chaco ecoregion is the main hotspot of Chagas disease. We assessed the district-wide effects of an insecticide-based intervention program on house infestation with the main vector Triatoma infestans in rural villages of Pampa del Indio municipality, in the Argentine Chaco. The program included periodic assessments of house infestation and household demographics; blanket house spraying with pyrethroid insecticide at the outset; promotion of householder-based surveillance, and systematic vector surveillance-and-response over a 9-year period. We found that house infestation plummeted over the first year postintervention (YPI); became rare over 2â€“6 YPI, and fell below 1% at endpoint. House infestation was spatially aggregated in three large clusters that partially overlapped with pyrethroid resistance. Triatomine aggregation occurred mainly at house compound or village levels. Indigenous households were at much greater risk of vector-borne transmission than creole households. We conclude that gradual scaling up of high-coverage, professional insecticide spraying combined with systematic surveillance-and-response operations within an adaptive management framework can achieve the quasi-elimination of T. infestans and concomitant blockage of vector-borne transmission in resource-constrained, remote rural settings.
