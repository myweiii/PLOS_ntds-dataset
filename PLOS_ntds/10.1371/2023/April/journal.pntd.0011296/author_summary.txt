Mosquito-borne viruses, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Mayaro viruses, derive from sylvatic transmission cycles involving forest mosquitoes and wild animals. Occasionally, these sylvatic viruses spill over into humans, which can lead to limited disease outbreaks or sustained human transmission by urban mosquitoes. When translocated by humans to new geographic regions, these viruses have potential to spill back into novel sylvatic cycles, creating a lasting threat to human health. Ecotones, such as forest edges, where humans, mosquitoes, and monkeys coexist, are at high risk of spillover and spillback. We investigated changes in mosquito community composition at incremental distances up to 2000 m into rainforest bordering the Amazonian city of Manaus, where the above viruses circulate in urban and sylvatic cycles. We also characterized mosquito habitat and analyzed associations between key vector species and environmental variables like temperature and vegetation. Our results show that mosquito communities and environmental variables change abruptly within 500 m of the forest edge, where there is high risk for contact of both monkeys and humans with both urban and forest mosquitoes. By 1000 m, conditions stabilize, and forest mosquitoes predominate. Environmental variables associated with the presence of particular mosquito taxa will help characterize suitable habitat for key vector species and refine spillover and spillback risk models for these viruses.
