Leprosy reactions (LRs) are acute inflammatory episodes that complicate 30% to 50% of Mycobacterium leprae infections. Type 1 is known as reversal reaction (RR), and type 2 is known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The two types have relatively distinct pathogenesis and clinical features; furthermore, they can advance to become severe and progress to irreversible nerve damage and deformities. Beyond leprosy infection, LR can bring about neurological burden, poor quality of life, and risk of further descent into poverty for often young patients. Despite effective standardized treatment of leprosy infection with multidrug therapy (MDT) since 1981, treating LRs prove to be challenging. First-line treatment of LR is based on prolonged systemic glucocorticoids (GCs) therapy. The current challenge in leprosy is now to develop and evaluate new therapeutic alternatives to reduce not only the sequelae and morbidity of LR but also the lasting side effects of GCs. Thalidomide is an effective alternative in moderate to severe ENL, but its use is limited given its numerous adverse effects. Methotrexate (MTX) is an immunomodulating agent used to treat inflammatory diseases and has an excellent safety profile and worldwide availability. Here, we describe the efficacy, GCs-sparing effect, and safety of MTX in LR.
