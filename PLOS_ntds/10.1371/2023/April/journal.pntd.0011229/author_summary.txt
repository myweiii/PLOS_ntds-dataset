Plasmodium vivax is one of the main species causing malaria around the globe, thus the development of control tools are needed if progress is to be made towards malaria elimination. Among them, vaccines are a crucial one, since itâ€™s been proven that a well-established immunization program can save millions of lives a year. Although the development of vaccines against malaria have had substantial progress in the last decade, most of the efforts are concentrated towards Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the potential role of a recently P. vivax-protein (PvVir14) discovered in the urine of infected subjects from the Brazilian Amazon. Initial findings showed that, although the protein elicits a higher frequency of antibodies among the Brazilian population (where it was first discovered), antibody titers were also found within African populations exposed and/or infected by P. Vivax. Interestingly, populations exposed to P. falciparum only did not have any immune responses against the protein, indicating that it is exclusive to vivax. Discovering key antigens is one of the most important steps towards the development of control tools. These findings provide the first characterization of naturally acquired antibody responses from different malaria regions against a new and promising target.
