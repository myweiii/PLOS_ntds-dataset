Two of our collaborators, Dr Alexandre A. Peixoto (Feb. 2013) and Dr. Hector M. Diaz Albiter (Feb. 2021) were influential in this project but died before the work could be completed. We dedicate this manuscript to them in recognition of contributions to both this work and the vector disease community as a whole. In addition, gratitude goes to Sandra Clifton who was instrumental in the work but retired before completion and to Daniel Lawson who was instrumental in the initial stages of the project while a member of the VectorBase staff. The authors thank the sequencing team members of the Washington University Genome Center and Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center for their efforts in generating the raw sequence data.
