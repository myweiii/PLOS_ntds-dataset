The leishmaniases are a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by protist parasites from the Genus Leishmania. Different Leishmania species present a wide clinical profile, ranging from mild, often self-resolving cutaneous lesions that can lead to protective immunity, to severe metastatic mucosal disease, to visceral disease that is ultimately fatal. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bites of sand flies, and as no approved human vaccine exists, available drugs are toxic and/or expensive and parasite resistance to them is emerging, new dual control strategies to combat these diseases must be developed, combining interventions on human infections and integrated sand fly population management. Effective vector control requires a comprehensive understanding of the biology of sand flies. To this end, we sequenced and annotated the genomes of two sand fly species that are important leishmaniasis vectors from the Old and New Worlds. These genomes allow us to better understand, at the genetic level, processes important in the vector biology of these species, such as finding hosts, blood-feeding, immunity, and detoxification. These genomic resources highlight the driving forces of evolution of two major Leishmania vectors and provide foundations for future research on how to better prevent leishmaniasis by control of the sand fly vectors.
