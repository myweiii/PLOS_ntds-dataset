The growth of human populations has led to an increase in rural urbanisation and habitat degradation. This, in turn, has displaced native wildlife and caused more conflicts between humans and wildlife. Human habitation and waste attract rodents and thereby, snakes, resulting in more snake sightings in homes. To deal with this issue, snake handlers/rescuers are asked to remove and relocate snakes away from human areas. However, snake removal is dangerous, especially when dealing with spitting snakes such as certain cobra species. These snakes can cause serious harm if their venom enters a person’s eye, leading to ophthalmic envenomation. Therefore, snake handlers must take precautions by wearing appropriate eye protection and using suitable tools to ensure their safety and the snake’s safety. Despite their experience, snake handlers are not exempt from the risks, as illustrated by a recent incident reported in this article where a handler was ill-equipped and suffered ophthalmic envenomation while removing a spitting cobra. This report emphasises the importance of taking due care when dealing with venomous species, particularly those that can spit venom, and wearing appropriate eye protection and using suitable tools to avoid accidents.
