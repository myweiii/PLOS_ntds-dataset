Doxycycline was offered to people to treat river blindness in Massangam health district after test indicating they are infected. The test, conducted twice, involved taking a small piece of skin for examination. Those infected were given doxycycline for 35 days by community volunteers. Among those who were eligible for the test, 54% were tested each time, increasing to 83% for both rounds. Participation was influenced by trust level; and varied by sex, age, and duration of community stay. Semi-nomadic population participated less than permanent residents because of their remote locations, language and cultural barriers, perceived discrimination by the permanent resident population. Doing test before ivermectin treatment impacted test result. Delay in starting treatment led to some infected people moving away. Almost all those starting treatment completed it each time. Some beneficiaries prefer the usual ivermectin treatment. For the volunteers, delivering treatment was demanding in terms of effort and time. Overall, the level of participation was satisfactory but could be improved through more sensitisation, reviewing volunteer compensation, inclusion of the frequently excluded population, combining doxycycline and ivermectin treatments, and developing a sensitive less invasive test.
