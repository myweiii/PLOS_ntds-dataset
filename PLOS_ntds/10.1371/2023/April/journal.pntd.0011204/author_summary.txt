The 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, details global targets to ensure improvements to health and well-being globally. SDG states that to meet SDG 1 and 3, poverty everywhere must end, and universal health coverage and access to quality health care must be achieved. Rabies is acknowledged as a disease of poverty, and therefore ending poverty, and improving health and economic deprivation, could in theory result in a reduction of rabies, providing it also results in universal health coverage. We investigated whether rabies incidence is an inevitable consequence of poverty or whether measures of development other than economics, are stronger predictors of countries that have successfully controlled the disease. We highlight that those most at risk of not being treated, and dying due to rabies, live in communities experiencing health care inequalities, readily measured through poverty indicators. We found that economic growth alone, may not be enough to support the global 2030 goal of zero human death due to dog rabies. Indeed, other strategies such as targeting vulnerable populations, responsible pet ownership are also needed in addition to economic investment.
