Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) infect over 1.5 billion people globally and are associated with anemia and stunting. School-based deworming (SBD) via mass drug administration has been recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce levels of morbidity due to STH in endemic areas. This study examines discrepancies between school-level reporting of SBD and individual-level survey reporting of SBD from the DeWorm3 trial in Benin, India, and Malawi. Study cluster coverages were calculated for both school-level and individual-level data in the intervention arm and the differences between them were used to produce a mean squared error (MSE) statistic for each cluster. These values were then applied to the control arm, where only school-level data had been collected, to estimate individual-level data. In each study site, SBD coverage in the school-level data was substantially higher than in the individual-level data. When applying observed MSE to project individual-level data in the control arm, SBD coverage dropped from 89.1% to 70.5% in Benin, from 97.7% to 84.5% in India, and from 41.5% to 37.5% in Malawi. These estimates indicate that current SBD coverage estimates derived from school-level data may substantially overestimate true pediatric deworming coverage within targeted communities.
