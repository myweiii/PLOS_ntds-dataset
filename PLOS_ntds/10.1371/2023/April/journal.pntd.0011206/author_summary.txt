As a neglected tropical disease (NTD), Leishmaniasis contributes to poor health outcomes, suffering, and death of vulnerable populations. Leishmania infantum or Leishmania donovani is transmitted from animals to humans through the sandfly vector and can be fatal in 5% of the cases even with treatment. Visceral leishmaniasis is a severe form of Leishmaniasis. The purpose of this study was to estimate regions of high Visceral leishmaniasis risk in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil between 2007 and 2020 to help inform public health initiatives and potential health policy interventions for this disease. Visceral leishmaniasis is a reportable disease and therefore VL cases are documented to the Brazilian Ministry of Health database through passive surveillance. Passive surveillance data can suffer from missing information; individuals may be asymptomatic, or may not seek medical care allowing for diagnosis. When modeling disease risk from passive surveillance data, assuming there is an absence of disease in regions without documented cases can underestimate disease risk. In this paper we estimate disease risk and identify areas with high-risk and increasing infection trends over time while considering data characteristics such as missing information and high correlation of risk factors.
