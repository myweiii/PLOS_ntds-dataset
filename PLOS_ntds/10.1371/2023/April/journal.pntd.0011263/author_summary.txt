Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), a neglected disease in developing countries that lack access to advanced health care, continues to plague many children and adolescents. While it is known that Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) plays a causal role in RHD, only a subset of ARF patients progress to RHD. Understanding the transcriptome level differences between these two disease states would aid in understanding the progression of the prequel state and stage an intervention at an appropriate time to avert fatal consequences. This pilot study aimed to understand the pathway-level perturbations caused in individuals with either disease condition and explore their similarities and differences. Using sensitive network mining approaches and transcriptomics, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in highly perturbed condition-specific protein-protein interactions networks unique to RHD compared to ARF by filtering out DEGs altered with respect to healthy and clinical controls. We also report differences in clinical parameters in the disease states. The study shows great potential in developing tools such as predictive biomarkers to study the progression of RHD while also unraveling novel pathway-level perturbations.
