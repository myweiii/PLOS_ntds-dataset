In Tanzania, dengue has been reported since 2010, and different DENV serotypes have been documented to circulate in the country, causing two large epidemics (2014 and 2019). Rapid diagnostic tests have been the countryâ€™s preferred laboratory tool for diagnosing dengue. Confirmatory tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic sequencing, are unlikely to be available for all samples collected during an outbreak, mainly due to resource constraints. Consequently, national surveillance of DENV cannot detect circulating serotypes and genotypes, especially during epidemic transmission periods. This information is critical to inform and support effective disease control interventions and prepare for future outbreaks. This study analyzed all the collected samples between 2017 and 2019 and referred to the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) for molecular characterization. Here we report the serotypes and phylogenetic characteristics of DENV from 2017 to 2019 circulating in Tanzania.
