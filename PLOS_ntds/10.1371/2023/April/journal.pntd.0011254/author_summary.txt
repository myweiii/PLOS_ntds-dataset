Due to the lack of effective treatments and drugs, rabies is still an important zoonotic disease, posing a great risk to animals and human public health in developing countries. Vaccines, especially inactivated vaccines, are currently the most effective way to prevent and control the rabies epidemic. Here, we constructed a recombinant virus rCVS11-MAB2560 chimeric-expressed MAB2560 protein (a DC-targeting molecular) on the surface of the RABV particles to promote its immunogenicity in vivo by activating the dendritic cells (DCs) and enhancing antigen uptake. Our results showed that inactivated rCVS11-MAB2560 was able to promote the recruitment and/or proliferation of DC cells, T cells and B cells in mice, and induce good immune memory after two immunizations. Moreover, compared with rCVS11, the inactivated recombinant virus rCVS11-MAB2560 could induce higher level of virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in mice and dogs more quickly post immunization. rCVS11-MAB2560 thus has potential to be used as a promising candidate for an effective inactivated rabies vaccine.
