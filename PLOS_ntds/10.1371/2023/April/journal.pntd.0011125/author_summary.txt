Approximately 1.7 million people globally have an eyelid condition called trachomatous trichiasis (TT) resulting from repeated ocular bacterial infections that caused the eyelid to scar and turn in so that the eyelashes rub against the eye. TT can be corrected through surgery. However, TT is mostly found in areas with limited health care resources. Thus, nurses are trained how to perform the surgery. Historically, training has been limited to one week of classroom training followed by three weeks of live-surgery practical training. This study describes a surgical simulator the authors developed to improve the training process. After a three-hour training with the HEAD START simulator, trainees required less assistance from the trainer during live-patient surgical practice and performed surgery faster than those not trained on HEAD START.
