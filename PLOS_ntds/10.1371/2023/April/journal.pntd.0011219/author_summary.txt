Scorpion sting can cause a variety of complications. One of the most dangerous complications associated with some scorpion venoms is damage to the heart in the form of myocarditis. Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle. The mechanism of myocarditis in scorpion sting is unique. The scorpion venom triggers a massive release of epinephrine and norepinephrine hormones, which affect the heart. At first, rapid heartbeats, hypertension, and agitation occurs. Then, as the result of the cardiac dysfunction, respiratory distress, fluid buildup in the lungs and a drop in blood pressure will develop. Children are particularly vulnerable to this condition. Electrocardiograms will reveal signs of heart strain and even dangerous arrhythmias. Serial heart enzyme measurements can help diagnose this condition. Echocardiograms show heart function decline. Respiratory support is critical. Prazosin is helpful for hypertension. Heart failure and its complications are the main targets of treatment. Dobutamine has shown the most promise in treating heart failure. We estimate the mortality rate at 7.4% in the reported cases. With timely management this condition is usually benign, recovery is quick, and survivors rarely experience long-term complications. Physicians should be aware of this potential complication, screen for it and begin appropriate treatment as soon as possible.
