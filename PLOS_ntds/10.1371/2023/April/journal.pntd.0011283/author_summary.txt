Human strongyloidiasis, caused mainly by nematoda Strongyloides stercoralis, with estimate of infecting around 613.9 million people worldwide, and may play a pivotal role in causing morbidity in aboriginals and indigenous populations worldwide. Nevertheless, prevalence and risk factors for S. stercoralis in Brazilian indigenous populations remains to be fully established. The present study was the first comparative report of S. stercoralis seroprevalence in indigenous population and healthcare professionals. A high seroprevalence to S. stercoralis in indigenous communities of Brazil along with even higher exposure of healthcare professionals was reported and should be considered as vulnerability and health worker exposure. Male and adult indigenous persons were more likely seropositive as associated risk factors, while having septic tank as a sanitary facility represented a protective factor for S. stercoralis exposure. Thus, the present study has alerted for the public health concerns of strongyloidiasis in such vulnerable populations, particularly when lacking sanitation conditions. Finally, a further One Health approach may contribute for better understanding the strongyloidiasis exposure including the environmental, animal, and human components to battle this important parasitic neglected disease in indigenous communities.
