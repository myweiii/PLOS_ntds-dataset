The southern region of Brazil has the highest morbidity and mortality from leptospirosis in the country. Here, we present an approach based on spatial and temporal modeling to help understand the incidence of leptospirosis in Rio Grande do Sul, an endemic state located in southern Brazil. Clusters of disease incidence and mortality were observed in Centro Oriental Rio Grandense and Metropolitan of Porto Alegre mesoregions, while no cases were recorded in 220 municipalities between 2007 and 2019. A model with satisfactory predictive ability was also developed. The high underreporting of cases may reflect the failure in the sensitivity of the stateâ€™s leptospirosis surveillance system. These results can assist public healthcare services in allocating appropriate efforts and resources to control the disease, specifically in these regions with a higher risk of leptospirosis, considering the growing need to clarify the dynamics of this neglected disease in Brazil.
