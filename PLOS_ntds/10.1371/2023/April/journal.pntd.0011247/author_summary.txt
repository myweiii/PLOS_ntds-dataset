The study and control of the numbers of Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue fever in China, is crucial for the prevention and control of this mosquito-borne disease. Due to the major impact of rainfall and temperature on mosquito population sizes, we built a mathematical model based on the life cycle of mosquitoes and meteorological and mosquito vector monitoring data in Guangdong Province. Through this model, we explored the effects of temperature, rainfall and their distribution characteristics on the development of the mosquito population and found that they had different effects on the developing stages of mosquitoes in different periods and different locations. Moreover, according to the established meteorological indicators and their importance ranking, it was found that for most areas of Guangdong Province, rainfall was more important than the temperature distribution and the evenness of rainfall distribution, and that the peak rainfall in summer was the best predictor of mosquito population development. In addition, we also developed a method to utilize previous experience in mosquito control, which together with the above conclusions will be of great help in the design of future mosquito vector control strategies and the prediction and early warning of mosquito-borne diseases.
