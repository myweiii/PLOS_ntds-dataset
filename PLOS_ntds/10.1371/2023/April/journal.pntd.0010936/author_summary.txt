Fasciolosis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus Fasciola, of which F. hepatica stands out provided its success in spreading all over the entire global geography. Definitive hosts, typically ruminants and humans, become infected by ingestion of aquatic plants or water contaminated with metacercariae, which excyst in the duodenum and release the so-called newly excysted juvenile flukes (FhNEJ). FhNEJ traverse the intestinal wall and migrate through the peritoneum and liver parenchyma until they reach their definitive location inside the major biliary ducts, where adult worms develop and egg shedding starts. In order to cross the intestinal wall, FhNEJ are endowed with a repertoire of proteases that degrade components of the intestinal extracellular matrix, and we hypothesized that they may also co-opt the proteolytic functions of plasmin, the central enzyme of the mammalian fibrinolytic system, to migrate more efficiently across host tissues. In this study, we demonstrate that a tegument-enriched antigenic fraction of FhNEJ contains proteins that interact with plasminogen, the zymogen of plasmin, and stimulate its conversion into its active form, which could potentially be used for trans-intestinal migration and contribute to the successful establishment of the parasite within its mammalian host.
