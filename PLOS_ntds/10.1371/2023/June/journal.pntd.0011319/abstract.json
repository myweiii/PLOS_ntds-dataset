    "Background": "Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad\u2013spectrum anthelmintic drug used to treat diseases caused by filarial worms, such as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). IVM is part of a triple\u2013drug therapy used by the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) as a preventive strategy to eradicate LF in sub\u2013Saharan Africa. The drug shows high variability in drug exposure in previous pharmacokinetic studies. This study aims to build a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to identify and quantify the possible sources of the variability of IVM exposure after a single\u2013oral dose in LF\u2013infected subjects and healthy individuals.",
    "Methodology / Principal findings": "In this analysis, 724 samples were collected from treatment\u2013na\u00efve Wuchereria bancrofti\u2013infected (n = 32) and uninfected (n = 24) adults living in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire who had received one dose of IVM as a part of triple\u2013drug therapy. PopPK analysis was conducted using Phoenix NLME 8.3 software. The Monte Carlo simulation based on the final model was performed to simulate drug exposure among different dosing groups (200 \u03bcg/kg, 18 mg, and 36 mg). A two\u2013compartment model with zero\u2013order dose input into the absorption compartment with a lag time function followed by first\u2013order absorption and linear elimination best described the IVM\u2019s pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. The final model identifies that the PK parameters of IVM are not affected by LF infection. Sex was a significant covariate on the peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F, 53% lower in men than in women). IVM drug exposure shows linear pharmacokinetic behavior among the simulated dosing groups with similar drug exposure based on sex.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "We have developed a PopPk model to describe and identify possible sources of the variability of IVM exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first PopPK study of IVM in patients with LF.",
