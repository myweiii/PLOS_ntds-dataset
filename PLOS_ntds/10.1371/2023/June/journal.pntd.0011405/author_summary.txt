Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic protozoa, exists in various clinical forms, the most common of which is tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL). The lethality of TL is low, but the skin lesions may produce physical deformities and stigma. Brazil has the highest number of TL cases in the American continent and the disease is present in all federative units. However, studies performed so far have been restricted to localized areas of Brazil and do not provide a broad view of the situation in the country. Therefore, we described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of TL cases in Brazil and evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns from 2001 to 2020. Our findings show that the occurrence of TL declined between 2001 and 2020 in all regions of the country except for the Southeast where incidence rates have recently increased. We have identified those areas of the country where the population remains at greater risk of contracting the disease and have found that the situation has changed little over the years. The knowledge gained about the spatial and temporal variations of the incidence of TL, the profiles of those affected by the disease, and the diagnostics and treatment employed might be valuable to improve the policies and actions against the disease.
