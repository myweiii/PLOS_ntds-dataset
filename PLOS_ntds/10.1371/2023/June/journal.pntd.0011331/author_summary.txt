The study describes country, State/Region and township level spatial and temporal epidemiology of dengue in Myanmar from routine surveillance data collected by the government. Dengue was found to widespread across the country with an increase in spatial extent over time, likely due to improvements in surveillance, reporting and access to health services. Most reported cases were children with an increase in the proportion â‰¥15 years of age over time. Dengue incidence was seasonal and related to climate, with larger annual peaks every two years, although the timing of peaks in incidence, strength and nature of the relationship with climate differed between States and Regions. Using ARIMA, it was possible to predict dengue incidence 1 month ahead at State/Region level using previous incidence data. Adding monthly climate data to the model gave a marginal improvement in model performance which did not justify the additional effort needed to acquire and process it. With further development and validation, the method may be a simple way to quickly generate short-term predictions at subnational scales with sufficient certainty to use for intervention planning.
