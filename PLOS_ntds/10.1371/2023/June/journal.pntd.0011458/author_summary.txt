Studies of the resistance to the antifolate methotrexate (MTX) in the protozoan parasite Leishmania have allowed to improve the understanding of one carbon metabolism. Here, through a chemogenomic screen with MTX selection, we generated 20 mutants with a decrease of MTX susceptibility. We reported some point mutations in genes known to be associated with MTX resistance (FT1, DHFR-TS and PTR1) but also in genes never associated with it, such as ALO and the methyltransferase LmjF.17.1130. Gene editing studies validated that point mutations in FT1 and DHTR-TS can be phenotypic in the context of MTX resistance. Some DHFR-TS and PTR1 mutations are further shown to have a dominant positive effect on resistance when overexpressed. This contrasts with the mutations detected in the gene ALO and in the methyltransferase LmjF.17.1130, for which overexpression of the wild-type versions reverted the MTX resistance they conferred. Overall, this screen has revealed several new mutations involved in antifolate resistance in Leishmania.
