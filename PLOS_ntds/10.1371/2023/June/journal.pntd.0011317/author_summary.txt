Plague have resurged among rodents in Yunnan Province since 1982, and intermittently occurs among humans. Yet the local risk of rodent plague dynamics has been highly diverse across ecological contexts. In natural foci, suggestions for this ecological diversity include high species richness and cyclic transmission between hosts and vectors. Here, we developed an eco-epidemiological framework to position the epidemiological dynamics of rodent plague in local ecological contexts. Our results suggest that diverse ecological conditions may have shaped the local risk of plague transmission in Yunnan Province. Typically, incremental of elevation has been associated with the tradeoff between the increased diversity and averted fraction of main host and vector species. More importantly, vectored flea index could be a critical ecological indicator for plague management.
