    "Background": "The flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), is an important hygiene pest, that causes myiasis in humans and other mammals, typically livestock, and as a vector for various parasitic agents, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene expression during metamorphosis of the flesh fly has not been well established.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In this study, we performed genome-wide identification and characterization of lncRNAs from the early pupal stage (1-days pupae), mid-term pupal stage (5-days pupae), and late pupal stage (9-days pupae) of S. peregrina by RNA-seq, and a total of 6921 lncRNAs transcripts were identified. RT-qPCR and enrichment analyses revealed the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE lncRNAs) that might be associated with insect metamorphosis development. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that the DE lncRNA (SP_lnc5000) could potentially be involved in regulating the metamorphosis of S. peregrina. RNA interference of SP_lnc5000 caused reduced expression of metamorphosis-related genes in 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signaling (Br-c, Ftz-F1), cuticle tanning pathway (TH, DOPA), and chitin related pathway (Cht5). Injection of dsSP_lnc5000 in 3rd instar larvae of S. peregrina resulted in deformed pupae, stagnation of pupal-adult metamorphosis, and a decrease in development time of pupal, pupariation rates and eclosion rates. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E), scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and cuticle hydrocarbons (CHCs) analysis indicated that SP_lnc5000 had crucial roles in the metamorphosis developmental by modulating pupal cuticular development.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "We established that the lncRNA SP_lnc5000 potentially regulates the metamorphosis of S. peregrina by putatively affecting the structure and composition of the pupal cuticle. This study enhances our understanding of lncRNAs as regulators of metamorphosis in S. peregrina, and provide valuable insights into the identification of potential targets for vector control and the development of effective strategies for controlling the spread of myiasis and parasitic diseases."
