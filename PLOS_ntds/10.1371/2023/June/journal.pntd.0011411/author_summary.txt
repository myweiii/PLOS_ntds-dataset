Sarcophaga peregrina, a significant flesh fly species, is closely associated with human life in its ecological habits, as vectors of parasitic disease agents, they can cause myiasis and other tropical infectious diseases, and has been implicated in the transmission of diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. Enhance the understanding of metamorphosis of this species, have a significance for vector control. The lncRNAs plays important roles in growth development of insect. However, its role in regulating the metamorphosis of S. peregrina has not been reported so far. In this study, we obtained genome-wide identification of lncRNA profiles from different pupae developmental stages of S. peregrina. Furthermore, we performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs (SP_lnc5000) in regulating the metamorphosis of S. peregrina by RNA interference, and H&E staining, SEM observation and CHCs detection. The results provided here increase the knowledge on metamorphosis processes in S. peregrina, which is important for the design of new vector control strategies.
