Chagas disease (ChD) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and continues to be a health problem despite the control of its transmission. ChD is a heterogeneous condition with a wide variation in its clinical course and prognosis. The majority (60%â€“70%) of infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life. Chagas cardiomyopathy (ChCM) encompasses all cases of ChD with cardiac involvement. It is defined by the presence of at least a typical electrocardiographic abnormality in patients with positive serological tests against T. cruzi. There is very little reliable information about the natural history of ChD individuals in old age, and most community-based longitudinal studies have been conducted on young adults. The findings of this study suggest that the T. cruzi infection provides continuous damage to the myocardium and that it is an independent risk of the occurrence of new ECG abnormalities despite the other factors that could cause cardiac lesions and promote ECG abnormalities associated with aging. The newly developed cardiomyopathy in the elderly is as ominous as the cardiomyopathy established at earlier ages.
