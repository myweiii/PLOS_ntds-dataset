Dengue fever is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and has become a global threat. The increased possibility of individual exposure to disease vectors due to human travel allowed for the rapid spread of dengue virus to new susceptible populations, ultimately resulting in severe febrile illness and substantial disease burden. Therefore, the integration of information on human movement into infectious disease prediction model will contribute to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. This study developed and retrospectively validated a forecasting system for predicting the spatial spread of dengue fever in Guangdong province, China, using population mobility and dengue fever incidence data. Compared with the local forecasting model designed for each individual city, the proposed system generated improved prediction performance with respect to the targets including peak time, peak intensity, and total incidence for retrospective forecasts of dengue fever epidemics in 12 cities of Guangdong province. The proposed method can be potentially adapted to predict other mosquito-borne infectious diseases.
