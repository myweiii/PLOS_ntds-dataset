    "Introduction": "In Taiwan, six venomous snake species with medical importance have been found; however, long-term epidemiological data of snakebite envenomation (SBE) is lacking. This study aimed to explore the epidemiology of SBE based on the distribution and use of different antivenoms in different parts of Taiwan to facilitate the development of prevention strategies and resource allocation.",
    "Methods and results": "This retrospective study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2002 to 2014. A total of 12,542 patients were treated with antivenoms. The directly standardized cumulative incidence was 3.6 cases per 100,000 individuals based on the 2000 World Standard Population. The incidence of SBEs peaked in the summer (35.9%). The relative risk (RR) of male patients versus female patients was 2.5 (p < 0.0001). The RRs of patients aged 18–64 and ≥65 years versus those aged <18 years were 6.0 (p < 0.0001) and 14.3 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, the RR of eastern Taiwan versus northern Taiwan was 6.8 (p < 0.0001). The RR of agricultural workers versus laborers was 5.5 (p < 0.0001). Compared with patients envenomed by Trimeresurus stejnegeri stejnegeri or Protobothrops mucrosquamatus, those envenomed by Naja atra or Bungarus multicinctus multicinctus were more likely to occur in central (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.6, p < 0.0001) or southern (aOR = 3.2, p < 0.0001) Taiwan, but less frequently among agricultural workers (aOR = 0.6, p < 0.0001). The overall case-fatality rate was 0.11%.",
    "Conclusions": "Among Asian countries, Taiwan had low incidence and case-fatality rates of SBE. Risk factors included male gender, old age, summer season, being in eastern Taiwan, and being an agricultural worker. Differences of the epidemiological findings between snake species should be focused on when developing strategies for snakebite prevention."
