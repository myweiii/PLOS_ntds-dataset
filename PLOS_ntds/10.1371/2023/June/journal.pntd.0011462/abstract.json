    "Abstract": "Bartonella are generally recognized as zoonotic pathogens of mammals, including many rodent species. However, data on the genetic diversity of Bartonella in some regions are still absent in China. In this study, we collected rodent samples (Meriones unguiculatus, Spermophilus dauricus, Eolagurus luteus, and Cricetulus barabensis) from Inner Mongolia located in Northern China. The Bartonella were detected and identified by sequencing the gltA, ftsZ, ITS, and groEL genes in them. An overall 47.27% (52/110) positive rate was observed. This may be the first report that M. unguiculatus and E. luteus harbor Bartonella. Phylogenetic and genetic analysis on gltA, ftsZ, ITS, and groEL genes indicated that the strains were divided into seven distinct clades, suggesting the diverse genetic genotypes of Bartonella species in this area. Of those, Clade 5 meets the criteria for identification as a novel species based on gene sequence dissimilarity to known Bartonella species and herein we name it “Candidatus Bartonella mongolica”."
