    "Abstract": "Identification of promising schistosome antigen targets is crucial for the development of anti-schistosomal strategies. Schistosomes rely on their neuromuscular systems to coordinate important locomotory behaviors. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is critical in the initial rate-limiting step in biosynthesis of catecholamine, the important neuroactive agents, which promote the lengthening of the worm through muscular relaxation and are therefore of great importance to the movement of the organism both within and between its hosts. THs from both Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum and their enzyme activities have been discovered; however, the role of these proteins during infection have not been explored. Herein, a recombinant protein of the nonconserved fragment of S. japonicum TH (SjTH) was produced and the corresponding polyclonal antibody was generated. The expression and antigenicity of SjTH were detected by qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence assays, and ELISA. Mice immunized with the recombinant SjTH were challenged with cercariae to evaluate the immunoprotective value of this protein. Our results showed SjTH not only distributed in the head associated with the central nervous system, but also expressed along the tegument and the intestinal intima, which are involved in the movement, coupling and digestion of the parasites and associated with the peripheral nervous system. This protein can effectively stimulate humoral immune responses in mammalian hosts and has high potential as a biomarker for schistosomiasis immunodiagnosis. Furthermore, immunization with recombinant SjTH showed to reduce the worm and egg burden of challenged mice, and to contribute to the systemic balance of the Th1/Th2 responses. Taken together, these results suggest that SjTH is an important pathogenic molecule in S. japonicum and may be a possible target for anti-schistosomal approaches."
