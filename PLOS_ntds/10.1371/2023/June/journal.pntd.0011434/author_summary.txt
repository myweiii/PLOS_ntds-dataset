Nodding syndrome (NS) is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that mainly affects children. The syndrome has only been found in onchocerciasis-endemic areas, and epidemiological studies suggest that it may be one of the forms of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. Nevertheless, other causes have been considered, such as an infection with Mansonella perstans. To identify a main causal factor for NS, it needs to be present in all sites where the syndrome is found. Hence, our team explored 113 people with epilepsy and 132 healthy controls in Mahenge, Tanzania, to determine if M. perstans could be behind the epidemic of NS in the area. Over a third of the epilepsy cases in the study met the criteria for probable NS. None of the participants was diagnosed with an M. perstans infection. However, those exposed to onchocerciasis and with onchocerciasis-associated skin lesions were more likely to have epilepsy, including probable NS. In conclusion, onchocerciasis remains the most likely main risk factor for NS.
