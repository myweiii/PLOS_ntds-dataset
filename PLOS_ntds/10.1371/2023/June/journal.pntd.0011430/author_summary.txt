Individuals with high Loa loa blood microfilarial densities are at risk of developing a serious encephalopathy after administration of antiparasitic drugs. Apart from this major inconvenience, L. loa filariasis (loiasis) is considered a benign disease, with no effect on brain function. However, recent epidemiological data suggest an increased mortality and morbidity in L. loa infected individuals, underscoring the importance of studies on the possible neurological morbidity associated with loiasis. This cross-sectional study assessed cognition using MoCA tests (Montreal Cognitive assessments, a tool for early detection of mild cognitive impairment) and neurological ultrasound among 143 matched individuals with either no microfilaremia, low microfilaremia or high microfilaremia. People with high microfilaremia were more than twenty times more likely to have an altered cognition, compared to individuals with no microfilaremia.
