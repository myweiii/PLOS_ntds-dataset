    "Background": "Individuals with high Loa loa microfilarial densities are at risk of developing severe encephalopathy after administration of antiparasitic drugs. Apart from this finding, loiasis is considered benign with no effect on brain function. However, recent epidemiological data suggest an increased mortality and morbidity in L. loa infected individuals, underscoring the importance of studies on the possible neurological morbidity associated with loiasis.",
    "Methodology": "Using MoCA tests and neurological ultrasounds, we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess cognitive alteration in a population living in a rural area endemic for loiasis in the Republic of Congo. Fifty individuals with high microfilarial densities (MFD) were matched on sex, age and residency with 50 individuals with low MFD and 50 amicrofilaremic subjects.",
    "Principal findings": "MoCA scores were very low in the studied population (mean of 15.6/30). Individuals with more than 15,000 microfilariae per milliliter of blood (mean predicted score:14.0/30) are more than twenty times more likely to have an altered cognition, compared to individuals with no microfilaremia (mean predicted score: 16.3/30). Years of schooling were strongly associated with better MoCA results. Extracranial and intracranial atheroma were not associated with L. loa MFD.",
    "Conclusion/significance": "Loaisis microfilaremia is probably involved in cognitive impairment, especially when the MFD are high. These results highlight the urgent need to better understand loaisis-induced morbidity. Further studies investigating neurological morbidity of loiasis are needed."
