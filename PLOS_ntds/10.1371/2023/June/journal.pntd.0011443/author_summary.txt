In June 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a framework for integrated control and management of skin-related neglected tropical diseases. The framework describes how mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other (deep) implantation mycoses including sporotrichosis should be addressed and integrated in the primary health care settings. Between January and March 2022, WHO conducted a global online survey to collect information on the medicines used to treat implantation mycoses worldwide. The survey was designed as part of a WHO collaborative project with the United States Food and Drug Administration to identify priority disease areas for pilot testing in CURE ID, a web-based application to help clinicians share their experiences in managing difficult-to-treat infectious diseases and thereby inform clinical research needs to support drug repurposing. The survey also explored the type of diagnostic methods employed in countries within different health care settings (tertiary, secondary, primary level) and the medicines used to treat implantation mycoses, to obtain a better understanding of the practices in diagnostic services and level of drug repurposing for treatment of these diseases.
