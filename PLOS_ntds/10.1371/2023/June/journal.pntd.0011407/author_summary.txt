In 2017 and 2018 massive sylvatic yellow fever (YF) outbreaks took place in Minas Gerais Brazil. To investigate yellow fever virus (YFV) circulation following these massive outbreaks, we investigated samples from 187 free-living non-human primate (NHPs) collected between January 2019 and June 2021. One sample belonging to a Callithrix, collected in June 2020 was positive for YFV. This virus was closely related to YFV from previous outbreaks (2017–2018) showing the continued enzootic circulation of YFV in the state. Next, we investigated the drivers of YFV infection and intensity (an estimation of viral load in each infected NHP) during the 2017–18 outbreaks. The odds of YFV infection in NHPs were lower in urban areas compared to rural ones as expected in sylvatic cycles. There were strong temporal and spatial patterns were observed for YFV infection and intensity, especially in the eastern part of Minas Gerais state. The higher YFV infection and intensity observed during the warm/rainy season (as opposed to the cold/dry one) could be related to higher exposure to vectors and/or higher virus titers in vectors during this time. The possible delivery of a higher virus dose in NHPs could lead to higher viral replication levels within NHPs explaining the higher intensity of infection during warm/rainy season. Further studies are needed to better test this hypothesis and further compare the dynamics of YFV enzootic cycles between different seasons.
