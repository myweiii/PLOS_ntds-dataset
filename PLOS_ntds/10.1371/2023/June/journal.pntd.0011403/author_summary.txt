Tuberculosis (TB) is the second most deadly infectious disease after COVID-19. Improving the accessibility of WHO recommended rapid molecular diagnostic tests to achieve earlier and more accurate diagnosis of TB is an important part of strengthening TB laboratory work in the strategy of ending the epidemic of tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) accounts for 15% of all tuberculosis cases. Due to the unique biological samples of different classified EPTB and the occult nature of their onset, their diagnosis is more challenging. Smear microscopy is often insensitive and culture methods are prolonged. With the introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid Inc.), this has changed TB diagnostics by providing a rapid accessible platform to diagnose TB and identify rifampicin(RIF) resistance within 2h. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a suite of semi-nested real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR in vitro diagnostic technologies with good detection efficiency. In recent years, WHO has limited recommended Xpert MTB/RIF assay to detect various types of samples other than sputum for preliminary diagnosis of EPTB. The purpose of this paper is to systematically evaluate the practical application effect of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in the clinical diagnosis of EPTB, and provide scientific guidance for clinicians.Å±
