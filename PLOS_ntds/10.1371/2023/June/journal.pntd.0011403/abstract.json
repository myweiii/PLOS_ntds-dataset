    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic efficacy of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for rapid diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) and detection of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in patients suspected of having EPTB, assessing it against traditional culture and drug susceptibility test (DST) by proportional method, and the ability to predict multidrug resistance TB by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. In this study, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was applied to 1,614 extrapulmonary specimens. Compared with TB culture and Composite Reference Standard (CRS), the Xpert MTB/RIF assay had a high sensitivity and specificity for detection of EPTB. Depending on the culture method or CRS as the standard, sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of MTB in pleural effusion, cerebrospinal fluid, thoracic drainage fluid and throat swabs specimens were lower than that of other specimens. According to the experimental results, we have reason to believe that Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a rapid and simple technique with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing EPTB and detecting drug resistance in variety of specimens. Xpert MTB/RIF assay combined with DST maybe identify more cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)."
