    "Background": "Community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) is used to eliminate onchocerciasis. However, despite 25 years of annual CDTi in Mahenge, Tanzania, the prevalence of onchocerciasis and onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy remained high in certain rural villages. Therefore, in 2019, bi-annual CDTi was introduced in the area. This study assessed the impact of the programme on the incidence of epilepsy in four villages.",
    "Methodology": "Door-to-door epilepsy surveys were conducted prior to (2017/18) and after (2021) implementing a bi-annual CDTi program. All household members were screened for epilepsy symptoms using a validated questionnaire, and suspected cases were examined by a medical doctor to confirm/reject the diagnosis of epilepsy. The prevalence and annual incidence of epilepsy, including nodding syndrome, were calculated with 95% Wilson confidence intervals with continuity correction. The latter was also done for CDTi coverage in 2016 and 2021.",
    "Results": "Precisely 5,444 and 6,598 persons were screened for epilepsy before and after implementing the intervention. The CDTi coverage of the overall population was 82.3% (95%CI: 81.3\u201383.2%) in 2021 and sustained in both distribution rounds (81.5% and 76.8%). The coverage was particularly high in children and teenagers aged 6 to 18 years (93.2%, 95%CI: 92.1\u201394.2%). The epilepsy prevalence remained similar: 3.3% (95%CI: 2.9\u20133.9%) in 2017/18 versus 3.1% (95%CI: 2.7\u20133.5%) in 2021. However, the incidence of epilepsy declined from 177.6 (95%CI: 121.2\u2013258.5) in 2015\u20132017 and 2016\u20132018 to 45.5 (95%CI: 22.2\u201389.7) in 2019\u20132021 per 100,000 persons-years. The incidence of probable nodding syndrome varied from 18.4 (95%CI: 4.7\u201358.5) to 5.1 (95%CI: 0.3\u201332.8). None of the nine incidence cases of epilepsy for which information on ivermectin intake was available took ivermectin in the year they developed their first seizures.",
    "Conclusion": "A bi-annual CDTi programme should be implemented in areas with high prevalence of onchocerciasis and epilepsy. High CDTi coverage among children is particularly important to prevent onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy."
