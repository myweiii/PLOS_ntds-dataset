In recent years, many countries have used new technologies to prevent dengue fever, among which unmanned vehicle systems are the most promising. We combined a crawling robot, wire-controlled cable car and real-time monitoring system into an unmanned ground vehicle system (UGV) to conduct ecological surveys of vector mosquitoes in sewers (ditches). The study found that the ditches in Kaohsiung city were a breeding source for dengue vector mosquitoes. Inspection by UGVs determined that 12 of the 58 examined ditches contained Aedes mosquitoes in stages from larvae to adult. Positive ditches were then sprayed with insecticides or flushed with high-temperature water jets to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes. The widespread use of UGVs can potentially eliminate some of the breeding sources of vector mosquitoes, thereby reducing the annual prevalence of dengue fever in Kaohsiung city.
