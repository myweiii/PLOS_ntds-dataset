Infectious diseases transmitted between humans and animals, called zoonotic diseases, pose a global threat to human and animal health. Furthermore, diseased animals, especially livestock, can compromise the financial resources and livelihood of their owners as these depend on healthy animals for milk or meat production, or for agricultural work purposes. Brucellosis, Q fever and Rift Valley fever are two bacterial and one viral zoonotic disease that were found to be prevalent among many human-animal communities living in close contact, such as it is the case among Chadian agro-pastoralists. Limited data are available on the current status of these diseases in Chad. In this study, the authors investigated the prevalence of these three diseases among humans and their livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and donkeys) by collecting blood samples and conducting serological analyses in two rural regions of Chad, Danamadji and Yao. Results point towards high Q fever and Rift Valley fever seroprevalences (13–49% and 10–28%, respectively), and low prevalence of brucellosis (< 1%), and towards a positive association between human and animal Rift Valley fever seroprevalence. With these findings, the study hopes to support current and future zoonotic disease surveillance and control efforts within the regions.
