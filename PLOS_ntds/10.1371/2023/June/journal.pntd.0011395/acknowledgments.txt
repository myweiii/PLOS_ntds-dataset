The authors would like to thank the study participants and local human and animal health authorities in the two study areas. We particularly would like to express our gratitude to the local communities’ members who accepted to participate in the survey and the blood sample collection. Furthermore, we would like to thank the data collection team in the field and the technicians involved in the samples analysis process in the laboratory. The authors acknowledge the PADS (Programme d’appui aux districts sanitaires au Tchad) for collaboration and synergies.
