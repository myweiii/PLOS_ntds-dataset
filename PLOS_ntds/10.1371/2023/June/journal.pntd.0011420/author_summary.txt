Lyssaviruses are the causative agents for rabies, a zoonotic, fatal disease that is thought to be ancestral to bats. The wide geographical distribution and genetic diversity of lyssaviruses detected in bats across Europe indicated the need for lyssavirus surveillance in the Slovenian bat population. Within a retrospective surveillance study on bat-associated lyssavirus in Slovenia, one positive sample was detected. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Divača bat lyssavirus genome, from Slovenia, reflects the characteristic gene organization known for lyssaviruses, its classification in phylogroup I, and its close relation to tentative lyssavirus species KBLV. Together with KBLV, KHUV, EBLV 2, BBLV, and ARAV, Divača bat lyssavirus was detected in the genus Myotis suggesting its key role in the transmission and maintenance of certain lyssaviruses. Worldwide increased laboratory surveillance and pan-lyssavirus molecular tools will support the discovery of novel lyssaviruses which could greatly impact recognizing the risk of lyssaviruses to animal and human health.
