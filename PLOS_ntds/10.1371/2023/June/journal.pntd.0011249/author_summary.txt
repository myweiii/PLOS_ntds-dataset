Schistosomiasis, or ‘snail fever’, is caused by parasitic flatworms known as schistosomes. Presently, there is no effective vaccine for this major disease of poverty. The trematode worm that causes the most widespread form of schistosomiasis, Schistosoma mansoni, depends upon a specific pond snail, Biomphalaria, to support a part of its life cycle. Within the snail, larval schistosomes multiply and transform into a form that can penetrate human skin. The disease could therefore be mitigated with effective strategies to control this intermediate host snail. This study forms part of a research program designed to identify specific targets in the Biomphalaria nervous system that could disrupt the schistosome life cycle. The present investigation explored the properties of an unusual neuropeptide receptor, the FMRF-NH2 activated sodium channel (FaNaC). This class of receptors may provide opportunities for highly specific pharmacological or genetic snail control interventions that have minimal impact on other animal groups.
