    "Background": "Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent helminthic infections worldwide. Praziquantel (PZQ) resistance poses a possible danger to the disease’s ability to be controlled. Little is known about the role of Ziziphus spina-christi leaf extract (ZLE) in the treatment of hepatic schistosomiasis. However, no study has explored ZLE’s anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity as a possible mechanism for reducing hepatic injury in this context. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ZLE as an anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative agent in hamsters infected with S. mansoni.",
    "Methods": "Fifty hamsters were used and divided into 5 groups (10 hamsters each); noninfected untreated (controls), noninfected treated with ZLE, infected untreated, infected treated with PZQ- and infected treated with ZLE. Anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic effects of the drugs were assessed pathologically through the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF, Ki-67, and TGF β1 in liver sections. Some oxidative stress parameters were measured in hepatic homogenates (NO, GSH, GST, and SOD), and serum liver enzymes were also assessed.",
    "Results": "A significant decrease in worm burden, granuloma size, granuloma area, and numbers in the ZLE- and PZQ-treated groups compared to the infected untreated group, and the decrease in granulomas number and tissue egg load was significantly lower in PZQ treated group compared to ZLE treated group (p<0.05). ZLE exhibited significant anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic effects on granulomas, illustrated by significantly lower expression of VEGF and TGF-β1 than infected untreated and PZQ-treated groups. ZLE exhibits antiproliferative activity evidenced by a significant reduction of positive Ki-67 hepatocytes percentage compared to the infected untreated group. Moreover, ZLE exhibits potent antioxidant effects evidenced by a significantly lowered NO and conservation of hepatic GSH, GST, and SOD in hepatic homogenates compared to infected untreated and PZQ-treated groups (p<0.05).",
    "Conclusion": "Our results point to ZLE as a promising hepatoprotective therapeutic tool in the treatment of schistosome hepatic fibrosis as it has anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-fibrotic, and antioxidant effects in hamsters infected with S. mansoni, providing scientific support for its use in conventional medicine."
