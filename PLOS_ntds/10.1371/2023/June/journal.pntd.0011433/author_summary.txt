Trachoma prevention and control strategies have been successful in certain societies, but it has been more difficult in many communities. In Ethiopia, there are 10.2 million cases of trachoma, in which the Amhara region takes the lionâ€™s share. Half the global population requiring intervention for trachoma elimination is in the country where some regions/districts have up to 37%TF rate after years of antibiotic treatment. Facial cleanliness & Environmental improvements are critical for sustained progress toward elimination. This study demonstrates the need to consider support for the introduction of those interventions (F and E) for trachoma elimination in Ethiopia and thus the elimination of an estimated half the global burden. The findings can be used to establish effective public health approaches and implementation of those strategies (F and E) for trachoma prevention and control.
