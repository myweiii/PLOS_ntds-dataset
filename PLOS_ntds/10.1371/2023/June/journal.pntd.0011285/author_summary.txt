Typhoid fever, caused by S. Typhi, remains a public health threat in low- and middle-income countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Country data on antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic diversity of circulating S. Typhi is crucial for surveillance, treatment guidelines and prevention. Typhoid fever is endemic in Rwanda but there are no data on the diversity of S. Typhi genotypes, genetic evolution, or the association with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the country. Therefore, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 25 S. Typhi historical (1984-1985) and 26 recent (2010-2018) isolates from Rwanda. Whereas the historical population is diverse and susceptible to antimicrobials, the recent S. Typhi population in Rwanda is dominated by genotype 4.3.1.2 (H58) which is associated with high AMR rates and is dominant in Asia and East Africa. Furthermore, we present a workflow for implementation of WGS to support typhoid surveillance and identified challenges of this workflow in endemic regions.
