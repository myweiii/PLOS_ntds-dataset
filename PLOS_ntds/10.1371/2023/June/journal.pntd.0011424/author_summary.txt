Parasitic worm infections, such as schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, belong to a group of diseases collectively known as neglected tropical diseases that affect primarily marginalized communities. Transmission of both parasitic worms is affected by behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, sophisticated geostatistical models that rely on environmental predictors are commonly used to predict transmission and treatment needs. We used two nationally representative surveys conducted in Ghana and employed a relatively simple and interpretable modeling approach to predict the risk of Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm infections among school-age children before (2008) and after (2015) deworming became a widespread practice. We found that as the proportion of infected children declined, model performance decreased, but hotspots of high-prevalence locations persisted. This suggests that the models may still be useful in spatial targeting of interventions, but the broad application of the approach should be re-evaluated.
