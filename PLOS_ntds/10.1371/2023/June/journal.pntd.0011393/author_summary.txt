Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most prevalent type of leishmaniasis with varied clinical presentations. It is caused by a group of protozoan intracellular parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted through the bite of blood-sucking female sandfly species. few studies have examined the relationship between vitamin D and the VDR gene polymorphism and protozoal infection including leishmaniasis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate for the first time the possible association of VDR gene polymorphisms (BsmI, ApaI, TaqI, and FokI genotypes) with parasite load and susceptibility to CL and attempted to ascertain such an a ociation with serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D in a trial to improve treatment strategies for CL.the results revealed that 25-OH vitamin D level was significantly lower among patients with CL compared to controls. The frequency of genotype “aa” and its “a” allele in ApaI SNP of VDR was significantly lower in CL patients compared to controls. However, the “A” allele frequency was significantly higher in patients with CL compared to controls, suggesting its role in CL susceptibility. The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of BsmI, TaqI, and FokI were non-significantly different 86 between both groups. The parasite load was significantly negatively correlated with 25-OH vitamin D levels. Correction of vitamin D levels may aid in CL management.
