Increasing knowlesi malaria cases and other zoonotic simian malaria caused by Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium inui in humans have added another dimension of complexity to malaria elimination. Unfortunately, the entomological perspective for this disease is scarce and understudied. Accordingly, we aimed to understand the bionomics and transmission efficiency of the simian malaria vectors, and to examine the genetic diversity and evolutionary pattern of their simian Plasmodium. Our study revealed that the Anopheles Leucosphyrus Group mosquitoes are highly potential competent vectors, and they represent a risk of human infection with zoonotic simian malaria in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium cynomolgi and P. inui were highly prevalent in mosquitoes collected from the present study, and they demonstrated close relationship with those from the vertebrate hosts, suggesting ongoing transmission between the vectors, macaques, and humans. With these constant microevolutionary processes, there are risks for both P. inui and P. cynomolgi to emerge and spread as a major public health problem, following the trend of P. knowlesi in Southeast Asia.
