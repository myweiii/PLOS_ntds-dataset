Chagas disease (ChD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted mainly through triatomine bugs of the Reduviidae family, genus Triatoma. These vectors are found in the Americas and T. infestans is the most common species in Southern Cone countries; closely tied to rural population that live in households with cracked walls and thatched roofs that serve as refuge for the bugs. Even though ChD can also be transmitted congenitally, through blood transfusions, or organ transplantation, among others, the main route of transmission is vectorial and programs for the prevention of this disease have traditionally focused on vector control through insecticide spraying. Argentina is the country with the greatest number ChD cases, and a national program of its control has been implemented since 1962, yet, due to a lack of sustainability, there are still 1.6 million infected individuals. Herein we describe a program that has been implemented since 2005 in rural areas from an endemic province of Argentina, Santiago del Estero, which worked together with the community, using an ecohealth approach, to monitor and control the vector and to improve the houses of the population to avoid the presence of the vector inside and prevent infection. The program achieved a reduction in triatomine infestation, especially in the domicile, therefore we hope it serves as an example to guide public health policy and enable diagnosis and treatment of ChD in endemic areas.
