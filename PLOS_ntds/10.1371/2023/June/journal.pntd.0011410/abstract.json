    "Background": "Chagas Disease (ChD) is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) affecting 6 to 7 million people worldwide, mostly from Latin America. In Argentina, a national control program has been implemented since 1962, yet there are still an estimated 1.6 million infected individuals. Control programs were based almost exclusively on entomological surveillance and chemical control of households and were not continuous given a lack of coordination and resources. Argentina\u00b4s ChD program was originally vertical and centralized; later, it was partially and, in general, unsuccessfully transferred to the provinces. Herein, we describe the implementation of a control program for ChD with an ecohealth approach in rural settlements around the city of A\u00f1atuya, Santiago del Estero.",
    "Methods": "The program included yearly household visits for entomological surveillance and control, health promotion workshops, and structural house improvements. Improved structures included internal and external walls and roofs, as well as the construction of water wells and latrines, and the organization and improvement of peri-domestic structures. Activities were carried out by specifically trained personnel except for house improvements, which were performed by the community, under technical guidance and provision of materials. Data was collected using standardized questionnaires for household characterization, entomological infestation status and chemical control activities.",
    "Results": "This program was continuously implemented since 2005 with high community participation and adherence, incorporating 13 settlements and 502 households. During the surveillance phase, 4,193 domiciliary inspections were performed, and both the intra- and peri-domestic infestation rate were reduced from 17.9% to 0.2% (P < 0.01) and from 20.4% to 3%, respectively. Additionally, 399 households were structurally improved.",
    "Conclusion": "The program is still ongoing and, after 14 years of implementation, has built social networks and collaboration between implementers and beneficiaries with a reduction of T. infestans infestation in the intra- and peri-domicile. This reduction, especially inside the household, has enabled access to diagnosis and treatment of the population, with minimal risk of re-infection."
