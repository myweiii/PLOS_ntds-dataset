In underdeveloped nations, the high frequency of neglected vector-borne illnesses like Chagas disease imposes significant health and financial burdens. Throughout history, the major efficient management strategies for such illnesses have relied on vector population control and continue to do so now. Although early efforts to understand the biology of specific vectors led to significant advances in the creation of management strategies for vector-borne diseases, studies regarding the intricate physiology of local vector species were hindered by the growing use of insecticide-based tools. Currently, the necessity to rely on in-depth species-specific vector biology has been highlighted once again by the growing threat of pesticide resistance and climate change (which can expand endemic areas). Disrupting molecular processes or attacking the metabolic targets required to generate viable eggs is one method of managing vector populations. Here, we present discoveries regarding the molecular basis of oogenesis of the insect vector of Chagas Disease Rhodnius prolixus. We found that proteasome activity is important for the unfolding of the oogenesis program, being essential for the reproductive success of this vector.
