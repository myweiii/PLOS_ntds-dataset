Vivax malaria is the most prevalent and widespread human malaria outside the African continent. The control of vivax malaria is based on vector control and effective radical cure of infected people. However, the elimination of the sexual stages of P. vivax present in infected people is important to block malaria transmission from human to mosquito vector. Here, we assessed the potential of currently used antimalarial drugs for vivax malaria therapy for blocking malaria transmission in the mosquito vector An. darlingi. We observed that the antimalarials tested were able to block the infection of mosquitoes; however, treatment based on the artemisinin combination proved to be the fastest for blocking transmission in mosquitoes, using blood taken 4 h after treatment. As such, patients in endemic areas who receive the first line vivax malaria treatment, chloroquine and primaquine, could need protection from bites of the malaria vector for at least 24 h after the initial dose in order to interrupt malaria transmission. Our observations provide an overview of the transmission-blocking profile of antimalarials currently used in Brazil for the treatment of vivax malaria and they also provide a platform for the evaluation of new antimalarials, such as tafenoquine or other compounds for combating the sexual stages of P. vivax, which may impact the epidemiology of malaria.
