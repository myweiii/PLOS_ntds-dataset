    "Background": "Filamentous fungi of the genus Madurella are the primary causative agents of mycetoma, a disease observed in tropical and subtropical regions. Since early diagnostics based on a morphological approach are difficult and have many shortcomings, a molecular diagnostic method suitable for rural settings is required. In this study, we developed the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to present a foundational technique of the diagnosis of Madurella spp. (M. mycetomatis, M. pseudomycetomatis, M. tropicana, and M. fahalii), the common causative organisms of eumycetoma.",
    "Principal findings": "We successfully designed a primer pair targeting the rDNAs of three Madurella spp. excluding M. fahalii, and detected up to 100 fg of genomic DNA extracted from isolates of M. mycetomatis and 1 pg of M. pseudomycetomatis and M. tropicana, within one hour. Second, a primer pair specific to M. mycetomatis, the most common causative species, or M. fahalii, a drug-resistant species, was constructed, and the detection limit of both primer pairs was 1 pg. The designed primers accurately distinguished 16 strains of the genus Madurella from various fungal species known to cause mycetomas.",
    "Conclusion": "In summary, we established the first model of a LAMP detection method that rapidly and sensitively detects and identifies Madurella isolates for clinical diagnostics. Moreover, the combined designed primer sets could identify mycetoma-causing strains simultaneously."
