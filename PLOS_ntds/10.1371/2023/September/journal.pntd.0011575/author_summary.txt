Histoplasma capsulatum exposure is rarely suspected in Indonesia, even though this fungal presence in the country has been reported since the 1930s. Pulmonary manifestations of histoplasmosis, especially chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis (CPH), resemble pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). It may be misdiagnosed as or be a co-infection with pulmonary TB. Since Indonesia is the second-highest TB-burdened country worldwide, it is imperative to capture histoplasmosis data among pulmonary TB patients. Our study provides evidence of H. capsulatum exposure by measuring anti-H. capsulatum IgG antibodies in both bacteriologically confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pulmonary TB patients at seven TB referral hospitals in Indonesia. We found 12.7% (39/306) of pulmonary TB patients were positive for anti-H. capsulatum IgG antibodies. We had a high suspicion of pulmonary histoplasmosis diagnosis in 10 of the 39 patients (six bacteriologically confirmed and four clinically-diagnosed TB) who were immunocompromised due to high IgG assay values (>30 EU). The utilization of other modalities, such as the Histoplasma antigen test, may support a histoplasmosis diagnosis. In our study, malignancies and cavitary lesions were associated with anti-H. capsulatum IgG antibody positive results. Our results bring much-needed preliminary data to guide policymakers regarding fungal infection in pulmonary TB patients and support further research on histoplasmosis in Indonesia.
