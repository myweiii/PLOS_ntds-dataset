Sporotrichosis is one of the unspecified deep mycoses that match the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) selection criteria. It is caused by Sporothrix, a fungus that usually results in zoonotic fungal diseases and sapronosis that are endemic in temperate regions. Sporotrichosis is clinically presented in two main forms, which are lymphocutanous sporotrichosis (LC) and fixed sporotrichosis (F), especially in immunocompetent patients. However, severe clinical versions, such as cutaneous disseminated, mucosal, and extracutaneous forms may present in immunocompromised hosts. This study presents a case of cutaneous disseminated sporotrichosis in a patient with diabetes mellitus and information based on the review of relevant literature. Clinicians should be on the lookout for severe clinical forms of sporotrichosis in all patients with possibly altered immune function.
