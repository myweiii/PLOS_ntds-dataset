Dengue fever has become an increasing threat to public health, with its global expansion and increased presence in dengue endemic countries. This study provides insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in children in Fortaleza, Brazil, a city which has been a hotspot for arbovirus infections. We estimated seroprevalence for certain study population characteristics and identified characteristics that were associated with an increased risk of dengue seropositivity. We also explored the associations of a composite measure of knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) with seropositivity and found an inverse relationship between KAP for dengue control and childrenâ€™s seropositivity. KAP could change due to previous infection experience, which is a potential limitation of using KAP as a potential predictor of dengue seropositivity in cross-sectional studies. Despite this, KAP remains useful for identifying gaps in knowledge, attitude, and practice that can be used to inform public health measures, such as education campaigns. Measures of social acceptability of interventions should also be considered for inclusion in similar studies, as it would provide an indication of likelihood of adoption of interventions, which provides additional insight for different dengue interventions.
