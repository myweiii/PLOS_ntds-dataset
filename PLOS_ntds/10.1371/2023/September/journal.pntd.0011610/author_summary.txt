Timely detection of arboviral introduction and transmission is paramount to decrease the probability of further autochthonous transmission in non-endemic countries. When, despite all efforts, autochthonous transmission occurs, then an early detection of cases helps in bringing the outbreak under control. However, due to the still low frequency in Europe of local outbreaks of arboviruses transmitted by the vector mosquito species Aedes albopictus, little is known about the performance of public health surveillance in an ongoing emergency situation. This research investigates the reporting delays observed during the 2017 Italian chikungunya outbreak and provides estimate useful for modeling outbreak responses as well as suggesting the strengthening of the surveillance systems in the early detection and identification of arboviral cases.
