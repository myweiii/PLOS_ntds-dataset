Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease of significant public health importance. Domestic dogs are the main reservoir and transmitter of this disease, particularly in developing countries. Community awareness about rabies is one of the key components of prevention. Here we assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices about rabies disease among dog owners at Kahama town council, Shinyanga Region, Tanzania. The finding shows that, majority of respondents had good knowledge and relatively good attitude, however a good number of them also had poor practice toward rabies prevention and control. It was further observed that both attitude and practice were associated with education level and occupation. The observed association could be due to the fact that education level and occupation of the respondents have influence in good attitude and practices regarding rabies disease and anti-rabies vaccination including vaccination of their dogs and willingness in paying full costs of post exposure prophylaxis. In conclusion, despite good knowledge and positive attitude about rabies among dog owners in Kahama town council, the practice was found to be poor indicating practice gaps in the community. We recommend that rabies awareness and vaccination campaigns be intensified, particularly among the least educated dog owners. Further, similar studies should be conducted in other regions of the country, especially in communities with a large number of dogs.
