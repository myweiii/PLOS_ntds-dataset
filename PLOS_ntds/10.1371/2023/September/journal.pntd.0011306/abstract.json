    "Abstract": "The composition of the microbiome is shaped by both environment and host in most organisms, but in the mosquito Aedes aegypti the role of the host in shaping the microbiome is poorly understood. Previously, we had shown that four lines of Ae. aegypti harbored different microbiomes when reared in the same insectary under identical conditions. To determine whether these lines differed from each other across time and in different environments, we characterized the microbiome of the same four lines of Ae. aegypti reared in the original insectary and at another institution. While it was clear that the environment influenced the microbiomes of these lines, we did still observe distinct differences in the microbiome between lines within each insectary. Clear differences were observed in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and abundance of specific bacterial taxa. To determine if the line specific differences in the microbiome were maintained across environments, pair-wise differential abundances of taxa was compared between insectaries. Lines were most similar to other lines from the same insectary than to the same line reared in a different insectary. Additionally, relatively few differentially abundant taxa identified between pairs of lines were shared across insectaries, indicating that line specific properties of the microbiome are not conserved across environments, or that there were distinct microbiota within each insectary. Overall, these results demonstrate that mosquito lines under the same environmental conditions have different microbiomes across microbially- diverse environments and host by microbe interactions affecting microbiome composition and abundance is dependent on environmentally available bacteria."
