Trypanosoma cruzi is a vector-borne parasite that causes Chagas disease (CD), an illness that affects 6â€“8 million people worldwide and results in approximately 50,000 deaths per year. Transmitted by more than 100 species of triatomine insects, T. cruzi has a complex life cycle that includes parasite forms that proliferate in the gut of the insect vector (epimastigotes) and in the cytoplasm of infected mammalian cells (amastigotes). To be transmitted to mammals, epimastigotes must differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigotes, and to infect new mammalian cells, amastigotes must differentiate into bloodstream trypomastigotes. Sphingolipids (SLs) are essential components of all eukaryotic cellular membranes and are present in all forms of T. cruzi as part of various cell surface molecules involved in host-parasite interactions. Different from mammals, in which sphingomyelin is the main SL, T. cruzi synthesizes inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) and, because of that, enzymes of the SL biosynthetic pathway have been considered potential targets for the development of new treatments for CD. By disrupting the gene encoding the T. cruzi IPC synthase, we showed that parasite differentiation from epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes and from amastigotes to bloodstream forms are affected and, as a consequence, these knockout cell lines are unable to establish an infection in animals.
