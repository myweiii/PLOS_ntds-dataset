Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) remains a serious public health concern in China. It is important to predict trends and understand peaks in the number of cases in advance for its prevention and control. The aim of this study was to consider the influence of meteorology and air pollution on the transmission of HFMD and establish multi-step prediction models for HFMD. In this study, we compared the performance of the Shih attention mechanism with the Luong attention mechanism, Seq2Seq model and LSTM model for future multi-day HFMD prediction based on multi-input multi-output. It was found that the Seq2Seq-Shih model performed best in predicting the trend for the next 2 days-15 days with RMSE, sMAPE and PCC values of 13.943~22.192, 17.880~27.937, and 0.887~0.705, respectively. Meanwhile, it was able to predict the peak within 15 days earlier by 17 days. This is the first study to use Seq2Seq models and perform daily multi-step prediction of HFMD. This study demonstrates the benefit of the Shih attention mechanism in multivariate time series multi-step prediction of infectious diseases.
