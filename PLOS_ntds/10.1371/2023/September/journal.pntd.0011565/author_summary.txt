Phlebotomine sand flies are tiny blood sucking insects. These are vectors of Leishmania, flagellate unicellular parasites, mostly found in Mediterranean and tropical areas. In Thailand, Leishmania martiniquensis and L. orientalis are responsible for local diseases but the parasite transmission cycle remains unknown. For a long time, South-Eastern Asia was considered to be free of leishmaniasis and as such, Phlebotomine sand flies have been understudied in this area.
We carried out an inventory in a cave located in the Chiang Rai district, northern Thailand. We caught two new species we consider to be new for Science based on morphological (head and genital apparatus) and molecular characters (cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequences).
The new species were named Phlebotomus shadenae n. sp. and Sergentomyia maiae n. sp. We also recorded the first species in Laos whereas the second has just been recorded in the studied cave.
