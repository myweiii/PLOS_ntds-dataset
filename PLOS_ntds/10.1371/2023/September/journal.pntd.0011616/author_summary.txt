Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), a newly emerging virus in North America, can result in disease spillover from wild mammals into human populations via the bite of infected mosquitoes. We show that the mosquito Aedes aegypti, known for transmitting many viral pathogens to humans globally, and whose distribution is creeping northward in the USA toward regions where JCV is present, is likely able to transmit the virus. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium being released in wild mosquito populations of because it limits the replication of human viruses inside the mosquito, limiting their transmission to humans. We show that Wolbachia has a limited ability to control the replication of JCV, which is likely because Wolbachia-induced antiviral response is quite weak, and unique aspects of negative-sense virus biology make them less susceptible to blocking. Our findings suggest that JCV may serve as a comparative model to positive-sense viruses like dengue in dissecting the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking. It also warns that shifting mosquito distributions, as expected under a changing climate, could bring JCV and Aedes mosquitoes into greater contact, potentially increasing the incidence of JCV in humans.
