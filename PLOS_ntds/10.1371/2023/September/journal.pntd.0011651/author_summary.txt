Arboviruses are notorious for triggering antibodies that may cross-react with (closely) related arboviruses, complicating interpretation of serology-based arbovirus diagnostics and of epidemiological surveys. This is further complicated by the rapid global spread of arboviruses, that may lead to increasing co-circulation of antigenically related arboviruses, and by the lack of detailed background information on the population tested, methods used and background arbovirus exposures such as prior infections or vaccinations.
Here, we aim to provide a better understanding of the complex cross-reactivity patterns as well as the current knowledge and knowledge gaps in differential arbovirus serology. We have done a systematic analysis of reported cross-reactivity patterns from published peer-reviewed articles, using a system that allows assessment of the quality of reported cross-reactivity results. We show that using this approach, the majority of studies lack details needed to reliably assess whether reactivity to antigens from different, related arboviruses is caused by antibody cross-reactivity, or if it reflects antibodies from multiple exposures to these different viruses. Furthermore, there is a strong need for standardization of assays and study designs in future serological studies to compare cross-reactivity results from different studies. Tackling this may lead to improved diagnosis and surveillance of (newly) emerging and/or rapidly spreading arboviruses.
