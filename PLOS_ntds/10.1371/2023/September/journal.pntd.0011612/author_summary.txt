Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonotic disease caused by cestode species belonging to Echinococcus granulosus s.l. complex. CE affects mainly pastoral and rural communities in both low-income and upper-middle-income countries, where the life cycle of the parasite is sustained between livestock and dogs. The larval parasite cysts causing human CE develop mainly in the liver and secondarily the lung, but in a smaller number of cases, larvae may develop in any organ or tissue, including the brain.
We report here a case of cerebral CE (CCE) in a child living near Rome (Italy), which was attributed to probable household/backyard infection from the family farm by comparative molecular analysis of the patientâ€™s and sheep CE cyst specimens obtained from the family farm and another local farm. We also summarized the clinical characteristics of CCE cases retrieved through a literature review. When considering clinical centres reporting all anatomical sites of CE, liver represented 70%, lungs 19%, and unusual localizations 11% of all CE cases. The proportion of CCE among all CE cyst localizations represented 1.5% of all CE cases. These figures are important when calculating the global burden of disease, since CCE and other uncommon CE localizations, although more rare, are clinically more severe.
