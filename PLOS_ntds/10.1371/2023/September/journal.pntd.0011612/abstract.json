    "Background": "Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the species belonging to the Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) complex. Parasitic cysts causing human CE are mainly localized in the liver and in the lungs. In a smaller number of cases, larvae may establish in any organ or tissue, including the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebral CE (CCE) is rare but poses serious clinical challenges.",
    "Methods": "This study presents a case of CCE in a child living in the countryside near Rome (Italy), along with a comparative molecular analysis of the isolated cyst specimens from the patient and sheep of local farms. We also systematically searched the literature to summarize the most relevant epidemiological and clinical aspects of this uncommon localization.",
    "Findings": "The comparative molecular analysis confirmed that the infection was caused by E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) (G3 genotype), and most likely acquired in the family farm.",
    "Conclusions": "We report a rare case of CCE and evidenced the probable local origin of infection. The proportions of CE cases with uncommon localizations and with high impact on patientsâ€™ lives have been globally neglected and should be included in the computation of the global burden of CE."
