In this study, we examined the potential for people with mild illness to transmit dengue virus to mosquitoes. Although people with mild dengue illness can be infectious, they often are undetected by surveillance systems and research teams. Variation in infectiousness over the course of a person’s infection is largely unexplored, but potentially important component of dengue epidemiology. In an effort to better understand the factors that underlie this variation, we blood fed laboratory-reared, uninfected mosquitoes directly on mildly ill people naturally infected with dengue virus in Iquitos, Peru. Detection of virus in mosquito saliva after feeding on an infected person was considered positive for mosquito transmission. As has been reported previously, transmission to mosquitoes was positively associated with the amount of virus in a person’s blood and the number of days after the mosquito fed on an infected person. Unlike results from previous studies, which reported peak transmission during the first day of a person’s illness, we found that for mildly ill people infectiousness to mosquitoes peaked on the second day of illness. Because people with mild illness are thought to contribute more to dengue virus transmission than more severely ill people, subtle differences in the dynamics of their infectiousness to mosquitoes could be epidemiologically significant.
