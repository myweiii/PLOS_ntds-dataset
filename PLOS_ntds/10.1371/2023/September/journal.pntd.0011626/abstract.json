    "Background": "Artesunate (ART) has been reported to have an antifibrotic effect in various organs. The underlying mechanism has not been systematically elucidated. We aimed to clarify the effect of ART on liver fibrosis induced by Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) in an experimentally infected rodent model and the potential underlying mechanisms.",
    "Methods": "The effect of ART on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was assessed using CCK-8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assays. The experimental model of liver fibrosis was established in the Mongolian gerbil model infected with S. japonicum cercariae and then treated with 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg ART. The hydroxyproline (Hyp) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in liver tissue were measured and histopathological changes of liver tissues were observed. Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the liver tissues was performed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using bioinformatic analysis and verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot assay.",
    "Results": "ART significantly inhibited the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HSCs in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, Hyp content decreased significantly in the ART-H group compared to the model (MOD) group and GPX activity was significantly higher in the ART-H group than in the MOD group. Besides, ART treatment significantly reduced collagen production (p <0.05). A total of 158 DEGs and 44 differentially expressed miRNAs related to ART-induced anti-schistosomiasis liver fibrosis were identified. The qPCR and western blot results of selected DEGs were consistent with the sequencing results. These DEGs were implicated in key pathways such as immune and inflammatory response, integrin-mediated signaling and toll-like receptor signaling pathways.",
    "Conclusion": "ART is effective against liver fibrosis using Mongolian gerbil model induced by S. japonicum infection. We identified host candidate regulators of schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis in response to ART through transcriptomics approach."
