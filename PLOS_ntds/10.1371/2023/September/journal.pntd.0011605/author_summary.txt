Intestinal worm infections—formally known as soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections—are a public health problem that can potentially reduce physical growth, cause anemia, and hinder cognitive development. In Uganda, baseline surveys conducted between 1998 and 2005 indicated that STH infection prevalence was over 50% among school-aged children in most surveyed districts. As a result of these findings, in the early 2000s, the Ugandan Ministry of Health began twice-a-year national deworming campaigns and health education among preschool- and school-aged children.
In March and May of 2022, we conducted follow-up surveys in five districts to determine how well the deworming campaigns have reduced infection prevalence in these communities. Among surveyed groups (preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and women of reproductive age), we found that in three of the five surveyed districts, STH prevalence had substantially decreased. In these areas, the national deworming program may consider reducing the frequency of the deworming campaigns from its current twice-a-year schedule. The prevalence remained high in the remaining two districts despite several years of deworming. Further investigation is needed to determine why.
