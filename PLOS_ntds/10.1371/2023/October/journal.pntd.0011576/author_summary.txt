Snakebite envenoming is a life-threatening issue. The Bede people in Bangladesh often engage in the snake business with professions such as snake charmers and snakebite healers, however, this makes them more vulnerable to snakebites. There is little research on health seeking behavior and its outcomes of the Bede people. Bangladesh has the highest rate of snakebites in the world where snakebite victims (both the Bede and non-Bede people) typically rely on the ethnomedicinal treatment provided by the Bede healers. Hence, clarification of their health seeking behaviors will contribute to the overall improvement of snakebite treatments among the Bede people and the rest in Bangladesh. In depth interviews were conducted, and conventional content analyses were performed. Although 33 of the 38 snake charmers answered that hospital treatment is the best way to care for snakebite, only five went to the hospital for treatment. Among 44 snake charmers, only one successful antivenom treatment was reported in this study. The accessibility to antivenom treatment is limited for the Bede community despite their proximity to the snake. To make antivenom treatment available within the Bede community, collaboration between the public sector and the Bede ethnomedical practitioners should be promoted.
