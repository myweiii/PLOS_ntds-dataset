Snakebite envenoming (SBE) predominantly affects poor communities living in rural areas of developing countries. As SBE induces a wide range of pathological effects in patients, they need a broad spectrum of treatment approaches to tackle those issues. Therefore, antivenom alone is not sufficient to treat SBE patients. In India, most people (including SBE patients) seek treatments from private healthcare settings, although government hospitals provide free treatments. Hence the treatment costs pose a significant burden on the SBE victims and their families leading to severe socioeconomic impacts. To develop better policies to support the clinical management of SBE, it is critical to estimate the costs of SBE treatment in private healthcare settings. In this study, we analysed the treatment costs of 913 snakebite patients who were treated in 10 different private tertiary care hospitals in Tamil Nadu, India, and identified various factors that contribute to treatment costs. For example, snake type, specialist treatments and the time of arrival to the hospital following bites are some of the key factors leading to increased treatment costs. These results form the basis for developing policies to regulate SBE treatment costs, provide health insurance coverage and ensure timely treatment for SBE victims in rural healthcare settings.
