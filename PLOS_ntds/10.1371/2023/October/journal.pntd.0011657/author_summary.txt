Zika virus (ZIKV) is known to cause congenital disease in humans through vertical transmission of the virus from mothers to fetuses during pregnancy. How the virus populations change during this process is currently not well understood. To evaluate differences in ZIKV populations during vertical transmission, we infected pregnant mice with ZIKV and sequenced the viral populations from matched placentas and fetal bodies at early stages of vertical transmission, and matched placentas, fetal bodies, and fetal brains at late stages of vertical transmission when the virus enters the fetal brain. We determined that there is little restriction of ZIKV diversity during transmission from the placenta to the fetus at early stages. However, there was a sharp decrease in ZIKV diversity in both fetal bodies and fetal brains at late stages. Two predominant viral variants were found across all fetal brains and most fetal bodies at late stages, suggesting there may be possible selection for certain variants during neuroinvasion of ZIKV into fetal brains.
