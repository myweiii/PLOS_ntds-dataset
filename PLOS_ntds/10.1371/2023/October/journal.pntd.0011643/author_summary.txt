Chagas disease (ChD) produced by Trypanosoma cruzi, usually, infect humans through the contact with the feces of blood-sucking triatomines, but microepidemics of oral transmission have been described. We ignore if patients who were infected by the oral route have a higher risk of developing early chronic Chagasic cardiopathy (CCC). In this work, a 10 years prospective cohort study was carried out to evaluate 106 people who were infected and treated simultaneously during the largest outbreak of orally transmitted ChD described. All clinical, electrocardiographic and ultrasonographic alterations of the acute phase improved almost completely few weeks after specific treatment. However, clinical and electrocardiogram bradycardia were the only non-subjective findings that did not revert during follow-up. Other findings appeared and sometimes persisted which do not necessarily indicate CCC, arising question if these could be early signs of CCC. A 5-years-old preschooler died during the acute phase, but there was no mortality associated with ChD during follow-up. Rapid diagnosis and immediate anti-parasitic treatment could be the reasons for the good evolution of these patients.
