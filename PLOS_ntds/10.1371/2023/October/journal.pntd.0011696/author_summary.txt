Melioidosis is an infection caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei bacterium and is most commonly found in tropical regions such as northern Australia and Southeast Asia, including Sabah, Malaysia. Death due to the disease is often associated with failure in clinical identification, prediction of death, and treatment of the disease. A local database on melioidosis could assist doctors, in particular infectious disease physicians, in overcoming these failures. Doctors in Sabah should have a high clinical suspicion of melioidosis, particularly for male patients, and particularly those of the Kadazan-Dusun ethnic group, who present with fever and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes. Patients with blood infections who develop septic shock or have affected respiratory organs should be prioritised during treatment and management due to their poor prognosis. Melioidosis patients with or without an existing illness, particularly diabetes, should also be equally prioritised to prevent death. In this region, ceftazidime, imipenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain highly effective antibiotics against B. pseudomallei. This new knowledge may contribute to better melioidosis clinical recognition, prognosis, and treatment of the disease to reduce mortality rates due to melioidosis.
