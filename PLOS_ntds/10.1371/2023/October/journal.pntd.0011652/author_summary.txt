The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme helps red blood cells work properly. When the body does not have enough of this enzyme and is exposed to oxidative challenges, including certain foods and medicines, red blood cells break down faster than they are made, causing hemolytic anemia. Diagnostics tools for this common condition have been limited but now, new point of care tests are available that can screen more people who are unable to access laboratory services. This is particularly important for the treatment of vivax malaria, where the only treatment options require G6PD screening before administration. This research provides an evaluation of the diagnostic performance of one such tool, the STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, South Korea), based on extensive data from multiple studies. These data show that the test can be used to safely identify people with G6PD deficiency, which will help ensure they do not receive contraindicated medicines. The research also provides specific estimates about how this test may impact malaria case management and treatment options.
