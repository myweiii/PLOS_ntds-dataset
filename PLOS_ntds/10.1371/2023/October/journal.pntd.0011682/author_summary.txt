Brucellosis is a priority zoonotic disease in Kenya that causes human illness and socio-economic losses in livestock-keeping households. We conducted a linked human-livestock study to investigate the seroprevalence of Brucella spp.. We also identified risk factors associated with brucellosis seropositivity. The study found a high seroprevalence in humans and animals and identified significant risk factors associated with livestock exposure, which included adult animals, female animals, and large herd sizes. In humans, significant risk factors included being male, residing in a specific ward, and having no formal education. We also found a strong correlation between human seropositivity and herd exposure. Implementing interventions such as promoting public awareness about the disease, safe handling of livestock and livestock products, and livestock vaccinations can potentially reduce the disease transmission in livestock and spill over to humans. Future studies should examine the efficacy of measures that reduce these risk factors to mitigate the spread of brucellosis.
