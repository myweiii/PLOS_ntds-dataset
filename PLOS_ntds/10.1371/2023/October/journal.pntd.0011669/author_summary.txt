Wild city rats can carry infectious organisms including various bacteria, protozoa, and viruses that are capable of causing disease in humans. People living in low-income areas or unhoused may have increased contact with rats and therefore may be particularly vulnerable. However, little is known regarding the role that rats have in spreading these organisms during human outbreaks of disease. From January to August 2021, there was an outbreak of Shigella flexneri, a bacteria that causes gastrointestinal disease, among homeless or poorly housed people in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada. We hypothesized that rats may have been involved in propagating the outbreak, so we trapped rats within the outbreak area and compared Shigella spp. strains from the feces of these rats and human patients. We found that some Norway rats were carrying Shigella spp., with two samples showing relatedness to the human samples. Rats were often carrying more than one potential human pathogen in their feces. This study highlights the importance of managing rat populations to reduce the spread of diseases to humans, especially among low-income neighborhoods with marginalized, unhoused, or poorly housed individuals.
