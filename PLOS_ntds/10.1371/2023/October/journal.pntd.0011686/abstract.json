    "Background": "Podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) is a chronic disease characterized by the development of persistent swelling of plantar foot initially; which progresses to the dorsal foot and lower leg slowly or in a number of acute episodes to reach the knee. About 4 million people are said to be affected by the disease worldwide and it is deemed a serious public health problem in at least 10 African countries including Ethiopia. Therefore this study aimed to identify the determinants of podoconiosis among residence in Machakel district.",
    "Method": "Unmatched case control study design was conducted at Machakel district from August 30 to September 30, 2022. The sample size calculated using Epi-info software yielded 211 controls and 106 cases (317 study participants). Simple random sampling technique was used to select the cases using registration books of the district. Data were entered to Epi info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 22 for statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to identify explanatory variables.",
    "Result": "A total of 312 study participants (104 cases and 208 controls) were included giving a response rate of 98.42%. Bare foot (AOR, 5.83 [95% CI: 2.34\u201314.50]), female sex (AOR, 4.25 [95% CI: 2.22\u20138.14]), family history of podoconiosis (AOR: 3.01(95% CI: 1.41\u20136.42) and age group 41\u201360 (AOR: 5.05(95% CI: 2.35\u201310.83), and 61\u201380 AOR 15.74 95% CI: (5.56\u201344.55) were determinants of Podoconiosis.",
    "Conclusion and recommendation": "Barefoot, sex, family history of podoconiosis and age were determinants of Podoconiosis. District health office should encourage at risk populations especially older people and individuals with family history of podoconiosis about shoe wearing practice all the time and not to expose their skin and feet."
