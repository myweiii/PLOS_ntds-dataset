Podoconiosis is a chronic neglected tropical disease that causes swelling in the feet and legs. It can lead to lifelong disabilities and is preventable. This research aimed to identify the factors that contribute to the development of podoconiosis among people in Machakle District East Gojjam Zone Amhara Region Ethiopia. The study found that regularly walking barefoot, having a family history of podoconiosis, being female, and being older were all risk factors for the disease. The findings suggest that promoting the use of shoes, especially among females, should be a priority in healthcare efforts to eliminate podoconiosis in Ethiopia and other similar settings.
