Malaria and dengue are common vector-borne diseases in eastern Sudan. However, co-infections with these two diseases are not reported among febrile patients. Malaria and dengue co-infections need a particular concern because this may increase morbidity and mortality if there are delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. So, this study has investigated the prevalence of malaria and dengue co-infections among febrile patients in Kassala, eastern Sudan. The findings of the study showed the prevalence of malaria and dengue co-infections in the study area according to the gender and age of enrolled patients. Results also showed the severity of clinical symptoms of patients with malaria and dengue co-infections were high compared to mono-infections, and the co-infections were found less among elder people.
