The presence of persons with disabilities in the family can affect a familyâ€™s quality of life. Neglected tropical diseases such as leprosy and podoconiosis can lead to disabilities and have been shown to affect family quality of life. We have selected the Beach Center Family Quality of Life scale to assess the family quality of life of persons affected by leprosy and podoconiosis. However, this scale has not been validated in the Ethiopian context previously. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the cross-cultural validity of the Beach Center Family Quality of Life scale in families with one or more persons affected by leprosy or podoconiosis in Ethiopia.
A total of 302 participants were included in this study. The results show that the scale is adequately reliable and valid in the culture and language of the target country. Based on the findings, the authors recommend the use of this scale among families of persons affected by leprosy or podoconiosis.
