First, we would like to express our gratitude to Gozamin Woreda health officials, for facilitating the selection of data collectors and writing a cooperation letter. We would like to acknowledge those professionals who participated in the translation and back-translation process. We would like to thank Dr Jean Ann Summers, a team member and developer of the original Beach Center Family Quality of Life scale, for evaluating the back-translation. Our acknowledgement goes to all leprosy affected person association leaders of Bichena, Motta, and Shebel Berenta for their cooperation in recruiting, assisting the data collection process in the specified areas. The research team also acknowledges the data collectors and study participants. Our deepest appreciation also goes to the Ethiopian National Association of Persons affected by Leprosy (ENAPAL) staff for facilitating the overall process of data collection, especially Tesfaye Tadesse and Abiy Abate. We would like to thank Jane Strugar Kole≈°nik from Disability Studies in Nederland for her help in editing the English language.
