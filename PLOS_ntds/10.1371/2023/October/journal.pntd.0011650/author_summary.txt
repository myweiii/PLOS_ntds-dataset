Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases and, due to its transmission by infested water, it is particularly linked to the poverty of the populations suffering from it, since most of them do not have easy access to running water. The main activities aimed at interrupting the parasite cycle require community participation and acceptance for their implementation, and for this purpose, being aware of the practical, cultural and social determinants of the disease in a particular population is essential. In this sense, KAP (knowledge, attitudes and practices) surveys may reveal misconceptions or misunderstandings that could represent obstacles to the health empowerment of the population at risk and potential barriers to behaviour changes. This study shows the results of a baseline KAP survey in a region in Angola of high endemicity for urinary schistosomiasis, showing that the populationâ€™s knowledge of the conditioning factors of the disease is intermediate and that poor knowledge and risk practices of caregivers of preschool children can represent a risk factor both for the infection of the children and for the development of the disease and its associated morbidity.
