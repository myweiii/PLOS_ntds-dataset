The standard method of control for intestinal worms, a common public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, is distribution of deworming treatment on a mass scale. These infections are difficult to eliminate as re-infection is common due a combination of people not being treated and high exposure to the parasites through poor access to sanitation and clean water. The Geshiyaro project in Ethiopia has the ambitious goal of breaking the transmission cycle of such infections through treatment in combination with provision of water and sanitation services. The impact of these interventions is being measured using a unique approach, that is, using finger printing to evaluate prevalence of infection with compliance to treatment and access water or sanitation.
