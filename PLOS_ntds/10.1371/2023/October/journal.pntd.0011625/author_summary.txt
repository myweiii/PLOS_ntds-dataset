Asthma, especially atopic asthma, one of the most common chronic, non-communicable diseases in children and adults, which is characterized by variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation. As the rapid rising of allergy and asthma rates, it seriously affects the quality of people’s life. Asthma is a consequence of complex gene-environment interactions with heterogeneity in clinical presentation. Recent years, A leading theory is the “hygiene hypothesis”, which suggests that the decreasing incidence of infections in western countries is the origin of the increasing incidence of allergic diseases. Following this lead, abundant experimental studies have proved that helminth infection can down-regulate host’s immunopathology in allergies. Further, helminth-derived excretory/secretory products (ESPs) have been reported to effectively control allergic inflammation, which have better therapeutic prospects than live parasite infections. Schistosome act as a wide-spread and one of the best illustrated helminths. Present study investigated that ESPs from Schistosoma japonicum eggs (ESP-SJE) could effectively alleviate OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation in a murine model, and nine potential modulatory proteins for Treg induction that might to be vital to inhibit asthmatic inflammation from ESP-SJE were predicated by mass spectrum analysis. The significance of our research is in founding a new way to explore schistosome-derived molecules alleviating asthma, which may allow the development of a model that will greatly enhance our understanding of the interaction between atopic asthma and helminth parasites, further facilitate the discovery of a better candidates to be tested for therapeutic application of asthma, thus pointing out to a possible new therapy for allergic disease or other autoimmune disease.
