India has committed to eliminate two neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) as a public health problem: visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and lymphatic filariasis (LF), both of which are transmitted by vectors and are caused by the parasites Leishmania donovani and Wuchereria bancrofti, respectively. Notably, the majority of L. donovani infections do not lead to a clinical event of VL and asymptomatic infections significantly outnumber the clinical cases. While mixed infections with Leishmania parasites and those causing lymphatic filariasis have been reported, the influence of the immune response triggered by filarial infection on the clinical manifestations and progression of both disorders is not well understood.
The Muzaffarpur-TMRC Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in Bihar is a well-established demographic platform in an area with the highest incidence of L. donovani infections in India which is also co-endemic for lymphatic filariasis. We used both cohort and case-control study designs within the HDSS population to assess the prevalence of filarial infection in blood samples and examine the association between filarial infection and the progression to clinical VL.
Our findings strongly suggest there is an increased risk of progression to clinical VL in individuals with a history of infection with W. bancrofti: in both the study designs, progression to clinical VL was higher among filaria-infected individuals. These results highlight that the co-endemicity of these NTDs necessitates an integrated approach in diagnosis and disease management to ensure elimination targets can be achieved and sustained.
