Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus Lyssavirus. It affects all warm-blooded animals including humans. Canine and human rabies are well documented as endemic in Cameroon, but little is known about this disease in wildlife, in particular among bats, despite their multiple interactions with the inhabitants of North Region of Cameroon. Indeed, bats are hunted, sold and consumed as bush meat by the local populations. We investigated the presence of Lyssavirus in bats and assessed the risk factors of human exposure to bats in the North Region of Cameroon. The study highlights that the rabies virus is present in bats in this area. The population was aware of human and canine rabies, however, the presence of the disease in bats was less known. Based on these findings, investigating bat populations on a large scale, to characterise the rabies virus circulating in the region, as well as educate the local population on the risks factors of rabies transmission from bats to humans and other animals are strongly recommended.
