Snakebite victims in the community continue to seek care from traditional healers for a variety of reasons including cultural influences, socio-economic factors, and the lack of snake antivenom in healthcare facilities among others. Thus, traditional healers play a vital role in the treatment of snakebites. However, one limitation of relying on traditional care is the potential delay or failure of patients to present themselves at hospitals for timely administration of antivenom for those who may require it. We interviewed sixteen traditional healers in Neno, Malawi, to explore their experiences and practices regarding snakebite treatment and prevention. The traditional healers displayed confidence in their treatment methods and offered a comprehensive approach to addressing snakebite cases from diagnosis to medication and follow-up, however, their claims were not scientifically proven. Some traditional healers provided their services free of charge, with some healers requesting payment only when their clients had recovered. Furthermore, traditional healers claimed to possess a snakebite vaccine, and there appeared to be no collaboration or relationship between them and healthcare workers for the management of snakebite cases. We recommend creating spaces for joint learning and collaboration between healthcare workers and traditional healers as they share a common goal of ensuring the recovery of snakebite victims.
