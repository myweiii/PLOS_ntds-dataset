Talaromyces marneffei is an opportunistic fungal infection primarily affecting individuals with impaired immune function, namely those with HIV-infected. Previous studies from Guangxi, China have reported approximately 17% mortality among HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis. Our study reveals a 10.8% readmission rate and a 16.2% mortality rate among HIV/AIDS patients who were exclusively infected with T. marneffei during the first admission. Understanding these key prognostic factors and the timing of intervention are crucial for clinicians to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions. To address this issue, we conducted an extensive 8-year retrospective study involving 12,946 HIV/AIDS patients. Compared to the eight major common opportunistic infections, T. marneffei-infected patients had the lowest readmission rate, yet accounted for the highest mortality rate. Leucopenia and elevated LDL emerged as significant risks for increasing hospital readmissions. Importantly, our study highlights the critical window for intervening in talaromycosis prognosisâ€“the first hospitalization. These findings have major clinical implications, enabling clinicians to implement effective treatments and interventions starting at first hospital admission to improve prognosis in HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei-infected.
