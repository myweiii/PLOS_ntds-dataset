Toxocara canis is a cosmopolitan ascarid nematode of dogs. In humans, following ingestion of eggs, larvae of this parasite cause visceral larva migrans and ocular toxocariasis. Toxocara canis continues to persist in the United States, with a high level of seropositivity observed in people. However, relatively little data is available to describe 1) genetic isolates of the parasite that have been transmitted from dogs to humans or 2) geographically isolated clusters of T. canis that may form taxonomic groups with unique properties. In this study, we collected adult T. canis from dogs in four different states and applied phylogenetic and haplotypic analyses to compare parasite cox1 sequences with those reported globally. Our hypothesis was that we would discover new haplotypes that were unique to the United States. However, our data demonstrated very little geographic clustering of isolates. Instead, maximum likelihood trees and median joining networks supported the conclusion that nearly all haplotypes reported thus far worldwide fell within 5 distinct clades. Analysis of additional genes and parasite traits could reveal distinct clades of T. canis with specific clinical significance such as those predisposed to causing disease in humans.
