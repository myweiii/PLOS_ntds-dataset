The strategy for several neglected tropical diseases is treatment of the whole community, referred to as mass drug administration. Normally these are delivered as separate rounds of treatment for each disease. This creates a burden for both the health workforce and the communities. As part of a larger study conducted in Ethiopia we used interviews and focus groups to explore perceptions and attitudes towards combined mass drug administration among both communities and health workers.
Both community members and health workers appreciated the time and effort saved via combined treatment although some community members were worried about the number of pills that had to be taken. Both health workers and community members said some people declined to take part due to a lack of understanding around the need for a combined drug regimen. Delivery of the drugs house-to-house, which had been adopted as a COVID-19 prevention strategy, was preferred over delivering the treatment at a central point in the community. Overall, our study showed that combined treatment of multiple neglected tropical diseases was acceptable to both communities and health workers.
