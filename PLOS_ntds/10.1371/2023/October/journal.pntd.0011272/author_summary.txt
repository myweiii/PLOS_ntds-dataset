Buruli ulcer (Buruli) incidence is increasing in temperate south eastern Australia. We have yet to develop public health programs to assist people in avoiding Buruli partly because the precise mode of transmission is contentious. Recent research has shown that environmental contamination with M. ulcerans (the cause of Buruli) is widespread in endemic areas as a result of faecal shedding from infected possums that live close to humans, although direct human-possum contact is rare. We investigated the possibility that the skin of humans in endemic areas could become transiently contaminated with M. ulcerans while outdoors. If this were the case then Buruli prevention programs could be developed around skin protection and regular washing/showering. To study this possibility, we developed a sensitive skin swab PCR-assay that we tested using a pigskin laboratory model so we could be confident in our results. We asked volunteers to collect their own skin swabs after spending at least 4 hours outside during the known period of peak Buruli transmission. Fifty seven volunteers returned swab sets for testing. Our results were negative. We did not find evidence that humans in our endemic zone have M. ulcerans contamination on their skin.
