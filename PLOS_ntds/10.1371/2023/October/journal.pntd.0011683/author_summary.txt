Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal disease caused by the bacteria Leptospira. Its signs and symptoms typically appear one to two weeks following infection, range from mild (e.g., fever, headache) to severe (e.g., meningitis). Despite knowledge of risk factors for leptospirosis, there are still significant gaps in knowledge about symptoms, infection routes, and risk. A correct and timely diagnosis of leptospirosis could potentially avoid medical complications or death but is challenging due to non-specific presentation and limited availability of diagnostics. This is particularly difficult in a tropical country where acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses can be caused by many pathogens. One such country is Colombia, where leptospirosis is endemic. In this study, we retrospectively study acute undifferentiated febrile illness in 92 postmortem cases reported as suspected leptospirosis cases through the national leptospirosis surveillance in Colombia, 2016â€“2019. Only a small proportion (27%) of cases were confirmed as leptospirosis; other etiologies including dengue, hepatitis, and yellow fever were found. However, 45.7% of cases were acute undifferentiated febrile illness, underscoring diagnostic limitations common in the tropics, and the need to recognize local pathogens and clinical characteristics to perform early presumptive diagnosis in cases with acute undifferentiated febrile illness.
