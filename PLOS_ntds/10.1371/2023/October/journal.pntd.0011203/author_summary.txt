Usutu virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and has so far been detected in various bird species on the African and European continent. The virus was isolated for the first time near the Usutu River in Swaziland, South Africa in 1959. Around the middle of the 20th century, the virus was introduced to Europe by migratory birds. In Germany, the virus was initially detected in 2010 in mosquitoes and in 2011 in birds and was associated with numerous bird deaths in the following years. To better understand the viral genome, several platforms are available to date to generate whole genome sequences. In this manuscript, a portable real-time sequencer was used to obtain Usutu virus genomes from birds sampled from 2017 to 2021 throughout the country. The subsequent phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that two Usutu virus lineages are prevalent in Germany and distributed nationwide. These two lineages could in turn be divided into two and three subclusters, respectively. It could be demonstrated that the time lag between the detection of the Usutu lineages in birds and the most recent common ancestor is very short, only a few years long, indicating the success of the stringent surveillance efforts in place.
