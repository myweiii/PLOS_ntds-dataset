    "Introduction": "Taiwan introduced a two-dose inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) mouse brain-derived (JE-MB) vaccine into routine childhood immunization in 1968, with booster vaccination implemented in 1974 and 1983. In 2017, JE-MB vaccine was replaced by a two-dose live-attenuated chimeric vaccine (JE-CV). After implementation of JE vaccination programs, JE cases have shifted from children to adults. In this study, we described the JE epidemiology and identify high-risk groups to further inform vaccine policy.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We extracted data from Taiwan’s notifiable disease surveillance database, vital statistics, and employment statistics from 2010 to 2022. Diagnosis of JE was confirmed by JE seroconversion, a four-fold increase in virus-specific antibodies, a positive JE viral nucleic-acid test, or JE virus isolation. From 2010 to 2022, a total of 313 cases of JE were diagnosed, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 0.10 cases per 100,000 person-years and a mortality rate of 0.006 per 100,000 population per year. Among these patients, 64% were male, and the median age was 51 years (range 0–82). Compared with people born in or after 1976 (vaccinated with four doses of JE-MB vaccine or two doses of JE-CV), those born in or before 1962 (unvaccinated) and those born during 1963–1975 (vaccinated with two or three doses of JE-MB vaccine) had a 4.2-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0–5.7) and 5.9-fold (95% CI 4.3–8.1) higher risk of JE, respectively. The relative risk of working in agriculture, forestry, fishing, or animal husbandry, compared to other occupations, was 5.0 (95% CI 3.5–7.0).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In Taiwan, individuals born before 1976 and those employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, or animal husbandry had a higher risk of JE. We recommend JE vaccination for people in these high-risk groups who have not been fully vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination history."
