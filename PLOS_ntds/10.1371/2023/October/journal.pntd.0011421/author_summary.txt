The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is primarily transmitted through infected mosquito bites between animals such as pigs and birds, with humans being the dead-end hosts. JE can lead to death or long-term neurological or psychiatric complications. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against JE. With the implementation of comprehensive immunization programs against JE since 1960s, Taiwan has experienced a significant decline in the incidence and mortality rates of the disease. This retrospective observational cohort study utilized Taiwanâ€™s national databases from 2010 to 2022 to investigate the epidemiology of JE and identify high-risk populations, thereby to inform vaccine policy. A total of 313 JE cases were diagnosed among Taiwanese citizens with an incidence rate of 0.10 cases per 100,000 person-years and a mortality rate of 0.006 per 100,000 population per year, indicating consistently low incidence and mortality rates. Several factors were statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of JE, including male gender, individuals born before 1976, residing outside the northern region, and working in occupations related to agriculture, forestry, fishing, or animal husbandry. To prevent JE, it is recommended to offer vaccination to high-risk populations who have not completed their immunization.
