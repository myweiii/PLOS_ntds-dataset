Bartonella bacilliformis is the causative agent of Carrionâ€™s disease, which affects neglected communities of the South American Andes. The available information about the genomic aspect of B. bacilliformis is limited, and there is no information on the ecological and geographical bases of the divergence of this bacterium. In this study, three genes were sequenced in twenty isolates of B. bacilliformis from Ancash and Cajamarca, Peruvian endemic areas. The collected data suggest a specific subgroup of B. bacilliformis present in the Ancash region, it could therefore be assumed that there is a sub-speciation process in the strains of this endemic zone of Peru. Additionally, our findings show non-synonymous mutations that could trigger the alterations of the activity or structure of the proteins codified by the sequence genes.
