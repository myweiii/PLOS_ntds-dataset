While the Amazon basin grapples with numerous epidemic and endemic infections, remains a lack of comprehensive information concerning the extent and impact of these infections on maternal and neonatal health. In this study, we have established that arboviral infections and urinary tract infections are the primary causes of fever in pregnant women. Notably, we have identified a significant association between these infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and prematurity. To address maternal and fetal infectious morbidity, it is crucial to implement close clinical and biological monitoring, along with providing appropriate treatment for pregnant women experiencing fever. Additionally, given the ongoing emergence of zoonotic diseases and the influence of climate change, which may facilitate the transmission of additional infections, there is an urgent need for the implementation of rapid diagnostic tools and the development of adapted surveillance and treatment strategies.
