Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) infect billions of people and animals worldwide and are mainly treated with a small number of anthelmintic drugs. The threat of drug resistance and the suboptimal nature of some single-drug treatments have prompted greater exploration of combinatorial drug regimens. However, we know very little about how these drugs may interact in exerting their anthelmintic effects or how these interactions are altered in the backdrop of resistance. We used the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to measure drug interactions across a panel of mutant strains that alter potential pathways of drug entry. Mutations in these pathways altered susceptibility to the major anthelmintic classes as measured by animal development. When drugs were administered in pairwise combinations, we observed that some mutations affecting single-drug susceptibility led to shifts in baseline drug antagonism and the appearance of drug synergies. This framework can potentially be translated to investigate drug interactions in amenable parasite species in the future.
