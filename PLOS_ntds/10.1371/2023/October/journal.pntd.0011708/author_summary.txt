Snakebite envenoming it is a health challenge worldwide. In Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, Bothrops snakebites represents the main cause of envenoming by venomous snakes. Every year, at least 20,000 accidents with Bothrops snakes are notified by The Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). However, it is well known that these numbers do not represent reality in many cases, since a significant portion of envenoming patients continue to dispense specialized medical care or are unable to arrive in time at the reference medical centers. Therefore, in our comprehensive study with secondary data made available online by SINAN, we decided to understand the temporal dynamics of Bothrops snakebites over a ten-year period across the five regions of Brazil. According to our results, which evaluated variables such as occurrence, incidence, mortality and lethality, envenoming by Bothrops snakes remains an important neglected public health problem in our country. Currently, the high rates of occurrence and incidence in certain regions are due to socioeconomic problems found in a vast and developing country such as Brazil. Despite this, lethality and mortality rates remain low at all regions of the country, a fact that can be associated with the effectiveness of the Antivenom therapy treatment provided free of charge by The Brazilian National Health System (SUS).
