Infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) bacteria can present as asymptomatic carriage, diarrhoea or invasive disease. Worldwide, invasive NTS disease (iNTS) is more common in Africa, especially among children, and is commonly caused by two serotypes: S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Recent studies suggest that transmission of these serotypes causing iNTS is human to human. Consequently, identifying the age-group and risk factors associated with asymptomatic carriage of NTS would help in controlling its transmission. We randomly sampled healthy children and adults across 3 sites in Kenya with carrying iNTS incidence. We found that carriage is highest among older children and adults, who can be targeted to reduce its transmission. We also found that carriage was highest in Kilifi, the area of low iNTS incidence, it was not associated with known risk factors for iNTS, and majority of the serotypes were neither S. Typhimurium nor S. Enteritidis. These differences between NTS carriage and invasive disease need further investigations to understand the linkages and inform control.
