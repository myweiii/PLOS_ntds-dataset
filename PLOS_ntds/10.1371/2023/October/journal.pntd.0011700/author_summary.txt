This study examined the effect of temperature on dengue in the 61 Provinces of the Philippines. We found that as temperature increases, so does the risk of dengue. However, the increase in the risk of dengue plateaus at 27.5 degrees Celsius, and beyond that temperature the risk decreases. The association between temperature and dengue incidence at high temperatures was stronger among provinces with high population density, less people in urban areas with larger household size, high poverty incidence, higher health spending per capita, and in lower latitudes compared to their counterparts. In particular, results showed that people in the rural areas had higher dengue risk than those in urban areas, which is contrary to expectations that dengue is an urban-dwelling related disease. On another hand, we found that high health spending per capita does not equate to better health outcomes. Efficiency of use of resources may come into play in terms of improving the health outcomes and not just the quantity or amount of the difference in the dengue risk by socio-economic factors highlights the need for a tailor-fit dengue response.
