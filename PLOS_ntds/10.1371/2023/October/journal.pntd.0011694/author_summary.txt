Insects that spread diseases are still a problem in many parts of the world. Monitoring and controlling them can be expensive and time-consuming, but new internet-based methods have shown promise in reducing workload and costs. We developed AlertaChirimacha, an internet-based surveillance system to detect Triatoma infestans, a species of insect that spreads Chagas disease. AlertaChirimacha was tested in Arequipa, Peru, and in the 26 months after it was implemented, it received 206 reports from residents who suspected they had these insects in their homes, 11 were confirmed by our team. AlertaChirimacha detected more infested homes than the traditional methods combined. AlertaChirimacha was also effective in reaching people, getting them to engage, and respond to reports. This approach can improve efforts to control insect-borne diseases in places with limited resources and make it less expensive to eliminate vector-mediated Chagas disease.
