Noma is a rapidly spreading infection of the oral cavity which mainly affects young children. Without early treatment, it can have a high mortality rate. Simple gingivitis is a warning sign for noma, and acute necrotizing gingivitis is the first stage of noma. We aimed to gather evidence on the epidemiology of noma and its association with malnutrition by conducting a prospective observational study enrolling 2346 patients aged 0 to 12 years who were admitted to the Anka General Hospital, Zamfara, northwest Nigeria. Consenting parents/ guardians of participants were interviewed at admission. Patients had anthropometric and oral exams at admission and discharge. Our study showed a small proportion of those admitted to the Anka General Hospital had simple or acute necrotizing gingivitis. Those admitted to the ITFC were more likely to have simple gingivitis. All of those diagnosed with acute necrotizing gingivitis had chronic malnutrition and most had acute malnutrition. The lack of access to and uptake of oral health care indicates a strong need for oral examinations to be included in routine health services. This provision could improve the oral status of the population and decrease the chance of patients developing noma.
