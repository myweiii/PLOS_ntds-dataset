Since the inception of the National Kala-azar Elimination Program (NKEP) in 2005, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases have declined significantly in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has achieved the elimination targets set by the WHO and continuous strides have been enforced by the government and non-government organizations in the present maintenance phase. To sustain the outcomes of the NKEP, move towards a zero-transmission goal and subvert the endgame challenges, an effective surveillance strategy is a primary focus. As part of this strategy, we examined whether using dried blood spots (DBS), rather than whole blood samples as currently recommended, could serve as a minimally invasive sampling technique prior to subsequent diagnostic tests. We determined the accuracy of molecular and serological assays using DBS samples compared with whole blood samples. While using DBS, excellent diagnostic accuracy was observed for serological assays (rK28 ELISA and rK39 ELISA), whereas sensitivity and specificity using molecular assays for DNA detection (qPCR and RPA) declined in comparison to whole blood. Given the low cost and field feasibility of DBS, we believe this simple sample collection technique coupled with serology-based detection of L. donovani meets the requirements for mass surveillance towards detecting residual VL transmission.
