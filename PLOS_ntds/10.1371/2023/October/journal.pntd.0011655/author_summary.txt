Toxoplasmosis is transmitted via food, water, and blood-borne zoonosis caused by an obligate intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). The opportunistic nature and distinct ability of T. gondii to inhabit almost all nucleated cells of any warm-blooded host makes it an important global public and animal health concern. Toxoplasmosis, a major neglected tropical disease, may lead to a devastating disease especially among immunocompromised patients and infants born to infected mothers. The emergence of resistant strains and development of serious side effects of the gold standard treatment, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, deemed as major causes of treatment failure. Besides, these drugs cannot be used during pregnancy because of the deleterious effects on the fetal development. Consequently, the present work focused on utilization of biologically-synthesized iron nanoparticles (INPs) that can cross cell membranes and reach specific targets more easily than multiple drugs. INPs were biosynthesized by an eco-friendly approach under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Orally administered INPs displayed significant antioxidant and antitoxoplasmic activity and afforded high levels of safety in mice. Collectively, the marked therapeutic activity and the safe nature of biosynthesized INPs enable them to serve as a promising nanotherapeutic antitoxoplasmic agents.
