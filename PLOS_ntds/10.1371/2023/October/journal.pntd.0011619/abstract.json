    "Abstract": "In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis on the drug-resistance phenotypic characteristics of a cohort of 325 tuberculosis and characterize by Whole Genome Sequencing 24 isolates from Nigeria belonging to L4, L5 and L6. Our results suggest an alarming rate of drug-resistance of the L4.6.2.2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) lineage and a high diversity of L5. We compiled these new Sequence Read Archives (SRAs) to previously published ones from available Bioprojects run in Nigeria. We performed RAxML phylogenetic reconstructions of larger samples that include public NCBI SRAs from some neighboring countries (Cameroon, Ghana). To confront phylogenetic reconstruction to metadata, we used a new proprietary database named TB-Annotator. We show that L5 genomes in Northern Nigeria belong to new clades as the ones described until now and allow an update of the taxonomy of L5. In addition, we describe the L4.6.2.2 lineage in Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana. We provide computations on the likely divergence time of L4.6.2.2 and suggest a new hypothesis concerning its origin. Finally we provide a short overview on M. bovis diversity in Nigeria. This study constitutes a baseline knowledge on the global genomic diversity, phylogeography and phylodynamics of MTBC in Nigeria, as well as on the natural history of this largely ignored but densely populated country of Africa. These results highlight the need of sequencing additional MTBC genomes in Nigeria and more generally in West-Africa, both for public health and for academic reasons. The likelihood of replacement of L5-L6 by L4.6.2.2 isolates, leave potentially little time to gather historical knowledge informative on the ancient history of tuberculosis in West-Africa."
