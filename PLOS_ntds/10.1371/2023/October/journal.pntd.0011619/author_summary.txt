Nigeria is a rapidly evolving and young country that still suffers from a high-burden of tuberculosis (TB), whether linked to poverty, to HIV co-infection, or to drug-resistant TB. Genomic remains poorly implemented in Nigeria, and previous studies on the genetic diversity of the pathogen agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), studied by targeted genotyping methods has first shown the high prevalence of the L4.6.2, a sublineage of the Euro-American L4 lineage. It also stressed the remaining importance of L5-L6, formerly designated as Mycobacterium africanum, two frequent yet poorly investigated ecotypes. Previous studies also suggested that MDR-TB transmission is alarming in Nigeria. Within a scientific project whose aim is to better analyze the genetic diversity of MTBC in Northern Nigeria and to reconstruct the evolutionary history of L5, we investigate in this article, some phenotypic and genomic characteristics of MTBC isolates obtained in a cohort of 325 TB patient from Northern Nigeria. We show an alarming rate of resistance to rifampin and isoniazid, but few indications of MDR-TB transmission. We gathered and studied a global collection of 495 Whole-genome SRA from Nigeria (n = 116), Cameroon (n = 202) and Ghana (n = 175), that includes 24 new SRAs from Northern Nigeria. The distribution of the various lineages found in these three countries support Nigeria or the border between Nigeria and Cameroon, as being the potential cradle of L4.6.2. We show that the L5 lineage is more diverse than expected and deserves more studies to better understand its evolutionary history, given the current scarcity of published L5-L6 data relatively to the wealth of L2-L4 sequences in the NCBI databases.
