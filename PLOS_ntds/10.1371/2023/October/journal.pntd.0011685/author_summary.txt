Tuberculosis is one of the world’s most deadly disease and is responsible for 4,000 deaths daily. People living in impoverished conditions, especially those who are homeless are among the worst affected. In Brazil, the population of homeless persons is rising. This population is affected by socioeconomic issues such as worst jobs, structural racism, lack of civil rights, limited access to health care service and stigmatization. Our study therefore investigated the reasons why tuberculosis treatments are unsuccessful among homeless people in Brazil in comparison to populations with shelter. We found out that homeless population living in Brazil are twice at risk of having an unsuccessful treatment, compared to those who are with shelter. In addition, we found that homeless population who use illicit drugs and had mental illness were the most affected. Also, the non-implementation of directly observed treatment is a major reason why most patients do not complete their treatment, and a major predictor of death among these homeless populations. Since tuberculosis is a preventable and curable disease and diagnosis and treatment are freely available in the Unified Health System (SUS, Sistema Único de Saúde) of Brazil, it therefore becomes important to understand and address these barriers that have limited the access of homeless populations to existing health services.
