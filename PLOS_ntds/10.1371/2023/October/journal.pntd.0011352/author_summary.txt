Leptospirosis is a tropical infectious disease predominantly affecting the lower socioeconomic groups in Sri Lanka. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in an endemic setting. Hence, it is vital to identify clinical and biochemical parameters that can predict mortality for triaging and for escalation of care. We observed that pulmonary haemorrhage, myocarditis, hemodynamic instability and hepatic dysfunction are frequent complications of leptospirosis in southern Sri Lanka. Additionally, we identified that mortality was associated with the presence of two major complications of leptospirosis: pulmonary haemorrhage and haemodynamic instability. Therefore, early detection of these two complications along with other parameters that predict mortality such as elevated SGOT levels on admission, acute haemoglobin reduction, atrial fibrillation, prolonged shock and need for invasive ventilation would assist to recognise critically ill patients. Within the first week of admission, PH and development of FHF predicted mortality. One-third our population had acute kidney injury in isolation and they had lesser mortality. Other major complications were almost always detected in combination and were associated with a higher mortality. Pulmonary haemorrhage was detected in one-third of patients and the majority warranted intensive care. Other than usual treatment modalities, ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) was used in six patients with critical respiratory failure due to pulmonary haemorrhage, where four survived. Out of the total group of complicated leptospirosis, more than one-third required intensive care treatment and 17% succumbed. Additionally, we mapped the case rates of complicated leptospirosis in Galle district, and observed that severe cases are detected in specific localities. These features are helpful in early detection of severe disease and proactive management for those who are having predictors of mortality.
