Helminth infections are caused by parasitic worms and affect over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Helminth infections and cardiometabolic diseases are both common and overlap with one another in many parts of the world. Studies have separately examined the relationship between helminth infections and various cardiometabolic diseases, but the relationships overall, as well as the impact of treatment of parasitic worms, have not been studied systematically. The authors conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of helminth infections, and treatment of helminth infections, on cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors. Eighty-four total studies were analyzed and included in the final review. People and animals infected with helminths were generally found to have fewer cardiometabolic disease risk factors including better overall cholesterol profiles, less diabetes, and less atherosclerotic heart disease than uninfected study participants. After treatment of helminth infections, participants frequently experienced worsening in those cardiometabolic measurements. There were no consistent effects of helminth infections on blood pressure, high-sensitivity CRP (an inflammatory marker), or other cardiac function. In summary, helminth infections may offer protection against certain cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors. More studies are needed to elucidate the pathways linking helminth infections with cardiometabolic diseases as it may impact how we treat both disease processes in regions where both are prevalent.
