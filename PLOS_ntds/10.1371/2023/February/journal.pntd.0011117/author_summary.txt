Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that is a major challenge to manage because of incidence underreporting, which is caused by the low coverage of health centers in tropical countries and preferences for traditional medicine among snakebite victims. Several mathematical approaches have been used to explain variation in snakebite incidence via parameter adjustment, but these approximations have not been used to estimate envenomings that are not reported to medical centers. Our study proposes a statistical framework to estimate snakebite underreporting. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that provides computational estimates of the number of snakebite cases that are not receiving treatment by health care facilities; this approach is more time and labor-efficient compared with field epidemiological studies. Our modelling scheme can be used to rapidly estimate spatial heterogeneity in snakebite underreporting and identify areas where increased accessibility to health care facilities is urgently needed. Our framework can also be used to determine the expected number of snakebite cases, promote community empowerment and public health, and determine the real demand for antivenom. This tool could also be applied in various countries, but it is worth emphasizing that it should not serve as a replacement for medical surveillance system.
