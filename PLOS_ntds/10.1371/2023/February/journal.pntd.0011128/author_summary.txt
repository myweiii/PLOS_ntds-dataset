As untreated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is fatal, reliable diagnostics are important for accurate treatment allocation. The current diagnostic algorithm for VL in Ethiopia, which is based on the rK39 rapid diagnostic test and microscopy of tissue smears, lacks sensitivity. This probably leads to missed cases and patients not receiving treatment. To prove this, we conducted a study on stored microscopically negative spleen and bone marrow aspirate smears from suspected VL patients in Gondar, Ethiopia. Clinical and treatment data were collected and samples were tested for Leishmania by PCR. We found that about 60% of these microscopically negative samples were PCR positive. This PCR positivity rate was considerably higher in patients with a microscopically negative bone marrow compared to splenic aspirate. Importantly, more than three quarters of the patients with a PCR positive sample was not treated for VL. Overall, our study demonstrates the gap in the diagnostic algorithm for VL in northern Ethiopia, especially when bone marrow samples are used. In resource limited settings, we advise to challenge the current diagnostic algorithm and implement molecular tools to accurately diagnose patients. This could lead to considerable improvements in patient management in Ethiopia and beyond.
