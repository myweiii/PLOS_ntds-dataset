Frequent enteric infections in children may be an important cause of growth faltering. Mechanisms by which pathogen infections result in poorer growth, however, are not fully understood. Commonly used biomarkers provide information on broad immunological processes but not on non-immune processes (e.g., gut integrity) that may be important indicators of overall health. In this manuscript we explore how additional biomarkers can expand our understanding on which immune and non-immune pathways are impacted by pathogen exposure. To do this we developed a panel consisting of 3 commonly used and 4 novel biomarkers. We analyzed stool samples from infants living in informal settlements in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. To test how this expanded biomarker panel captures distinct pathological processes we used two scoring systems and examined their association with stool pathogen gene counts. We found that Shigella and enteropathogenic E. Coli (EPEC) were positively associated in inflammation, while the integrity of intestinal tissue was negatively associated with Shigella, EPEC and shigatoxigenic E.coli (STEC) infection. Our biomarker panel holds promise as a tool to measure both immune and non-immune outcomes of pathogen infection.
