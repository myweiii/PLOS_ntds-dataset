In this systematic review, we made an exhaustive search of published literature that reported outbreaks or etiological surveillance of HAdV among ARTI patients in China from 2009 to 2020. A total of 950 studies were included in this study, and we explored the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of the infection of various HAdV types. Positive detection rates of HAdV-3 (32.73%) and HAdV-7 (27.48%) were significantly higher than other virus types according to the hospital-based etiological surveillance studies. Nearly half (45.71%) of outbreaks were caused by HAdV-7 with an overall attack rate of 22.32% among the 70 outbreaks for which the HAdVs were typed by the meta-analysis. Military camp and school were main outbreak settings with significantly different seasonal pattern and attack rate, where HAdV-55 and HAdV-7 were identified as the leading type, respectively. Clinical manifestations mainly depended on the HAdV types and patientâ€™s age. HAdV-55 infection tends to develop into pneumonia with poorer prognosis, especially in children <5 years old. This study will help improve the epidemiological and clinical understanding of different HAdV types of human infections and thus will promote the targeted surveillance and measures to control and prevent HAdV infection.
