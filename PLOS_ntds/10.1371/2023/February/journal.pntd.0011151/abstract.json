    "Background": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a major pathogen that causes acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) and is frequently associated with outbreaks. The HAdV prevalence and the predominant types responsible for ARTI outbreaks remains obscure in China.",
    "Methods": "A systematic review was performed to retrieve literature that reported outbreaks or etiological surveillance of HAdV among ARTI patients in China from 2009 to 2020. Patient information was extracted from the literature to explore the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of the infection of various HAdV types. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022303015.",
    "Results": "A total of 950 articles (91 about outbreaks and 859 about etiological surveillance) meeting the selection criteria were included. Predominant HAdV types from etiological surveillance studies differed from those in outbreak events. Among 859 hospital-based etiological surveillance studies, positive detection rates of HAdV-3 (32.73%) and HAdV-7 (27.48%) were significantly higher than other virus types. While nearly half (45.71%) of outbreaks were caused by HAdV-7 with an overall attack rate of 22.32% among the 70 outbreaks for which the HAdVs were typed by the meta-analysis. Military camp and school were main outbreak settings with significantly different seasonal pattern and attack rate, where HAdV-55 and HAdV-7 were identified as the leading type, respectively. Clinical manifestations mainly depended on the HAdV types and patientâ€™s age. HAdV-55 infection tends to develop into pneumonia with poorer prognosis, especially in children <5 years old.",
    "Conclusions": "This study improves the understanding of epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV infections and outbreaks with different virus types, and helps to inform future surveillance and control efforts in different settings."
