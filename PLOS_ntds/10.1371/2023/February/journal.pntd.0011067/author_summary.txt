Melioidosis is a disease caused by the soil-dwelling bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Tier 1 Select Agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the ability to naturally infect humans and non-human primates (NHP). Although melioidosis diagnosis in humans has been formally outlined, there is no standardized test available for B. pseudomallei exposure and melioidosis in NHP. NHP are important animal models in melioidosis research in addition to other scientific research. The goal of this study was to formally evaluate the first extensive serodiagnostic test for detection of B. pseudomallei exposure in NHP. The BurkPx assay comprised 21 B. pseudomallei specific antigens and was previously standardized in humans. Early IgM antibody responses were noted to carbohydrates whilst IgG antibody responses were mounted to multiple proteins during the second week of infection. The assay elicited low background reactivity to B. pseudomallei-naive NHP. Data collected from the BurkPx assay was fed into a multiple antigen model, which produced a  score used to classify the assay via thresholding. The final model produced a 100% specificity and 63.48% sensitivity among all samples; however, removal of early infection samples increased sensitivity to 95%.
