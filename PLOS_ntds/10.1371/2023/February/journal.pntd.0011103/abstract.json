    "Background": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. To reduce transmission, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) improvements are promoted through a comprehensive public health strategy. Evidence supporting the role of WaSH in trachoma elimination is mixed and it remains unknown what WaSH coverages are needed to effectively reduce transmission.",
    "Methods/Findings": "We used g-computation to estimate the impact on the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation—follicular among children aged 1–9 years (TF1-9) when hypothetical WaSH interventions raised the minimum coverages from 5% to 100% for “nearby” face-washing water (<30 minutes roundtrip collection time) and adult latrine use in an evaluation unit (EU). For each scenario, we estimated the generalized prevalence difference as the TF1-9 prevalence under the intervention scenarios minus the observed prevalence. Data from 574 cross-sectional surveys conducted in 16 African and Eastern Mediterranean countries were included. Surveys were conducted from 2015–2019 with support from the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and Tropical Data.",
    "Conclusions": "Our results support Sustainable Development Goal 6 and provide insight into potential WaSH-related coverage targets for trachoma elimination. Targets can be tested in future trials to improve evidence-based WaSH guidance for trachoma."
