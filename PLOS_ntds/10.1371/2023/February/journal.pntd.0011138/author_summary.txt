Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a sequel of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and occurs in VL endemic areas. PKDL patients can be a reservoir for Leishmania donovani parasites and thus sustaining the occurrence of VL. Since Bangladesh, India and Nepal have targeted the elimination of VL, it is important to eliminate PKDL as well. However, in Nepal there is no active case detection of PKDL and the real burden of PKDL is not known. This community based survey encountered a PKDL prevalence of 2.23 per 10,000 population. PKDL patients had limited knowledge of VL and PKDL. They suffered to some degree from social and psychological stigma. Therefore, PKDL case detection and management should be strengthened in the national programme in the context of the VL elimination initiative.
