Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae. Cholera continues to severely threaten the health of the impoverished and vulnerable populations in the endemic regions. The present laboratory-based cholera detection methods take time and require well-equipped facilities and well-trained staff that are often not available in the resource-poor settings. The available rapid diagnostic tests have a wide range of sensitivity and specificity. A rapid, simple, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic for cholera is required, which would identify cholera cases early on in outbreaks to facilitate a rapid response and provide reliable surveillance data. We developed a simple, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic assay, "Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test (RLDT)," to detect cholera in low-resource settings. Using RLDT, cholera could be detected directly from stool, dried stool on filter paper, and environmental water in less than one hour with minimum hands-on time. The RLDT assay does not require maintaining a cold chain and is electricity-free, facilitating point-of-care testing. The RLDT assay is sensitive, simple to use, and can be scaled up for rapid detection of cholera and surveillance in low-resource endemic settings.
