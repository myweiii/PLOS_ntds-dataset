Numerous studies have shown the effects of mosquito saliva proteins on the immune system of animals and humans with disease caused by mosquito-borne pathogens. We have previously described some of these effects in humanized mice (which contain specific human immune system cells and develop arboviral diseases similar to humans) infected by mosquito bite with dengue and chikungunya viruses. In this study, we show that humanized mice have altered cellular immune responses after they are bitten by uninfected mosquitoes lacking the sialokinin salivary protein. Our results suggest that sialokinin alone shifts mammalian immunity towards a TH2 response, away from the anti-viral, cell-mediated, and humoral responses that would protect against viruses included in the saliva. This is the first study of its kind, and it highlights how the effects of specific saliva components can be evaluated for human therapeutic intervention.
