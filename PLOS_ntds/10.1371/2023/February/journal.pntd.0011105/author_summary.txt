To be the most successful parasite worldwide, Toxoplasma gondii develops fascinating ways to coexist with its host and fulfil its life cycle. After infection with T. gondii, the survival time of mice is short, while human beings can coexist with T. gondii for lifetime. Remarkably, in this study we found that a short peptide from T. gondii microneme protein MIC3, which was known to be the circulating antigen after T. gondii infection, was sufficient to trigger the TLR11/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and induced macrophage TNF-α production, NF-κB phosphorylation, iNOS transcription and Ly6C expression in mouse macrophages. Human macrophages lacking TLR11 failed to induce such inflammatory reaction in response to MIC3. Therefore, we speculate that the TLR11-driven deleterious inflammatory immune responses impede the long-term coexistence of host and T. gondii, which might provide the evolutionary pressures for TLR11 expression. Additionally, the amino acid sequence, simulated tertiary structure and triggered immune responses of MIC3 are completely different from the well-known TLR11 ligand profilin. All together, these findings propose MIC3 as a potential different ligand from profilin, and what we learn about MIC3 and TLR11 provides important insights into the evolutionary roles of T. gondii and other TLR11 sensing pathogens.
