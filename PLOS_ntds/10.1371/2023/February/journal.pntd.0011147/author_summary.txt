Rabies results in tens of thousands of human deaths and tens of millions of exposures every year. Human rabies mediated by dogs is targeted for elimination by 2030. However, poor quality data hinder advocacy and resource allocation for effective prevention and control. We used a novel Bayesian approach incorporating domain expertise and realistic uncertainty to guide multiple imputations for missing data and understand factors associated with human rabies deaths among self-reported victims of dog bite in Abuja, Nigeria. Over 20 years, we observed low reporting across 19 major hospitals in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The probability of rabies deaths after a dog bite was predicted to decrease after bites by owned dogs compared to free-roaming dogs. Similarly, there was a predicted decrease in the probability of human rabies death among victims bitten by vaccinated dogs compared to unvaccinated dogs. The odds for the risk of human rabies death after bitten individuals received human rabies vaccination were predicted to decrease compared to those without vaccination. Our analysis has shown how to approach missing rabies data objectively and transparently, which is valuable for gaining inference using real-world data. Our modelling approach will be helpful for future applied research in Nigeria and low and medium-income countries with similar challenges. The low reporting noted in this study underscores the need to improve rabies surveillance in Nigeria to understand the disease burden for effective prevention and control.
