    "Background": "Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic tick-borne disease with an increasing number of outbreaks among communities in Uganda. Following the disease outbreak in the western district of Kagadi on 20th February 2020, a KAP survey was conducted to identify knowledge gaps and at-risk behaviors related to the disease among livestock value chain actors.",
    "Methods": "A household survey using a semi-structured questionnaire was conducted in 399 households in the two sub counties of Bwikara and Ruteete, Kagadi district. A focus group discussion with members of the community was conducted as well as key informant interviews with at-risk individuals.",
    "Results": "Although majority of the respondents believed in the existence of the disease, only 12.8% had knowledge of prevention measures against CCHF. 67.2% of the respondents reported regular interaction with ticks during routine farm operations and they employed tick control measures on their farms. Although the respondents believe the disease is fatal, almost all of them (99%) would welcome a CCHF survivor back into the community. 95.2% of the respondents actively attended to animals but only 25.8% participated in slaughtering animals.",
    "Conclusion": "Knowledge on CCHF among majority of the respondents was poor. There is a need for educational programs to increase awareness of CCHF in communities. This awareness should be done by both the community leaders and technical people to ensure the community receives enough knowledge on how to prevent and control the disease. To ensure effectiveness of these programs a One health approach should be adopted to implement prevention and control strategies."
