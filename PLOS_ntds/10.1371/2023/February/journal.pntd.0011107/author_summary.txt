Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever causes widespread outbreaks in areas where the principal tick vector is found. In Uganda, several outbreaks have been reported in recent years and this is attributed to silent circulation of the causative agent in ticks and animals which later spills to humans. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for the disease and the only available treatment option is primarily supportive. Data to inform design of interventions that can prevent the emergence and spread of the disease in high-risk areas is limited. We, therefore, decided to investigate, knowledge, attitudes, practices and risk of the disease in Kagadi district where an outbreak was confirmed in 2020. We found low levels of knowledge on how to prevent the disease although most people in this area participated in activities that put them at a risk of contracting the disease. Funding to support prevention and control of the disease in communities is limited. Additionally, there was poor multi-disciplinary coordination during response to the disease outbreak. This study, therefore, recommends an educational program to sensitize communities on the disease using a multi-disciplinary approach where all related sectors are involved in prevention and control activities.
