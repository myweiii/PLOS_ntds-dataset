Three epidemiologically significant food-borne trematodes (Opisthorchis felineus, O. viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) affect the hepatobiliary system of mammals, including humans, inducing cholangitis, bile duct neoplasia, and even cholangiocarcinoma among chronically infected individuals. Two species, O. viverrini and C. sinensis are both recognized 1A group of biological carcinogens to human, whereas O. felineus is classified as a noncarcinogen. The impact of microbiota in the differences in morbidity for these three infections is not clear due to the absence of comparative studies conducted within the same experimental setting.
Here we examined the microbes of liver flukes C. sinensis (South Korea), O. viverrini (Thailand) and O. felineus (Russia) as well as that in the bile and feces of hamsters that were infected with these three species of worms.
The liver flukes (O. felineus, O. viverrini, and C. sinensis) contain their own unique bacteria and contribute to significant species-specific alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota of the mammalian host. O. viverrini, a fluke with the most pronounced carcinogenic potential, has the strongest impact on the bile microbiome. O. felineus has the smallest consequences both in bile and feces microbiome. Our data can lead to the development of more effective species-specific modalities for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
