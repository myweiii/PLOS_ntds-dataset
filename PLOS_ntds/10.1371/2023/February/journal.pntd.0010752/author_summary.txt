Human schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by members of the trematode genus Schistosoma. Every schistosome species is dependent on a particular species, or array of species, of intermediate gastropod host(s) for their transmission. In the Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya, two related schistosome species (Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis) utilize multiple species within the genus Bulinus as intermediate hosts. Discerning which bulinid species vector S. haematobium or S. bovis, or both, and identifying the habitats for each, is critical to understanding local transmission patterns. Closely related bulinids cannot be confidently distinguished using morphological criteria so this study used DNA sequence-based methods to identify local bulinid species and to identify schistosomes shed from infected snails. We implicate two bulinid species in the transmission of S. haematobium and four species in the transmission of S. bovis. Both S. haematobium associated species were found exclusively in streams and dams in the Lake Victoria Basin thereby seemingly keeping the shores of Lake Victoria largely free of S. haematobium transmission. Further study as to why some species like B. globosus are susceptible to S. haematobium whereas other close relatives like B. ugandae are apparently refractory may reveal underlying resistance factors potentially useful for control programs.
