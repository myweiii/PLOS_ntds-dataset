Melioidosis has a wide diversity of symptoms, making laboratory diagnosis essential. The diagnosis of melioidosis is primarily by culture of the causative bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is problematic for locations with limited laboratory resources and for laboratories inexperienced in handling B. pseudomallei. Early diagnosis of melioidosis facilitates the specific antimicrobial therapy that optimizes outcomes and substantially lowers mortality. We have developed and evaluated a multiple antigen-antibody serology assay using serial samples from culture confirmed melioidosis patients including the first sample after patient admission, together with non-melioidosis serum controls. Multiantigen reactivity was compared to single antigens and to the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) antibody assay data collected from routine patient testing. The results from testing patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis suggest that using multiple individual antigen assays coupled with models can improve the sensitivity and specificity of serological diagnosis using the same antigens evaluated individually. In addition, all evaluated antigens may not be needed to improve assay performance. Further antigen down selection and evaluation of the utility of this assay is now required in both melioidosis-endemic and non-endemic settings.
