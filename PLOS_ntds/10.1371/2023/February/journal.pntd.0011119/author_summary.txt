Trichinellosis is a zoonosis caused by consuming raw meat containing infective larvae of genus Trichinella nematodes. Trichinellosis patients can be found globally, and severe cases may die from myocarditis and heart failure. Currently, information on the molecular mechanisms of trichinellosis and precise biomarkers for the infection are scarce. To improve disease diagnosis and treatment, better understanding in these areas is required. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate impacts of Trichinella infection on the host body and identify potential biomarkers with metabolomics, a holistic approach to studying global compound changes in organisms. Our study used a mouse model of trichinellosis, and sera were collected before and three timepoints after infection and explored for metabolomic data. Trichinella infection affected the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway within the host body, and glycerophospholipid species were highlighted as potential biomarkers of the disease. Lipid molecules have never been proposed as markers of trichinellosis before; hence, the development of biomarkers based on findings of our study could be a novel approach to improve disease diagnosis in the future.
