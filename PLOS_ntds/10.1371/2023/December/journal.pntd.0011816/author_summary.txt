Trichinosis is a severe zoonotic disease that affects humans by eating raw or semi-raw meat products containing T. spiralis larvae. The intestinal mucosal barrier is the initial defense against T. spiralis infection and the main point of contact between the host and the parasite. Beyond the mechanical action, the protease released by the worm are essential for T. spiralis invasion of the host small intestine. Cathepsins play a crucial role in the migration of Fasciola hepatica and the invasion of Schistosoma japonicum, essential for their parasitism in the host. Nevertheless, the specific functions of T. spiralis cathepsin L during the wormâ€™s invasion of the intestinal mucosa remain unexplored. In this study, the TsCatL gene was silenced using siRNA, which inhibited worm invasion of Caco-2 cells, impaired worm development, and decreased female fertility. Incubation of rTsCatL2 with Caco-2 cells resulted in the translocation of cell tight junction proteins (claudin 1, occludin and zo-1), adhesion junction protein (e-cadherin) and extracellular matrix protein (laminin) into the cytoplasm or the nucleus, a reduction in claudin 1 expression and cellular autophagy, leading to disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. This study provides a novel target for developing anti-trichinosis vaccines and drugs.
