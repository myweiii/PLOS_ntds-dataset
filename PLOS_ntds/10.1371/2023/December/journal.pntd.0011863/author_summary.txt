The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced to the Americas in 2013, causing large outbreaks that rapidly affected a substantial portion of the population in several countries. The virus was first detected in Brazil in 2014 and has since spread across the country. However, prospective studies have not been performed to investigate the force of CHIKV transmission shortly after its introduction in Brazil. To fill this gap, we followed 652 participants through a series of six semi-annual serological surveys from Feb/2014 to Feb/2017 in Salvador, Brazil, a city that has been an epicenter of several Aedes aegypti-transmitted arbovirus epidemics. As the study started before the detection of CHIKV in Brazil, we were able to estimate the proportion of participants who became infected between each of the surveys by detecting the appearance of CHIKV IgG antibodies. We found that CHIKV transmission was higher between Feb-Apr/2015 and Aug-Nov/2015, when 10.7% of the participants were infected. Transmission was largely focal in space. However, unlike in other American countries, the transmission was limited, with >85% of the participants still susceptible to infection ~1.5 years later. Given the difference in the speed of CHIKV spread among countries, further studies should investigate which factors influence the intensity of CHIKV transmission, aiming to guide prevention and control strategies for coping with future outbreaks.
