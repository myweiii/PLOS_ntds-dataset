Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness, due to repeated bacterial infection of the eye. The early and contagious stage of the disease, known as active trachoma, predominantly affects children. The impact of the disease includes permanent visual impairment, dependency and stigma.
The WHO targeted to eliminate trachoma by 2030 as a public health concern in each endemic country. Through the implementation of the SAFE strategy (surgery to treat the blinding stage; antibiotics to clear infection; environmental improvement; improving access to water and sanitation).
In Ethiopia majority of the districts are still trachoma endemic. Thus, this study assessed the prevalence and factors associated with active trachoma among school-aged children in Southwest Ethiopian Peoples Regional State. The region is highly endemic for several neglected tropical diseases including trachoma.
In this study 44.1% of the participant had active trachoma. Also, age groups 6–10, being female, improved water sources, and sanitation, presence of flies in the house and on the child’s face, ocular and nasal discharge, unclean faces were factors associated with the occurrence of active trachoma.
Intensive scaling up of the facial cleanness and environmental improvement components of the SAFE strategy helps reduce the high prevalence of active trachoma.
