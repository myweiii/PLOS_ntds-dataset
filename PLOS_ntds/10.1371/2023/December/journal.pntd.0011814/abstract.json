    "Background": "The escalating risk and contemporary occurrences of arbovirus infections prompt a critical inquiry into the ability of nations to execute efficient surveillance systems capable to detect, prevent and respond to arbovirus outbreaks. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the major actors in the surveillance of infectious diseases with epidemic potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of HCWs regarding arboviruses in the public health facilities of Conakry, Guinea.",
    "Methods": "A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the from December 27, 2022, to January 31, 2023, encompassing from public health facilities in Conakry. The data collection process encompassed various aspects, including the characteristics of health facilities, socio-demographic and professional attributes of HCWs, the information received concerning arboviruses and the sources of information, as well as a series of inquiries designed to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions. Subsequently, scores were computed for knowledge, attitude and perception. To identify the factors influencing the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of HCWs regarding arboviruses, Decision Tree and Inference Conditional Tree models were used.",
    "Results": "A total of 352 HCWs participated in the study, comprising 219 from national hospitals, 72 from municipal hospitals and 61 from primary health centers. More than half of the respondents (54.3%) had never received information on arboviruses. Only 1% of the respondents had good knowledge about arboviruses, 95.7% had a negative attitude about arboviruses. Moreover, nearly 60% of the respondents had a moderate perception and 24.1% had a good perception. The analysis revealed significant associations between the knowledge and attitudes of respondents concerning arboviruses and their years of professional experience and age.",
    "Conclusion": "This study highlights the imperative requirement for comprehensive training targeting HCWs to enhance their capacity for early case detection within healthcare facilities. Additionally, there is a crucial need for analogous studies adopting a mixed-methods approach across all healthcare regions in Guinea."
