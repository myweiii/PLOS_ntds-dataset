Chagas disease is a neglected parasitic disease prevalent throughout the Americas, with approximately seven million people infected. The highest infection rates have been identified in Bolivia. There, we followed for five years a cohort of chronically T. cruzi-infected patients attending the Platform for Integral Care of Chagas disease Patients in Cochabamba. With the aim to understand clinical and serological responses after completing treatment with benznidazole, we recorded clinical symptomatology and collected serum samples to run two ELISAs based on total and recombinant antigens in each yearly follow-up visit. Upon analyzing clinical and serological data, we found there were no major changes in the patientsÂ´ clinical status while serological reactivity generally declined until the third year of follow-up, particularly with the total antigen test. Remarkably, only one participant met the cure criterion of negative serological reversion for both ELISAs at the final visit. Our findings confirm that, using currently available tools, the appropriate time to address treatment efficacy is longer than five years. Additional studies are needed to find biomarkers for the early assessment of treatment efficacy.
