Microsporidia are a large group of parasites which infect both humans and agriculturally important animals such as honey bees and shrimp. These parasites pose a threat to health and food security and there are few therapeutic options available to treat them. To identify compounds that could inhibit microsporidia, we took advantage of the roundworm model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, and the microsporidia Nematocida parisii which naturally infects this worm. We then used this system to screen the Pandemic Response Box, which is a collection of compounds with activity towards pathogens. We identified four compounds which could inhibit microsporidia, and found that these compounds worked by either inactivating microsporidia spores, preventing microsporidia germination, or hindering the growth of the parasite. Together this work provides compounds that could be used to study microsporidia infection and that could be a starting point for the development of drugs against these parasites.
