Giardia intestinalis, a globally significant microbial pathogen, displays taxonomic diversity, with at least eight sub-types (assemblages A-H) capable of infecting various hosts, including humans. This study examined 89 Canadian genomes of assemblage A and B G. intestinalis to explore vesicle formation and cargo transport machinery using comparative genomics. We found considerable variability in the molecular components of endolysosomal ESCRT protein machinery, adaptor coat protein complexes, and the ARF regulatory system. Notably, differences existed between assemblages A and B but not within the same assemblage in the examined trafficking systems, including the loss of ESCRTIII subunits and lineage-specific duplications in COPII machinery, ARF1, and ARFGEF families. These findings could have clinical and taxonomic implications, as the membrane trafficking system is critical for parasite survival, pathogenesis, and propagation.
