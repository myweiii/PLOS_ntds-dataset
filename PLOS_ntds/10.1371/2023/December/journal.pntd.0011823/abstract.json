    "Background": "Burkholderia pseudomallei possesses a diverse set of genes which encode a vast array of biological functions reflecting its clinical, ecological and phenotypic diversity. Strain variation is linked to geographic location as well as pattern of land uses. This soil-dwelling Gram-negative pathogen causes melioidosis, a tropical disease endemic in northern Australia and Southeast Asian regions including Bangladesh. Phylogeographic analyses of B. pseudomallei isolates by molecular typing techniques could be used to examine the diversity of this organism as well as to track melioidosis epidemics.",
    "Methods": "In this study, 22 B. pseudomallei isolates, of which 20 clinical and two soil isolates were analyzed, utilizing Real-time PCR assay and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The sequences were then submitted to PubMLST database for analysis and construction of phylogenetic tree.",
    "Findings": "A total of 12 different sequence types (STs) that includes four novel STs were identified for the first time. Strains having STs 1005, 1007 and 56 were the most widespread STs frequently isolated in Bangladesh. ST 1005, ST 56, ST 1007 and ST 211 have been detected not only in Bangladesh but are also present in many Southeast Asian countries.",
    "Significance": "ST 1005 was detected in both soil and clinical samples of Gazipur. Most prevalent, ST 56 has been previously reported from Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, confirming the persistence of the genotype over the entire continent. Further large-scale study is necessary to find out the magnitude of the infection and its different reservoirs in the environment along with phylogeographic association."
