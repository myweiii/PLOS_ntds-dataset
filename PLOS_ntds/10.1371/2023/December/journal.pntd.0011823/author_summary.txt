Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a disease of various manifestations and poor outcome, if not diagnosed and treated early. The first case of melioidosis is believed to be identified from Bangladesh as early as 1960, although the persistence of the causative organism was discovered in soil about 50 years later, in 2012. The study utilized 20 B. pseudomallei isolated from clinical samples and 2 from soil samples. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was conducted with all 22 isolates and the sequence types analyzed and compared with B. pseudomallei sequence types previously detected from other countries. Four novel sequence types (STs) were detected in our study. Out of 12 different STs determined, STs 1005, 1007 and 56 were the commonest sequence types identified in Bangladesh. ST 1005 was found in both clinical and soil samples. ST 56 was isolated from five septicemic patients. The study revealed the sequence types of B. pseudomallei isolated from Bangladesh and their genetic relatedness with sequence types of other regions. We further showed that the sequence types of Bangladesh share more genetic similarities with the isolates of Southeast Asian isolates rather than South Asian isolates.
