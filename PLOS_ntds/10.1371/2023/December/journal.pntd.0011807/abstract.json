    "Background": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has become a significant public health issue in Jinan City. However, the analysis of epidemiological characteristics and spatio-temporal clustering of SFTS in Jinan has not been studied yet.",
    "Methods": "SFTS data from 2018\u22122022 in Jinan City were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed using ArcGIS 10.2 software, and spatiotemporal hotspot area detection was carried out using SatScan 9.6 software.",
    "Results": "Between 2018 and 2022, 680 SFTS cases were reported in Jinan City, resulting in 53 deaths and an average case fatality rate of 7.8%. 99.0% of cases occurred between April and October, 91.9% individuals were over 50 years old, and 87.79% were primarily farmers. A positive spatial correlation of SFTS in Jinan was observed (Moran\u2019s I value between 0.135\u22120.197, P<0.001), indicating spatial aggregation, primarily in Licheng, Zhangqiu, Laiwu, and Gangcheng districts in southeastern Jinan. Spatiotemporal scanning detected one class I and two class II aggregation areas, with the class I aggregation area (RR = 5.66, LLR = 192.547, P<0.001) locating in southeastern Jinan City, comprising 31 towns/streets, and an aggregation time from 13 May 2020 to 13 October 2022.",
    "Conclusion": "Spatial and temporal aggregation of SFTS is evident in Jinan. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution and epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures such as public education, monitoring, and training should target key populations in high-incidence epidemic areas."
