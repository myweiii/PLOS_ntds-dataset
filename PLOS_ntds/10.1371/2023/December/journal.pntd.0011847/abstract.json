    "Background": "Chagas disease, endemic in Latin America and spreading globally due to emigration, has a significant health burden, particularly in relation to chagasic heart failure (HF). Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCM) is characterized by chronic inflammatory myocardial disease. This study aimed to identify inflammatory parameters and biomarkers that could aid in the management of patients with chagasic HF.",
    "Methods and findings": "A cohort study was conducted at a tertiary cardiology single-center over a mean follow-up period of 2.4 years. The study included patients with HF secondary to CCM enrolled between October 2013 and July 2017. Various clinical parameters, echocardiography findings, parasitemia status, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin T (TnT) levels, and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, adiponectin, and IFN-γ) were assessed. The study encompassed a cohort of 103 patients, with a median age of 53 years and 70% being male. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 28%, with 40% of patients classified as NYHA II functional class. The median BNP level was 291 pg/ml. The observed mortality rate during the study period was 38.8%. Predictors of lower survival were identified as elevated levels of BNP, TnT, reduced LVEF, and increased adiponectin (thresholds: BNP > 309 pg/ml, TnT > 27.5 ng/ml, LVEF < 25.5%, adiponectin > 38 μg/mL). Notably, there was no evidence indicating a relationship between parasitemia and the inflammatory parameters with lower survival in these patients, including INF-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL12-(p70), and IL17a.",
    "Conclusion": "Despite the presence of a chronic inflammatory process, the evaluated inflammatory biomarkers in this cohort were not predictive of survival in patients with chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, reduced LVEF, elevated BNP, adiponectin levels, and troponin T were identified as predictors of lower survival in these patients."
