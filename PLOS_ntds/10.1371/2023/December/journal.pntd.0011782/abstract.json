    "Introduction": "Act to End NTDs | West, a USAID-funded program that supports national governments to eliminate or control five neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in West Africa including trachoma, lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, conducted a gender and social inclusion analysis to determine how NTDs differentially impact various populations and how gender and social norms impact NTD programs to inform future programming.",
    "Methods": "The study used a mixed methods approach including a literature review; primary qualitative data collection; and monitoring data in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Ghana.",
    "Results": "Women and girls face additional health risks from many NTDs compared to men and boys. In addition to differential health burden, the social and economic impacts of NTD-related disability or infertility can be particularly dire for women and girls.",
    "Discussion": "Programs to address NTDs can promote equity and improve programming by increasing women\u2019s participation as CDDs and providing financial compensation. Additionally, programs should prioritize inclusive training for CDDs, and inclusive messaging about MDA for communities."
