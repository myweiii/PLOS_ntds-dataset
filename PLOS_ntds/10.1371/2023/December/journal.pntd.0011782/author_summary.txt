The Act to End NTDs | West program supports USAID’s efforts to control or eliminate trachoma, lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in 11 West African countries using mass drug administration.Act | West conducted a gender and social inclusion analysis to inform a strategy for the program to improve outcomes and more meaningfully engage and empower women and marginalized individuals in program implementation. Our objective was to identify how gender and social norms and stigma differentially impact men’s and women’s adoption of healthy practices around NTD prevention, use of NTD services, participation in programing, and opportunities to engage in identifying solutions, using an intersectional lens inclusive of disability, ethnic identity, and geographic location.
Several studies have looked at gender dimensions of staffing for NTD programming, analyzed differential risk factors and prevalence of NTDs between males and females, or presented data on gender and national mass drug administration (MDA) coverage to combat NTDs. This paper aims to consolidate these findings through a literature review as well as a qualitative study conducted in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, to provide a comprehensive look at gender and social inclusion within NTD programming across various contexts and diseases.
This study found that women and girls face additional health risks from five NTDs compared to men and boys. In addition to the health burden, the social and economic impacts of NTD-related disability or infertility can be particularly severe for women and girls.
Additionally, men were somewhat less likely to participate in mass drug administration (MDAs) and pregnant and breastfeeding women were sometimes excluded by community drug distributors (CDDs) from certain types of MDAs for which they are eligible due to misunderstanding on the part of CDDs and community members on eligibility criteria.
Training participation rates for CDDs and supervisors were universally higher for men than women, even though feedback on the effectiveness of female CDDs was overwhelmingly positive, and female CDDs often have more access to other women in conservative households. Additionally, challenges faced by CDDs were seen as a greater barrier for women to serve in that capacity.
