Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can cause severe disease and death in warm-blooded animals such as humans and sea otters. Feral cats can release T. gondii oocysts, or environmentally resistant ‘eggs’, in their feces. These oocysts can be transported by surface runoff after rainfall and go on to contaminate bodies of water. Oocyst shedding from feral cats is not well understood, and whether they shed specific types of T. gondii that have been found in sea otters that died from toxoplasmosis is not known. We aimed to determine how often feral cats in central coastal California shed T. gondii oocysts and identify types of the parasite in feces. Although we did not see oocysts, 25.9% of samples tested positive for T. gondii DNA. Parasite DNA was more common during the wet vs. dry season. There were diverse T. gondii types found in feral cat feces, including types that were previously found in sea otters that died from toxoplasmosis. Future management of feral cats could reduce environmental contamination and in turn, T. gondii infections in sea otters and humans.
