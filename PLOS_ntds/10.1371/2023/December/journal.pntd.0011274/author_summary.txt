Plasmodium ovale, one of five species of malaria known to infect humans, in fact represents two distinct species, P. ovale curtisi (Poc) and wallikeri (Pow), that can only be distinguished using molecular diagnostics. Though Poc and Pow circulate in the same regions in Africa and Asia, mixed infections, where both are found in the same human host, have rarely been described. In this study, we modified existing real-time PCR assays targeting 18S rRNA and developed an algorithm to detect mixed Poc/Pow infections. We then applied these assays to field-collected samples from Tanzania and Cameroon, including blood samples from P. ovale-infected persons and P. ovale-positive mosquito midguts saved from mosquito feeding assays. We detected both Poc and Pow in roughly 10% of human P. ovale blood-stage infections, and surprisingly, in a majority of blood-fed mosquitoes. This suggests that Poc and Pow co-infect the same hosts more frequently than previously realized.
