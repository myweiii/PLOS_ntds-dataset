Long-term chikungunya disease is characterized by persistent rheumatic symptoms for years, after infection with the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus. Quantitative studies using generic instruments, consisting of pre-selected structured responses, reports physical and psychological well-being impairment among affected individuals. Qualitative studies using open-ended questions exploring long-term chikungunya disease impact on daily living and well-being from the experiences of affected individuals are scarce. This qualitative study aimed to fill this gap. In our study, physical functioning restrictions induced by rheumatic symptoms impaired well-being beyond what has been captured by generic instruments. These restrictions led to inactivity, struggle to avoid weight gain, and performance of domestic tasks in stages. Next to an altered emotional state, a high level of fear to walk or run was experienced, which required unwilling footwear adaptations for comfort and support, causing subsequent emotional impairment. The restricted physical functioning also reduced social participation and interest in social relations, but also introduced dependency on others. In addition, presenteeism and decreased productivity at work, and giving up leisure activities after work to rest were reported. To improve physical functioning and subsequent overall well-being, multi-disciplinary physical exercise programs including manual therapy and stretching exercises, and orthopaedic footwear interventions could be implemented.
