Clinical outcomes of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in endemic countries varies depending on disease foci. To gain more insight of r-HAT disease in Malawi, we analyzed gene expression profiles in blood from 23 individuals with early stage 1 and late stage 2 sleeping sickness versus 21 healthy controls. We found differences in gene expression profiles in individuals with stage 1 and stage 2 disease but not between Malawiâ€™s r-HAT foci. Furthermore, innate immune response transcripts were elevated in individuals with stage 1 sleeping sickness, and there was enrichment of proliferating neutrophil precursors in cases versus controls. We have also shown that wasting in individuals with late stage sleeping sickness might be linked with altered lipid metabolic process. Lastly, we have identified transcripts that in combination with other markers maybe explored in future for possibility of being used in staging of sleeping sickness without the need of the invasive lumber puncture. Our findings add to the current understanding of human response to T. b. rhodesiense infection in Malawian r-HAT patients.
