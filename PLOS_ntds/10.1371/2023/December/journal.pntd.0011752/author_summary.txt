Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted by female sand flies to humans and animals, causing infections ranging from asymptomatic and self-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis to visceral leishmaniasis which is highly lethal if untreated. Although all forms of leishmaniasis are treatable and curable with early diagnosis and treatment, the disease presents many challenges for affected populations, many of whom live in remote rural areas of the developing world, with limited access to public health facilities. Health services also face major constraints in supplying critically needed, yet costly medicines, in the context of limited financial resources. This paper presents the case of Colombia which is among the countries most affected by leishmaniasis globally, and discusses its many challenges in responding to the disease, including the guaranteed supply of necessary medicines. Our results uncover new opportunities for a revitalized health system response through committed leadership, intersectoral actions, such as a One Health approach, and partnerships with like-minded international organizations. These include Colombiaâ€™s new 10-Year Public Health Plan that contains specific time-bound goals for leishmaniasis control and elimination as a public health problem, prioritizing a reduction in deaths from visceral leishmaniasis, and potential cost-savings from the acquisition of essential medicines and supplies through the Strategic Fund of the Pan American Health Organization.
