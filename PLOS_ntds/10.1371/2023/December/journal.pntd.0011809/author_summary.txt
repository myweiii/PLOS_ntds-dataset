Several localities in Mato Grosso do Sul have already recorded human visceral leishmaniasis cases, including the city of Miranda, which is a famous fishing and tourism destination. Due to the high number of visitors, we decided to evaluate the risk of Leishmania infantum transmission in the area. Thus, we conducted vector collections over one year, detecting both the presence of the main vector (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and the Le. infantum parasite. We used nonlinear multilevel mixed models, under the Bayesian framework, to investigate the seasonal changes on transmission risk (i.e.; overall vector abundance and the proportion of females), taking into account the residence space. We found that the overall vector abundance outdoors was higher than in the indoors. Outdoors abundance was more consistent with two-peaks during the year, whereas indoors abundance was more seasonal with a single peak. Although, indoor abundance was lower than observed outdoors, the proportion of females captured was up to twice that observed outdoors. These findings highlighted the spatiotemporal component of leishmaniasis transmission risk, which can guide entomological surveillance and control measures.
