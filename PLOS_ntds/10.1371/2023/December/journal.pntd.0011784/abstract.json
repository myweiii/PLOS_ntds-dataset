    "Background": "This study aimed to define immunological markers of exposure to L. major parasites and identify correlates of protection against infection.",
    "Methods": "We analyzed a cohort of 790 individuals at risk of developing ZCL living in endemic areas with varying L. major infection prevalence. One area had a high infection prevalence indicated by high proportions of leishmanin skin test (LST) positive subjects, while the other areas were recent foci with lower infection prevalence. Blood samples were collected before the transmission season to measure Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), Interleukin 10 (IL-10), and Granzyme B (GrB) levels in response to parasite stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",
    "Results": "The study population showed heterogeneity in parasite contact, evident from specific scars and/or positive LST results, significantly higher in the old focus compared to recent foci. IFN-γ and GrB were markers of parasite exposure and reliable indicators of immunity to L. major. Positive correlations were observed between IFN-γ/IL-10 and GrB/IL-10 ratios and LST results.",
    "Conclusion": "This study on a large cohort at risk of ZCL confirmed IFN-γ and GrB as protective factors against the disease. A high IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio, but not GrB/IL-10 ratio was associated with resistance. These results are valuable for developing and evaluating of a vaccine against human leishmaniasis."
