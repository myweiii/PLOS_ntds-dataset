Onchocerca volvulus is a nematode parasite that is the causative agent of river blindness in Africa, the Americas and Yemen and is transmitted by blackflies of the genus Simulium. Efforts to reduce and eliminate this neglected tropical disease focus on mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and require reliable and accurate diagnostic assays to monitor the progress of once or twice-yearly treatments. One important measure of the impact of MDA is to screen pools of vector flies collected in endemic areas for the presence of L3-stage (infective) larvae. Since dissection of individual flies and microscopic examination to search for larvae in the flies is very time-consuming and results in many false negative and false positive results (due to morphologically similar larvae of closely related animal parasites), DNA-based PCR assays have proven extremely useful. An existing PCR-ELISA method based on amplification and detection of the O150 repeat found in the parasites has proven very useful over the last 25 years. An updated real-time qPCR-based method using a mitochondrial DNA target (OvND5) has now been developed that is more sensitive, more species specific, less-time consuming and less costly than the original O150 PCR-ELISA assay. This assay is ready for field evaluation.
