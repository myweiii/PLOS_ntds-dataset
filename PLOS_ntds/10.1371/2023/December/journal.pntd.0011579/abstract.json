    "Abstract": "Salmonella is a prevalent foodborne and waterborne pathogens threating global public health and food safety. Given the diversity of Salmonella serotypes and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, there is an urgent need for the development of broadly protective therapies. This study aims to prepare monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) with broad reactivity against multi-serotype Salmonella strains, potentially offering cross-protection. We prepared two Mabs F1D4 and B7D4 against protein FliK and BcsZ, two potential vaccine candidates against multi-serotype Salmonella. The two Mabs belonging to IgG1 isotype exhibited high titers of 1:256,000 and 1:512,000 respectively, as well as broad cross-reactivity against 28 different serotypes of Salmonella strains with percentages of 89.29% and 92.86%, correspondingly. Neutralizing effects of the two Mabs on Salmonella growth, adhesion, invasion and motility was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay. Additionally, cytotoxicity assays, animal toxicity analyses, and pharmacokinetic evaluations demonstrated the safety and sustained effectiveness of both Mabs. Furthermore, F1D4 or B7D4-therapy in mice challenged with S. Typhimurium LT2 exhibited milder organs damage and lower Salmonella colonization, as well as the higher relative survival of 86.67% and 93.33% respectively. This study produced two broadly reactive and potential cross protective Mabs F1D4 and B7D4, which offered new possibilities for immunotherapy of salmonellosis."
