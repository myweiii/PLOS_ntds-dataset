    "Background": "The timely identification of severe dengue in peadiatric patients is of utmost importance, as any delay in diagnosis could lead to an irreversible state of shock potentially leading to fatal consequences. The primary aim of our study was to characterize dengue severity in paediatric patients based on initial symptoms, signs, and laboratory investigation of their presentation in the emergency department.",
    "Methodology": "We conducted a retrospective data retrieval from the medical records of 254 paediatric patients who had been diagnosed with confirmed cases of dengue fever. The clinical characteristics were compared between severe and non-severe dengue. Multiple logistic regression analysis was utilised to elucidate the variables that exhibited associations with severe dengue.",
    "Results": "A total of 254 paediatric patients were included, among whom 15.4% (n = 39) were diagnosed with severe dengue. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified lethargy, systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 90 mmHg, capillary refilled time (CRT) longer than 2 seconds, ascites, and hepatomegaly were independently associated with severe dengue.",
    "Conclusion": "In paediatric patients, severe dengue is associated with specific clinical indicators, including lethargy, low systolic blood pressure, prolonged capillary refill time (CRT), and the presence of ascites and hepatomegaly. Identifying these clinical features early is crucial for primary care physicians, as it enables accurate diagnosis and timely intervention to manage severe dengue effectively."
