Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that can be passed from wild animals or livestock to people. We investigated how frequently people who attended a rural hospital with a fever had leptospirosis, and what jobs or tasks were risk factors for the disease and for previous infection. We found 8% had leptospirosis and nearly 1 in 3 people had been previously exposed. Milking cattle and goats were risk factors for leptospirosis or previous exposure. We conclude that that livestock are a likely source of exposure to leptospirosis and that milking livestock is a risk factor for being infected. Controlling leptospirosis in livestock and strategies to protect people when milking livestock could reduce human infections.
