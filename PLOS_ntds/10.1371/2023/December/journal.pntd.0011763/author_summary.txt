In this study, we examined the associations between meteorological variables, ambient air pollutants and four major mosquito-borne diseases, dengue, malaria, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis in Thailand. For the optimization of vector control, it is pertinent to understand risk factors associated to disease transmission. Given the complex transmission patterns of mosquito-borne diseases, risk factors are known to be multi-factorial in nature. Although associations between climate variables and mosquito-borne diseases have been studied extensively, the role of ambient air pollutants in mosquito-borne disease dynamics remains relatively unexplored. Recognizing that urban areas experience unique challenges related to air quality and that pollutants can have a significant impact on ecological systems, it is imperative to understand the interplay between climate variables and pollutants comprehensively. Therefore, we aim to begin addressing this gap by determining the risk factors driving multiple major mosquito-borne diseases in Thailand from 2003 to 2021. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of disease transmission in urban settings, ultimately contributing to more effective public health interventions and strategies.
