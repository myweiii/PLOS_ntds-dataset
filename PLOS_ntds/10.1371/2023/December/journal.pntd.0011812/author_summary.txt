Fascioliasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by flatworms or liver flukes of the genus Fasciola. The review paper focuses on the effect of temperature on the life history traits of intermediate hosts of fascioliasis. The authors aim to explore the impact of temperature on the growth, survival, and reproduction of the host snails and the development of parasites inside intermediate hosts. Fascioliasis is considered a major public health problem in many countries, affecting both humans and livestock. The disease is transmitted through the consumption of metacercaria contaminated watercress for humans and vegetation for grazing livestock. The review paper highlights that temperature plays a crucial role in the life history traits of these intermediate hosts. The authors gathered and analyzed various studies conducted on different intermediate host snails of Fasciola species to investigate the relationship between temperature and the development, survival, reproduction, and infectivity of the parasites within them. Their findings reveal that the temperature can significantly influence the life history traits of these intermediate hosts. Higher temperatures generally promote faster development, increased reproduction, and higher infectivity rates. However, there is a limit to the beneficial effects of temperature, beyond which the survival and fitness of the intermediate hosts start to decline. The authors also emphasize the relevance of understanding the impact of temperature on fascioliasis in the context of climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the distribution and prevalence of fascioliasis may change, affecting the transmission dynamics of the disease. This knowledge is crucial for the design and implementation of effective control strategies to mitigate the impact of fascioliasis on human and animal health.
