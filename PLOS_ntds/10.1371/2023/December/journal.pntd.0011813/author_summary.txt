Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, is a neglected tropical zoonotic disease that predominantly affects impoverished pastoral communities worldwide. It is endemic in the southernmost regions of South America, specifically in Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay, with over 5000 new human cases reported annually across the four countries. The dog-sheep cycle has been identified as the most epidemiologically significant, as the parasite circulates between farm dogs and livestock, associating with cattle breeding and the feeding of dogs with infected offal. In the 21st century, remarkable progress has been achieved in the fields of genetics, genomics, and molecular epidemiology of causative parasites, as well as in diagnostic techniques, treatment modalities, and control strategies, including the development and distribution of vaccines. Nevertheless, there remain several unresolved issues, one of which is the prevalence among relatives of patients undergoing surgery for CE, because there is limited evidence regarding the infection of relatives of operated patients.
