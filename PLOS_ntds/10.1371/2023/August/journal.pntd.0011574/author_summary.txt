Entamoeba histolytica is a unicellular parasite causing amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. The trophozoites live in the human colon where they feed on bacteria and simple sugars, e.g. glucose, which is essential for their fermentative energy metabolism, moreover, glucose and galactose appear in large amounts on their surface molecules. We characterised the enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GalE). The enzyme converts UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) to UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), and in addition UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). As E. histolytica possesses a Î²-N-acetylhexosaminidase, which potentially releases GalNAc and GlcNAc from human intestinal mucins; via the action of GalE, these building blocks can be utilised to generate UDP-GlcNAc, the precursor for the chitin of the amoebic cyst wall. The compounds ebselen, diethylstilbestrol and ethacrynic acid had been reported as inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei GalE and were also active against the parasite. When we tested the compounds against E. histolytica and its GalE, all three compounds led to amoebic death, but only one of them, ebselen, inhibited GalE activity. Considering its bifunctionality, GalE is not only key to the synthesis of trophozoite glycans, but probably is essential for the generation of chitin for the emerging cyst wall from sugars cleaved from the host intestinal mucin.
