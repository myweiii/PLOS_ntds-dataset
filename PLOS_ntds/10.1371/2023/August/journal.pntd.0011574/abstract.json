    "Abstract": "In the human host, the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is adapted to a non-invasive lifestyle in the colon as well as to an invasive lifestyle in the mesenterial blood vessels and the liver. This means to cope with bacteria and human cells as well as various metabolic challenges. Galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) are sugars of great importance for the amoebae, they attach to the host mucus and enterocytes via their well-studied Gal/GalNAc specific lectin, they carry galactose residues in their surface glycans, and they cleave GalNAc from host mucins. The enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GalE) works as a bridge between the galactose and glucose worlds, it can help to generate glucose for glycolysis from phagocytosis products containing galactose as well as providing UDP-galactose necessary for the biosynthesis of galactose-containing surface components. E. histolytica contains a single galE gene. We recombinantly expressed the enzyme in Escherichia coli and used a spectrophotometric assay to determine its temperature and pH dependency (37°C, pH 8.5), its kinetics for UDP-glucose (Km = 31.82 μM, Vmax = 4.31 U/mg) and substrate spectrum. As observed via RP-HPLC, the enzyme acts on UDP-Glc/Gal as well as UDP-GlcNAc/GalNAc. Previously, Trypanosoma brucei GalE and the bloodstream form of the parasite were shown to be susceptible to the three compounds ebselen, a selenoorganic drug with antioxidant properties, diethylstilbestrol, a mimic of oestrogen with anti-inflammatory properties, and ethacrynic acid, a loop diuretic used to treat oedema. In this study, the three compounds had cytotoxic activity against E. histolytica, but only ebselen inhibited the recombinant GalE with an IC50 of 1.79 μM (UDP-Gal) and 1.2 μM (UDP-GalNAc), suggesting that the two other compounds are active against other targets in the parasite. The importance of the ability of GalE to interconvert UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc may be that the trophozoites can generate precursors for their own cyst wall from the sugar subunits cleaved from host mucins. This finding advances our understanding of the biochemical interactions of E. histolytica in its colonic environment."
