Cholera is considered endemic in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), along the Great Lakes Region. From these endemic areas, cholera outbreaks regularly spread to other areas. However, some major epidemics have spread to far-off areas outside the endemic eastern DRC. Although the dynamics of their spread have been widely described, their underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Our modelling framework showed that the exacerbation of conflict events, followed by mass population movement and the amplification of cholera outbreaks in endemic areas bordering Lake Kivu, significantly increased the risk of spatio-temporal spread of major cholera epidemics outside the endemic eastern provinces of DRC. In addition, we found that the remote areas affected by these major epidemic waves were grouped into three categories based on cholera indices, population density, transportation network density, and geographic accessibility. Monitoring of conflict dynamics should be included in multisectoral cholera surveillance to anticipate the risk of significant geographic expansion of the disease in DRC.
