Scabies is a common skin disease that is caused by a small mite that burrows into the skin. It can be treated by a drug called ivermectin, which was given to every person aged 5 years and over in Samoa in 2018 to treat a different disease, known as lymphatic filariasis. We wanted to understand how common scabies was in the people of Samoa and so did two surveys where we visited people’s houses that we randomly selected. We asked people in each household questions about scabies symptoms and looked at their skin for signs of scabies. We surveyed 2868 people in 499 households in the first survey and 2796 in 544 households in the second survey. We found that 2.4% of people in the first survey and 4.4% of people in the second survey had scabies. We also found that some people were more likely to have scabies: younger children, women, people living in some regions of Samoa, people living with more people in their household, and people who didn’t take the medicine for lymphatic filariasis in 2018.
