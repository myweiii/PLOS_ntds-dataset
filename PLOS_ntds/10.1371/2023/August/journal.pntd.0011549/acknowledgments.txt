We would like to thank all the staff at the Samoa Ministry of Health who supported the many different aspects of the study. We especially thank Miriama Asoiva who provided valuable advice on local logistics and cultural sensitivities, and assistance with obtaining permissions to conduct village visits. We also thank Fuatai Maiava for making it possible for nurses to assist with the household surveys.
We sincerely thank Tautala Maula, the general secretary of the Samoa Red Cross, and her team (especially Babey Suniula, Nixon Mataia, Brenda Koon Wai You, Alesi Mataia, and Shem Lepale) for their enthusiastic and untiring support with fieldwork, village visits, and laboratory work; this survey would not have been possible without their hard work and dedication.
We greatly appreciate all the support and advice provided by Rasul Baghirov and Lepaitai Hansell at the WHO country office in Samoa, and thank them for generously sharing their wisdom. We also thank the Australian volunteers and students who assisted with fieldwork and data management (Brady McPherson, Kelley Meder, Meru Sheel, Benjamin Dickson, Kinley Wangdi, Sophie Phelan, Ximena Tolosa).
