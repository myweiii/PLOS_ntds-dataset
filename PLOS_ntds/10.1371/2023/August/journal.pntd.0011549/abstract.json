    "Background": "Scabies is a common skin infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabei mite. Ivermectin, one of three drugs used in mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis, is also effective for treating scabies. Ivermectin-based MDA was first conducted in Samoa in August 2018, with ivermectin being offered to those aged ≥5 years. Here, we report scabies prevalence in Samoa after MDA.",
    "Methods": "We conducted household surveys 1.5–3.5 months (Survey 1) and 6–8 months (Survey 2) after the 2018 MDA in 35 primary sampling units. We conducted clinical examination for scabies-like rash and used International Alliance for the Control of Scabies classification criteria. We estimated scabies prevalence by age, gender and region. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with prevalence.",
    "Results": "We surveyed 2868 people (499 households) and 2796 people (544 households) aged 0–75 years in Surveys 1 and 2, respectively. Scabies prevalence increased from 2.4% (95% CI 2.1–2.7%) to 4.4% (95% CI 4.0–4.9%) between surveys. Scabies was associated with younger age (0–4 years: aOR 3.5 [2.9–4.2]; 5–15 years: aOR 1.6 [1.4–1.8] compared to ≥16 years), female gender (aOR 1.2 [95% CI 1.1–1.4]; region (aOR range from 1.4 [1.1–1.7] to 2.5 [2.1–3.1] between regions), large households (aOR 2.6 [2.0–3.4] households ≥13), and not taking MDA in 2018 (aOR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1–1.6]).",
    "Conclusions": "We found moderate prevalence of scabies in two population-representative surveys conducted within 8 months of the 2018 MDA for lymphatic filariasis. Prevalence appeared to increase between the surveys, and ongoing surveillance is recommended, particularly in young children."
