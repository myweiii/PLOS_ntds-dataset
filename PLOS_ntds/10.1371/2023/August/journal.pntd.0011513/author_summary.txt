Schistosomiasis is one of the leading neglected tropical diseases worldwide. Ghana is considered endemic to schistosomiasis and cited to be present throughout the whole country according to the 2015 World Schistosomiasis Risk Chart. Earlier studies have reported that individual and community perceptions of schistosomiasis are key factors that impact transmission rates and could help in planning and implementing control initiatives. In this study, we assessed community knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to schistosomiasis among inhabitants living along water bodies in the KAPND of Ghana. In addition, this study highlights the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of schistosomiasis in the area. We observed a gap in knowledge, attitude, and practice in the area. Consequently, a prevalence as high as 52.9% which was related to individual characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices was observed. Schistosoma infection was associated with poor clinical outcomes in the area. Infection prevalence observed in the area indicates intense exposure and alarming transmission possibly due to poor knowledge, attitude, and practices. Control interventions targeted at controlling infection in the communities are warranted and should focus on educating inhabitants on Schistosoma prevention strategies and mass drug administration.
