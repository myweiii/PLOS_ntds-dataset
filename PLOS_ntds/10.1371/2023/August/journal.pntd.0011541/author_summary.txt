We investigated the interaction between the two environmental commensals Acanthamoeba and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the origin of hypermucoviscosity in K. pneumoniae. Our study findings show that co-culturing K. pneumoniae with Acanthamoeba results in an enlarged bacterial capsule, leading to an increase in capsular polysaccharide production in the subsequent generations of K. pneumoniae. We screened several K. pneumoniae serotypes and observed the same effect. We demonstrated that the interaction between Acanthamoeba and K. pneumoniae could be a crucial factor in controlling hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae infections.
