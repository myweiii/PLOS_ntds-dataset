In the current study, we demonstrated that the KAP for RVF transmission and prevention is low among the pastoral and agropastoral community members in Ngorongoro district, Tanzania. The causes, route of transmission and signs of RVF in both humans and animals were mostly unknown to the respondents. The population was unaware that the high mortality rate of young animals and the miscarriage of pregnant animals were severe signs of RVF. The crucial preventive measures against RVF were not being used, which created a gap between recommended and real practices. Low level of knowledge about the RVF was linked to poor preventive efforts, so raising awareness could launch public awareness in a positive way. We suggest that important authorities should launch public awareness campaigns to help bridge these knowledge gaps and strengthen peopleâ€™s understanding about RVF. It might be necessary to use radio and mobile applications to provide the public with access to such health information. In order to alter behavioral patterns in the study communities to avert RVF occurrences, barriers to change must be identified and eliminated. The livelihoods of agropastoral and pastoralist communities will benefit if these procedures are put into action since they may prevent regular disruptions of livestock market chains that occur whenever RVF outbreaks happen.
