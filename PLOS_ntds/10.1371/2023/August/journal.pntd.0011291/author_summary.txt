Leptospirosis is a widespread disease that affects humans and animals and is mostly affecting individuals living in resource-poor settings, in particular in tropical and subtropical regions. To understand the economic impact of this disease, we estimated the cost of this disease, assuming that all deaths and disabilities due to the disease will lead to a loss of human productivity. The country-level estimates were done using the published data from the World Bank on per capita gross domestic product (GDP) after removing the per capita health expenditure from the GDP. The estimated average annual cost of leptospirosis due to loss of productivity was $29.3 billion in 2019, which could be as high as $52.3 billion. The countries with the highest costs were China ($4.8 billion), India ($4.6 billion), Indonesia ($2.8 billion), Sri Lanka ($2.1 billion), and the United States ($1.3 billion). Most countries with the highest costs were in the Asia-Pacific region, and lower-middle-income countries had an annual cost of 13.8 billion US dollars. The estimate of lost productivity represents, however, a fraction of the overall economic burden caused by leptospirosis, highlighting the need for immediate action to control and eliminate the disease and its inclusion in the global health agenda.
