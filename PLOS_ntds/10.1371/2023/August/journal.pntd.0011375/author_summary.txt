Taenia solium taeniosis / cysticercosis (TSTC) is endemic in Zambia. We aimed at assessing knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to TSTC and epilepsy in a community setting in Chiparamba area of Chipata district of the Eastern Province of Zambia. Understanding KAP is important in designing and implementing public health interventions for control and eradication of TSTC in a community. We found generally poor KAP related to TSTC among the community in our study area. This lack of knowledge about TSTC infections can lead to behaviours that facilitate the transmission and maintenance of T. solium infections and could hinder efforts to control the most preventable cause of epilepsy in the sub-Saharan African region. More efforts to improve KAP using a One Health approach for the control and elimination of TSTC are therefore required in Zambia.
