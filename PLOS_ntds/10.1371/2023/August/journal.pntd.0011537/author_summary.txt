Age has been previously found to be associated with severe dengue. However, it is unclear whether this effect is purely due to aging or the predisposition of older individuals to be exposed to secondary infection. Since secondary infection with a dengue serotype other than the infecting serotype during the first infection increases the risk of severe dengue, we explored how much this effect contributed to the effect of age on severe dengue. We performed a mediation analysis and assessed the spatial distribution pattern of primary and secondary infection across Mexico to determine regions vulnerable to severe dengue occurrence. The youngest and oldest population groups had relatively higher odds of severe dengue. However, the effect of age on severe dengue was partly mediated by secondary infection. The spatial analysis also revealed aggregation of severe dengue cases among individuals with primary infection in the Northeastern region, which may be associated with the high prevalence of DENV-3 in the region. Focusing on the prevention of secondary infection among the elderly and infants may help to avert the number of severe dengue cases.
