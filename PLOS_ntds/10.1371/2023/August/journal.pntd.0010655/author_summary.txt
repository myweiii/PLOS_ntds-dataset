Outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases are still sporadic events in temperate Europe. Among these, a notable example is provided by the outbreak of CHIKV in Italy in 2017. We investigated which environmental variables may be spatially associated with CHIKV cases and to what extent these variables could be used to infer the occurrence of CHIKV cases when no vector data are available. To do this, we conducted a case-control study designed to assess the relative risk of observing a CHIKV case. Our results suggest that, across areas characterized by a relatively lower temperature as well as high vegetation coverage, the risk of infection is greater in the highly urbanized areas of Rome. On the other hand, in Anzio, only human population density was found to be positively associated with the likelihood of observing a CHIKV case. These preliminary findings may help identify vulnerable areas to be monitored and to be prioritized by integrated vector management as soon as the autochthonous transmission of an Aedes-borne disease is uncovered.
