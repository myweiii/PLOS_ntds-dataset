Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a chronic, debilitating illness of major significance in Latin America. Due to the extensive genetic and phenotypic variability of this parasite, methods able to reliably assign the infecting strain type are expected to have a positive effect on epidemiologic surveillance, prevention of transmission, and clinical management of Chagas disease. Herein we describe the diversity of human antibody specificities directed to a polymorphic T. cruzi antigen, TSSA, using a combination of bioinformatics and state of the art immunoassays based on peptide arrays. Our results led to the identification of novel variants of the antigen, distinct epitopes, and their key residues for antibody binding across diverse human populations and have practical implications for the design and/or evaluation of T. cruzi serotyping strategies.
