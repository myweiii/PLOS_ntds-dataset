The African elapids pose a major potential to induce clinically important envenomations and severe sequelae after a snakebite accident. Within the genus Naja, different radiation events have occurred rendering the African cobras with diverse features in their venom composition. Commonly divided into spitting and non-spitting cobras, their venom is characterized as either cytotoxic or neurotoxic, respectively, based on the pathophysiology of envenomation. In this study, an experimental protocol was developed based on the generation of monospecific antisera in rabbits immunized with venoms of spitting and non-spitting African cobras. Cross-reactivity of monospecific antisera was assessed by immunochemical analyses and by neutralization of the lethal, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and dermonecrotic activities. Results showed a large extent of intrageneric cross-reactivity by all antisera, yet few exceptions were noticed. The venoms that generated antisera with the highest cross-neutralization ability among the spitting cobras were Naja nigricollis and N. ashei, whereas for the non-spitting cobras were N. haje and N. senegalensis. These results provide evidence for the selection of the best combination of immunogens for antivenom production with the widest neutralization scope within the African cobras. Additionally, the results obtained in the rabbit model should be translated to a larger animal model used for antivenom fabrication to assess whether these predictions are confirmed.
