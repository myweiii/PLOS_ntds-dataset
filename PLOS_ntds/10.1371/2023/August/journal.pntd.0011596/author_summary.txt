Lack of available sensitive point-of-care testing is one of the primary obstacles to the rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis. This study aimed to test the performance of a CRISPR/Cas12a FBDA, a Leptospira IgM RDT, and a combined test. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed on the first day of enrollment and stratified by the day after symptom onset. The combined assays exhibited significant sensitivity for the detection of leptospires at over 80% on various days after the onset of fever.
