We wish to express our special thanks to the German Leprosy and Tuberculosis Relief Association for making it possible to shed light not only on a neglected (tropical) disease, but also on the underestimated field of stigmatization. Due to the fact that quality of research is always based on the quality of data collection, we want to express our gratitude for the wonderful Tanzanian research team; Anna Samson, Grace Peter, Rogers Kwengulia, Sunday Deogratias, and Caritas Kitoga. Special thanks to all participants for sharing their thoughts and stories.
