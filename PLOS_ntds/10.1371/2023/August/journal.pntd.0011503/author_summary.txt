A lot of epidemiological studies suggest that an infection with the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus is a risk factor for a certain form of epilepsy which includes the nodding syndrome. The seizures occur suddenly in previously healthy children between the ages of 3 and 18 years and the disease is an important public health problem in onchocerciasis-endemic regions with inadequate or lacking onchocerciasis elimination programmes. So far, no exact pathophysiological mechanisms were detected that shed light on how the parasite can trigger the seizures, although many factors have been investigated. However, most studies lack an accurate determination of an active/chronic O. volvulus infection; rather, they rely on the presence of circulating antibodies, which is only evidence of previous exposure to the parasite (and therefore positive in most people living in endemic areas. Within our study, we included participants from the Mahenge area, Tanzania, who were displaying epilepsy/nodding syndrome in absence or presence of a PCR-determined O. volvulus infection. We could show that the group of O. volvulus infected patients displayed higher levels of eosinophils, antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels as well as increased levels of a worm-related metabolic product (NATOG), which might be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker of the disease in future studies.
