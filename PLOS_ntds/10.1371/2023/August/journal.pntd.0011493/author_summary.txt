Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The clinical presentation varies depending on the immune response of the affected person. The infection is curable with antimicrobial therapy but individuals with leprosy can experience immune-mediated complications known as leprosy reactions. There are reports of vaccines, including those for SARS-CoV-2 being associated with the development of leprosy or leprosy reactions. We performed a retrospective study to determine the vaccination status of all individuals diagnosed with leprosy attending the Leprosy Clinic in 2021 and whether any individual had developed leprosy or a new leprosy reaction within 12 weeks of receiving a dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Fifty-two individuals with leprosy attended the clinic, five newly diagnosed and eight individuals were on antimicrobial treatment. Twenty-two individuals were prescribed an immunosuppressant drug during 2021. Forty-nine individuals had at least one vaccine dose, one was unvaccinated There was no vaccination record for two individuals. Two individuals met our criteria for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine associated new leprosy adverse event. We have reviewed other cases of vaccine associated leprosy adverse events and conclude that the benefits of vaccination to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outweigh these unwanted events. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential leprosy adverse events associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and to advise leprosy affected individuals to report any new symptoms immediately.
