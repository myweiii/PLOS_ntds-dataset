Worldwide, 1.8 to 2.7 million snakebite envenomings occur annually resulting in 81,000 to 138,000 deaths. Annually, 1,000 to 3,225 deaths occur in Nepal. However, there is an epidemiological knowledge gap. Since news media data are typically available in near real-time, the news media data can be analyzed to understand the epidemiological situations in Nepal like poor resource country. Therefore, we analyzed news media-reported snakebite envenomings that occurred in the last 13 years. The median age of envenomed patients was 19 y. People were envenomated mainly during natural human activities such as sleeping. Cobras, kraits, Russellâ€™s Viper, Mountain Pitviper, and Green Pitvipers were involved in snakebites. Overall, three-fourth of victims who consulted traditional healers died. Forty-four cases being referred to higher centers were died on the way to higher healthcare centers or in healthcare institutions during treatment. Dependency on traditional snakebite healers, the long distance between snakebite localities and snakebite treatment centers, and snakebite occurred at night were the major barriers to accessing healthcare facilities by people bitten by snakes in Nepal. In this country, people inhabiting 48 districts are at risk of venomous snakebites.
