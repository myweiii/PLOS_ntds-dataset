The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, if left untreated, can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, known as AIDS. It is a global epidemic infectious disease that remains incurable but has treatment and prevention strategies. Several studies have been conducted to identify new technologies to control and cure this disease, such as vaccines and new drugs. Furthermore, there are several strategies for combined prevention of this infection, including HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which has been adopted as a Brazilian public health policy and is indicated for individuals who are not infected with HIV. Despite being effective, it only prevents HIV infection and not other sexually transmitted infections (STI). It is estimated that socioeconomic indicators may be correlated with and directly impact access to prophylaxis. In light of this scenario, an ecological study was conducted to verify whether PrEP administration is associated with an increase in STI, and whether its access and coverage are associated with the socioeconomic conditions of the population. It was observed that PrEP administration and the most vulnerable socioeconomic indicators showed an inversely proportional association; these results could guide actions and investments focused on public health, aiming to reduce social disparities and inequalities in access to this strategy.
