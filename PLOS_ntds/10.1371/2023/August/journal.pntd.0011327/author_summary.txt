In this paper we describe the medical situation of people affected by mycetoma in Turkana County, (north-west Kenya). This is a neglected disease, suffered by the poorest people in the world due to lack of education and access to health services. In Turkana there is a high incidence of this disease, especially among young men working in the fields, where they get infected by fungi or bacteria in the soil or on plants and thorns. The lack of nearby health care means that these patientsâ€™ injuries develop into severe disability and even death. The study of the tissues of patients detecting and studying the microorganisms involved, led to a more specific knowledge about the disease in this area of the world. Our work aims to contribute to the global knowledge of mycetoma to favor the implementation of means for the diagnosis and treatment of this problem, which will allow a better management and the implementation of satisfactory medical solutions.
