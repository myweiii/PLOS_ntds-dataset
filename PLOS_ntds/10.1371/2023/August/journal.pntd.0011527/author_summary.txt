Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has led to three historic pandemics and remains a major public health issue. Here, genomic epidemiological analysis of 175 Y. pestis strains isolated over 50 years from the Dehong Daiâ€”Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, a region located in southwestern China, revealed the genomic evolution scenario of Y. pestis with high resolution. Our results revealed that plague epidemics in this region were led by different phylogroups, and population shift events were observed during different years, suggesting high dynamics of Y. pestis populations in the local natural plague foci. We found that the spread of plague was from southwest to northeast and inferred the possible origin of the epidemics, which would help strengthen surveillance of the epizootic in local natural plague foci and promote the prevention and control of human plague.
