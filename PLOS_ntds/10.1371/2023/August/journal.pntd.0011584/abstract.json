    "Background": "There is a lack of systematic evidence for strategies to control loiasis transmission in highly endemic regions. Here we assessed albendazole and ivermectin based treatment regimens to reduce Loa loa microfilaraemia in Gabon.",
    "Methods": "Eligible adult patients with L. loa microfilaraemia between 5,000 and 50,000 microfilariae/ml were randomized to either a control or one of three intervention groups (1:2:2:2 allocation ratio) consisting of three-week twice daily 400mg oral albendazole followed by 1) no treatment, 2) two further weeks of twice daily 400mg albendazole, or 3) a single dose of ivermectin in this open label randomized assessor blinded controlled clinical trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with L. loa microfilaraemia \u2264 100 mf/ml at Day 168.",
    "Results": "In the efficacy-population of 42 patients 0 (0%; control group), 1 (9%; 3-week albendazole), 5 (39%; 5-weeks albendazole) and 2 (22%; 3-week albendazole plus single dose ivermectin) participants met the primary outcome of microfilaraemia below 100/ml at day 168. A 80\u201390% reduction of microfilaraemia was observed in the active treatment groups.",
    "Conclusion": "The 5-week regimen of albendazole or a 3-week regimen of albendazole followed by ivermectin were most efficacious to reduce microfilaraemia. All therapeutic regimens were well tolerated and safe.",
    "Trial registration": "Trial registered at the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201807197019027."
