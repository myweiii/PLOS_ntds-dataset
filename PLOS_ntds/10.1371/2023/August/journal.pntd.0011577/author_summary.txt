Our study explored the management of onchocerciasis among adolescents, perception, community, and health system support in Nkwanta North district of Ghana. Our results revealed that community members have various perceptions of the mode of transmission and the risk factors of onchocerciasis. For example, some community members believe that onchocerciasis is a very serious disease which if you get can make you blind. Others believe that onchocerciasis is caused by the consumption of some types of food products or stressful work. Adolescents on the other hand believed that onchocerciasis was caused by insect bite blood infection, poor environmental hygiene, sun, or could have been inherited from parents. The adolescents reported indicated that Ivermectin treatment had a great positive impact on their condition by helping relieve symptoms they were experiencing. We found that community support available for adolescentsâ€™ management of onchocerciasis was financial and emotional support. Also, we found that financial support, free treatment, home visit, counseling, and education were health system supports available to adolescents for the management of their condition. We concluded that community-based education should be provided to communities by health authorities to educate the communities on NTDs because this will help address the diverse and erroneous perceptions.
