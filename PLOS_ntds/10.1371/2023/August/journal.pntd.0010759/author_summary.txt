Worm infections affect over 2 billion people worldwide, and the most common are schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth infections. In Rwanda, the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections can be as high as 45%, while the prevalence of schistosomiasis is 2.7% among school-aged children.
The government of Rwanda continues to develop initiatives to eliminate worm infection, among which, the national decentralized deworming program, implemented at village and school level.
In this program, community health workers collaborate with teachers and local leaders to administer deworming tablets, community sensitization and health education. To date, no published studies have been conducted to understand the experiences and perspectives of key stakeholders in the national deworming program in Rwanda. We conducted a quantitative analysis of the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of teachers and community health workers, and a qualitative assessment of the perspectives of local leaders in two of the most food insecure districts of Rwanda. The results show a gap in the knowledge of community health workers and teachers on worm infections. The study also revealed that there were some misconceptions about deworming tablets, which highlights the need to train key implementers of the program for them to transfer their knowledge to the broader community.
