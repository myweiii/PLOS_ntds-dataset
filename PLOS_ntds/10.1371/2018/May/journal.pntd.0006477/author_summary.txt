Fever remains an important reason why people are hospitalised in Southeast Asia. We do not know the most common causes of fever in many regions of the tropics. This knowledge would help doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment in areas where access to diagnostics is difficult. Establishing diagnostic tests for all possible diseases in an area is expensive and often impractical. An alternative is to measure ‘marker’ chemicals in the blood which the body produces in response to infection. These are usually higher in patients with bacterial infections. Differentiating bacterial from viral infections will help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, which can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this study, we investigated the causes of fever in hospitalised patients in Chiangrai, northern Thailand, and assessed if two chemical markers (CRP and procalcitonin) could distinguish bacterial from viral infections. Scrub typhus, dengue and leptospirosis were the major causes of fever, and these were not always accurately diagnosed and managed. We also found that CRP was better than procalcitonin in differentiating bacterial from viral infections. These results should help improve the management of febrile patients and increase the awareness of these neglected tropical diseases that are potentially deadly if missed.
