In oviparous animals all the nutrients and energy needed for the embryo cells are previously stored in the eggs, in the form of what we call yolk. The yolk is the food of the embryo, and, like our food, it needs to be broken down into nutrients and energy to supply the embryo cells rapid growth and division. The yolk-macromolecules are maternally synthesized, accumulated in the oocytes into specific organelles and, after fertilization, they are degraded in a regulated manner throughout early embryogenesis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern these components accumulation and degradation are still mostly unknown. This is our interest in this work. We found that one specific gene (RpATG6) is crucial for the endocytosis of the yolk components by the oocytes in the insect vector of Chagas disease R. prolixus. Insects silenced for this gene generate oocytes lacking most of their yolk components, and, as a consequence, their F1 embryos are not viable. Thus, these findings are important in the context of vector population control and can help us to further understand the molecular mechanisms of yolk uptake and oocyte formation in these animals.
