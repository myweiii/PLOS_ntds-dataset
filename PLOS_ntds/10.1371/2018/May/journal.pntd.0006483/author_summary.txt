Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have shown that co-infected individuals can show strikingly different disease symptoms than singly infected individuals. Among these studies, the potential protective effect of some helminth species on malaria severity has attracted considerable attention because of the possible public health impact. However, despite the fact that helminth species frequently co-occur together within an individual, no studies have investigated the role of within-host helminth community interactions on malaria severity. Taking the advantage of a cohort study in Thailand, we found that infection by Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were both associated with direct reductions in cerebral malaria risk. However, the benefit of T. trichiura infection was halved in the presence of hookworm, revealing that interactions among helminth species can jeopardize the beneficial role of individual helminths. Our study shows that the outcome of interactions between two parasite species can be significantly modified by a third, emphasizing the critical role that parasite community interactions play in shaping infection outcomes and their impact on public health. These insights are especially relevant for neglected tropical diseases that occur in areas of high pathogen diversity.
