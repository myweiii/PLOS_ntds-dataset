Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important neglected tropical disease that has caused severe epidemics and epizootics throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Severe outbreaks have involved tens of thousands of both human and livestock cases for which no effective, commercially available human vaccines are available. Vaccine candidates have been developed based on the complete deletion of two known RVF virus virulence factors, the NSs and NSm genes. These vaccines were previously demonstrated to be protective in rats, mice, and sheep. In this study, we expand upon those results and evaluate the vaccine candidates in a non-human primate model for RVF. The animals received a single dose of vaccine that led to the development of a robust immune response. No vaccine-induced adverse reactions, signs of clinical illness or infectious virus were detected in the vaccinated animals. All vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with RVF virus were protected against viremia and liver disease. These results demonstrate that the vaccines are safe and effective in non-human primates, which provides the impetus for further development of these candidates for use in humans.
