Rabies is a 100% vaccine-preventable disease but invariably fatal once symptoms occur. Annually, tens of thousands of people die after being infected with rabies virus, predominantly through bites or scratches of infected dogs. The stable mortality rates highlight the limitations of current disease specific interventions, including prophylaxes, awareness campaigns and mass vaccination of dogs. Consequently, research is needed to develop improved and novel strategies that circumvent the barriers faced in implementation in endemic settings. Interest for rabies, however, is limited and to effectively allocate budgets the field would benefit from a more focused research agenda. This study prioritized research topics based on the importance for rabies control and the need for improvement. According to experts, research should focus on 1) cheap and scalable production systems for RIG; 2) efficacy of dog mass vaccination programs and; 3) development of a cheap human vaccine. By elucidating differences in perceptions of stakeholders between disciplines and between those with more versus those with less experience in the field, this study also provides practical insights to inform stakeholders concerned with the implementation of interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of rabies. The prioritization of rabies-specific research needs is a vital step in accelerating innovation necessary to decrease the burden of disease.
