Onchocerciasis, commonly called river blindness, is a chronic parasitic disease particularly prevalent in Africa. It is transmitted through the bites of infected Simulium blackflies. Onchocerciasis is endemic in Equatorial Guinea. Huge achievements have been made in human and vector control during the last two decades, especially on Bioko Island. Eliminating onchocerciasis transmission on Bioko is feasible given its isolation from other landmasses, which also reduces the risk of reinvasion by the disease vector. Recently updated WHO guidelines for stopping mass drug administration (MDA) and verifying elimination of human onchocerciasis (2016) established a new critical threshold to verify elimination of onchocerciasis transmission based on novel serological tests. We applied these techniques in a representative sample of 5- to 9-year-old school children. An entomological assessment was also carried out. We found no evidence of current infection or recent transmission. There was no evidence of onchocerciasis vectors, and our results from the sample population meet the current WHO serologic criteria for stopping MDA. Based on these results, we recommended to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea that MDA on Bioko Island be stopped and that 3 years of post-treatment surveillance should be undertaken to identify any new occurrences of exposure or infection.
