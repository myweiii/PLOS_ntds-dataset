Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease affecting mostly rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa. New drugs for this parasitic disease have been slow to develop, but one new class of drug, the benzoxaboroles, has proven to be highly effective in preclinical models and holds promise for on-going clinical trials. The lead compound in this class is AN5568, also known as SCYX-7158. Here, we study the effects of AN5568 on intracellular metabolism of the parasite and show changes to pathways involved in S-adenosyl-methionine metabolism. Further work shows similarities between this drug and sinefungin, an inhibitor of methyltransferases and dithiothreitol, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer. These phenotypes provide new clues to the mechanism of action of this compound.
