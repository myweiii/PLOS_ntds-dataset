Aedes mosquitoes are important vectors of arboviruses, representing a major threat to public health. While feeding on blood, mosquitoes address the challenges of digestion and preservation of midgut homeostasis. Damaged or senescent cells must be constantly replaced by new cells to maintain midgut epithelial integrity. In this study, we show that the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) of blood-fed mosquitoes are able to respond to abiotic and biotic challenges. Exposing midgut cells to different types of stress, such as the inhibition of the peritrophic matrix formation, changes in the midgut redox state, or infection with entomopathogenic bacteria or viruses, resulted in an increased number of mitotic cells in blood-fed mosquitoes. Mosquito strains with different susceptibilities to DENV infection presented different time course of cell regeneration in response to viral infection. Knockdown of the Notch pathway in a refractory mosquito strain limited cell division after infection with DENV and resulted in increased mosquito susceptibility to the virus. Conversely, inducing midgut cell proliferation made a susceptible strain more resistant to viral infection. Therefore, the effectiveness of midgut cellular renewal during viral infection proved to be an important factor in vector competence. These findings can contribute to the understanding of virus-host interactions and help to develop more successful strategies of vector control.
