Biomphalaria straminea is an intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni. This snail has not only established in peripheral countries but also survived in different water habitats in Hong Kong and adjacent cities of mainland China. Ecological niche models were used to predict the potential global distribution of B. straminea. Our results showed that there were niche shifts in the process of invasion for B. straminea in the Americas and China. This snail has expanded its habitats to subtropical regions with lower annual mean temperature. Annual mean temperature, isothermality, temperature seasonality and human influence were identified as most important climatic features for the occurrence of B. straminea. Under current climate conditions the distribution of this snail should be mostly confined to the tropic and subtropic regions, including South America, Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. With the rapid globalization and the continued burden of imported cases of S. mansoni to non-endemic countries, predicting the potential distribution of the intermediate host and its drivers is increasing in importance for designing control strategies and optimizing use of limited public health resources. Prioritizing surveillance and control efforts to high-traffic regions with high habitat suitability may be the most effective approach.
