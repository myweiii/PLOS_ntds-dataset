Dog rabies causes, globally, approximately 55,000 human deaths per year. Mass vaccination programs can control dog rabies. We built a spreadsheet-based tool, RabiesEcon, to aid public health officials in planning large-scale dog rabies vaccination programs. We used RabiesEcon to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dog rabies control programs in East Africa for a human population of one million (approximately 2/3 urban, 1/3 rural). We evaluated three different vaccination options: no vaccination, annual vaccination of 50% of dogs, and semi-annual vaccination of 20% of dogs. Over a 10-year period, no dog vaccination results in approximately 44,000–65,000 rabid dogs and 2,000 human deaths. Annually vaccinating 50% of dogs for 10 years resulted in approximately 42,000–48,000 fewer rabid dogs and approximately 2,000–1,600 fewer human deaths. These reductions cost approximately $450-$385 per life saved. Semi-annual vaccination of 20% of dogs for 10 years resulted in approximately 41,000–50,000 fewer rabid dogs and approximately 2,000–1,900 fewer human deaths. These reductions cost approximately $400–$300 per life. In certain scenarios, 70% of dogs vaccinated eliminated dog rabies. Dog rabies vaccination programs can control, and potentially eliminate, dog rabies.
