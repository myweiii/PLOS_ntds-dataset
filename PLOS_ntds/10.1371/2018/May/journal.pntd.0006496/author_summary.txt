Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious public health problem. Cases of canine VL (CVL) tend to precede cases of human VL and current control measures are ineffective in significantly reducing the number of disease cases. Therefore, in light of the need for new strategies, we evaluated the mass use of dog collars impregnated with deltamethrin as a public health measure to control and prevent CVL in a highly endemic region in Brazil. Although our results were inconclusive, they do point to the possible effectiveness of this measure if it were comprehensively implemented over an extended period of time. We identified the need to adjust the currently employed implementation strategy and call attention to the operational challenges faced by local zoonosis prevention authorities.
