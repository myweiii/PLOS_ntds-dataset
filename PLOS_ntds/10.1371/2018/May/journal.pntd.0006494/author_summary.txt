Despite the apparent progress observed in recent years in leprosy control, early identification of cases remains one of the primary objectives of control programs. In addition, the failure of the current therapeutic scheme on the incidence of leprosy demonstrates that the disease elimination as a public health program promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) depends on an incisive action to interrupt its transmission chain. The long incubation period of leprosy, its insidious symptoms and signs may difficult its diagnosis. Several studies have recently demonstrated that IgM anti-PGL-I seropositive contacts present higher chances to become ill than seronegative ones. Therefore, our question was: do seropositive contacts at greater risk of becoming sick already present subclinical neural damage? Therefore, our approach was to analyse anti-PGL-I seropositive contacts through electroneuromyography. The development and implementation of more specific and sensitive methods for the detection of M. leprae and its neural impairment, using immunological, molecular and neurophysiological tools are mandatory to increase the knowledge of leprosy epidemiology, to break its chain of transmission, thereby enabling effective control of this disease. This report demonstrated that seropositive contacts is the population group with higher chances of neural impairment.
