Infection with blood fluke Schistosoma parasites is a major cause of disease burden around the world. Control of schistosomiasis, which is transmitted through intermediate host freshwater snails, is a priority for national and global health programs working in at-risk regions of Africa, the Mideast, Asia, the Philippines, and South America. Program planning often relies on mathematical models to project the impact of different schedules of mass drug administration (MDA) of the anti-schistosomal drug, praziquantel, in these areas. In practice, though, recent projections of standard models have failed to capture the variability of MDA program impact on community levels of infection, especially in high-risk zones. In the present study, we developed a modification of the conventional modeling approach that takes more detailed account of human-to-snail transmission. Inclusion of a revised, nonlinear form for the modelâ€™s snail infection function had profound effects on long term predictions of the impact of MDA programs for Schistosoma control. In specific, our proposed snail parameters helped to explain the persistent rebound of Schistosoma prevalence in certain high risk communities. The efficiency of human-to-snail transmission is likely to be much higher than predicted in standard models, which makes local elimination by implementation of MDA, alone, highly unlikely.
