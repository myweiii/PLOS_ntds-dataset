Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that has been recognized as a growing public health problem affecting mainly residents from slum settlements located in floodable areas. As such, it is considered a neglected disease that needs greater attention to reduce its global burden. A key step towards this purpose is to identify factors that influence the adherence to preventive practices regarding leptospirosis in endemic areas. We conducted a survey on residents of riverside settlements of the province of Santa Fe, an endemic area in Argentina, in order evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding leptospirosis. Our results suggest that risky practices were performed mainly by men and that, contrary to our expectations, having a positive attitude towards leptospirosis does not appear to influence the likelihood of performing preventive practices, while greater knowledge about the disease does lead to safer practices. Public health officials should develop a comprehensive plan with diverse information, education and communication activities to promote a better understanding of the symptoms, treatment and prevention of leptospirosis by the various actors involved.
