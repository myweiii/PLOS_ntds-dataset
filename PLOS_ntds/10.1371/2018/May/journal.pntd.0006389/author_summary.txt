Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are widespread globally, and their health impacts include poor growth and impaired cognitive development in children. STH control programs therefore usually focus on delivering deworming medications to school-aged children. However, expanding such programs to the whole community may result in larger benefits for children. Additionally, using water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions has been encouraged, to augment deworming programs by reducing environmental transmission. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the impact of an integrated WASH and deworming program implemented at primary schools only with a similar program implemented community-wide. Results confirm that the study procedures were feasible and acceptable to participants. Furthermore, results provide preliminary evidence that a community-wide control program will result in greater reductions in STH prevalence among school-aged children, compared to a school-based program.
