North-west Ethiopia faces the highest burden world-wide of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infection. VL treatment outcomes in HIV co-infected patients are associated with high initial treatment (parasitological) failure and recurrence rates after cure (relapse). With secondary chemoprophylaxis, the risk of relapse can be reduced. However, with the current VL treatment regimens, the initial parasitological failure rates remain high. In this study, we aimed to determine the initial effectiveness of a combination of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) and miltefosine for treatment of VL in HIV patients in Ethiopia. We conducted a retrospective study using routine program data from a Médecins Sans Frontières—supported health center in north-west Ethiopia. We included 173 adult VL-HIV co-infected patients treated for VL with a combination of AmBisome and miltefosine. Initial cure rate was 83.8%, death rate 12.7% and parasitological failure rate 3.5%. Tuberculosis co-infection at VL diagnosis was predictive of initial parasitological failure. Predictors of death were age >40 years, hemoglobin ≤6.5 g/dL and primary VL. Initial parasitological failure rates were very low with AmBisome and miltefosine combination therapy. This regimen seems a suitable treatment option. Knowledge of predictors of poor outcome may facilitate better management. These findings remain to be confirmed in other studies.
