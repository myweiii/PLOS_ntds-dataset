Trichinellosis is an important parasitic zoonosis, and has a public health hazard and an economic impact on the safety of animal food. The diagnosis of trichinellosis is difficult and it is often misdiagnosed. There is an evident 2â€“3 week window stage between clinical manifestations and the anti-Trichinella IgG positive. Serine protease is a superfamily of proteolytic enzymes and exerts a major role in tissue invasion, larval development and survival of the parasites. A T. spiralis putative serine protease (TsSP) was characterized in ES proteins of T. spiralis intestinal infective larvae and adult worms by the immunoproteomics with early infection serum. In this study, the TsSP was expressed and purified. The results revealed that the TsSP was expressed at various T. spiralis stages (newborn larvae, muscle larvae, intestinal infective larvae and adult worms) and it was principally located in cuticle and stichosome of the nematode. The rTsSP was sensitive and specific for detection of anti-Trichinella IgG, and could be regarded as an early diagnostic marker of trichinellosis.
