Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. They cause schistosomiasis, a disease with major consequences for human health and economic development. There is only a single drug available for treatment and control of this highly prevalent disease, and there is an urgent need for development of new treatments. TRP ion channels play key roles in sensory (and other) functions. One type of TRP channel, TRPV1, is activated by capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot peppers. However, schistosomes do not have any TRPV-like channels. Nonetheless, we previously showed that capsaicin and similar compounds induce dramatic hyperactivity in schistosomes, and that this response is abolished by suppressing expression of SmTRPA, a schistosome TRPA1-like channel. Mammalian TRPA1 channels are not sensitive to capsaicin. Here, we show that the SmTRPA channel itself responds to capsaicin, resulting in an influx of Ca2+ into cells. ShTRPA, a TRPA1-like channel from another schistosome, S. haematobium, is also sensitive to capsaicin. Thus, the pharmacology of schistosome TRPA1 channels apparently differs from that of host mammalian channels, a characteristic that could indicate mixed TRPA/TRPV functionality and might be exploitable for development of new antischistosomal drugs. Furthermore, we show that schistosome TRPA1-like channels are activated by host-derived compounds, perhaps indicating a mechanism by which the parasite can respond to host signals.
