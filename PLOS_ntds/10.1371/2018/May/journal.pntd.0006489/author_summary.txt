Integration of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) into the public health agenda has been a priority in global health for the last decade. A common feature shared by several NTDs is skin involvement. Conditions within this group of NTDs have now been classified as skin NTDs to promote wider NTD integration. Several skin NTDs including leprosy, Buruli ulcer, yaws, and scabies are co-endemic in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa. As children are vulnerable to these diseases, we carried out the first large-scale integrated, multi-skin NTD school survey in a rural district of this country. Our strategy of involving community healthcare workers and dermatologists effectively reached a large population. However, the detection of skin NTDs may have been limited because of the low schooling and attendance rate. We found a high prevalence of skin diseases among schoolchildren (26%), possibly due to poor socio-economic status and air pollution, which requires more attention. This high prevalence of skin diseases posed a challenge for our project as the need for medications and those with dermatological skills exceeded our capacity to reach our initial target population. Our study provides important lessons that will aid the framing of future school skin surveys in sub-Saharan Africa.
