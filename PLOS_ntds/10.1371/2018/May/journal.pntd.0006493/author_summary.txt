Hsp90 is an essential chaperone in eukaryotes and it is often described as a master regulator of cellular homeostasis. In addition to its well-known functions inside the cell, extracellular Hsp90 has also been implicated in migration and invasion of tumor cells. We have, for the first time, identified the presence of an extracellular Hsp90 in a parasitic protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. The extracellular Hsp90 is a Grp94 homolog that lacks a canonical ER retention signal. Our analysis of Grp94 sequences from protozoa shows that it is uncommon for a Grp94 to lack ER retention signal. In the current study, we characterized the biochemical parameters and established the extracellular localization of this Hsp90 paralog. This secreted Hsp90 in Trichomonas can potentially modulate host-pathogen interaction.
