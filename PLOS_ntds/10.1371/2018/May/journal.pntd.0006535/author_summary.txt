Human schistosomiasis is a chronic, neglected tropical disease (NTD) that is predominantly caused by the blood flukes Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. Infections by S. haematobium and/or S. mansoni are highly prevalent in Africa, affecting ~ 200 million people. The decoding of schistosome draft genomes has, to some extent, improved our understanding of the molecular biology of these parasites and now allows for non-protein-coding regions in these genomes to be characterised. Here, we explored small RNAs in adult S. haematobium by deep sequencing, reference genome mapping and detailed bioinformatic analyses. This study provides the first genome-wide miRNA and sncRNA resource for S. haematobium, extending earlier work on schistosomes and facilitating future curation efforts and functional investigations of schistosome sncRNAs. These efforts should enable a better understanding of post-transcriptional RNA modifications, gene regulation and novel aspects of parasite development, parasite-host cross-talk and disease at the molecular level.
