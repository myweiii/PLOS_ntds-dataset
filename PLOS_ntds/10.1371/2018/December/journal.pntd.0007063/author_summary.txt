Chagas disease is a complex pathology caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease affects more than 8 million people in Latin America and is considered a serious public health problem. The diagnosis of the disease is challenging due to the natural course of infection and therefore molecular tools such as qPCR have been deployed to detect parasite DNA in infected individuals. However, qPCR is not suitable for diagnosis in the chronic phase of the disease and new diagnostic tools are needed. Digital droplet (dd)PCR is a next-generation PCR technology that enables the absolute quantitation of nucleic acids. This technology has been successfully applied as a diagnostic tool in bacteria and viruses, but few reports exist for parasites. Herein, we imported a previously validated qPCR assay to the ddPCR platform. Our results show complete agreement in terms of diagnostic operative features but a higher limit of detection. Overall, ddPCR did not offer significant diagnostic benefits compared with qPCR.
