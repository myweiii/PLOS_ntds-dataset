Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries affecting poor, rural populations. It commonly affects the feet or hands and leads to substantial chronic morbidity, loss of function and disability. The disabling consequences of mycetoma have not been studied before. In this study we interviewed 300 patients and asked them to what extent mycetoma has affected their lives across several functional domains. We looked at bodily function, mobility, self-care, domestic activities, interpersonal interactions and relationships, education, economic status, and community, social and civic life. We found that mycetoma causes significant disability and pain. It also causes a significant financial burden to patients, interfering with their ability to be economically self-sufficient and to gain remunerative employment. We also found that mycetoma prevents the attainment of education. To overcome mycetoma-related disability we recommend integrating analgesia and physiotherapy into clinical services, adapting educational provision and working practices and early case detection and treatment to avoid the disease disabling consequences.
