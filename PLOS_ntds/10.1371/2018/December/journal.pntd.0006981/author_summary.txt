Hosts repeatedly bitten by phlebotomine sand flies develop species-specific antibody responses against certain sand fly salivary antigens. Salivary gland homogenate (SGH) is frequently used to evaluate the levels of this antibody response in host. However, SGH is less suitable for large-scale studies, since obtaining sufficient numbers of salivary glands is labor intensive and requires expertise in dissection. To replace SGH as antigen to screen for exposure to sand fly bites, specific recombinant salivary antigens were utilized. Our study assessed the human antibody reactions against recombinant salivary proteins of Phlebotomus orientalis. This sand fly species is a vector of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of severe visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. To identify valid markers of exposure to P. orientalis in humans, we screened for anti-P. orientalis antibody responses in serum samples from individuals residing in Sudan and Ethiopia. We tested nine recombinant salivary antigens and found a combination of yellow-related protein (mYEL1) and antigen 5-related protein (mAG5) the best marker of exposure, accurately correlating with the levels of exposure to P. orientalis bites as determined using SGH. Thus the combination mYEL1+ mAG5 can comprise a useful epidemiological tool to determine levels of exposure to P. orientalis in populations living in endemic areas of Eastern Africa, which could help in monitoring the distribution of P. orientalis and therefore assessing suitable anti-vector campaigns.
