Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes encephalitis in humans and reproductive disorder in pigs. The enzootic transmission cycle of JEV is maintained in nature by several species of mosquitoes and vertebrates including birds and pigs. In recent years, JEV genotype I (GI) replaced genotype IIII (GIII) as the dominant genotype in Asian countries. Genotype shift has an impact on disease control, and understanding the reasons for this shift will offer valuable insight into avenues for future disease control. Therefore, we compared the replication efficiencies of GI and GIII viruses in vitro and in vivo. We observed that GI viruses show higher replication titers in avian cells and higher viremia levels in young domestic ducklings than GIII viruses, suggesting an enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in birds. Based on these findings, we speculated that the enhanced replication of GI viruses in birds could provide increased mosquito infection, leading to an increase in the birds-mosquitoes-birds transmission cycle, thereby contributing to JEV genotype shift.
