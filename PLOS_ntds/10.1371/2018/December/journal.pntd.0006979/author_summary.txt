Recently, the number of asthma patients have increased sharply. Among patients with asthma have a high serum IgE titer, but despite this, some of these patients do not react to known allergens in skin prick tests, that suggests the presence of unknown environmental allergens. The protozoa Acanthamoeba live in very diverse environment including water, soil, air and even human nasal cavities, throat, pharynx and lung. In previous study, Acanthamoeba could be a new aero-allergen. Patients who showed positive results for the skin-prick test response to Acanthamoeba, their serum could be cross-reacted with several pollen allergens as well as Acanthamoeba total proteins. Additionally, the patients have common antibodies reacted to the 13–15 kDa Acanthamoeba unknown allergen. Profilin, which is found in all eukaryotic organisms in most cells, is an actin-binding protein that interferes with nucleation and restructuring of new filaments. Recent studies showed that profilin functions as a pan-allergen recognized by IgE in approximately 20% of birch pollen and plant food allergic patients. In Acanthamoeba, two isoforms of profilin (Ac-PF) have been identified: profilin-I and profilin-II. We examined profilin from Acanthamoeba as a potential human airway allergic agent because of its molecular weight (13–14 kDa) and cross-reactivity with several pollen allergens in the skin prick test showing positive results for Acanthamoeba in chronic cough patients. In this study, we expressed recombinant Ac-PF (rAc-PF) protein using an Escherichia coli expression system and evaluated whether Ac-PF is an airway allergic agent using an asthma animal model. Our study showed that rAc-PF may be an allergen in Acanthamoeba, but further studies needed to identify the mechanisms of allergenic reactions induced by Ac-PF.
