India is the highest leprosy burden country in the world. Government of India’s National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) launched Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC)—an active community-based case detection campaign—in 2016 in all high burden areas to detect undiagnosed cases. Following these LCDC, a small validation exercise was conducted in 8 Primary health centres (PHCs) in Bihar State by an independent expert group, to assess the correctness of case diagnosis. It found that ~30% of the cases detected were not true cases, but false positive diagnosis. To reduce false positive diagnosis in the subsequent round of LCDC in 2018, an “appreciative inquiry” involving the health care staff of these 8 PHCs using the 4-D framework (Discovery-Dream-Design-Destiny) was done. In 2018 LCDC, the false positive diagnosis decreased to ~23%. After adjusting for the differences in the patient and health facility characteristics, the decline in false positive diagnosis was estimated to be about 9%. This study shows that false positive diagnosis was a major issue during LCDCs and that appreciative inquiry can be used to address this deficiency in programme implementation.
