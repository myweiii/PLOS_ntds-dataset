Leprosy is a slow-progressing and extremely debilitating disease; the armadillo is the only animal model able to mimic the symptoms observed in humans. In addition, the causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae, is not cultivable in vitro. Due to these constraints the chain of transmission is still not yet completely understood. We know, however, that at least two animals, armadillos in the Americas and red squirrels in the UK, are natural reservoirs of the bacillus, although their role in disease epidemiology is unclear. This information raised the following question: Can ticks carry leprosy from wild animals to humans? In the present study we demonstrated that artificially-infected female cayenne ticks are able to transmit the bacillus to their offspring, which were then able to transmit it to rabbits during bloodfeeding. We were able to grow M. leprae in vitro in a tick cell line for the first time. We also generated the first transgenic M. leprae strain, making the pathogen fluorescent in order to monitor its viability in real time. We believe that this new methodology will boost the screening of new drugs useful for control of leprosy, as well as improving understanding of how M. leprae causes disease.
