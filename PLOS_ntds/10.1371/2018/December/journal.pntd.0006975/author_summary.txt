Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne infectious diseases worldwide. It is caused by one of four viruses, types 1â€“4, and ranges in severity from subclinical (mild or no symptoms) to dengue fever (febrile illness with headache and bone pain), or less frequently, dengue hemorrhagic fever, where patients experience leaky blood vessels, sometimes significant bleeding, and may be severe enough to cause death. While many risk factors have been associated with development of severe dengue, sequential infection with different virus types is a major factor, implying that the immune response generated after an initial infection is partly responsible for making subsequent exposure clinically worse. This study sought to identify profiles of immune markers that correlate with increased or decreased risk of dengue. Using samples from individuals ~5 months prior to dengue virus infection, who later experienced either subclinical infection or overt disease, we modeled virus exposure in vitro and compared the production of various immune proteins between the two outcome groups. Three of the proteins studied were produced at higher levels by subjects who subsequently had dengue, and six of the proteins were produced at higher levels by subjects who subsequently had subclinical infection. These results help define what constitutes beneficial versus potentially harmful immune responses, aiding in the design of effective dengue vaccines.
