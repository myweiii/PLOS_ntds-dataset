Vaccines represent an attractive tool in the fight against schistosomiasis. Pre-clinical immunization studies with the schistosome enzyme 28 kDa glutathione S-transferase (28GST) have shown a significant reduction of schistosome egg production and subsequent pathology. The objective of the present phase 3 trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of vaccination with the recombinant 28GST of Schistosoma haematobium (rSh28GST) named Bilhvax, in infected school children. After Praziquantel treatment before inclusion and three administrations of rSh28GST at one month interval as primo-vaccination, subjects received a boost injection one year after the first administration. The efficacy was evaluated as a delay of recurrence of urinary schistosomiasis. While immunological analysis showed that Bilhvax induced a consistent immune response characterized by antibodies able to inhibit 28GST enzymatic activity, the efficacy endpoint was not reached. This lack of significant effect may be due to the negative conjunction of a too challenging recurrence criterion associated with safety measures ensuring repeated PZQ treatment. The control of these main factors will be essential for the subsequent trials and must provide evidence of the Bilhvax efficacy as a safe vaccine against uro-genital schistosomiasis.
