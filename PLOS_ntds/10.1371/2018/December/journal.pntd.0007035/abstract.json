    "Background": "Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a systemic inflammatory complication occurring mainly in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL). Prednisolone is widely used for treatment of ENL reactions. However, it has been reported that prolonged treatment with prednisolone increases the risk for prednisolone-induced complications such as osteoporosis, diabetes, cataract and arteriosclerosis. It has been speculated that perhaps these complications result from lipid profile alterations by prednisolone. The effects of extended prednisolone treatment on lipid profiles in ENL patients have not been studied in leprosy patients with ENL reactions. Therefore, in this study we conducted a case-control study to investigate the changes in lipid profiles and serological responses in Ethiopian patients with ENL reaction after prednisolone treatment.",
    "Methods": "A prospective matched case\u2013control study was employed to recruit 30 patients with ENL and 30 non-reactional LL patient controls at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Blood samples were obtained from each patient with ENL reaction before and after prednisolone treatment as well as from LL controls. The serological host responses to PGL-1, LAM and Ag85 M. leprae antigens were measured by ELISA. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured by spectrophotometric method.",
    "Results": "The host antibody response to M. leprae PGL-1, LAM and Ag85 antigens were significantly reduced in patients with ENL reactions compared to LL controls after treatment. Comparison between patients with acute and chronic ENL showed that host-response to PGL-1 was significantly reduced in chronic ENL after prednisolone treatment. Untreated patients with ENL reactions had low lipid concentration compared to LL controls. However, after treatment, both groups had comparable lipid profiles except for LDL, which was significantly higher in patients with ENL reaction. Comparison within the ENL group before and after treatment showed that prednisolone significantly increased LDL and HDL levels in ENL patients and this was more prominent in chronic ENL than in acute patients with ENL.",
    "Conclusion": "The significantly increased prednisolone-induced LDL and TG levels, particularly in patients with chronic ENL reactions, is a concern in the use of prednisolone for extended periods in ENL patients. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring lipid profiles during treatment of patients to minimize the long-term risk of prednisolone-induced complications."
