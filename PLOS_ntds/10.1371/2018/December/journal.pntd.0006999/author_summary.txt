Many infectious diseases of public health concern, such as dengue, Zika and malaria, are transmitted by insect vectors. Control effort required to curb their continued spread or even prevent their establishment in the first place are partially determined by the disease’s basic reproduction number, R0. Of particular importance for estimating R0 is the duration at which the vector can transmit the disease, which is limited by its life expectancy. Many R0 estimation methods are based on mathematical frameworks that assume constant vector mortality rates. Here we demonstrate how the resulting exponential distribution in life-expectancy can lead to significant over-estimations. By means of an individual-based model we elucidate the effect of vector mortality on R0 estimates and derive a correction factor that alleviates some of the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. Our results clearly demonstrate the need to obtain more realistic, i.e. field-relevant vector mortality rates in order to generate robust estimates of a disease’s reproduction number and provide guidance for setting-specific disease control.
