Although rabies is almost always fatal after the symptom onset phase, it can be prevented by timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which involves passive antibody transfer and vaccination. One of the primary laboratory confirmatory tests for RABV infection is antigen detection, directed against the RABV encoded N protein using anti-N protein specific antibodies, in central nervous system (CNS) tissue samples of animals. This immuno-microscopy based detection utilizes either fluorescent tags (direct detection) or chromogenic substrates (indirect) in brain impressions from animals in which rabies is suspected. In this study, we explored the detection of N protein by a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based method that is label-free and does not require target amplification. The MS method specifically detected N protein in brain tissue and identified RABV variants based on amino acid sequence information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an N protein detection method that does not utilize either antibodies or microscopy. This method provides an alternative platform for the development of future rabies diagnostic tests.
