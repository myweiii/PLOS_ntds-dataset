Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important cause of mosquito-borne viral disease in humans worldwide. Investigating DENV seroprevalence in Kaohsiung City after the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan since World War II, we found an overall seroprevalence of 12.4% and heterogeneity in seroprevalence within a metropolis; this together with the low efficacy and potential disease enhancement of the currently available dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) in DENV-naive individuals highlighted the importance of checking the DENV immune status of individuals prior to Dengvaxia vaccination. The pattern of a sharp and significant increase in DENV seroprevalence in the 70â€“79 year age group in Kaohsiung City was different from that in the Americas and Southeast Asia, and suggested that a large proportion of monotypically immune individuals in that age group together with other risk factors may contribute to clinically severe dengue disease among the elderly in Taiwan.
