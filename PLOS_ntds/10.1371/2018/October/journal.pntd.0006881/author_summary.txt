Hantaviruses are responsible for a disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized by fever, headache, back pain, abdominal pain, hypotension, multi-systemic hemorrhage and acute renal failure in humans. China has the highest incidence of HFRS worldwide, accounting for 90% of global cases reported. Many factors can influence the incidence of HFRS, but the two main ones are related to the composition of the rodent community composition and the influence of the environment in the transmission of this disease. Here, we used a combination of 10-year (2006â€“2015) field surveillance on rodent reservoir of HFRS along with epidemiological and environmental data to investigate the factors related to the transmission of HFRS infections. Our results indicate that the occurrence of HFRS is influenced by the potential for rodent-to-human contact under different environmental conditions. Our findings, which offer novel insights into the networks used by hantavirus for transmission, could be used to optimize preventative interventions against HFRS disease.
