Infections with HIV and blood flukes (Schistosoma) both exert chronic modulatory effects on the host’s immune system. Coinfections, meaning the host is simultaneously infected with both pathogens, are common in sub-Saharan Africa. In this situation the induced immune modulation of one pathogen may affect the course of the disease induced by the other pathogen. One study showed that coinfection with Schistosoma in people living with HIV who begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have deleterious effects on the reconstitution of the HIV-induced immunosuppression. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Schistosoma coinfection on the recovery of the patient’s immune system, on the efficacy of ART to suppress HIV replication, and on a combined endpoint of lost to follow-up or death. We found that schistosomiasis may have beneficial effects on immune reconstitution, while no deleterious effect was detected on HIV-suppressive efficacy of ART. Surprisingly, our data suggest that schistosomiasis-induced immunomodulatory effects might be beneficial for survival and retention in care. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings. In the era of increasing access to ART in sub-Saharan Africa, the issue of schistosomiasis-HIV coinfection may have major consequences on the outcome of HIV treatment programs.
