Leprosy remains as a severe health problem in Brazil and its transmission in children under 15 years of age occurs mainly through intradomiciliary contacts. The number of leprosy cases in this age group is considered an important indicator for the surveillance of this disease. To understand how the epidemiological studies in Brazil have shown the situation of young people affected by leprosy, we performed a systematic review of the literature, searching for published articles about the situation of leprosy in this age group. We reviewed 22 studies published during 2001 to 2016 and concluded that the negative effects of leprosy still remain high in most of studied places in Brazil. This disease was more common in boys, aged between 10 to 14 years old, with a remarkable proportion of disabilities due to leprosy. These disabilities can limit their routine activities and reflect failure in the public medical care. We hope that our review should contribute to arguments in order to improve the control of this disease in children.
