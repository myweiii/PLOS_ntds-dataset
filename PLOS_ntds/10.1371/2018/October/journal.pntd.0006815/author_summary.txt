Our macrophages are equipped with the ability to detect and kill invading pathogens, and yet, these cells of the innate immune system are still subject to infection by intracellular bacterium. In particular, mycobacterium, the type of intracellular bacteria responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, are very successful at establishing infection within macrophages. By studying Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, we describe an immune evasion mechanism whereby this bacterial pathogen utilizes our own antiviral immune response against the macrophage. Type I interferons (IFN) are a major part of our immune response to viral infections; however, this response will also suppress our ability to fight opportunistic bacterial infection. During infection of our macrophages, M. leprae induces an aberrant type I IFN response that subsequently suppresses our macrophageâ€™s ability to activate the vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial pathway, a critical antimicrobial response for containment of mycobacterium. Thus, understanding how these pathogens can evade our immune response will be important for the development of new therapies against these chronic infections.
