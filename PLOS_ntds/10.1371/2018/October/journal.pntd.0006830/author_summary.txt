Treatment is one of key strategies for visceral leishmaniasis control and elimination. Historically a number of monotherapy drugs for VL treatment were used in India including pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB), and miltefosine (MF). With the limited number of drugs available there was a need to preserve existing drugs and to develop shorter and safer treatment regimens. Three short-course combination regimen including AmBisome, miltefosine and paromomycin have been evaluated in a phase III clinical trial conducted in India (2008â€“2010). All showed an excellent safety profile and an efficacy of at least 97% in controlled conditions. In 2010, WHO recommended the use of new short-course treatment regimens in kala-azar elimination efforts for the Indian subcontinent. Although phase 3 studies have shown excellent results, there remains a lack of evidence on a wider treatment population and the safety and effectiveness of these regimens under field conditions within national program settings. This study was implemented in field conditions with treatment provided by government doctors, providing further evidence for scaling up new regimens in national program contexts within the public health sector and contributing to national policy change in India.
