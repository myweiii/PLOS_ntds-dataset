The co-infection incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and neglected tropical infectious diseases such as Zika virus (ZIKV) is on the rise due to the large geographical overlap of populations exposed to both of these viruses. Thus, research on such co-infection is of particular importance. In this study, we investigated SIV/SHIV-ZIKV co-infection dynamics in adult non-pregnant Rhesus Macaques (RMs) chronically infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)â€”or chimeric simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). We found that post ZIKV inoculation, ZIKV plasma viral loads in co-infected macaques were similar to ZIKV alone-infected animals, and minimal changes were observed in cytokines/chemokines levels. Viral levels of SIV and SHIV also did not change as compared to pre-ZIKV inoculation levels. These findings thus suggest that co-infection may not alter disease pathogenesis of either HIV or ZIKV infections.
