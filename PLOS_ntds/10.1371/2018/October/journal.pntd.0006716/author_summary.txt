In this manuscript, I report the general knowledge regarding snakebite envenomation and its care before and after a two-day course that was organized in Yaounde, the capital city of Cameroon, in late 2015. Snakebite is a public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to antivenoms is dramatically insufficient. Anticipating the decision of the World Health Organization that added snakebite envenomations to the list of neglected tropical diseases in June 2017, Cameroon has joined the African Society of Venimology and several Non-Governmental Organizations, including Médecins sans Frontières, to put in place a national snakebite envenomation control strategy. The article describes the state of knowledge of health care workers who participated in the training about snakebite envenomations in Cameroon at the time of the launching of the National Snakebite Envenomation Control Program. It also describes the improvement of knowledge thanks to the training. In conclusion, the results obtained highlight the need for continuous training of the health care staff and capacity building over the next few years.
