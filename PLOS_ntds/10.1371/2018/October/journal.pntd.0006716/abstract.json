    "Background": "Snakebite has only recently been recognized as a neglected tropical disease by the WHO. Knowledge regarding snakebites and its care is poor both at the population level, and at the health care staff level. The goal of this study was to describe the level of knowledge and clinical practice regarding snakebite among health care staff from Cameroon.",
    "Methods": "A two-day training dedicated to snakebite and its care was organized in 2015 in Yaoundé, capital city of Cameroon. A total of 98 health care staff from all over Cameroon attended the training. Prior to and after the training, an evaluation quantified the attendees’ level of knowledge. Pre- and post-training evaluations were compared to assess knowledge improvement.",
    "Results": "Overall, prior to the training knowledge regarding snakebite and care was poor, and wrong beliefs that “pierre noire” or tourniquet were useful in case of snakebite were common. Knowledge was statistically improved after the training.",
    "Conclusion": "Trainings dedicated to all type of health care staff towards snakebite to improve care are needed, this training must take into consideration the context and the targeted population."
