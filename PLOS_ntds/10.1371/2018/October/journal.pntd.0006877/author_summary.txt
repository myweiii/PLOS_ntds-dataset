In arid regions of the southern United States and Mexico, tick-borne relapsing fever is primarily caused by Borrelia turicatae. The tick vector, Ornithodoros turicata, feeds indiscriminately on a variety of vertebrates; however, it is unclear which animals are competent hosts for B. turicatae. This study evaluates the exposure of small and medium sized mammals in Texas to B. turicatae and identifies likely hosts for the pathogens. This work will provide insight regarding mammals to target for surveillance to identify endemic foci and to better prevent human exposure.
