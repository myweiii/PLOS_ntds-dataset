Monocytes are key players during infection, and they leave the bloodstream and migrate into tissues in response to inflammatory signals. Although the recruitment of monocytes is essential for the effective control and clearance of microorganisms, they can also be highly damaging to neighboring tissues. Based on the expression of CD14 and CD16, monocytes are classified into classical, non-classical and intermediate subsets, all of which exert different functions. Because chronic T. cruzi infection induces a constant activation of the host immune system, inflammatory signals are exacerbated, possibly leading to alterations in the frequencies of monocyte subsets. In this study, we evaluated the monocyte profile in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected subjects with different degrees of cardiac dysfunction and explored whether this profile was similar between seropositive and seronegative subjects with heart failure. We found that the different clinical stages of chronic Chagas disease displayed distinct monocyte profiles, which are susceptible to being restored by modulating the parasite load with anti-parasite drug therapy. T. cruzi-infected subjects with severe cardiac disease displayed a profile of monocytes subsets suggestive of a more pronounced inflammatory environment compared with subjects suffering from heart failure not related to T. cruzi infection, supporting that parasite persistence might be a detrimental factor in the evolution of the cardiac disease induced by T. cruzi.
