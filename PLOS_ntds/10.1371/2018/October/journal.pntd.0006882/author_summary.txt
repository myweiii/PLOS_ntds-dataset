Dengue is considered the most significant mosquito-borne disease, globally. It is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti throughout most affected countries. In order to prevent dengue, most control efforts focus on removing Ae. aegypti from the environment, as currently there are no anti-viral treatment or WHO approved vaccine. Removing or destroying the breeding sites of Ae. aegypti is generally recommended. However, this may be difficult as the mosquito breeds in a wide variety of water holding containers readily available in the human environment. The urban areas of Southern Taiwan have experienced annual dengue epidemics for decades in spite of substantial efforts to control Ae. aegypti. In this study we investigated whether containers harboring the highest number of Ae. aegypti differ between all active aquatic stages (larvae and pupae) and the final aquatic stage (pupae only). In Kaohsiung City in Southern Taiwan, we found that more Ae. aegypti were predicted to be in containers on private property, compared with government property, when assessing all aquatic stages. However, for pupae only, more were found in indoor containers used for water storage when compared with outdoor water storage containers. For the specific category ‘other water receptacle’ such as flower pot saucers and water catchment buckets, the model predicted more pupae in outdoor containers compared with indoor containers. We recommend that future control efforts target these types of containers to reduce the risk of dengue transmission in Southern Taiwan.
