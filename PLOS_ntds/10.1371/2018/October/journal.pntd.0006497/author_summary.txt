Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide. Although several drug candidates have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, none has been effective, and early recognition of severe dengue and timely supportive care remain the only means to reduce mortality. While the first dengue vaccine was recently licensed, and several other candidates are in late stage clinical trials, future decisions regarding deployment of such vaccines or therapeutics will require evidence of product safety, efficacy and effectiveness. Standard, quantifiable clinical endpoints are needed to ensure reproducibility and comparability of research findings. To address this need, we established a working group of dengue researchers, vaccine developers, and public health specialists to develop endpoints. After two working group meetings and discussions at international meetings, the Delphi methodology was used to clarify and further develop endpoints such that 70% or greater agreement was reached on most endpoint definitions including moderate and severe plasma leakage, moderate and severe bleeding, acute hepatitis and acute liver failure, and moderate and severe neurologic disease. The process identified areas for further evaluation and standardization within the context of ongoing clinical studies. The endpoints can be used to harmonize data collection and improve comparability between dengue clinical trials.
