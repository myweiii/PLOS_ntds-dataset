Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease (CD), circulates among humans, vectors and domestic and wild reservoirs. Frequent invasion of housing by infected triatomines may present a risk of vector transmission from T. cruzi to humans. The objective of this study was to predict the potential distribution of triatomines in the State of Paraná and to infer potential high risk areas for T. cruzi vector transmission. Five distinct species of three different genera of triatomines were collected, the majority of which were Panstrongylus megistus (73% of occurrences). More than half of collected specimens (54.8%) were captured intradomicile. The infection rate was 24.7%, which may represent a risk of occurrence of new cases of CD by vector transmission. Ecological Niche Models indicated suitable areas to triatomine occurrence in municipalities of Northwest, North and Northeast of Paraná state. Thus, more effective management actions are needed to ensure epidemiological surveillance of CD. P. megistus is the main species that colonizes the intradomicile, reinforcing the importance of the maintenance of surveillance for directing vector control actions of the CD in the local health systems in this and similar regions, mainly in the northern region of the State of Paraná, with the intensive participation of the community and also of municipal agents.
