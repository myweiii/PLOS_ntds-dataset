In order to understand the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses in protection against infection, we studied T cell cytokine production in relation to clinical disease severity and resolution of viraemia in a large cohort of patients with varying severity of acute dengue infection. We found that DENV-specific T cell responses were higher in patients with dengue fever, when compared to those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. In addition, early appearance of DENV-specific T cell responses was significantly associated with milder clinical disease (p = 0.02). DENV peptide specific T cell responses inversely correlated with the degree of viraemia, which was most significant for DENV-NS3 specific T cell responses (Spearman’s r = -0.47, p = 0.0003). The frequency of NS1, NS5 and pooled DENV peptides, correlated with the degree of thrombocytopenia but had no association with liver transaminases. Our data suggest that early appearance of DENV-specific T cell IFNγ responses appear to associate with milder clinical disease and resolution of viraemia, suggesting a protective role in acute dengue infection.
