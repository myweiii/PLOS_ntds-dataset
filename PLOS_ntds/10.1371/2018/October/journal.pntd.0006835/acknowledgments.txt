We are grateful to Claudia Hartmann (ZMBH), who repeated several of the experiments and measured aminoglycoside susceptibility of the DKO and DKO+ lines. We would like to thank Dr. Susanna Kramer (Universität Würzburg) for the cell line with in situ YFP-tagged Tb927.8.3820. We are also thankful to David Ibberman from Bioquant CellNetworks Sequencing facility, for processing the RNA-Seq samples, and the Mass-spectrometry facility in the ZMBH, for processing all protein samples for this project. We thank Steffanie Heinze and Prof. Elmar Scheibel (ZMBH) for the kind gift of GBP-Sepharose beads, which we used for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments; and Kevin Leiss, who developed software for trypanosome RNA-Seq data analysis. We acknowledge Luise Krauth-Siegel (BZH, Heidelberg), Keith Gull (Oxford University, UK), Mark Carrington (University of Cambridge) and Susanna Kramer (Universität Würzburg) for plasmids and antibodies, and Luise Krauth-Siegel (Biochemie Zentrum Heidelberg) and Georg Stoecklin (Universität Mannheim) for useful discussions.
