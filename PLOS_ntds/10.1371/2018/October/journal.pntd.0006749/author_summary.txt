Many diseases such as typhoid fever, typhus, brucellosis and malaria show common symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain and back pain. Hence, in countries where there is a problem of appropriate laboratory based diagnostic tools, health workers cannot properly diagnose these diseases and provide appropriate treatment. A community- based studies of the causative agents of the above mentioned illness would provide important information for health workers about some of the common causative agents in that particular area. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of typhoid fever, typhus, brucellosis and malaria among individuals who were complaining illnesses such fever, headache, joint pain and back pain in the pastoral of the Amibara district, Afar Region, Ethiopia. Among 650 individuals who were complaining symptoms, 46 (7.3%), 88 (14.0%), 28 (4.4%) and 16 (2.5%) were diagnosed for typhoid fever, typhus, brucellosis and malaria in that order. However, for the majority of the participants (75.4%), the cause of their illness remained unknown, and further investigations on the causative agents of febrile illness related symptoms is important in the present study area.
