There was a large outbreak of typhoid fever in Kikwit, DRC, in late 2011. The outbreak started in military camps in the city but then spread to the general population. Multiple investigations were undertaken to understand how the disease spread. The worst affected areas of the city were mapped and compared to the water network. In early 2013, demographic and exposure data were collected for 320 cases and 640 controls residing in the worst affected areas, using a structured interview questionnaire to try to better understand individual risk factors. Residents of areas with water supplied via a gravity fed network were about six times more likely to have been ill with typhoid fever than residents of areas not supplied by the mains network. The most important individual risk factor was ever using tap water. Visible urine or faeces increased risk of getting typhoid but having chosen a water source because it is protected was linked to lower risk. Not handwashing and regularly sharing plates of food were also linked to less illness, but these findings may be especially subject to recall bias. The water network was also found to be heavily contaminated, including with faecal bacteria of human origin in multiple microbiological studies. Spatial, microbiological and case-control studies all implicate the water supplies in Kikwit to be unsafe and linked to spread of typhoid fever in 2011. Improvements to the mains water network in Kikwit are urgently needed to prevent future typhoid fever outbreaks.
