Although the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is an important assay for measuring neutralizing antibody responses against many viruses, no free, open-source programs specifically designed for virus plaque counting and neutralizing antibody titer estimation are available. We have developed Viridot, a package for R with a user-interface in shiny, which is designed for use by laboratory-based virologists and researchers with minimal coding experience. The program includes: automatic and user-specification of settings for plaque counting; saving of plaque counting settings; counting of many plates at once; and easy output of plaque counts, plaque sizes, and images with counted plaques circled. Viridot also includes programs to analyze plaque counts, including estimation of: neutralizing antibody titers, pfu/mL of a virus stock, and the dilution factor of virus needed for an experiment. Viridot can be used to standardize plaque-counting methods within and between laboratories, helping researchers formalize an important aspect of the PRNT method that is often subjective. Viridot thus provides laboratory researchers around the world with a free tool to improve the speed and consistency with which the PRNT is conducted, aiding the public health response to emerging viral diseases.
