Mosquito-borne flaviviruses include medically significant members such as the dengue viruses, yellow fever virus and Zika virus. These viruses regularly cause outbreaks globally, notably in tropical regions. The ability of mosquitoes to transmit these viruses to vertebrate hosts plays a major role in determining the scale of these outbreaks. It is essential to assess the risk of emergence of flaviviruses in a given region by investigating the vector competence of local mosquitoes for these viruses. Bamaga virus was recently discovered in Australia in Culex mosquitoes and shown to be related to yellow fever virus. In this article, we investigated the potential for Bamaga virus to emerge as an arthropod-borne viral pathogen by assessing the vector competence of Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens mosquitoes for this virus. We showed that Bamaga virus could be detected in the saliva of Cx. annulirostris after an infectious blood-meal, demonstrating that the virus could be horizontally transmitted. In addition, we showed that Bamaga virus could interfere with the replication in vitro and transmission in vivo of the pathogenic flavivirus West Nile virus. These data provide further insight on how interactions between viruses in their vector can influence the efficiency of pathogen transmission.
