Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes, and can cause elephantiasis. It is the world’s leading cause of disability due to infectious diseases, affects over 120 million people globally, and is scheduled for global elimination via mass drug administration (MDA) and mosquito control. Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) is a process of screening mosquitoes—not humans—for parasites to estimate whether they are circulating in human populations. MX is especially useful during and following MDA, when new case detection becomes difficult, but is challenging to design and conduct in cities. Using two study sites in the Recife Metropolitan Region, Brazil, we investigated two crucial questions for urban MX development—“What is the best operationally feasible tool to catch adult mosquitoes?” and “How far do mosquitoes disperse in cities?”—in order to determine placement of future surveillance sites. We also screened a proportion of mosquitoes and all eligible residents from the study sites for LF infection. We determined that handheld battery powered aspirators were the best mosquito collection tool; that mosquitoes flew no more than about 85m; and—in this small sample of mosquitoes and very small sample of humans—there was no evidence of LF infection in mosquitoes or study area residents.
