We extend our warmest thanks to the many participants, communities, staff from the Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical Services, and community health workers who generously contributed to the field study conducted in Fiji in 2013. We also thank Scott B Craig, Mary-Anne Burns, and Sarah Wynwood at the WHO/FAO/OIE Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Leptospirosis (at Health Support Queensland, Department of Health, Brisbane, Australia) for providing the laboratory support for the field study. We also thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback.
