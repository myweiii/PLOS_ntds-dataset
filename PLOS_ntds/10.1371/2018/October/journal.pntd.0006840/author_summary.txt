The World Health Organization aims to eradicate yaws using mass drug administration (MDA), which consists of treating everyone in an administrative unit with antibiotics. Prevalence assessments are used to identify endemic communities for mass treatment programs, but the spatial scale (eg, village, sub-district, district, or province) at which mass treatment should be implemented is currently unclear. The administrative unit which is used as the basis for making decisions about implementing MDA is called the implementation unit. For example, if the implementation unit is the sub-district, then public health officials must determine for each sub-district whether MDA is warranted. All villages in the same sub-district will necessarily have the same treatment status, whereas all sub-districts in the same district need not share a treatment status. The choice of implementation unit depends on many factors; one of these is the underlying transmission patterns of the disease. Using data from Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, we found that geographic clusters of yaws often spanned multiple villages. These clusters likely reflect transmission of the disease across village boundaries and suggest that it may be best to implement MDA at a spatial scale larger than the individual village, for example at sub-district level.
