We previously reported that Clonorchis sinensis newly excysted juveniles (CsNEJs) were chemotactically attracted to bile. However, there is still a paucity of information regarding which components and what concentration of bile induce the chemotactic behavior. Here, we show, among various bile components tested, two have opposing chemotactic influences on the CsNEJs; cholic acid was characterized as a chemoattractant and lithocholic acid as a chemorepellent. Chemorepulsive migration was dependent on the concentration of lithocholic acid. Notably, the ratio (25:1) of cholic acid and lithocholic acid plays a critical role in defining chemotactic preferences of CsNEJs. We suspect that this bile acid ratio directs the parasites in the mammalian host, i.e. the high concentration of lithocholic acid in the gallbladder bile may repel CsNEJs from entering it. Bile in the hepatic bile duct has a chemoattractive level of cholic acid but a trace amount of lithocholic acid. These findings may explain why the CsNEJs preferentially migrate to the common and hepatic bile ducts rather than the gallbladder. Deeper understanding on the parasitism of the liver fluke is likely to have major implications for the studies on other parasites.
