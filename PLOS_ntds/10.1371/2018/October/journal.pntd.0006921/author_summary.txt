Leishmania protozoan parasites are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, neglected tropical diseases with clinical manifestations ranging from self-limiting cutaneous lesions to invasive disease involving multiple organs. During blood-feeding by an infected sand fly, Leishmania parasites are transmitted to human hosts where they establish long-term infection in cells such as macrophages. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which Leishmania parasites replicate and persist in macrophages may identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of leishmaniasis. Using genetically-altered Leishmania parasites, cell-culture approaches, and a mouse model of Leishmania infection and disease, we found that a normal level of Leishmania superoxide dismutase B1 (SODB1) is necessary for Leishmania major persistence in macrophages and for virulence in mice. This work contributes new knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms of Leishmania major infection and suggests that SODB1 may be an efficacious therapeutic target.
