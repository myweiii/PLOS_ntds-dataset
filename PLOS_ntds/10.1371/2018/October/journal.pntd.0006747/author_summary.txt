Since the mid-1980â€™s, when Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) was formally targeted for eradication, the associated national and international efforts to control and eliminate the parasite have been remarkably successful. As of 2017, 16 of the 21 countries with endemic transmission have been certified free of the disease by World Health Organization, and one country (Sudan) is in the pre-certification stage. However, recent and unprecedented prevalence of apparent Guinea worm infection in Chadian dogs has caused concern. That this seemingly sudden emergence in non-human hosts also coincided with an apparent reemergence of infection among humans in Chad after almost 10 years without reported cases raised questions about the population history of Guinea worm in Chad and whether worms from human and non-human hosts were, in fact, the same species. To address these questions, we characterized the genetic variation in Guinea worms collected from various host species and locations in Chad and in the other three endemic countries. Genetic variation was measured in adult female worms using sequence variation of mitochondrial DNA genes and repeat number polymorphism at 23 nuclear microsatellite loci. We found that, regardless of host species, all worms sampled from the remaining endemic countries in Africa are D. medinensis and show no evidence of isolated transmission on the basis of host species.
