Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging threat to human health worldwide. In 2007, a ZIKV outbreak was reported in the Yap Island of Micronesia and was the first outbreak outside Africa and Asia. In 2013 and 2014, another ZIKV outbreak was reported in French Polynesia, and more than 28,800 people were infected by ZIKV. In 2015, the first ZIKV outbreak in America was reported in Brazil; the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which was geographically and temporally correlated with the ZIKV outbreak. Recent evidence demonstrated that ZIKV infection leads to severe syndromes, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and microcephaly in adults and infants, respectively. Thus far, anti-ZIKV drugs and vaccines have not been developed yet. Moreover, the underlying mechanism of ZIKV pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we propose a small animal model of wild-type ZIKV infection and associated neurological disorders. In the animal model, ZIKV causes signs of illness and neurological disease, potentially emulating the hallmark of ZIKV infection in human. These features can be used to study the underlying mechanism of ZIKV pathogenesis. The newly developed Zika disease model provides an immunocompetent and time saving framework for development of drugs against ZIKV and ZIKV-caused diseases.
