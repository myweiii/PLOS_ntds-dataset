Snake envenoming affects approximately 2.5 million people and causes more than 100,000 deaths annually. The WHO includes envenoming as a category A Neglected Tropical Disease. Therapy involves intravenous delivery of animal-derived antivenoms, constituted by IgG from the plasma of mammals immunized with venom. Antivenoms are species-specific, expensive and suffer the limitations of a biological therapy. There are no broad-spectrum antivenoms. The work describes hope for treatment of snakebite, a broad-spectrum antivenom comprised polymer nanoparticles (NPs) engineered to sequester the major protein toxins in elapid snakes. The stable, low-cost NPs can be administered subcutaneously immediately after the bite at the site of envenoming to halt or reduce the extent of local tissue damage and mitigate the systemic distribution of toxins post-envenoming.
