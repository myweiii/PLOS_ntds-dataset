During the 2014 West-African Ebola Virus Disease epidemic, the Ebola-Tx clinical trial in Guinea aimed to determine whether the administration of Ebola antibodies from the blood plasma of Ebola survivors could increase Ebola patientsâ€™ survival rate. Ebola-Tx was the first trial to solicit and evaluate blood-product donation as an experimental treatment on a large scale in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this qualitative study, part of the Ebola-Tx study, we report on factors of motivation and demotivation influencing Ebola survivors to donate their plasma. Understanding these factors is essential as the successful recruitment of this specific subgroup, providing the therapy itself, directly impacts the effectiveness of such a trial. We show that organizing an effective and ethical donation system requires directly engaging with emerging social barriers at the interface between pre-existing social dynamics, the impact of the disease, and the consequent emergency response including the trial set-up. These results provide insights that can be useful for future plasma trials but also for emergency clinical trials as part of general epidemic preparedness.
