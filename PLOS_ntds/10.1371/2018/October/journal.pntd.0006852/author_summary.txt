Control of schistosome infections is through treatment of infected people with a single dose of the anti-helminth drug praziquantel (PZQ) which is safe, highly efficacious, and can reverse schistosome-related morbidity particularly in the early stages of disease progression. However pre-school children are normally excluded due to the belief that these children are not sufficiently exposed to infective water to experience high infection rates. This could lead to clinical manifestation of the disease and the lack of safety data on praziquantel in this age group. Due to this we investigated the safety, efficacy and acceptability of praziquantel in Kwale County, Kenya. We examined urine samples from 400 preschool children. They were treated with crushed praziquantel (40mg/kg) mixed with orange juice and the efficacy of the treatment was determined 5 weeks after treatment. Acceptability was determined by whether the child spat and/ or vomited the treatment through the direct observed treatment (DOT).No child spat or vomited during treatment. Safety of the treatment was assessed by interviewing the parents of the treated children for adverse events (e.g., abdominal pain, dizziness, and headache). The treatment was well tolerated and most of the parasites were cleared by praziquantel.
