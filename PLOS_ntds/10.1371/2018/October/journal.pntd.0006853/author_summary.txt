There is an urgent need to develop innovative medicines addressing neglected diseases, multi-drug resistance and other unmet therapeutic needs. To create new drug design opportunities, we attempted to exploit protein functional motions by using a rational approach to model structural intermediates of a therapeutic target. After successfully designing inhibitors based on modeled intermediates of T. Cruzi proline racemase, the determination of crystal structures of the target protein in complex with the inhibitors revealed conformations that were strikingly close to the predicted models. Thus, beyond the discovery of compounds establishing a novel mode of action that can lead to innovative treatments of Chagas disease, we illustrate how modeling protein functional motions can be exploited in a rational approach to create opportunities in drug design.
