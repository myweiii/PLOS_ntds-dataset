Onchocerciasis has recently been targeted for elimination in Côte d’Ivoire. With support of international donors the country’s integrated Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) program has recently achieved 100% geographical coverage for mass drug administration in districts endemic for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. From 1975 to 1991 onchocerciasis control in Côte d’Ivoire was based on weekly aerial spraying of insecticide on targeted rivers. From 1992 to present, community directed treatment with ivermectin by community drug distributors was implemented in most endemic areas. Although the country experienced periods of civil disturbance that interrupted distribution of ivermectin for several years, significant progress was made during this time toward onchocerciasis elimination. There have been significant reductions in both microfilarial prevalences and community microfilarial loads in sentinel villages that had implementation of vector control and/or mass drug administration coverage rates of at least 65%. Although onchocerciasis persists in some areas, changes in management of the programme in 2015 together with improved political stability and increased support from key donors may lead to its elimination over the next 10 years.
