Rhodnius prolixus together with other blood-feeding bugs of the Triatominae family are primary vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the Chagas disease. It has been estimated that 7â€“8 million people are affected by this life-threatening illness worldwide, which makes the Chagas disease one of the most neglected tropical diseases. In this study, we describe the transcriptome of previtellogenic stages of Rhodnius oogenesis. Furthermore, by using a combination of molecular biology techniques and functional analyses we show that central components of the piRNA pathway are conserved in this species. The piRNA pathway guarantees genomic stability in the germ cells of organisms as distant as flies and mice. In accordance, we find that the knock-down of the piwi genes, which form the backbone of the pathway, results in partial or complete female adult sterility in Rhodnius. Our data will help improve the annotation of the Rhodnius genome and provide a framework for the development of novel techniques aiming at the eradication of Rhodnius prolixus and other Triatomine species from the infested areas. The achievement of this goal will ultimately prevent the transmission of trypanosomes to humans and reduce or eliminate the diffusion of the Chagas disease.
