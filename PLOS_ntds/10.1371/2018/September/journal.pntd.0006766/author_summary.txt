The soil-transmitted helminths Ascaris lumbricoides and the hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale) are the most prevalent intestinal helminths of humans. The standard approach for geohelminth control is large-scale preventive chemotherapy predominantly using benzimidazoles through mass drug administration. Nevertheless, this inexpensive and highly effective strategy can potentially select subpopulations of parasites that become resistant to treatment. In veterinary parasites, intensive reliance on the same anthelmintics has led to the emergence of benzimidazole resistance, but this is not yet proven to helminth parasites of humans. Here we describe a PCR-RFLP approach for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detection at codons 167 and 198 in the beta-tubulin gene of A. lumbricoides, and SNPs at codons 198 and 200 in the beta-tubulin gene of N. americanus of Brazilian populations. A. lumbricoides samples showed no mutations in any codons, and mutation at codons 198 and 200 were observed at low frequencies in N. americanus. The observed data posit important public health issues: the mutations are a substrate for selective pressure and a long-term mass drug administration could allow to the selection of parasites resistant to benzimidazole in Brazil.
