Head lice and scabies are both caused by ectoparasites and lead to itchy skin conditions that are associated with secondary bacterial infections and social stigma. Both are common in developing countries. In the Solomon Islands, mass treatment of communities using ivermectin (at dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram) has been shown to be an effective strategy in reducing scabies prevalence. This study shows that the same dose of ivermectin and the same regime of mass drug administration is also effective at reducing the burden of head louse infestation, offering an additional benefit to community wide treatment.
