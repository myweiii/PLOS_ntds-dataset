Rabies is a fatal viral disease. Transmitted mostly by dog bites, human rabies continues to be a substantial public health problem, especially in poorer countries. In Côte d’Ivoire, rabies is common and remains largely uncontrolled, but the true number of human rabies cases is unknown, so the magnitude of the problem remains unclear, complicating efforts to control this zoonosis. Data on human rabies cases in Côte d’Ivoire are collected by the National Institute of Public Health through a network of 28 NIPH local units. These NIPH local units provide rabies vaccine to people that may have been exposed to rabies virus. During 2014, the NIPH initiated a program to reinforce the rabies surveillance system in those NIPH local units, with specific goals of improving the infrastructure, training, communication and government involvement. Here, we describe the results of these efforts during 2014–2016. The reinforced surveillance system yielded detailed data about animal exposures and human rabies cases. This study confirmed the suspicion that many people who receive rabies prophylaxis do not finish the full set of vaccinations, putting them at unnecessary risk. Thus, the reinforcements represent an advance, but further improvements to the surveillance system are needed.
