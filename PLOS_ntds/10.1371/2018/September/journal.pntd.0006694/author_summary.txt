Several species of the genus Leptospira cause leptospirosis, a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans (zoonosis). Leptospirosis is the most extended zoonosis worldwide, with over a million human cases each year. Leptospira spp. infect a broad range of wildlife and domestic animals, including cattle. In several South American countries beef and dairy exports rank among the most important national income sources, explaining why in Uruguay cattle outnumber human population by a factor of 4. Yet, we did not know which Leptospira species and serovariants (serovars) circulate among Uruguayan cattle. Current serologic diagnostic methods and whole killed-cell vaccination approaches, critically depend on using the proper serovars, which are hugely variable in Leptospira spp. from different regions of the world. Through a multidisciplinary consortium effort, we now report the isolation and typing of 40 strains of pathogenic Leptospira spp. An unexpectedly large variation in terms of species and serovars was found. These data are extremely important: 1- to improve diagnostics by updating the available reference antigen panels; 2- to evaluate the efficacy of novel vaccines; and, 3- to implement efficacious bovine vaccination as a means of reducing the incidence of bovine and human leptospirosis.
