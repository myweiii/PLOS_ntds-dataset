The CRISPR/Cas9 system, based on the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea against viral infections, has been adapted and has rapidly emerged as a very effective genetic engineering tool in many organisms. Although great advances on gene editing in the medical entomology field have arisen, no attempts have been reported in sand flies, the vectors of Leishmania spp. Leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected parasitic diseases with twelve million people affected worldwide. Despite their importance as disease vectors, sand fly genetics and molecular studies are limited when compared to other insects. In this article, gene editing strategies used in mosquitoes and other model insects have been adapted to work with sand flies, providing the tools and relevant information for adapting embryo microinjection techniques to sand flies, an essential step in a successful gene editing experiment. We believe gene editing in sand flies will provide essential information of medical and veterinary relevance on the biology of these vectors, and will further a better understanding of vector-parasite-host interactions.
