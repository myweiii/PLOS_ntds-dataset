Although the implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) multidrug therapy (MDT) treatment has drastically reduced the number of registered leprosy cases, new case detection rates have stabilized over the last decade, and leprosy remains an important health problem in many regions. Antigen-specific immune diagnostic tools are helpful for leprosy diagnosis but require broad evaluation in different populations from areas with hyperendemic leprosy. The NDO-LID Rapid Test, M. leprae antigen-specific ELISA and antigen-specific secretion of IFN-γ in a whole blood assay (WBA) can be used to diagnose multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy patients. The authors found that in Honghe Autonomous Prefecture,Yunnan Province, China, the NDO-LID Rapid Test and M. leprae antigen-specific ELISA have the potential to be used as tools to assist in the diagnosis of patients with MB leprosy. The NDO-LID Rapid Test has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than the M. leprae antigen-specific ELISA. M. leprae antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion in WBA exhibited diagnostic value for distinguishing PB from TB but not for distinguishing PB from HHC or EC. This study provides an evaluation of antigen-specific immune responses for leprosy diagnosis in a hyperendemic area in China.
