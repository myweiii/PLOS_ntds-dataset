As tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives’ economy, this country recognizes the importance of controlling mosquito-borne diseases in an environmentally responsible manner. This study sought to estimate the economic costs of dengue in this Small Island Developing State of 417,492 residents with an annual average of 1,543 reported symptomatic dengue cases. Overall, the cost of dengue illness in the Maldives in 2015 was $3 million ($6.10 per resident) and surveillance cost an additional $1 million ($3.27 per resident). The risk of dengue lowers the country’s gross annual income by $110 per resident and its annual tax receipts by $14 per resident. Rigorous elimination of debris on some resort islands demonstrates effective and environmentally sound vector control. Many innovative vector control efforts are affordable and could decrease future costs of dengue illness in the Maldives.
