Dengue, chikungunya and Zika are a group of rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases worldwide. These arboviral diseases have received increasing attention in Mozambique as a consequence of recent dengue outbreaks, which occurred in the northern region. There has also been an increase in the number of cases of chikungunya reported in the country. Additionally, earlier evidence obtained from neutralizing antibodies against Zika revealed an overall prevalence of 4% in 249 individuals (142 adults and 107 children) sampled from 22 localities across Mozambique in the 1950â€™s. These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by the bites of infected Aedes (Stegomyia) females, especially Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. However, data on the distribution and the bio-ecology of both Aedes species are scarce. This lack of information is a major barrier for the implementation of public health interventions to prevent Aedes-borne arbovirus infections. In this study, we investigated the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in 32 districts of Mozambique. We found Ae. aegypti in every district sampled, although with heterogeneous abundance, while Ae. albopictus had limited occurrence. Aedes aegypti breeding sites varied among districts. The predominant containers were used tires, cement tank and drums, all present at high densities in central and northern Mozambique. This is the first study that investigates the distribution of breeding sites and abundance of Aedes spp. in a large number of districts in Mozambique and provides relevant baseline data for the establishment of a vector surveillance and control interventions for arboviruses in the country.
