This study considers the feasibility of engaging rural Ethiopian youth as lay health workers (LHWs) with the objective to improve community understanding of the joint influences of genetics and environment on health. Identifying LHWs to accurately convey contributors to the heritable but preventable neglected tropical disease of podoconiosis provides an optimal context to address this question. Misunderstanding that inherited susceptibility to podoconiosis makes the disease unavoidable has led to numerous negative social consequences (e.g., stigma) and poor uptake of protective footwear. We report data from a pilot study that included a cross-sectional survey of youth ages 15–24 in rural communities with endemic podoconiosis. Results provide preliminary support that a sizeable group of youth hold accurate knowledge about gene x environment influences and self-evaluate as being confident to explain these associations to others. Research to evaluate strategies to engage youth as LHWs and the impact of these approaches on communities’ understanding of the joint influences of genetics and environment in this context is needed. This manuscript fills an important gap in the literature about neglected tropical diseases, as it suggests opportunities to improve the prevention of podoconiosis and reduce misconceptions and stigma through engagement of LHWs in Ethiopia.
