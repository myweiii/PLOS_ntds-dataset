This study focuses on Chagas disease (CD) prevention in southern Ecuador. This region has a high rate of triatomine infestation. We used the Health Belief Model (HBM) to understand why people do or do not engage in CD preventive behaviors, particularly those related to home improvement. Additionally, we wanted to learn how to communicate most effectively about CD prevention. We gathered information about community member’s perceptions of CD in four focus groups, with a total of 26 participants. Our results indicate that communities do not see triatomines and CD as a threat. Lack of structures, cost, and convenience were the three key barriers mentioned by research participants for implementing CD preventive behaviors. However, participants were open to work with prevention programs since they saw it as an opportunity for community members to work together under the motivation of improving their living conditions. Capitalizing on motivators and removing barriers will be important for subsequent communication campaigns. Messages evoking fear of triatomine bugs and CD will contradict participants’ personal experience; instead, messages focusing how these behaviors will improve communities’ quality of life, protect their families, and strengthen their relationship with the land, will be more acceptable and appealing.
