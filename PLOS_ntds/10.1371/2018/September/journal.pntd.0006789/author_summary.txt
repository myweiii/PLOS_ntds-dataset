Despite elimination efforts, the reported number of new leprosy patients has been relatively stable during the past decade throughout the world. Solid evidence exists that individuals living in close proximity to patients are at an increased risk of developing leprosy, thus identifying the contact individuals who are at a higher risk of developing leprosy is an important aspect of disease control. In the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple genetic variants associated with leprosy in the Chinese population, however, the combined impact of these variants for leprosy risk prediction remains unclear. The goal of our study was to utilize the genetic variants to construct a risk prediction model in a Chinese set, and further assess the performance of the model in identifying higher-risk contact subjects in an independent set. We developed risk prediction models for leprosy based on GRS encompassing 25 GWAS-derived variants with good discriminatory capability (AUC = 0.743). When compared to the individuals in the high-risk group (GRS > 28.06) and low-risk group (GRSâ‰¤18.17), the former had a 24.65 times higher risk for developing leprosy than the latter, which demonstrated a considerable value for risk stratification in leprosy. Our results may assist physicians to identify higher-risk leprosy contact subjects for disease interventions.
