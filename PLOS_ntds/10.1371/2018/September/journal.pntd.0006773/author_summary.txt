Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. The expansion of dengue viruses to different parts of the world has been accelerated by the increase in worldwide travel and trade. In this study, we present the results of a laboratory-based dengue surveillance in Taiwan during 2011â€“2016. A total of 1,596 laboratory-confirmed imported dengue cases were identified. The travelers were infected in 29 countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region, Latin America, Australia and Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of the envelope gene sequences of 784 imported dengue virus isolates suggest that the DENV-1 genotype I and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype comprise the predominant serotype/genotype DENV strains circulating in Southeast Asia. Our results also showed that geographical restrictions of some of the DENV genotypes are becoming blurred, indicating the extensive introductions and continuous expansions of DENV strains between countries in Southeast Asia. In addition, we demonstrated dengue outbreaks in Taiwan caused by viruses imported from Asia and the Americas. The DENV envelope gene sequences from this study will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic evolution, dynamic transmission and global expansion of dengue viruses.
