We are very grateful to the communities of the study areas for their collaboration in the study and to the regional health services of the East, Northwest and Southwest regions for their active collaboration. We would like to thank the Cameroon National Programme for Onchocerciasis Control at the Ministry of Public Health for facilitating this work administratively.
