Cholera remains a major public health issue among underprivileged populations in the developing world. Current methods of disease surveillance are inadequate for identifying key populations at highest risk of cholera. Serosurveillance can provide accurate measurements of an individual or populationâ€™s exposure to cholera infection or oral cholera vaccine (OCV) induced immunity, though they require venous blood draw and stringent processing needs. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these challenges, acting as a portable surveillance tool suitable for field use. We developed a drop-plate culture method for evaluating vibriocidal and cholera-specific isotype responses using DBS from OCV-immunized volunteers from South Sudan. Blood equivalent to only two drops were spotted on Whatman Protein Saver (WPS) DBS cards. Vibriocidal titers from WPS eluates determined by drop-plate culture methods correlated well with serum based assays. In addition, by using DBS cards capable of automatic separation of serum from blood, we demonstrate that vibriocidal titers and V. cholerae polysaccharide antibody responses could be measured by conventional spectrophotometric methods and that these responses are stable over a range of storage temperatures. In summary, we show that cholera-specific immune responses can be measured using DBS, providing a potential tool for large-scale serosurveillance field studies for cholera.
