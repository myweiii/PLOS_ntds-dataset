West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are two emerging mosquito-borne arboviruses mainly transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. WNV considered one of the most important causative agent of viral encephalitis has a wide distribution in many tropical and temperate countries including the Middle East. RVFV is mainly distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa but epizootics were also reported in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The mosquito vector belongs to the Culex pipiens species which includes two biotypes: pipiens and molestus. Both biotypes are the most widely distributed mosquitoes in Lebanon. Using experimental infections of mosquitoes, our study showed that Cx. pipiens populations collected in West Bekaa were susceptible to infection by these two viruses and ensured efficient transmission of WNV and to a lesser extent, RVFV. Our findings may help to prepare a control strategy more adapted to these mosquito vectors.
