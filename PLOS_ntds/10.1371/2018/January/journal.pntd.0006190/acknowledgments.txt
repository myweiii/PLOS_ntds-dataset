The authors thank Josephine E. Clark-Curtiss and David G. Smith for providing M. leprae DNA samples; Charlotte Payne, Gary Aronson, Brenda Bradley, and David Watts for providing the chimpanzee fruit wadge samples; Scott Larsen for veterinary assistance; Teague Oâ€™Mara and Stephanie Meredith for providing the ring-tailed lemur buccal swab samples; Nicholas Banovich and Danielle Johnson for help with DNA extractions and qPCR assays; and Crystal Hepp and Andrej Benjak for bioinformatics advice. Genomic DNA from M. leprae strains NHDP (NR-19350), Br4923 (NR-19351), and Thai-53 (NR-19352) was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. M. leprae whole-genome baits were provided by MYcroarray, Ann Arbor, MI. The raw sequence data generated by this study have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under study SRP112601.
