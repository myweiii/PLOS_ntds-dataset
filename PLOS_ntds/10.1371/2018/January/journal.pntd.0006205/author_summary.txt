Globally, one-quarter of children under the age of five are affected by poor linear growth, known as stunting. Interventions, including giving children supplemental foods or improving hygiene to prevent diarrhea, have only been partially successful at restoring normal growth. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a disease characterized by damage to the lining of the small intestine and is thought to contribute to stunting, though the exact mechanism is still unclear. EED was first diagnosed by removing samples of the intestinal lining and analyzing them under a microscope; however, these procedures are costly and invasive, and recent research has focused on discovering easier ways to identify EED. These tests focus on the many interconnected aspects of EED, including damage and function of the intestinal wall, inflammation, and presence of pathogenic bacteria outside the gut. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence of relationships between each aspect of EED and stunting. We found the most evidence for the relationship between inflammation and stunting, but less evidence for the relationship between stunting and the presence of pathogenic bacteria outside the gut. Our results suggest that EED may be more complex than previously conceived and that some frequently used EED tests may need reconsideration.
