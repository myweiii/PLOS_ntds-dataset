Over the past years, more attention has been brought to neglected tropical diseases including lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. The latter are caused by helminthic parasites and lead to chronic and debilitating symptoms and present a major health burden that also affects the economy of endemic countries. It has been suggested that disease elimination may be possible but an accelerated implementation of proven and cost-effective interventions are needed if the targets for elimination are to be achieved. Recently, an indirect mode of action has been identified, targeting bacterial Wolbachia endosymbionts within the filariae, which also kills the adult parasites, an advantage over the drug currently used for mass drug administration, i.e. ivermectin. Doxycycline has been successfully used in clinical trials, however due to its long regimen as well as restrictions of use in children and pregnant women new drugs or drug combinations are required that overcome these obstacles. Here, we present the filarial parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis as suitable model for the preclinical testing of anti-wolbachial drugs against filariae and show that combinations of already registered drugs with anti-wolbachial efficacy are able to reduce the treatment time dramatically.
