Dengue is a re-emerging disease caused by dengue viruses (DENV) and half of the world’s population is now at risk of dengue infection. DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to the potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The molecular mechanisms that trigger transition from DF to DHF are not well understood. To gain insights on the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis, we performed metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical phase of infection (5–7 days after onset of fever), the time point when the clinical symptoms of DHF become more evident. 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF were identified, allowing us to discover a variety of metabolite pathways linked to DHF. They include bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, phospholipid catabolism, tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism, and so on. The results advance our understanding on the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis, and certain altered pathways being harnessed as therapeutic targets to alleviate DHF. These differentially expressed metabolites have the potential as biomarkers for disease monitoring and evaluation of therapeutic interventions.
