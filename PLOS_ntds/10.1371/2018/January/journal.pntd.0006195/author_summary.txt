Soil-transmitted helminth infections affect 1.5 billion people worldwide and mass drug adminstration (MDA) is one of the key public health measures for reducing the burden of infection. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated links between temperature and the dynamics of Ascaris spp. eggs, which are exposed to the environment during maturation. Field studies in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia and South Korea have demonstrated seasonal variation in reinfection rates; in Sri Lanka significant correlations were found between reinfection and both temperature and the number of wet days recorded. The impact of these variations on transmission, and therefore control, are unknown. Using a deterministic macroparasite model we demonstrate that seasonal changes in maturation and death rates of free-living stages, as well as transmission, could result in large seasonal swings in the infective larval population and mean worm burden in the human population. Although the seasonal effects are likely to vary between species of STH due to disparate life-cycles, this could have large knock-on consequences for timings of MDA programs and expected public health outcomes for A. lumbricoides infections in certain settings, indicating the need for further investigation in this area.
