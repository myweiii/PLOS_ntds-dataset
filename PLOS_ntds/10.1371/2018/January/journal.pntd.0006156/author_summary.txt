Though NTS is normally associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, it is a leading cause of bloodstream infection in Africa. The biological mechanisms that contribute to invasiveness in NTS in Africa are unclear. In this paper we address which specific host and pathogen risk factors are associated with blood stream infection from non-typhoidal Salmonella in rural Kenya. We found that multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of NTS were associated with NTS bacteremia, even after controlling for known host-factors including HIV, age, and NTS serogroup (a taxonomic grouping). Our results suggest that multi-drug resistant NTS is associated with blood stream infection even in the immune-competent host. Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type ST313, an emerging genotype in sub-Saharan Africa, was the most common cause of blood stream infection in children and adults, followed by Salmonella Enteritidis sequence type ST11. The increasing prevalence of commonly circulating non-typhoidal Salmonella poses a major challenge to the control of highly pathogenic NTS serovars. The specific biological and epidemiological mechanisms driving invasiveness from infection with drug-resistant NTS warrant further investigation.
