Soil-transmitted helminths are categorised as a neglected tropical disease and comprise four dominant species (two hookworms, Trichuris trichuria & Ascaris lumbricoides) that affect the poorest people in the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has made great strides in reducing the morbidity induced by STH infections in pre-school aged and school-aged children through mass drug administration. Many countries are now considering moving from morbidity reduction in school-aged children to community-wide treatment with the aim of transmission elimination. These helminths reproduce sexually within a human host and therefore both male and female worms must be present to produce fertilized eggs. The density of female and male worms below which mating success is too low to sustain parasite populations is defined as the ‘breakpoint’ in transmission. Both the prevalence and intensity of infection are very low as this breakpoint is approached when worm numbers are highly aggregated in their distribution within the human host population. Consequently, it becomes increasingly challenging to identify infected individuals using standard microscopic diagnostic tools (such as Kato-Katz). New and more sensitive molecular diagnostics tools, such as qPCR, are a necessity in settings where communities are moving towards the interruption of transmission. This paper demonstrates that the threshold to declare interruption of transmission is 50% lower when microscopic techniques are applied compared with molecular techniques.
