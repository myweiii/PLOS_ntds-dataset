The DeWorm3 Project is a series of randomized clinical trials testing the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths. We have integrated implementation science research questions into the trials in order to optimize delivery of trial interventions as well as to speed the translation of study evidence into relevant policy and practice. DeWorm3 implementation science research will take place at baseline (formative research), midline (process research), and endline (summative research). DeWorm3 will use stakeholder mapping and network analysis, qualitative data collection via individual interviews and focus groups, structural readiness surveys, process mapping, and economic evaluation methods to assess opportunities to maximize intervention effectiveness, evaluate the efficiency of the intervention relative to the standard-of-care, and identify strategies for sustaining, scaling, and replicating effective components of trial interventions. The implementation science research described in this protocol will be helpful to policy makers and program implementers who aim to use DeWorm3 findings to inform guidelines and routine programmatic activities. The DeWorm3 implementation science protocol is also relevant to researchers interested in incorporating implementation hypotheses into their own clinical research studies.
