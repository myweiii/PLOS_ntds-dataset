We describe a model of a mobile laboratory co-located at an Ebola treatment unit (ETU) equipped with GeneXpert molecular diagnostic platform and automated qRT-PCR test for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The laboratory contributed significantly to the EVD response in Liberia, including supporting surveillance, outbreak detection, contact tracing and management of confirmed cases. The laboratory was run by local laboratory technicians as opposed to international experts on short missions, making it a more sustainable option in prolonged outbreaks and early recovery phases. The redeployment and strategic placement of these GeneXpert instruments to complement EVD isolation facilities throughout the country has strengthened preparedness and response capabilities for future EVD outbreaks in Liberia.
