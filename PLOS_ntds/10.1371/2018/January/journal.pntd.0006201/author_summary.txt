Rhinoscleroma is a human specific chronic infection characterized by the formation of granuloma in the nose and upper airways. It is a rare disease endemic in low-income countries where hygienic conditions are poor and caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis. A hallmark of this pathology is the appearance of atypical foamy monocytes called Mikulicz cells. Very little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this disease and the bacterial virulence factors of K. rhinoscleromatis are unknown. In this study, we created the first mutant made in K. rhinoscleromatis and inactivated the production of capsule, an outer-membrane-anchored polysaccharide. Using a murine model recapitulating the formation of Mikulicz cells and this bacterial capsule mutant, we observed that capsule is a virulence factor for K. rhinoscleromatis which is not required for the formation of Mikulicz cells, indicating that other specific virulence factors are present in the genome of the bacterium. This works opens the way to further genetic analysis of K. rhinoscleromatis and identification of new specific virulence factors.
