Dengue viruses (DENV) are viruses that can cause asymptomatic infection to life-threatening haemorrhagic fever disease. Although DENV are not classically known to infect and invade central nervous system (CNS) in human, numerous cases of DENV infection in the CNS have been reported with limited information about the characteristics of the infecting virus. Here, we report the isolation and first complete genome analysis of DENV serotype 3 (DENV-3) from cerebrospinal fluid of a patient diagnosed with dengue encephalitis in Jakarta, Indonesia. By using next-generation sequencing strategy, we recovered the complete genome of the virus isolate and identified unique amino acid changes not found in any other recovered DENV-3 strains. The virus was determined to be closely related to isolates from Jakarta, Indonesia, which have been circulating for almost four decades.
