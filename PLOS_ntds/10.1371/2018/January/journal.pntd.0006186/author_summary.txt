The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviral diseases in subtropics and tropics. The confounding effects of immature development and adult microbiome on the ability of Ae. aegypti to transmit diseases (vector competence) have gained renewed attention in the recent years. However, the molecular nature of these links/ effects remains unknown. This is major gap in knowledge regarding how vector competence is regulated at molecular level, and how that regulation may be variable among different strains of this mosquito. In this study, we investigated expression of newly discovered class of small RNAs, called tRNA fragments (tRF) in Ae. aegypti strains. Based on small RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, we show that tRFs are expressed in Ae. aegypti, and they are associated with significant changes in expression between males and females, during development stages, and post blood feeding responses. A single tRF showed association with sex-biased expression, developmental regulation and in response to blood meals between Moyo-S and Moyo-R strains that differ in midgut susceptibility to dengue virus. The findings of this study are expected to guide future research efforts directed toward examining detailed regulatory mechanisms of tRFs in vector competence of Ae. aegypti to disease transmission.
