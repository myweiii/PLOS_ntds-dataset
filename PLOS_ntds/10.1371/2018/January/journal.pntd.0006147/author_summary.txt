Bovine tuberculosis is a rather neglected zoonotic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis that is of global concern owing to the persistence of the bacillus in reservoirs that can spread bovine tuberculosis between animals and humans. Africa remains understudied regarding this pathogen, and should be an area of concern given that in many regions the consumption of raw milk or meat from infected animals persists and the presence of HIV infection renders the population more susceptible. In order to control the disease, we need to understand M. bovis epidemiology, which includes the sources of infection. The important conclusion drawn from the work presented here is that there is a strong association between M. bovis genetic characteristics and geography. This implies that the diversity of M. bovis isolates in Mozambique does not seem to be caused by recent introductions to the territory, but is probably maintained within reservoirs in each particular region.
