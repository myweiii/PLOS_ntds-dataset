Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of the neglected Chagas disease in humans. During infection in mice, depletion of plasma L-arginine is correlated with mortality. L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid needed for cell proliferation, and is the substrate of arginase 1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is involved in the immune response against infections. Observed L-arginine depletion is likely caused by increased Arg-1 activity, but the effect on immune response are still unknown. Our hypothesis is that L-arginine depletion may block nitric oxide (NO) production by iNOS, which is needed for parasite killing. To test this hypothesis, mice were supplemented with and without L-arginine, and the differential effect of treatment with an iNOS inhibitor was determined. L-arginine supplement was beneficial to the mice, lowering mortality and improving disease outcome and heart function. The beneficial effect was associated with increased levels of NO, thus low levels of L-arginine and NO are considered candidate markers of pathology. Finally, as L-arginine is a common dietary supplement, it may be useful for treatment of Chagas patients, either alone or in combination with antiparasitic drugs.
