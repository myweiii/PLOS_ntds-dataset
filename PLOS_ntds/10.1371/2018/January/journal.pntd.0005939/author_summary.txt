Although tungiasis (sand flea disease) is associated with important morbidity and affects millions of people in South America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, it has been largely ignored by health care providers up to now. In this study we show that the restriction of life quality due to tungiasis goes far beyond physical aspects and that the disease is also a mental and emotional strain on affected children in rural Kenya. Almost eighty percent of the diseased individuals reported a moderate to very large effect of tungiasis on their life quality. The degree of perceived life quality impairment correlated with the number of embedded sand fleas and pain. Sleep disturbance and concentration difficulties were the most frequent impairment. Effective treatment led to a rapid improvement of pathology and, subsequently, to an improved quality of life. The results of this study give substantial evidence that tungiasis is an important health hazard deserving more attention from policy makers and international donors.
