Empirical evidence for cognitive or educational benefits of anti-Schistosoma treatment is currently uncertain, despite the recommended practice of wide-scale deworming with praziquantel. We addressed this knowledge gap by synthesizing information from 30 relevant epidemiologic studies reporting on 38,992 children between 5â€“19 years old from 14 countries. In those studies, Schistosoma infection or non-dewormed status was associated with educational loss and cognitive deficits. Specifically, there were small to moderate deficits in both school attendance and scholastic achievement. Similarly, Schistosoma infection or non-dewormed status was associated with deficits in learning and memory domains of psychometrically tested cognitive function. However, there was no evidence of Schistosoma infection- or non-deworming-associated deficits on tests of innate intelligence or reaction-time. Overall, compared to Schistosoma-uninfected or to dewormed children, the presence of Schistosoma infection or non-dewormed status was associated with educational, learning, and memory deficits in school-aged children. The combined evidence suggests that early treatment of children in Schistosoma-endemic regions could mitigate these deficits.
