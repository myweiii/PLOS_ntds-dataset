The soil-transmitted-helminths (STH) infections are produced by four species of parasites: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). These parasites are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces, which contaminate the environment in areas where sanitation is poor. These diseases negatively impact health and development. Current STH control is based on mass drug administration (MDA) programs, mainly through the use of albendazole (ABZ) and mebendazole. However, although MDA programs have been shown to reduce the prevalence of STH infection and to control morbidity in school-age children, rapid reinfection is common among treated children and many programs fail to reach coverage targets. Optimizing methods to assess treatment coverage may allow programs to more effectively deliver MDA to populations requiring treatment. We conducted a controlled trial to evaluate the serum pharmacokinetic behaviour and urinary excretion of ABZ and its metabolites in human volunteers. The study focused also on to evaluate, by mean of non-invasively measures, ABZ treatment coverage and adherence. The measurement of ABZSO concentrations both in serum and urine may be useful methods to monitor adherence to ABZ treatment and serve as a more objective measurement of program coverage.
