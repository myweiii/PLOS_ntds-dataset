Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a deadly vector-borne parasite (Leishmania donovani) transmitted to man by phlebotomine sand flies. Indoor residual spraying (IRS), performed within village dwellings, is the primary means of sand fly control performed in Bihar, India and more explicit methods of evaluating the success of control are warranted. A field-based study was conducted to collect ecological sand fly data for use in evaluating the effectiveness of IRS in reducing relative sand fly abundance. Results indicate that sand flies blood feed primarily on humans and cattle and are most frequently found within cattle enclosures. Results further suggest IRS-treatment has a limited impact on vector density. Our approach incorporates detailed evaluation of sand fly spatial distribution (cattle enclosures, houses, vegetation), seasonal fluctuations in abundance, host blood meal preferences within Bihari villages, and dates of IRS performed within treated villages. Hence, this study provides an explicit means of monitoring vector populations and evaluating control measures in Bihar.
