The genus Onchocerca (Spirurida, Onchocercidae) includes Onchocerca volvulus, which is estimated to infect at least 37 million people globally, and zoonotic Onchocerca lupi in carnivores. Infection by O. lupi has been reported in dogs and cats from several European countries and recently also in the U.S. and Canada, causing mainly ocular lesions. In humans, O. lupi displays a marked neurotropism with nematodes embedded in nodules localized in the cervical spine of infant, children and adults. Though the reported severity of infection in humans and the high prevalence detected in dogs are now well-recognized, a proper treatment regime for curing this parasitic infection is lacking, being the surgical removal of the parasitic nodule the therapy of choice in canine patients. Hence, there is an unmet medical need for treatment of this zoonotic disease in both humans and animals. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of oxfendazole under two treatment regimes in the reduction of ocular lesions and skin-dwelling microfilariae of O. lupi in naturally infected dogs.
