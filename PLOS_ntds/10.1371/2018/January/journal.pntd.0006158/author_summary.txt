An epidemic model for the transmission of yellow fever virus (YFV) in urban areas is formulated and implemented to study the 2016 yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Luanda, Angola. We explore the complex vector-host dynamics of this system taking into account mosquito abundance, vaccination and asymptomatic infections in the human population, that are generally not included in other modelling studies of YF. The model successfully fits the time series of weekly reported YF cases and deaths during the epidemic. This allows us to study the impact of the vaccination campaign in Luanda and hypothetical “delayed vaccination” scenarios. The transmission of YFV appeared to be oscillatory having a wave-like pattern in the basic reproduction number (). The oscillations are hypothesized to be due to human reaction to the reported deaths, as has been noted for other human infectious diseases, and the second wave also possibly due to El Niño rainfall patterns. We conclude that the lives saved due to the vaccination campaign before August 2016 should have been approximately 370 (i.e., approximately five-fold of the observed 73 deaths), and would have been far larger extrapolating beyond August 2016.
