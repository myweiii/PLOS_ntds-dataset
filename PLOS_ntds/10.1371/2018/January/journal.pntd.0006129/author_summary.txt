The successful campaign being waged against polio has eliminated the disease from most countries where it was once endemic. With this success, it is anticipated that the disease will be eradicated in the coming years with only 37 cases being reported in 2016. Although the efforts to control polio are successful there are a number of low-profile, but no less serious disease, that are still highly prevalent throughout the world. These diseases have been termed the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) and this study aims to test the suitability of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) as a platform to screen for two of the NTDs, soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH). To test the suitability of the samples collected by the GPLN and the suitability of the laboratories themselves 448 samples from the Ghanaian GPLN laboratory were screened with multiplex TaqMan assays for the following six helminth types: Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma spp, Trichuris trchiura, Strongyloides stercoralis and Schistosoma spp. Using this method this study was able to identify a prevalence of 22% for the combined helminth infection. The most common infection was A. lumbricoides with a prevalence of 15% followed by N. americanus (5%), Ancylostoma spp. (2.5%), Schistosoma spp. (1.6%) and S. stercoralis (1%). The success of this study indicates that this may be a cost-effective method to passively screen a country for STH and SCH and its success in identifying S. stercoralis infections makes it especially useful as this parasite is hard to identify using traditional surveillance techniques.
