We would like to thank Dr. Eric Ottesen and Dr. Patrick Lammie (NTD Support Center, Task Force for Global Health, Decatur, GA), for their continued support, encouragement, and advice. We would also like to thank the Filarial Research Reagent Resource Center (FR3) for parasites and molecular reagents, and Oxitec Ltd. for the provision of mosquitoes. Our grateful appreciation also goes to Ryan R. Hemme, for providing us with the preliminary protocol for NaOH-based DNA isolation that we adapted for use with this project. We also wish to thank Susan Haynes for logistical support.
