Chagas disease is a neglected illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which affects millions of people in the endemic countries in Latin America. Despite the knowledge about the parasite genetic diversity, there still some gaps regarding the association between those different genotypes and clinical manifestations, including the level of parasites circulating in the bloodstream. From a group of adult chronic patients presenting the cardiac and indeterminate forms, originated from different regions of Brazil, we evaluate the parasite load and T. cruzi genotyping in order to search an association with the clinical features of Chagas disease. We observe a high diversity of T. cruzi genotypes in Brazil, although the genotypes TcVI, TcII and mixed infection TcVI+TcII were more prevalent, but no correlation with the cardiac or indeterminate clinical forms was observed. In contrast, we found that the age of patient and infection by TcII are associated to higher parasite load levels.
