Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram negative bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis. B. pseudomallei is a soil saprophyte and causes infections in humans by percutaneous inoculation, inhalation or ingestion. Melioidosis is a life threatening disease, which requires prolonged antibiotic treatment and is classically characterized by pneumonia, septicemia and multiple abscesses. Melioidosis is widely prevalent in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Of late it has been reported from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. The predicted annual global burden of melioidosis is 165,000 cases. B. pseudomallei has been classified as a Category B threat agent by US Center for Disease Control. Melioidosis is an emerging disease in India that affects many regions. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in number of melioidosis cases, mainly from southwestern costal part of India. This study provides new insights into molecular epidemiology of melioidosis in India. By use of multi locus sequence typing (MLST), we show that Indian isolates are closely related and cluster in one major group suggesting clonality of the isolates. We further show that Indian isolates are more closely related to isolates from Asian countries particularly from South Asia.
