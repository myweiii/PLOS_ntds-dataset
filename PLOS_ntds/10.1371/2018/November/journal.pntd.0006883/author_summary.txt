Chagas disease is a serious infection that is spread by blood-sucking insects called ‘kissing bugs.’ These bugs live in and around human homes, and until recently, they infested thousands of human homes throughout Arequipa, the second largest city in Perú. However, a decades-long control campaign drastically reduced the number of infested houses, and the city is now in a stage where health personnel annually inspect a sample of houses throughout the city for kissing bug reinfestation. A large amount of information was collected during the control campaign that could be used to help identify the houses at highest risk for re-infestation, so we developed a cell phone app to provide this information to health personnel in the form of interactive, user-friendly risk maps. We carried out a pilot study to see if health personnel would use these maps to select houses to inspect for re-infestation, and we found that most inspectors did use the information. We also observed that using the app did not slow the inspectors down, which can be an issue when introducing new technology. Our results suggest that the app could be a useful tool for monitoring diseases spread by insects in cities.
