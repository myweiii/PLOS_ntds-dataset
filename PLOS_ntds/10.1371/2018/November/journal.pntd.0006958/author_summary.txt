Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arthropod-borne virus that is transmitted predominantly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In 2016 alone CHIKV caused over 100.000 infections in South-America, exemplifying the impact of CHIKV disease. Previous research has suggested that the CHIKV non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) may determine the infection of mosquitoes. NsP3 is known to interact with several host proteins through a conserved proline (P)-rich and duplicate FGDF motifs that are present in its C-terminal domain. Here we investigated the importance of these conserved motifs for the infection and replication of CHIKV in both Aedes mosquito cells and mammalian cells. Furthermore, we assessed the role of these motifs for the transmission by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes via infectious bloodmeal experiments. We show that mutation of the P-rich motif negatively affects the replication of CHIKV in both mammalian and mosquito cells. In contrast, mutating the P-rich motif did not affect the transmission by Ae. aegypti. Mutation of both FGDF motifs together completely inactivated CHIKV in mammalian and mosquito cells, while mutation of a single FGDF motif negatively affected replication only in mammalian cells. Importantly, CHIKV containing only a single FGDF motif was still efficiently transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. These results contribute to understanding the key interactions between alphaviruses and their mosquito vector.
