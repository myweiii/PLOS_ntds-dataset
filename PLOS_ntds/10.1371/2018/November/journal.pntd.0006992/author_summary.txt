Helminths are large multicellular parasites that infect approximately every third person. Infections are controlled by a concerted action of innate and adaptive immune responses. Basophils and mast cells are innate effector cells with overlapping functions that have recently been implicated in the initiation and promotion of adaptive immune responses. Here, we analyze the function of basophils during murine infection with Strongyloides ratti, an intestinal parasite with tissue migrating stages. Using mice constitutively lacking basophils, we show that their most important function is the early control of intestinal parasite burden during a primary infection. Basophils are not needed for efficient killing of tissue migrating S. ratti larvae, the timely termination of infection or the initiation and execution of protective immunity against S. ratti challenge infections in immune mice. Since basophils were shown to be important for the immunity against different helminth parasites in intestine or tissue (Heligmosomoides polygyrus and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis), their function has to be evaluated for every parasite species individually.
