Lymphatic filariasis is a disfiguring parasitic infection tens of millions of people in more than 70 countries. The global effort to eliminate LF transmission via mass drug administration (MDA) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to identify infected individuals and map afflicted areas. This effort is complicated in loiasis-endemic nations of central Africa for two reasons. First, persons with heavy L. loa infections may suffer severe adverse events, including death, following treatment with MDA medications. Second, it is now clear that RDT testing for LF can be unreliable in areas with loiasis, since many L. loa-infected individuals, especially those with heavy infections, test positive by LF RDT in the absence of infection with W. bancrofti (the causative agent of LF in Africa). We report here the identity and characteristics of multiple L. loa antigens found in RDT-positive sera that bind to antibodies used in LF RDTs. Understanding the differences between these cross-reactive antigens and the circulating filarial antigen of W. bancrofti may lead to development of improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis to facilitate elimination of filarial infections in Sub-Saharan Africa.
