The ZIKV scientific field has greatly expanded since the emergence of ZIKV in South and Central America, but a comprehensive comparison of the assays used to examine the phenotypic and replicative properties of ZIKV is limited in the literature. The influence of host, whether insect or mammalian, on viral production and infection has not been thoroughly examined for ZIKV. Additionally, a number of different assays are used in the literature to examine ZIKV, but how results compare across assays and between laboratories is unclear. We provide a detailed in vitro characterization of growth parameters in both mosquito and mammalian cells for one reference and three contemporary ZIKV isolates. These studies provide the basis for other researchers to compare results and to build on for future animal and cell culture studies with current and emerging ZIKV isolates.
