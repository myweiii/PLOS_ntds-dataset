    "Abstract": "Lymphatic filariasis is widely endemic in Myanmar. Despite the establishment of an elimination program in 2000, knowledge of the remaining burden of disease relies predominantly on programmatic information. To assist the program, we conducted an independent cross-sectional household cluster survey to determine the prevalence of filariasis infection, morbidity and mass-drug administration coverage in four townships of the Mandalay Region: Amarapura, Patheingyi, Tada-U and Wundwin. The survey included 1014 individuals from 430 randomly selected households in 24 villages. Household members one year and older were assessed for antigenaemia using immunochromatographic test cards and if positive, microfilaraemia by night-time thick blood smear. Participants 15 years and older were assessed for filariasis morbidity by ultrasound-assisted clinical examination. The overall prevalence of infection was 2.63% by antigenaemia (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71–4.04%) and 1.03% by microfilaraemia (95%CI 0.59–1.47%). The prevalence of hydrocoele in adult males was 2.78% (95%CI 1.23–6.15%) and of lymphoedema in both genders was 0% (95%CI 0–0.45%). These results indicate the persistence of filarial infection and transmission despite six rounds of annual mass drug administration and highlight the need for further rounds as well as the implementation of morbidity management programs in the country."
