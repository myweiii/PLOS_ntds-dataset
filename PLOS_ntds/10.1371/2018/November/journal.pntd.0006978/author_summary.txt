The development of effective therapeutic approaches to the treatment of human diseases requires an understanding of the disease process induced by an infectious agent. Historically the development of medical countermeasures for highly pathogenic viruses required the use of a uniformly lethal animal model. While this approach is useful in some regards, it frequently does not provide a true indication of the disease process. In the work presented here, the approach was to use a virus exposure method that mimicked a potential route of human exposure and used a dose that might be more representative of one a human would receive. Using this method and advanced medical imaging techniques, we were able to demonstrate an extended disease course with mixed respiratory and neurological disease like that seen in humans. This study also found that the response to infection in the lungs was inflammatory and that the disease in the brain was limited despite clear evidence of lesions. These data support the development of animal models that mimic human disease and allow for the identification of potential therapeutic approaches that target the disease process rather than only the virus.
