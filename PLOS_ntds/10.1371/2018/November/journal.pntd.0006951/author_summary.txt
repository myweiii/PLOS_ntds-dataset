International travelers may be exposed to rabid animals while traveling abroad. Current guidelines recommended that any traveler who was not been vaccinated against rabies before travel and sustained an animal exposure putting him at risk for rabies required rabies post-exposure prophylaxis including rabies immunoglobulin administration in addition to rabies vaccine as soon as possible. Available data indicate that only a small proportion of travelers received rabies immunoglobulin in the country of exposure when indicated. In this multi-center survey, we collected information on rabies post-exposure prophylaxis administration in international travelers exposed to potentially rabid animals. We observed that about two-thirds of travelers with an indication for rabies immunoglobulin who started their post-exposure prophylaxis during travel did not receive it. This analysis identified specific countries where travelers may be more or less likely to receive rabies immunoglobulin and helps inform risk education of international travelers regarding appropriate rabies prevention. In our analysis, Bali, Indonesia, was the most common location to have an exposure to a potentially rabid animal, but very few travelers received rabies immunoglobulin in Indonesia when indicated. By contrast, travelers exposed in Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines were more likely to receive rabies immunoglobulin in the country of exposure.
