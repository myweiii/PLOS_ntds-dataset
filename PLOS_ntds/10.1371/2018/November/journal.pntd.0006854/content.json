    "Introduction": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by Leishmania parasite and is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most common neglected tropical diseases [1]. During the past decade, an alarming increase in the incidence of CL was documented, ranging from 2.1 million cases in 2002, to approximately 4 million cases in 2015 [2]. In the Eastern Mediterranean, Leishmania tropica and Leishmania major cause CL [3]. In Syria, the prevalence lately doubled due to chronic conflicts [4]. The displacement of Syrian refugees to the neighboring countries, including under-endemic ones like Lebanon, promoted the dissemination of this infection [5].\nCL treatment varies among patients [6], and include local, systemic and physical approaches [7]. Meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) is widely used [8], but yet presents with many disadvantages such as the painful intra-lesional injections to be repeatedly injected in each lesion, on a weekly basis and for up to 8 weeks [9]. An intramuscular injection of Glucantime was proposed to overcome this painful process, however it was associated with high hepatic and cardiac toxicity [10]. Imiquimod is an FDA approved imidazoquinoxaline against skin infections, with great anti-viral/anti-tumor activities [11]. Imiquimod proved potent in CL treatment [12, 13]. It was used in combination with systemic antimonials [14], and presented with cure rates exceeding 90% in refractory patients [15]. Accordingly, it was introduced by the WHO to the guidelines of CL treatment [16].\nAmong several synthesized Imiquimod analogs [11], EAPB0503 (1-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N-methylimidazo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-amine) exhibited higher potency than Imiquimod in several cancer models [17,18,19]. This study addressed the effect of Imiquimod and its analog, EAPB0503, in the context of CL, against amastigote stages of L. tropica and L. major parasites. The mechanism of action as well as the elicited immune response were also investigated. This work gives a better insight about the effect of immunomodulatory drugs derivatives on CL, and opens horizons for new and promising treatment paradigm.",
    "Results": "EAPB0503 exhibited a higher effect on L. tropica and L. major amastigotes replication\nTo compare the effect of Imiquimod and EAPB0503 on L. major amastigotes, macrophages were infected at the ratio of 5 parasites per cell. Treatment was performed with different concentrations of either drugs for 24 hours. Amastigotes replication was evaluated by real time PCR, using kinetoplast specific primers. Starting the concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM, L. major amastigotes transcription levels decreased in a concentration-dependent manner following treatment with either drugs, and leading to 80% inhibition of parasite replication at the concentration of 1\u03bcM (Fig 1A).\nReal-time quantitative PCR detection of infected macrophages with L. major or L. tropica amastigotes treated with different concentrations of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 (A, B). RT-PCR detection of infected macrophages with L. major (C) or L. tropica (D) amastigotes treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 and 24h. Briefly, differentiated and activated THP-1 into macrophages were infected with L. major or L. tropica at the ratio of 5 parasites/cell for 24h. Treatment with 0.1, 0.5, 1 or 10 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or its analog EAPB0503 was performed for 24h (A-D). Treatment with 0.1\u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 was performed for 10 and 24h (C, D). The results are shown as percentage of untreated infected macrophages. Amastigote transcripts were evaluated by Syber green RT-PCR using kinetoplast specific primers and their percentage of expression was normalized to GAPDH. Results are expressed as percentage of untreated control (\u00b1) SD and are representative of at least three independent experiments. Giemsa staining on untreated or treated macrophages infected with amastigotes of L. major (E) and L. tropica (F) strains. Treatment with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 was performed for 10 or 24h. The results depict one representative of three independent experiments. The t-test was performed to validate significance. *, ** and *** indicate p values \u2264 0.05; 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\nL. tropica, the most endemic species causing anthroponotic CL (ACL) in the Middle East area [7], showed that both drugs exert an anti-amastigote activity in a concentration dependent manner. Strikingly, a concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM was obtained upon treatment with EAPB0503 as compared to 1\u03bcM of Imiquimod (10 folds higher concentration) (Fig 1B). This decrease in amastigotes was also more prominent at 0.5 and 1 \u03bcM of EAPB0503, compared to the same doses of Imiquimod (Fig 1B). No effect was observed using the vehicle alone (S1 Fig). This promising data clearly shows a different response of leishmanial strains to treatment with either drugs, and a better response obtained upon treatment of L. tropica strain with EAPB0503.\n\n\nEAPB0503 inhibited amastigote replication as early as 10h post-treatment\nBased on our concentration screening results, we chose the optimal concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM for further analysis. We examined the effect of this concentration at an earlier time point of 10h. Imiquimod induced a decrease in L. major amastigotes replication by 50% at 10h post-treatment, and by 65% at 24h post-treatment (Fig 1C). More interestingly, EAPB0503 showed a more prominent decrease of amastigotes expression at 10h or 24h post-treatment, where only 10% of amastigote transcripts were detected by RT-PCR (5 folds less than Imiquimod) (Fig 1C).\nImiquimod reduced L. tropica amastigotes transcription levels to around 60% at 10h post-treatment and to around 20% at 24h post-treatment (Fig 1D). Interestingly, EAPB0503 reduced amastigotes transcript levels to 30% (almost 2 folds less than Imiquimod) at 10h post-treatment and to 10% (around 2 folds less than Imiquimod) at 24h post-treatment (Fig 1D).\nWe then assessed the effect of both drugs on amastigotes of L. major and L. tropica strains histologically. Consistent with the transcript results, both drugs had a leishmanicidal effect on both strains (Fig 1E and 1F). Whilst Imiquimod displayed similar results against L. major at both time points (Fig 1E), EAPB0503 was more potent against L. tropica strain (Fig 1F). Altogether, these data show that EAPB0503 acts at the low dose of 0.1 \u03bcM and as early as 10h, when compared to its parental compound Imiquimod.\n\n\nImiquimod triggered an increase of TLR-7 expression in L. tropica infected macrophages\nImiquimod belongs to the class of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists with high affinity to TLR7, commonly involved in pathogen recognition (Fig 2A) [14, 20]. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the potency of Imiquimod and its analog EAPB0503 against Leishmania amastigotes. We focused on L. tropica and adopted the concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM at both time points 10 and 24h post-treatment. Our results showed that TLR7 protein levels increased after treatment with either drugs, in comparison to uninfected or untreated infected macrophages (Fig 2B). Same results were obtained on L. major infected macrophages upon treatment with either drugs (S2 Fig 2). In case of L. tropica and consistent with published data, the upregulation was maximal upon treatment with Imiquimod for 10h (Fig 2B). EAPB0503 induced a higher protein expression of TLR7. Nonetheless, the highest induction of TLR7 was obtained upon treatment with Imiquimod. Our results confirm the mechanism of action of Imiquimod via this receptor in the context of CL. The lower expression of TLR7 upon treatment with EAPB0503, seemingly shows a potential mode of action through a different TLR.\nSchematic representation of the mode of action of Imiquimod through TLR-7 immuno-modulation and its subsequent downstream NF-\u03baB activation (A). Western blot analysis for TLR-7 (B), IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, P-I\u03baB\u03b1 and P50 (C) in L. tropica infected macrophages treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 and 24h. The results depict one representative experiment among three independent ones. Densitometry was performed using Image Lab software (Biorad). Results shown represent the average of quantification of three independent experiments. (D) Confocal microscopy on L. tropica infected macrophages treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10h. The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was stained with an anti-p65 antibody (red), and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). The results depict one representative experiment among three independent ones.\n\n\nImiquimod and EAPB0503 induced the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway activation\nFollowing recognition of pathogens, TLRs trigger the NF-\u03baB pathway activation (Fig 2A) [21] inducing immune inflammatory responses [22]. Imiquimod activates the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway (Fig 2A) [23]. We explored this pathway in the context of CL. Western blot analysis clearly showed an activation of the multimeric IKK complex (IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2) after 10 or 24h treatment with either drugs (Fig 2C). Furthermore, an induction of the phosphorylated form of the I\u03baB\u03b1 at both time points was obtained, presumably leading to its degradation (Fig 2C). We then examined whether this NF-\u03baB activation involves the canonical pathway. Our results demonstrate that the p50 subunit was upregulated especially upon 24h post-treatment with either drugs (Fig 2C). This led to the nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig 2D), which represents the active NF-\u03baB subunit, and known to activate immune response genes. Collectively these results showed that both Imiquimod and EAPB0503 inhibit amastigote replication via activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway.\n\n\nImiquimod and EAPB0503 induced NF-\u03baB mediated macrophage immune response\nWe investigated the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators after treatment. Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins (MIP-1\u03b1 and \u03b2) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP-1) levels increased upon treatment with both drugs (Fig 3A). The secreted levels of depicted pro-inflammatory cytokines namely Interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, important in CL clearance [24], were increased upon treatment with Imiquimod or EAPB0503 (Fig 3A).\n(A) ELISA showing the secretion level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in infected macrophages with L. tropica amastigotes treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10h. (B) RT-PCR detection of iNOS in infected macrophages with L. tropica amastigotes, treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10h. iNOS percentage of expression was normalized to GAPDH. Results are expressed as percentage of untreated control (\u00b1) SD. (C) ELISA showing the secretion level of and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) upon treatment of L. tropica infected macrophages with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10h. Results are expressed as percentage of untreated control (\u00b1) SD and are representative of at least three independent experiments. The t-test was performed to validate significance. *, ** and *** indicate p values \u2264 0.05; 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\nMacrophage-derived nitric oxide (NO) is effective against microbes, and synthesized by Nitric Oxide Synthase (i-NOS). i-NOS is induced in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines [25] and, in CL-infected macrophages, iNOS is protective against L. major [26]. Both drugs increased i-NOS transcripts in macrophages infected with either L. tropica or L. major strains, with EAPB0503 inducing a 5-fold higher expression (Fig 3B, S2B Fig respectively). This presumably leads to higher NO production, hence enhanced leishmanicidal activity.\nIn CL, pro-inflammatory cytokines are linked to resistance against leishmaniasis; whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines relate to disease progression [27]. We examined the secretion levels of two depicted anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-4 after treatment with either drugs. In comparison to non-treated L. tropica infected macrophages, secretion levels of IL-10 and IL-4 decreased by around 4 folds after treatment with Imiquimod (Fig 3C). More interestingly, treatment with EAPB0503 showed a significant decrease by 4 and 15 folds of IL-10 and IL-4 respectively and as compared to non-treated infected macrophages (Fig 3C).\nAltogether, our results show that NF-\u03baB activation by Imiquimod and EAPB0503 induces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This leads to i-NOS upregulation, presumably leading to NO production and leishmanicidal activity. In addition, and concomitantly with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokines is obtained, diminishing macrophage susceptibility to L. tropica infection, and triggering the leishmanicidal effect of the tested drugs.\n\n\nEAPB0503 exhibited a higher efficacy on freshly isolated L. tropica from patients\u2019 biopsies\nTo eliminate the potential doubt due to the susceptibility of cultured L. tropica and L. major strains to our tested treatments (e.g genetic drift and less virulent strains after long term culture), we investigated the effect of Imiquimod and its analog EAPB0503 on freshly isolated parasites from untreated patients\u2019 biopsies. The infection with L. tropica was confirmed in all used patients by PCR and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) (S3A and S3B Fig respectively). Both drugs inhibit amastigote replication in a time dependent manner. As a control of potency, we used Glucantime, alone or combined with Imiquimod, since these drugs were clinically used in the treatment of CL [15, 16, 28]. Upon treatment with Imiquimod, amastigotes transcription levels decreased to reach around 10% at 72h post-treatment as compared to 60% upon treatment with Glucantime alone, or around 25% upon treatment with Glucantime combined to Imiquimod (Fig 4A). Treatment with EAPB0503 induced a more prominent effect where, L. tropica amastigote transcripts decreased by 70 and 90%, at 10 and 24h post-treatment respectively (Fig 4A). This effect was identical at 72h post-treatment (Fig 4A). Interestingly, the effect of EAPB0503 was more profound than Glucantime alone, Imiquimod alone or Glucantime combined to Imiquimod at all tested time points, and starting 10h post-treatment (Fig 4A). We then assessed the effect of both drugs on amastigotes histologically (Fig 4B) and by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig 4C). Our results were very consistent with the transcript data with less amastigotes detected upon treatment. Consistently, and using the Leishmania Glycoprotein Gp63 marker for quantification of amastigotes [29], Imiquimod treatment led to a decrease in amastigotes percentage reaching 60% at 10h and 35% at 24h post-treatment (Fig 4C). More interestingly, EAPB0503 induced a more prominent decrease in amastigotes number, to 40% after 10h of treatment, and to 25% after 24h of treatment (Fig 4C). Altogether, these data show that Imiquimod and mostly EAPB0503 are highly active at the low dose of 0.1 \u03bcM and as early as 10h on patients\u2019 derived L. tropica stages, confirming the obtained results on in vitro cultured strains.\n(A) RT- PCR detection of infected macrophages with patients\u2019 derived L. tropica amastigotes treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 or 24h, compared to 100 \u03bcg/mL of Glucantime alone or combined to 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod. Percentage of expression of amastigotes was normalized to GAPDH. Results are expressed as percentage of untreated control (\u00b1) SD and are representative of three independent experiments. (B) H&E staining on untreated or treated macrophages infected with patients\u2019 derived L. tropica amastigotes with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 or 24h. The results depict one representative patient. Similar results were obtained on the remaining two patients. (C) Confocal microscopy on patients\u2019 derived L. tropica infected macrophages treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 or 24h.

Graphs show quantification of Gp63 (Blind count) as averages of one Z section/cell from 50 different cells of 2 independent experiments on two different patients\u2019 derived amastigotes.\nThe mechanism of action of either drugs on L. tropica obtained from patients, was evaluated for TLR7 protein expression and showed an increase after treatment, in comparison to uninfected or untreated infected macrophages. Consistently with the cultured strain, Imiquimod induced the highest TLR7 protein levels (Fig 5A). Moreover, i-NOS transcript levels were increased reaching the highest levels after 10h treatment with EAPB0503 (Fig 5B). These results indicate a similar mode of action of both drugs on freshly isolated parasites from patients\u2019 biopsies and confirm the higher potency of EAPB0503 against CL.\n(A) Western blot analysis for TLR-7 on patients\u2019 derived L. tropica infected macrophages (from one patient) treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 and 24h.

    "Discussion": "CL is one of the most common neglected tropical diseases worldwide. Globally, the annual incidence of CL is estimated to be 0.7 to 1.2 million new cases per year. This disease is still endemic in many countries [30]. In the Eastern Mediterranean, Syria presents with the highest number of CL cases [31]. The Syrian conflict exacerbated the spread of the infection to the surrounding areas. In Lebanon, 85% of infected Syrian refugees were diagnosed with L. tropica whilst the remaining 15% were infected with L. major [5].\nPentavalent antimony compounds remain the treatment choice for CL. However, these compounds associate with high cost, poor availability, drug resistance and systemic toxicity [32]. We focused on testing novel drugs\u2019 efficacy on L. tropica and L. major. Imiquimod activates macrophages [15], the main host cells for Leishmania replication. In CL, Imiquimod was mainly tested against L. major amastigote [33]. In Imiquimod treated mice infected with L. major, an increased protection was obtained [34]. In CL patients, Imiquimod combined to Glucantime induced a high healing rate in refractory patients [13, 16, 34]. We showed that both drugs affected amastigotes. Conversely, EAPB0503 was more potent on L. tropica strain [4, 5]. Imiquimod acts via binding TLR7, leading to the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Imiquimod protective effect, on L. major infected mice, was coupled with the induction of NO synthesis [26, 35]. Consistent with the published data, but on L. tropica strain, we showed that Imiquimod and EAPB0503 upregulated TLR7 expression. Nonetheless, the highest induction was obtained upon Imiquimod treatment. This finding suggests that EAPB0503 may partially act via TLR7, or through other TLRs. The canonical NF-\u03baB pathway was activated by both drugs, leading to increased secretion levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, involved in resistance against infections [36] were both secreted at higher levels upon treatment with either drugs. Consistently with the known role of MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 in recruiting other cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [37], levels of secretion for these two cytokines were also increased. TNF-\u03b1 increased secretion levels were consistent with its protective role against CL [38].\nPrevious studies have shown that MCP-1 is highly expressed in lesions of patients with self-healing localized cutaneous leishmaniasis whereas it is scarce in those of chronic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis [39]. This suggests its role in the parasites elimination via induction of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). Our results showed that MCP-1 levels increased upon treatment with either drugs, but more importantly with EAPB0503, presumably explaining its higher potency. However, the potential involvement of ROIs on the clearance of treated parasites remains to be elucidated.\nWe also succeeded to test the activity of Imiquimod and EAPB0503 on freshly isolated L. tropica from skin lesions of CL patients. We confirmed the results obtained on cultured strains, thus eliminating any potential doubt about a lower virulence or a genetic drift obtained from long term cultures. Moreover, EAPB0503 showed a better anti-leishmanicidal activity than the clinically used Glucantime, whether alone or combined to Imiquimod [15, 16, 28]. These results highlight the promising potency of EAPB0503 for CL treatment.\nNitric Oxide production by activated macrophages is known to play a major role in fighting against infections [40], including Leishmania [41]. Inhibition of i-NOS reduced L. infantum burden in human macrophages [42]. In addition, the increase of i-NOS and NO generation in response to IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 is crucial to control CL [43]. We checked for i-NOS transcripts in treated macrophages infected with either L. major or patients\u2019 derived L. tropica and showed an important increase with either drugs. Interestingly, the highest levels were obtained upon EAPB0503 treatment, presumably explaining its higher leishmanicidal efficacy.\nTLRs are important pattern recognition receptors expressed abundantly on macrophages. Early studies concluded that TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, are involved in the recognition of L. major and that TLR2 ligands play a protective immune role against Leishmaniasis [44]. However, recent studies on C57BL/6 mice deficient in either TLR2, 4, or 9, showed that only TLR9-/- mice are more susceptible to L. major infection, indicating TLR2 and TLR4 related immunity to murine leishmaniasis requires re-evaluation [45]. In this study, we confirmed that Imiquimod displays its anti-amastigote activity via TLR7 upregulation, leading to NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. EAPB0503 effect on TLR7 was less prominent. Whether EAPB0503 acts via any of the important TLRs in CL or not, requires further investigation.\nCollectively, our results did not only show a promising efficacy of a new compound, EAPB0503 against CL, but also highlighted the mechanism of action through which Imiquimod and its analog acted against the aggressive L. tropica strain. We also described the molecular mechanisms of these drugs against amastigotes highlighting the importance of immune-modulatory therapy against CL.",
    "Materials and methods": "Parasite culture\nLeishmania major (MHOM/MA/81/LEM265 and MMER/MA/81/LEM309) and Leishmania tropica (MHOM/LB/76/LEM61, MRAT/IQ/72/ADHANIS1) were purchased from the CRHU \u201cMontpellier\u201d. Parasites were maintained in RPMI1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100IU/ml streptomycin/penicillin (Sigma).\n\n\nTest agents\nImiquimod was purchased from Molekula (Wessex House) and EAPB0503 was synthesized using microwave-assisted chemistry as described by Khier et al. [46]. Drugs were prepared as a 0.1 M stock in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -80\u00b0C. Glucantime (1.5g/5ml) was used at the final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL. Working solutions of 0.1 \u03bcM were freshly prepared in culture media.\n\n\nMacrophage culture and treatment\nHuman monocytic THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC TIB-202), Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI1640 medium with L-Glutamine, 25 mM Hepes (Lonza), supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% kanamycin and 1% glutamine (Invitrogen). 1 million THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages, using 50 ng/mL of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) overnight. Following their adherence, differentiated macrophages were then activated with 1 \u03bcg/mL of LPS for 4h, then infected with L. major or L. tropica at the ratio of 5 parasites/macrophage, and incubated for 24h at 37 \u1d3cC. Non-internalized promastigotes were removed by two gentle washes with PBS.\n\n\nIsolation of fresh L. tropica promastigotes from biopsies of CL patients\nPunch biopsies (4 mm of diameter) from three CL patients were performed in 2016, and incubated in sterile physiological serum, supplemented with Penicilline G (100 IU/ml). Specimens were incubated in a semi-solid culture media (10g agar, 3g NaCl, 500 mL water). 3 weeks later, promastigotes were transferred to liquid medium.\n\n\nAnti-amastigote activity\nMacrophages infected with L. major, L. tropica, or patients\u2019 derived L. tropica parasites were treated with Imiquimod and EAPB0503 (0.01 \u03bcM, 0.05 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.5 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM) for 24h. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using a Revert Aid First cDNA synthesis Kit (#K1622-Thermo Scientific). Syber green qRT PCR was performed using the BIORAD-CFX96 machine. Primers for the housekeeping Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH, and i-NOS are listed in Table 1. Primers for amastigotes detection target the minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) (Table 1). Percentage of expression was calculated according to Livac method [47].\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nSupernatants of infected macrophages in presence or absence of either drugs were collected 10h and 24h after treatment, and ELISA was performed using Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, supernatants of L. tropica infected macrophages (untreated or treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503) were collected. Supernatants were spun for 10 min at 1000g and transferred to new Eppendorf tubes, and diluted using a specific cocktail of antigens (IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, IL-10 and IL-4) provided by the kit (Qiagen). Samples were then loaded in the coated ELISA plaque, and were incubated for 2 hours. 3 washes were performed, and the detection antibody was added and incubated for 2 hours. Then, Avidin-HRP was added for 30 min, and 4 washes were performed. Development solution was then added in dark and kept for 15 min, before addition of the stop solution. The secreted levels of the following cytokines and chemokines were then assessed. The optic density (O.D) was determined at 450 and 570 nm and calculated according to the standard values of a positive control provided by the kit.\n\n\nImmunofluorescence and confocal microscopy\nFor Immunofluorescence assay, p6 well plates were seeded with activated macrophages infected with L. tropica (5p/c) for 24h and treated with Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 or 24h. At these time points, coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Permeabilization was performed in Triton (0.2%) for 10 minutes. Following one PBS wash, blocking for 30 min with PBS-10% FBS was performed. Primary antibody directed against the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit (Santa Cruz, Sc-8008) was used at the dilution of 1:50. For Leishmania parasite staining inside macrophages, an anti-Gp63 (LifeSpan BioSciences, LS-C58984) was used at the dilution 1:50. Anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Abcam, ab150116) were used at the concentration of 1:100. Staining of nuclei was performed using 1 \u03bcg/mL of Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride trihydrate solution (Invitrogen, H33342) for 5 min and then coverslips were mounted on slides using a Prolong Anti-fade kit (Invitrogen, P36930). Z-section images were acquired by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and all images were analyzed using Zeiss LSM 710 software.\n\n\nHematoxylin and eosin stain\nH&E staining was performed as described by Grosset et al., 2017 [50]. Briefly, hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Canada) was added on cells, and a counterstaining for 30 seconds was performed followed by a water rinse for 5 minutes. Slides were then dipped in 50% (vol/vol) alcoholic eosin Y solution (Leica Microsystems, Canada) then rinsed in ethanol before slide mounting.\n\n\nGiemsa staining\nGiemsa staining was performed using Ral 555 Kit (RAL Diagnostics). Briefly, cells were fixed with methanol for 1 min, stained with solution 2 for 40 seconds then with Solution 3 for 25 seconds as per the manufacturer. Cells were then mounted using Prolong Anti-fade (Invitrogen, P36930).\n\n\nWestern blot analysis\nActivated macrophages infected with L. tropica (5p/c) for 24h were treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of Imiquimod or EAPB0503 for 10 or 24h. Cells were scrapped, washed with PBS, and pellets were re-suspended in 1x Laemmli buffer. Following denaturation, samples were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BIO RAD Cat# 162\u20130112) at 30V overnight using a BioRad transfer unit. To verify the protein transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau Red. Blocking was performed for 1h in 5% of Bovine Albumin serum (BSA) in wash buffer and probed with specific primary antibodies against TLR7 (sc- 57463 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), NF-\u03baB p65 (sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250), or p52 (sc-7386, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250). Equal loading was tested following probing with the anti- GAPDH antibody (MAB5476; abnova, 1:20 000). Nitrocellulose membranes were then washed three times with wash buffer for 5 minutes each, before incubation with the appropriate anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (m-IgGk BP-HRP, Santa Cruz, sc-516102, 1:5000). Bands were visualized by autoradiography, following incubation with luminol chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad, Cat# 170\u20135061).\n\n\nInternal Transcribed Spacer-1 (ITS1)-PCR and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of amplified ITS1-PCR amplicons\nDNA extraction from patient\u2019s biopsies and PCR were performed as previously described using ITS-1 primers (Table 1) [49]. Following PCR amplification, 10 \u03bcl of the remaining volume of the amplicon was digested with 2 \u03bcl MnII enzyme, in 2 \u03bcl in 10x Buffer G (Fermentas Life Sciences, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 18\u03bcl of nuclease-free water. Digestion was carried out using the TS100 thermal cycler (Biorad) by incubating for 6h at 37\u00b0C, followed by enzyme inactivation for 20 minutes at 65\u00b0C.\n25 \u03bcl of the digestion products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels at 100 V in 1\u00d7 TBE buffer (0.04 M Tris-acetate and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 30 minutes. The restriction fragments were visualized under UV light. Images were then captured using the GelDoc-IT TM Imaging System and RFLP patterns interpreted for sub-speciation. Leishmania tropica is characterized by the presence of two bands of 300 base pairs (bp) and 50bp respectively.\n\n\nEthics statement\nSample collection was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut (PALK.IK.01). A parent of each of the three children participants provided written informed consent on the child\u2019s behalf before sample collection.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were analyzed by the unpaired Student\u2019s t test. P value was determined and values for p < 0.05 were considered as significant."
