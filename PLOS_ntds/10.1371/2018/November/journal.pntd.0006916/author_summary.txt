China is severely affected by rickettsial diseases caused by rickettsiales bacteria. To date, at least 13 tick-borne rickettsiales bacteria have been reported in China. In this study, we perform molecular epidemiological investigations of rickettsiales bacteria circulating in Xi’an. Through sampling in Xi’an, we show that high prevalence of Anaplasma capra in ticks and domestic animals. In addition, A. ovis and two potentially novel Anaplasma species closely related to A. phagocytophilum are also identified in goats. Besides Anaplasma, Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis, a tentative Rickettsia species potential pathogenic to human, is also detected in H. longicomis ticks with high prevalence. Although our study shows that human-pathogenic rickettsiales bacteria exist in Xi’an, the association between them with the non-viral hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases should be confirmed in further study. In sum, A. capra and Ca. R. jingxinensis infected in domestic animals and ticks with high positive rate, and highlight the high risks for human exposure to A. capra in Xi’an, China.
