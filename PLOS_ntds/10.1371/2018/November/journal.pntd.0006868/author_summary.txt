In the developing world, over 207 million people are infected with parasitic Schistosoma worms. Among the species of Schistosoma that infect humans Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most common causes of illness. Here, we investigated the performance of point shear wave elastography (pSWE) for predicting significant periportal fibrosis (PPF) in schistosomotic patients and to determine its best cutoff point. We examined 358 people from northeast of Brazil for Schistosoma infections. The present study showed that pSWE was able to differentiate significant from mild PPF, with better performance to predict significant PPF.
