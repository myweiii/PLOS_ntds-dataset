Given the global expanding distribution of Aedes mosquitoes, dengue has established itself throughout the worldâ€™s tropical and subtropical regions in both endemic and epidemic transmission cycles, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the rise of air travel over the past century has resulted in a highly inter-connected world, where geographical distance is becoming less of a barrier to pathogen dispersal. However, few studies have quantified and validated changes in seasonal and long-term risks of international spread for infectious diseases. In China, dengue remains a seasonal disease occasionally triggered by imported dengue viruses in travellers, with more than 90% of imported cases between 2005 and 2014 originated from South-East Asia. Therefore, taking dengue importation from South-East Asia into China as an example, we constructed a branching process modelling framework to integrate three components for assessing the risk of dengue introduction into a country: 1) the risk of a person acquiring the disease in the origin country; 2) the probability of a person traveling to the destination country of interest while infectious; and 3) the likelihood of subsequent local transmission in the destination country. This model has revealed the seasonal patterns and increasing risks in routes of dengue spread by air travel over a decade. The spatiotemporal heterogeneities of dengue importation risk have also been seen in the travelers of Chinese and SEA residents. The risk of introduced transmission from particular routes highlighted could be used to inform efforts to dengue prevention and control, particularly in currently neglected, high-risk locations.
