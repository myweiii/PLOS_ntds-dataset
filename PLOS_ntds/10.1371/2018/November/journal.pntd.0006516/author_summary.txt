Trichinella spiralis can make collagen capsules in host muscle cells during its life cycle, which encapsulates muscle stage larvae. Many investigators have tried to reveal the complex mechanism behind this collagen capsule architecture, and it has been suggested that several serine proteases in excretory-secretory proteins of the parasite are potential collagen capsule inducing factors. In addition, collagen synthesis is activated through the TGF-Î²/Smad signaling pathway and these events are closely related with protease activated receptor 2 which was activated by various serine proteases. In this study, we isolated and characterized a collagen gene expression inducer from T. spiralis ES-P using immunoscreening and investigated the candidate protein for its usefulness as a wound healing therapeutic agent.
