Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) affect 1.4 billion people worldwide and cause significant morbidity when the intensity of infection is high. Currently, these infections are controlled in school-aged children by preventive chemotherapy with the benzimidazole drugs albendazole (ALB) or mebendazole (MEB). However, for the success of these control programs, it is essential to keep track of the efficacy of these drugs and to screen parasite populations for a possible rise of anthelmintic resistance (AR). In this light, a series of trials will be performed to assess the efficacy of ALB treatment against STH in four endemic countries with varying drug pressure. Both microscopic and molecular stool-based diagnostic methods will be used to evaluate drug efficacy. DNA samples will also be analysed for the presence and prevalence of mutations in a gene that was previously linked to AR in animal STHs. The results of these trials will provide evidence on the efficacy of ALB, help select the optimal diagnostic method to assess drug efficacy and provide information regarding the usefulness of genetic markers for AR detection in human STHs.
