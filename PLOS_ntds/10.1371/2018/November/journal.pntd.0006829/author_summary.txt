In the absence of a Lassa fever vaccine, rodent control is the primary prevention option. An effective rodent control intervention must understand human behaviour towards the rodent such as: human–rodent interactions, cohabitation, and local rodent control measures. We conducted a rodent control intervention at community level in a Lassa Virus endemic area in Upper Guinea (Guinea) accompanied by an anthropological study on people’s perceptions and recommendations on the intervention. Based on our results we seek to broaden the rodent control intervention by including environmental hygiene, house repairs and rodent-proof storage. Chemical treatment has proven effective for rodent control but other factors involved in human-rodent interactions should also be addressed. Our findings highlight the need for Lassa fever prevention and rodent control initiatives to work in collaboration with communities and undertake a holistic approach towards rodent control.
