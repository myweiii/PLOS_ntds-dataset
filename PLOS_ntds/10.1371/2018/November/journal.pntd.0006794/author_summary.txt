Critical questions remain regarding the potential for achieving elimination of helminth (worm) infections, and methods are needed to quickly estimate the probability of achieving elimination over specific timeframes. Here, we make use of methods in mathematical epidemiology to propose an estimator of elimination potential, and then apply this estimator of Reff−the number of parasites produced by a single reproductive parasite at a given stage in the transmission cycle, over the parasite’s lifetime—as a so-called ‘elimination feasibility coefficient,’ or ‘ε.’ We compare this metric ε to commonly used metrics of population viability for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis. The value of this estimator is that it allows us to determine whether an elimination program is succeeding and how much effort might be required to bring it to completion.
