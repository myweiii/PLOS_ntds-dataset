Subconjunctival adult Loa loa is one of the ocular manifestations of paraisitosis by Loa loa, which is categorized as a neglected benign disease. Loa loa transmission has predominantly been amongst inhabitants in rural communities in Nigeria, one of the countries in the endemic belt of Africa. However we report a case series of 4 patients presenting with subconjunctival Loa loa who in childhood lived in rural communities but later migrated from rural to urban cities where they presented. The varied presentation of the patients in this series and the technique of worm removal are reported.
