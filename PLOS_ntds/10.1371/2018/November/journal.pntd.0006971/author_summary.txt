Lassa fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The different LASV strains are grouped into lineages based on the geographical location of the isolated strains. The aim of our study was to characterize the lineage II strains in southern Nigeria. We sequenced LASV RNA genome from positive cases of LF between 2012 and 2016 which were reported at tertiary hospitals in Ebonyi and Enugu in southeastern Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral proteins showed the division of lineage II strains into two genetic clades with one clade being more conserved than the other despite evolving at similar rates. Also, our phylogenetic analysis supported the role of human to human transmission in the 2014 outbreak, in keeping with the epidemiological data. These results provide additional information on the evolution of LASV in southern Nigeria and LF outbreak management.
