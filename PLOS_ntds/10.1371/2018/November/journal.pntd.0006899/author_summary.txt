Chagas disease is a parasitic infection, which in 30% of people results in chronic dilated organomegaly over the course of decades. This progressive disease typically advances subclinically until end stage heart failure is established, at which point treatment is no longer efficacious. Thus, current public health efforts target screening of high-risk populations for early disease detection and clinical management for improved health outcomes. Although historical evidence suggests the Texas-Mexico border as a region with high Chagas disease prevalence, surveillance is nonexistent. Our study indicates this region likely has an increased risk for undiagnosed morbidity. Furthermore, occupational histories were highlighted as key risk factors for both cases in this report. Physicians should consider Chagas screening in persons with residential histories along the Texas-Mexico border.
