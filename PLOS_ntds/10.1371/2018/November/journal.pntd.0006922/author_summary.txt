Definitive diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis(VL) by demonstration of amastigotes by microscopy is invasive and risky. Serology based diagnosis using rK39 rapid diagnostic test(RDT) has excellent sensitivity of~97% when combined with clinical symptoms but is inconclusive for detection of active infection and relapses due to persistence of anti-leishmanial antibodies. The developed SYBR Green I based closed tube LAMP assay overcomes these constraints and further, direct blood lysis (DBL)-LAMP, makes it more suitable for field application. The study involved validation of LAMP assay at two endemic sites in India, on a total of 179 VL patients confirmed by rK39 RDT and/ or microscopy and 88 controls. The assay was highly sensitive (98.32%) and specific (96.59%). Further, DBL-LAMP assay yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 93.05% and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, the study has validated the field potential of LAMP assay for diagnosis of VL which will provide momentum to ongoing VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent (ISC).
