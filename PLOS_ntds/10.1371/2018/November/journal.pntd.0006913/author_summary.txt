The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes lifelong infection in humans. Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic HTLV-1 causes severe disease in at least 5% of carriers. In the present study we estimate the number of HTLV-1 infections that occur annually due to mother to child transmission (MTCT) in Brazil and within its regions. The high number of estimated cases due to MTCT (3,024) which will give rise in adult life to HTLV-1associated diseases suggest the importance of performing HTLV-1 antenatal screening in Brazil to reduce the dissemination of this infection and to thus prevent a blood cancer to which most individuals succumb within 8 months of presentation and in others a disabling disease of the spinal cord.
