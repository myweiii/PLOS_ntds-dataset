Typhoid fever is a common disease among children in Cambodia. It can be fatal or lead to chronic faecal carriage if not treated. In resource-limited settings, typhoid fever is often diagnosed and treated presumptively. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of introducing a rapid diagnostic test for typhoid fever in a remote setting in Cambodia. In a hypothetical cohort with 1000 children in each arm we compared the use of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with a presumptive clinical diagnosis. In each arm, we calculated the number of true-positive typhoid fever cases detected, treatment success at seven days, and the cost of making a correct diagnosis and providing the correct treatment. The RDT detected 5.87 more true positives, had 3.61 more treatment successful cases, but the total cost was $ 5700 higher per 1000 children. Additional analysis showed that the RDT would be more cost-effective if the sensitivity could be improved or cost lowered.
