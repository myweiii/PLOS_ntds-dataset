Scavenger Receptors (SRs) are constituents of hostâ€™s innate immune system able to sense and remove altered-self and/or pathogen components. Data on their interaction with helminth parasites is scarce. In this work, we describe that CD5 and CD6 -two lymphoid SRs previously reported to interact with conserved structures from bacteria, fungi and viruses- recognize tegumental components in the cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.). Moreover, both receptors differentially modulate the cytokine release by host cells exposed to E. granulosus s.l. tegumental components. Importantly, the infusion of soluble forms of CD5 or CD6 improve infection outcomes in a murine model of secondary cystic echinococcosis. In summary, our results expand the pathogen binding properties of CD5 and CD6 and suggest their therapeutic potential against helminth infections.
