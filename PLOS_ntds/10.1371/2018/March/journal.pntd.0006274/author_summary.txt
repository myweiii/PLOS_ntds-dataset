Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that is caused by flatworms that live inside venous vessels. The parasite eggs are eliminated with human feces. They hatch in the water and the free swimming larvae infect snails. The larvae develop in the snail tissues and, on reaching an infective stage, are released into the water and can penetrate human skin to restart the cycle. Millions of people on several continents have schistosomiasis, although sanitary improvements, treatment, and environmental control have reduced the intensity of transmission in various localities around the world. In order to eliminate schistosomiasis, identification of infected individuals is critical. However, in areas where transmission has declined, the methods used to detect eggs in human feces are not sufficiently sensitive. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate new and more sensitive methods for obtaining a diagnosis of schistosomiasis. This study compared the relative performance of the POC-CCA method, which detects parasite molecules released in urine and the Helmintex (HTX) method, which isolates eggs from large volumes of feces in a magnetic particle-based assay, together with the Kato-Katz method. In comparison with the egg detecting methods (Kato-Katz [KK] and HTX), the POC-CCA method exhibited limitations in detecting low intensity infections, while the HTX method was confirmed to be a highly sensitive diagnostic method for schistosomiasis. These results provide insights into the deployment of diagnostic tools for efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis in low endemic regions.
