Being endemic in several countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Southeastern Europe, the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) is the geographically most widespread tick-borne arbovirus. As evidenced by the recent occurrence of an autochthonous CCHFV infection in Spain, it possesses also a significant potential to spread to as yet non-endemic regions. Due to the severity of the disease caused by this bunyavirus, the lack of specific prophylactic and therapeutic measures and the infection’s epidemic potential, CCHFV was included in the WHO priority list of diseases needing urgent R&D attention, in particular the development and improvement of diagnostic tools. Here we present the development and validation of two novel ELISAs (BLACKBOX CCHFV IgM, BLACKBOX CCHFV IgG) for the detection of CCHFV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies employing recombinant CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP) as antigen. Test performance in comparison to both in-house gold standard testing (CCHFV IgM/IgG immunofluorescence test (IIFT)) and commercial ELISA kits (VectoCrimean-CHF-IgM/IgG; Vector-Best) was evaluated using a thoroughly characterized serum panel that was obtained from 15 Kosovar patients with an RT-PCR-confirmed CCHFV-infection collected during the years 2013–2016 and that comprised samples from both the acute and convalescent phase of the disease. While both IgM ELISAs, like the CCHFV IgM IIFT, detected CCHFV-specific IgM antibodies in all sera collected during the acute phase of the disease on day 5 after onset of symptoms or later, the BLACKBOX CCHFV IgG ELISA and the CCHFV IgG IIFT were found to be significantly more sensitive than the VectoCrimean-CHF-IgG ELISA in detecting the rising IgG antibody titers in samples collected between days 11 and 19 after onset of symptoms.
