In China, the morbidity of clonorchiasis resulting from the infection of Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) increased every year and 1.5 to 2 million patients develop to the late stageâ€”liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or cholangiocarcinoma. Proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines produced by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems can trigger fibroblasts and nonfibroblastic cells by transdifferentiation, especially in liver fibrosis caused by parasitic infections. T helper type 2 (Th2)-cell skewing immune responses presented during chronic clonorchiasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain vague in Th2 immunologic cascade-related reaction following C. sinensis infection. The present study illustrated that C. sinensis adult-derived proteins (CsTPs) inhibited LPS-induced maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) via mannose receptor in vitro and led to BMDC-induced differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 cells though the production of IL-10. Our findings also confirmed that CsTPs initiated Th2-cell skewing immune responses to markedly elevate the production of IL-13 and IL-4 which are closely associated with the generation of liver fibrosis.
