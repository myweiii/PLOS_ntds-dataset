In this paper, we used a multiplexed, serologic assessment to identify children with previous or current exposure to or infection with filarial parasites or S. stercoralis (a soil transmitted helminth), enhancing our understanding of co-infections in early childhood. We identified an increasing prevalence of filarial antibodies over time in a population of children as young as 6 months old. In addition, we found a significant association between filarial seropositivity at six months of age and subsequent severe malaria.
