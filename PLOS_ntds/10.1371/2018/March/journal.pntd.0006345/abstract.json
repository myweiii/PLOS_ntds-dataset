    "Abstract": "The disease burden of Wuchereria bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum malaria is high, particularly in Africa, and co-infection is common. However, the effects of filarial infection on the risk of severe malaria are unknown. We used the remaining serum samples from a large cohort study in Muheza, Tanzania to describe vector-borne filarial sero-reactivity among young children and to identify associations between exposure to filarial parasites and subsequent severe malaria infections. We identified positive filarial antibody responses (as well as positive antibody responses to Strongyloides stercoralis) among infants as young as six months. In addition, we found a significant association between filarial seropositivity at six months of age and subsequent severe malaria. Specifically, infants who developed severe malaria by one year of age were 3.9 times more likely (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 13.0) to have been seropositive for filarial antigen at six months of age compared with infants who did not develop severe malaria."
