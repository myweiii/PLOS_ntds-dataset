Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a neglected tropical disease that represents a risk to more than seventy million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most cases are caused by infection with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Diagnosis of HAT relies on the identification of suspected cases by serological methods, which include recently developed rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Current RDTs are produced using native antigens that are purified from live parasites in a laborious and dangerous process. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a new RDT made using recombinant antigens, by screening people in fifteen endemic sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new RDT was found to be more sensitive than, and as specific as, the reference RDT made using native antigens. It was also more sensitive than CATT, a serological test that has been widely used for decades. While one third of HAT cases were correctly diagnosed by all tests, the other cases were only identified by one or two of the tests. In order to enhance case detection and accelerate elimination of HAT, there may be a need to explore diagnostic strategies that combine two or more screening tests.
