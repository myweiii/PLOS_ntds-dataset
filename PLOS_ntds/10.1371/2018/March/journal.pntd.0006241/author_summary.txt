Benin, like other low or moderate-income countries in the African continent, is endemic for several neglected tropical diseases, including soil-transmitted helminthiases. The National Program for Neglected Tropical Diseases of the Ministry of Health has conducted the national STH mapping using the Kato-Katz method to assess the baseline epidemiological status in all 77 districts of Benin, in order to guide implementation of a preventive chemotherapy program using albendazole. The results of the survey showed that infection with at least one of the three targeted species (hookworm, roundworm or whipworm) affected 20% or more of school aged children in 45 out of 77 districts, and which therefore require PCT. Hookworm infection was the most prevalent followed by ascariasis and trichuriasis. Boys were significantly more likely than girls to be infected with hookworm or ascariasis.
