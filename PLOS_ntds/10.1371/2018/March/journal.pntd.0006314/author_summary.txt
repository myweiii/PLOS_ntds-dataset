In Brazil, around 1.8 million people, mostly in the northeastern region of the country, are thought to be infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts of the S. mansoni. A special program for schistosomiasis control was implemented more than 40 years ago in Brazil, decreasing prevalence, morbidity, and mortality over the past years. PCR-based diagnostic methods have been successfully applied in a few endemic areas of schistosomiasis in Brazil, although they are not still widely used due to the highly technical requirements making them unviable for routine application in field conditions. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology could be a powerful tool to apply for point-of-care testing in resource-poor settings. In previous work, a LAMP-based method to detect S. mansoni DNA, called SmMIT-LAMP, was developed by our research group to detect S. mansoni DNA testing stool samples from experimentally infected mice. Here, with the aim to apply SmMIT-LAMP as a cost-effective molecular tool for the detection of S. mansoni in field applicable conditions, we assess SmMIT-LAMP in human and snail samples collected in an endemic area of Brazil. The results obtained by Kato-Katz analysis of human stool samples and nested-PCR performed in snails were compared with the SmMIT-LAMP assay. It is the first time that a LAMP-based method has been used to identify potential transmission foci and to evaluate the epidemiological risk of acquiring schistosomiasis.
