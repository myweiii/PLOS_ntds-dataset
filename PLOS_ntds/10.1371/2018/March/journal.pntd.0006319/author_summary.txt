Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis in the tropics. However, there is still a major barrier of early diagnosis of leptospirosis due to a lack of specific and sensitive testing. Moreover, in resource-limited countries with small budgets, a simple and cheap diagnostic test is essential for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. The THAI-LEPTO score has been developed and validated based on the relevant clinical history and related laboratory test. This score will help the physician in early diagnosis and prompt treatment leptospirosis as a point of care test. Finally, we aim that this scoring system can be one of the key parts of diagnostic algorithm and improve leptospirosis patientsâ€™ outcome.
