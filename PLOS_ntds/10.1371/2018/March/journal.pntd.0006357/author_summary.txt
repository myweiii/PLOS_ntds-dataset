In our study we have described for the first time in a large cohort of Australian patients the natural history of wound healing of Mycobacterium ulcerans lesions following treatment with antibiotics. We have shown that the lesions usually initially clinically improve with a reduction in induration size, and then deteriorate with increased induration and ulceration, prior to healing after the inflammation associated with lesions resolves. The time to complete healing of lesions is generally long (on average 4.5 months), and is further prolonged in those with increasing initial lesion size or in those who develop paradoxical reactions. In some cases excisional surgery of lesions can reduce healing times by 1â€“2 months. Knowledge of the natural history of wound healing on antibiotics provides important prognostic information for patients and clinicians when managing Mycobacterium ulcerans disease. This information is also needed as a baseline to assess the impact of new interventions aimed at improving healing times. Furthermore, knowledge of factors that affect wound healing times may lead to interventions that significantly reduce them, and in turn the quality and effectiveness of M. ulcerans treatment.
