The Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects up to 20 million people worldwide who predominantly reside in resource-limited areas. The virus is associated with a haematological malignancy (adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, ATL), and inflammatory diseases involving organ systems including the spinal cord, eyes and lungs. Determining the outcomes of infection in most HTLV-1 endemic areas is extremely difficult; however, the virus is highly endemic to central Australia where the Indigenous population has access to sophisticated medical facilities. We prospectively followed a large hospital-based cohort of Indigenous Australian adults that was well characterized with regard to base-line comorbid conditions, HTLV-1 serostatus and HTLV-1 proviral load (pVL). A higher baseline HTLV-1 pVL was strongly associated with an increased risk of airway inflammation (bronchitis/bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis) and death, which most often resulted from complications of bronchiectasis. Increased mortality due to an HTLV-1-associated inflammatory condition has not been demonstrated previously. The morbidity and mortality associated with HTLV-1 infection may therefore be substantially higher than has been assumed from an analysis of cohorts of subjects with adult T-cell leukaemia or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research and for determining health care priorities in resource-limited settings.
