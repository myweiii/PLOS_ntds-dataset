In this study, we provided a single round of total community treatment (TCT) with azithromycin to the population of a sub-district in Ghana (16,287 people) that is endemic for yaws and surrounded by other yaws-endemic communities to determine whether a sustained decrease in yaws prevalence could be achieved up to one year after the intervention. The efficacy of TCT was assessed by performing a clinical evaluation and serological testing of any yaws-like lesions found as well as serological screening of asymptomatic schoolchildren aged 5â€“15 years pre-TCT and at one year post-TCT. The results indicate that after a single round of high coverage TCT (89%) with azithromycin, the prevalence of active and latent yaws was significantly reduced. We also found that the use of a dual point-of-care immunoassay to detect non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies among school-going children is a practical alternative to laboratory-based serological testing to evaluate the effectiveness of yaws interventions in resource-poor settings.
