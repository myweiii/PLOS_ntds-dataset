Plague is a type of zoonosis that is highly lethal to humans. The surveillance of animal hosts is critical for the prevention and control of plague. The Yulong plague focus is a newly discovered plague focus in China in recent years. The plague outbreak had attracted widespread attention because 5 people were infected in 2005, 2 of whom died. We have monitored the plague focus for a decade, and isolated strains and DNAs of Yersinia pestis were studied. The structure, origin and evolutionary trend of the Yulong plague focus were clarified, which provides a scientific basis for the effective prevention and control of human plague. This article also provides a set of paradigms for the systematic study of new plague foci, which is a perfect combination of traditional monitoring methods and modern research methods.
