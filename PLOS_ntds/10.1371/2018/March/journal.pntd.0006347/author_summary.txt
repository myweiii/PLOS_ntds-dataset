Lymphatic filariasis (LF), endemic in 72 countries, is a debilitating mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease caused by filarial worms. The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) aims to interrupt transmission through mass drug administration (MDA) and to reduce suffering caused by the disease. At the start of GPELF in 2000 it was estimated that approximately 1.4 billion people were at risk for infection. By the end of 2016, primarily through successful MDA programs, the global number of people requiring interventions was reduced to 856.4 million. Current recommendations by the World Health Organization for LF surveillance advise programs to implement activities to monitor for new foci of transmission after stopping MDA. A current need in the global effort to eliminate LF is to standardize diagnostic tools and surveillance activities beyond the recommended transmission assessment survey (TAS). Two TAS were conducted in American Samoa; first in 2011 (TAS 1) and repeated in 2015 (TAS 2). In our evaluation, circulating filarial antigen and serologic results from both surveys were analyzed to determine whether interruption of LF transmission has been achieved in American Samoa. Despite passing TAS 1 and TAS 2, clustering and persistence of positive antibody responses in schools may be an indication of ongoing transmission. Results from our evaluation suggest that serologic tools can have a role in guiding programmatic decision-making.
