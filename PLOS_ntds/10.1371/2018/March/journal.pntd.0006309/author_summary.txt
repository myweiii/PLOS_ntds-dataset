Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is one of the worldâ€™s most dangerous zoonoses. Although there have been recent advances in some aspects of the molecular biology of E. multilocularis, larval development is far from understood. An in vitro hepatocyte based cultivation system for the metacestode stage of E. multilocularis has been developed to improve our understanding of AE. However, in two-dimensional conventional cultures, hepatocytes rapidly lose key phenotypic and functional characteristics after only approximately seven days. This hinders long-term in vitro studies of E. multilocularis larvae, which require several months for development. Thus, in this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) hepatic model was developed for simulating the organotropism of E. multilocularis toward the liver of its intermediate host. This 3D model can preserve the functions of hepatocytes and results in rapidly developed E. multilocularis larva. Genes uniquely expressed in protoscoleces and vesicles provided key information for the further study of AE. The 3D hepatic model provides a new foundation for E. multilocularis developmental studies and in-depth analysis of the host-parasite interaction in AE.
