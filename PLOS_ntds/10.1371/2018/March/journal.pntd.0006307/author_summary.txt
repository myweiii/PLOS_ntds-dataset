Mosquitoes transmit many devastating diseases, including malaria, dengue, and Zika, which together are responsible for over one million deaths per year. Major reasons for this tragic situation are the unavailability of effective vaccines and drugs for most mosquito-borne diseases, increased resistance of vectors to insecticides, and resistance of pathogens to currently available drugs. A thorough understanding of the molecular machinery involved in mosquito fertility is essential for developing vector control strategies. In this study, we observed a unique feature of the Aedes aegypti Notch (AaNotch) in the control of a sterile-like phenotype in female mosquitoes. Silencing AaNotch using a reverse genetic approach revealed significant reductions in fecundity and fertility. It also resulted in the abolishment of micropyles, which led to impaired fertilization. However, no effect on fecundity and fertility was observed in the absence of AaDelta, a canonical Notch transmembrane ligand. Although JNK is a downstream component of the non-canonical Notch signaling pathway, treatment with a JNK inhibitor resulted in impaired fecundity and fertility. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Notch-dependent regulation of sterile-like female mosquitoes is controlled by non-canonical Notch signaling.
