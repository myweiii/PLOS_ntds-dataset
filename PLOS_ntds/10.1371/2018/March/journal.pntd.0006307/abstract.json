    "Abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway is a highly evolutionarily-conserved cell-cell signaling pathway that regulates many events during development. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation during embryonic and adult development. However, functions of Notch signaling in Aedes aegypti, the major mosquito vector for dengue, are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a unique feature of A. aegypti Notch (AaNotch) in the control of the sterile-like phenotype in female mosquitoes. Silencing AaNotch with a reverse genetic approach significantly reduced the fecundity and fertility of the mosquito. Silencing AaNotch also resulted in the prevention of micropyle formation, which led to impaired fertilization. In addition, JNK phosphorylation (a signaling molecule in the non-canonical Notch signaling pathway) was inhibited in the absence of AaNotch. Furthermore, treatment with a JNK inhibitor in the mosquito resulted in impaired fecundity and fertility. Taken together, our results demonstrate that non-canonical Notch signaling is essential for controlling fertility in the A. aegypti mosquito."
