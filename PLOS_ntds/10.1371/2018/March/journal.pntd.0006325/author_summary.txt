Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, caused by 3 nematode parasites, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. The aim of the Global Program to Eliminate LF (GPELF) is to interrupt LF transmission through mass drug administration (MDA) by 2020 and to alleviate the suffering of affected people. Mapping is the first programmatic step to determining areas of LF endemicity and establishing a national program. Ethiopia was believed to be endemic for LF, but until recently the distribution of LF in the country was unknown. From 2008–2013, mapping for LF was conducted using the current WHO protocol, and 112 woredas were identified as endemic or possibly endemic. In 45 of these 112 woredas, only a single CFA positive result was found (<1% prevalence), which called into question the stutus of transmission and need for MDA. To help resolve this uncertainty, a new confirmatory mapping tool was designed and tested in Ethiopia. The new mapping tool was piloted in the 45 woredas with uncertain LF transmission from the 2008–2013 mapping (S1 Table). This mapping confirmed that only 3 of the 45 woredas were endemic, which decreased estimated total population at risk of LF and in need of MDA from 11,580,010 to 5,893,309.
