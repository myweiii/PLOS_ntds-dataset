Despite the suggestion that nutritional deficiencies may impair host immune responses against Mycobacterium leprae, there has not been any systematic study on how various aspects of poverty interact and associate with nutrition and leprosy. In poor rural areas in Indonesia that have the highest proportion of multibacillary cases, we aimed to investigate these associations by interviewing recently leprosy diagnosed patients and measuring their anemia and iron profiles. Our findings suggested that, compared to the control population, people who are at an increased risk of contracting leprosy have lower education, lack of stable income to provide diverse types of food, and are anemic. Although low serum iron and high ferritin levels were found more commonly in those with leprosy, we did not find a significant association between iron deficiency and leprosy. Our study clarifies that food poverty is an important risk factor for leprosy susceptibility, yet the mechanisms underlying the association between diet and leprosy other than nutrient deficiencies still need to be identified. Improving dietary diversity through food-based approaches should be initiated and directed towards high-prevalence villages.
