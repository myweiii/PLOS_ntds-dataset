Preventive chemotherapy plays a critical role in breaking transmission of soil-transmitted helminths but it is likely that sustainable control of soil-transmitted helminths will require environmental improvements such as access to water for hygiene and hygienic sanitation, access to and use of a clean toilet facility, and handwashing with soap at key times (WASH). Here, we report on school-, home- and community-level WASH and the relationship of these characteristics with the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection, one of the most prevalent soil-transmitted helminths, observed in the context of preventive chemotherapy among Togolese school children. In this large, country-wide assessment, few WASH conditions were found to be significant predictors of the presence or absence of hookworms in an individual, however, intensity of infection was associated with several WASH characteristics. Our analysis emphasizes the complex and often unpredictable role of WASH characteristics on hookworm, particularly relevant for Togolese and other international policy makers aiming to understand the interaction between WASH, preventive chemotherapy and hookworm. Further research taking into account not only WASH conditions but also use of WASH resources and practices would further strengthen our understanding of the interaction between WASH and deworming treatment as effective hookworm control strategies.
