Host-parasite interactions are usually studied as a binary system, without considering the role of the host microbiota. This work integrates microbiome research into the study of gastrointestinal Chagas disease. We show that T. cruzi infection perturbs the fecal microbiome and metabolome, indicating functional changes affecting the gastrointestinal lumen. Our results support further investigation into the role of the microbiota-parasite interaction in gastrointestinal Chagas disease pathogenesis.
