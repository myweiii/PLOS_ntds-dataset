We present, for the first time, a series which describes clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with Q fever in our region (Galicia, North-Western Spain). Our results showed that pneumonia is the main form of presentation of Q fever in our area, with headache and cough as the most frequent symptoms. We also found a very low percentage of patients with potential exposure risks (5%), which reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of alternative mechanisms of transmission to animal reservoir contact. Due to the lack of data available, we believe that the present work could be the starting point to improve the knowledge of this disease in our area. We also developed a systematic review of all series published in Spain, which showed a geographycal pattern linked to form of presentation, with pneumonia as the main form in Northern regions and hepatitis and isolated fever in Central and Southern regions.
