Helminth infections downregulate immunity and reduce hostâ€™s inflammatory responses, but the filarial nematode Mansonella ozzardi, which is widely distributed across Latin America, appears to represent an exception to this rule. We found similar lymphoproliferative responses to filarial and unrelated antigens and comparable regulatory cytokine responses in subjects harboring M. ozzardi microfilariae, compared to local uninfected controls. The proportion of CD4+ T cell subtypes expressing CD39 was significantly increased in infected subjects and correlated positively with their microfilarial density. However, antibody blocking of CD39, an ectonucleosidase involved in the synthesis of the immunosuppresive molecule adenosine, paradoxically reduced, rather than promoted, antigen-driven lymphoproliferation in vitro. We suggest that CD39+ CD4+ T cells circulating in microfilaremics comprise both regulatory and stimulatory cell subsets that are concomitantly expanded. The balance between these cell subsets with opposing regulatory functions may be crucial to maintain immune homeostasis during chronic M. ozzardi infections.
