Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease that mainly affects the skin. The disease results from infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, an environmental bacterium. In Benin, the BU treatment centres usually receive patients from Nigeria. In 2014, a study from one of the treatment centres (CDTUB, Pobe) which borders south-western Nigeria reported on a cohort of 127 PCR-confirmed cases between 2005 and 2013. We describe the epidemiological, clinical, biological and therapeutic characteristics of BU cases from Nigeria treated in the three other CDTUBs.
