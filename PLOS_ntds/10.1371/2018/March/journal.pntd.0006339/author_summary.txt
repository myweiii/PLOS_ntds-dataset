Infection is usually assayed as a static observation of a pathogen within a host; it is, nevertheless, a dynamic process that cannot be described from a single time point and arbitrary conditions. Results based on the usual methods are a snapshot of a convenient laboratory condition; a more comprehensive data set is required to describe the entire process of infection from inoculation of the host with a microorganism to establishment of a systemic infection, or elimination of the threat by the host. We design an experiment that takes into account increasing pathogen challenges to a mosquito host and viral levels along time; we use a dynamic mathematical model to analyze the resulting data set. The entire framework is used to compare susceptibility to dengue virus of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes either carrying the Wolbachia symbiont or not. Instead of a simple pairwise comparison, we are able to compare infection profiles and parameters associated to host immune processes in this insect-symbiont-virus system.
