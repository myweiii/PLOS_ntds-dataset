In Algeria, the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases (VL and CL) has been and continues to be based on antimony-containing drugs. It is suspected that high drug selective pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. Within the framework of knowledge about the epidemiology of VL and CL amassed during the last 30 years, we sampled Leishmania isolates to analyze their susceptibility to antimony. The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) that allowed us to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmanioses that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined. The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg/mL for VL and CL, respectively. We report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility of VL isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL was observed during the same period. The emergence of these S- phenotypes appears to correlate with the appearance of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. killicki (syn: L. tropica). We highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony resistance status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant srains.
