The management of Buruli ulcer (BU) is complex, resulting in high costs to families and health systems. Early detection and treatment heals lesions without functional limitations. Decentralization of the management of this disease into the peripheral health system remains a challenge for national control programs. We report here on an innovative pilot intervention of decentralization of the management of BU in one of the most BU-endemic districts in Benin. The intervention was preceded by a culturally sensitive outreach campaign, which explained the diseaseâ€™s symptoms and treatment options, and increased self-referral. It also included the treatment of all chronic ulcers free of charge. While serious cases of BU were still referred to the reference hospital for treatment, study results showed that 71% of BU cases could be treated in decentralized care; of these, 93% were successfully treated without functional limitations with antibiotics alone. The decentralized treatment option brought in new cases not previously treated by a proactive centralized BU program, and maintained total patient adherence to treatment protocols, in part through the support of community volunteer groups. The model developed in this pilot study may serve as the foundation and proof of concept for a larger community-based decentralized wound care agenda.
