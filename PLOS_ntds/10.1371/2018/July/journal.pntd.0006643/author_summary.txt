Snakebite is a major health issue affecting large numbers of people, particularly in tropical developing countries. Myanmar has one of the highest incidences of venomous snakebite in the world. Considering changes in demography, development, agricultural practices, knowledge about prevention and preventive practices, regular and accurate assessment of incidence is needed in order to improve public health programs and health services provision to improve health outcomes for snakebite patients. For that purpose, we conducted a large population based survey in Mandalay, which is one of the seven high incidence regions in Myanmar. The survey indicated a substantially higher incidence of snakebites than that suggested by the number of snakebite victims attending health care centres and hospitals. This higher incidence of snakebite has implications for community health service planning, scale of production of antivenom, and the need to improve access to health care centres or hospitals where antivenom is available, and suggests a need for community health education regarding appropriate 1st aid.
