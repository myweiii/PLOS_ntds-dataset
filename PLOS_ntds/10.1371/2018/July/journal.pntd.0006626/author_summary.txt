Aedes albopictus is one of the major human disease vectors and, despite substantial control efforts, it is rapidly spreading worldwide and increasing its epidemiological role. Thus, innovative approaches to fight this mosquito are urgently needed. Among the available control strategies, the exploitation of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia seems to be promising. In nature, the infection by Wolbachia is generally not detrimental, instead, it causes a series of modifications in host physiology promoting the spread of the infection in uninfected populations. Herein, we report on the artificial transinfection of specific Wolbachia strains in Ae. albopictus to replace its native Wolbachia infection type. This manipulation aimed at exploiting the expected modifications in the reproductive biology and vector competence of the species to contribute to reduce its epidemiological role. Specifically, we found that the new double Wolbachia infection did not affect Ae. albopictus fitness. The males belonging to the manipulated line, ARwP-M, induced full egg infertility in the wild-type females they mate with and showed increased male mating competitiveness. Remarkably, the ARwP-M females demonstrated significantly reduced competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses while both tested Ae. albopictus lines showed a very low susceptibility for Zika virus. These findings may encourage the use of ARwP-M Ae. albopictus as a highly efficient and safe biocide to suppress the wild-type populations.
