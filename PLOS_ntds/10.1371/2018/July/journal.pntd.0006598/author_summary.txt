Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus belonging to the genus Orthonairovirus of the Nairoviridae family. The virus is responsible for outbreaks of severe viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of approximately 30%. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues. A mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed (included in this study) and used on a small scale in eastern Europe. There is no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use. Currently, there are a limited number of serological assays commercially available for testing for CCHFV specific IgG and IgM. There are enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and imunnofluorescent assays (IFA) designed for screening human samples for diagnostic purposes however they are not cost effective for surveillance studies. The limiting factor for the replication of these protocols in other laboratories is the availability of antigens and (where relevant) specified monoclonal antibodies. To contribute to the improvement of the diagnostic methods for CCHFV, we aimed to identify and characterize new synthetic antigens that were more sensitive and specific and could be applied in epidemiologic surveys.
