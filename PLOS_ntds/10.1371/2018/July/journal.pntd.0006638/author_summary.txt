Studies conducted in our laboratory indicate that several species of mosquito larvae require living bacteria in their gut to grow. Previous results also show that living bacteria reduce gut oxygen levels below 5% and that bacteria-induced gut hypoxia functions as a signal that activates several processes in larvae with growth functions. Here we report that bacterial density affects larval growth rates and that other living organisms besides bacteria induce larval stage Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae to grow. In contrast, the requirement for living organisms was not altered by the diet larvae were fed. These findings are of fundamental interest because they show that several types of organisms in the gut activate the same growth-related processes when viable but none do so when non-viable. Reported results also have applied implications for producing axenic adult mosquitoes for use in different types of studies.
