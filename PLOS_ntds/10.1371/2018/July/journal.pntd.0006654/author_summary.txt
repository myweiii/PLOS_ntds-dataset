Schistosomiasis is a worldwide public health concern particularly in developing countries. The causative agents, schistosomes, can survive within the vascular system of their final hosts for several decades despite facing the hostâ€™s immune response. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of cell survival will contribute to the understanding of host-parasite interaction and may lead to the identification of suitable targets for developing novel strategies against schistosomiasis. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins are highly conserved proteins functioning as endogenous inhibitors of apoptotic cell death. Here, we demonstrated that an inhibitor of apoptosis protein of Schistosoma japonicum (SjIAP) governs the integrity of the tegument of schistosomes by inhibiting cellular apoptosis of the parasite. Further studies revealed that SjTeg-20, an S. japonicum tegumental protein, cooperates with SjIAP to inhibit apoptosis in schistosomes. Our findings provide new insights into the role of SjIAP and SjTeg-20 in maintaining the integrity of the worm tegument by negatively regulating apoptosis.
