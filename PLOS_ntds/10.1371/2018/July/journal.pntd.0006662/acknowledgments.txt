The local support by Lucinete Silva do Monte and Maria José da Silva Oliveira is highly appreciated. Joana Claudia Silva Dias took care of the study team every day. Without their help the study would not have been possible.
We are also grateful to the team of the Fundaçao de Medicina Tropical do Amazonas (FMT-AM) which provided infrastructure and helped to identify the study area. Data are part of the medical thesis of FR.
