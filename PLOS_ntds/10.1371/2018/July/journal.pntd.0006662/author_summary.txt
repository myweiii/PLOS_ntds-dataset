Hookworm-worm related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) is a parasitic skin disease caused by hookworm larvae of cats and dogs occurring in many countries with a tropical or subtropical climate. Humans are a biological impasse for these helminths as the larvae cannot pass the basal membrane of the epidermis and hence migrate haphazardly in the skin causing local inflammation and intense itching. In scientific literature HrCLM is generally described as a disease of travellers returning from endemic areas. In contrast, epidemiological data is scanty. In a previous study, we had examined an entire resource-poor neighbourhood in Manaus (Brazil) and showed, that HrCLM is an important individual and public health problem, affecting up to 8% of the population, in particular children. In this study, we followed a cohort of children for six months. We found a significant seasonal variation in incidence and morbidity between dry and rainy season. Extrapolated, every second child in this population will be affected at least once within one year. The longitudinal study design enabled us to validate previously identified risk factors. Children aged 10â€“14 years, in particular boys, and those walking barefoot on sandy ground had the highest infection rates. Children from the poorest families in the resource-poor community were most vulnerable to HrCLM.
