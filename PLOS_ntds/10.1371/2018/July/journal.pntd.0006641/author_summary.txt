Household members of cholera patients are at a 100 times higher risk of developing cholera infections than the general population. This risk is highest during the seven days after the cholera patient presents at a health facility. In this study we investigated the rate of cholera transmission within cholera patient households, identified risk factors for household cholera transmission, and performed genetic characterization of cholera strains collected. Stool was collected from patients, their household members, and from water sources and stored water during the seven days after the cholera patient presented at the health facility. A total of 230 human and water V. cholerae strains were collected and analyzed. Thirty seven percent of households had at least one household member with a V. cholerae infection. Thirteen percent of households had V. cholerae in their water source, and 27% had V. cholerae in stored drinking water. A water source with V. cholerae, consuming street vended food, and younger age were risk factors for cholera infections for household members of cholera patients. All strains from within households with water and human samples were closely related. These results demonstrate the importance of interventions focusing on water treatment and food hygiene for prevention of cholera.
