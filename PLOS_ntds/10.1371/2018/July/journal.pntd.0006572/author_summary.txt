Buruli ulcer (BU) remains a major Public Health problem in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. There are several reports of the occurrence of BU in Wildlife as well as domestic animals in Australia leading to the suggestion that animals may play a role in the transmission of MU to humans. Report of BU in animals is however scanty in Africa and no significant link has been made between BU in humans and animals. BU-like lesions were investigated in 397 and 361 roaming domestic animals respectively from Sedje-Denou and Akonolinga. Wound swabs, and tissue fragments were collected from animals with active lesions. Overall, 2 (8%) type I (<5 cm) animal lesions (localized on the abdominal part of a goat and the nape area of a dog) were colonized by MU in Benin. MU VNTR genotypes Z (4, 1, 2, 2) and C- (3, 1, 2, 0) were identified in the lesions of the goat and dog respectively. Significant homology was found between orthologous sequences of MU strains infecting animals and humans. The evolutionary history inferred from sequenced data revealed a clustering of animal MU isolates within isolates from human lesions. New reservoirs of MU were found through this study and allowed to a new interpretation of the life cycle of this mycobacterium from the risk environment to humans in Africa.
