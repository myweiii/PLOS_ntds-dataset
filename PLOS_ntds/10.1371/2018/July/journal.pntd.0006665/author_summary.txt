Human toxocariasis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stages of Toxocara canis (T. canis), the common roundworm of dogs, and by the roundworm of cats, Toxocara cati (T. cati). Toxocariasis is one of the most prevalent helminthiasis worldwide. Humans become infected by the ingestion of contaminated food or soil or by direct contact with dogs and cats. Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder worldwide with a global estimate of about 70 million cases of lifetime epilepsy. Early studies suggested high rate of toxocara exposure (toxocara seropositivity) among people with epilepsy. Despite several studies support the possible role of toxocariasis in the incidence of epilepsy, this association is still debated. We updated our previous research to gain further insight on the association. This study provides new evidence of a positive association between the two diseases. On this basis, health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp are strongly advised. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of certain parasites in epilepsy.
