    "Objective": "To gain further insight on the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy in light of the new evidence in the last years.",
    "Methods": "A systematic review was conducted without date and language restriction in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Ingenta Connect, Science Direct (Elsevier), RefDoc, Scopus, HighWire, Scielo and the database of the Institute of Neuroepidemiology and Tropical Neurology of the Limoges University (IENT). Two investigators independently conducted the search up to November 2017. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.",
    "Results": "Database search produced 204 publications. Eleven case-control studies were included that were carried out in 13 countries worldwide. A total number of 4740 subjects were considered (2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 people without epilepsy). The overall pooled OR was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42–2.01) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity. A positive association was constantly reported in the restricted analysis (WB as confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger population, and population–based studies). Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome.",
    "Conclusion": "The updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy. New surveys supported the association, mainly population-based studies. On this basis, health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp are strongly advised. Further research should be performed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis."
