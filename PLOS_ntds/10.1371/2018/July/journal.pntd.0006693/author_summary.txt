Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus capable of causing long term debilitating joint and muscle pain at a great economic expense. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or treatment for CHIKV infection. We generated a modified version of the virus, termed CHIKV 37997-mCherry, stably expressing a fluorescent tag on the surface of the virus. To achieve this, a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, was fused to the virus envelope protein E2. Structural studies demonstrated the presence of mCherry on the virus surface. Infection of mice with CHIKV 37997-mCherry caused less severe disease in the animals compared to wild-type virus. Infection with CHIKV 37997-mCherry induced immune responses against both the mCherry protein and the virus. Furthermore, CHIKV 37997-mCherry is as attenuated as the vaccine strain CHIKV 181/clone 25 in different mouse models, causing less joint swelling and reduced persistence of viral genomes in tissue. Our work suggests that chimeric alphaviruses carrying foreign antigen on virus particles may serve as vaccines against both aphaviruses and other pathogens and diseases.
