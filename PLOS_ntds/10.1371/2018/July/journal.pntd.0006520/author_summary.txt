Soil-transmitted Helminths potentially reduce physical growth and retard cognitive development in school-age children (SAC) with great implications for national control programs in Africa. In Uganda, baseline investigations between 1998 and 2002, indicated STH prevalence was over 60.0% in most districts, the commonest worms infections were Hookworms, Ascaris and Trichuris. Twice a year national deworming campaign was initiated in 2003 targeting aged 1â€“14 years. Over ten years of deworming campaigns, has reduced the overall STH prevalence to 8.8% in 2016. The findings suggest routine deworming campaigns reduce STH exposure and infections. Periodic program evaluations are key to determining the progress made in order to achieve the elimination targets by 2020.
