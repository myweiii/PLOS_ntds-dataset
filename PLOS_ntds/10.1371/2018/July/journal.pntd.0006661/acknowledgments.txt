We want to dedicate this work to the memory of Prof. Mário Alberto Cardoso Silva-Neto (1967–2017), one of the brightest minds we ever met, an example of dedication, integrity, and service to science, and a lovely human being, which inspired many of us with his permanent creativity, drive and enthusiasm for the scientific endeavor.
