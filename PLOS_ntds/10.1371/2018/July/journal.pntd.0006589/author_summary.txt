Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the main cause of death during Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection in patients. Individuals with CCC have high production of inflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and nitric oxide (NO) which are involved with myocarditis, fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy. Yet the role of innate immunity receptors in CCC pathophysiology has not been addressed. Activation of TLRs and NLRs is fundamental to activate the innate immune system and also to modulate adaptive responses. Herein we have evaluated the association between innate immune receptors and innate cytokines with the clinical manifestation, and with the cardiac function in patients with different clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. Our data suggest that high TLR2 and NLRP3 expression in cardiac patients may induce an enhancement of proinflammatory cytokine expression such as IL-1β, IL-12, TNF-α and participate of the pathophysiology of CCC. A better understanding of immunological mechanisms involved in CCC may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the most lethal clinical manifestation of Chagas Disease.
