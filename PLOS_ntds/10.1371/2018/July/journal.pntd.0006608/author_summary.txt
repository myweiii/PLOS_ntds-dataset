A key function of MΦ is to recognize, phagocytose and mount an antimicrobial response against microbial pathogens to defend the host. In humans, monocytes are recruited to the site of infection and differentiate into MΦ upon the onset of microbial infection. The MΦ phenotype and function are determined by the cytokine profile of the microenvironment in which the monocyte enters. Additionally, vitamin D is known to trigger direct antimicrobial responses against invading pathogens in MΦ, but also disrupts the differentiation of immune subsets within the myeloid lineage. Therefore, we investigated whether vitamin D status during MΦ differentiation influenced either phenotype or function. Here, we found that the IL-15 MΦphenotype is sustained regardless of vitamin D status. In contrast, antimicrobial MΦ differentiated in the presence of vitamin D exhibited a robust expression of an antimicrobial peptide, relative to MΦ differentiated in the absence of vitamin D. The antimicrobial MΦ armed with cathelicidin prior to M. leprae challenge demonstrated a strong antimicrobial response against the invading pathogen. Our study reveals that the presence of sufficient levels of vitamin D prior to microbial infection contributes to effectively reduce the viability of the pathogen in MΦ.
