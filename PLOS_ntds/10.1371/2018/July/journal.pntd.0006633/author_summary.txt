Coinfections of leprosy and HIV are a challenge for clinical management, particularly concerning peripheral neuropathy, which is common in leprosy and is also present in HIV infection. We conducted a clinical follow-up of leprosy patients coinfected with HIV and compared them to patients with leprosy alone and observed that coinfected patients were more likely to present overall peripheral nerve damage (nerve function impairmentâ€”NFI), especially in multibacillary patients, where motor damage was largely responsible for this impairment. Throughout the period using multidrug therapy (MDT) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the development of the damage, along with the occurrence of neuritis and complaints, decreased considerably. Thus, the data suggest that in addition to patients presenting possible damage caused by leprosy, they also have a greater damage gradient attributable to the disease due to HIV but not related to HAART. Another important point was the therapeutics used for neuritis with prednisone at doses recommended by the WHO, in which the coinfected patients had the highest rate of clinical improvement in the first 60 days. The characteristics of the two diseases should be considered in the understanding and clinical management of peripheral nerve alterations in leprosy patients coinfected with HIV. In addition, it became clear that further NFI assessment tests should be used with these patients.
