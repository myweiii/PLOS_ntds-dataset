In Pacific islands like in most tropical regions, Aedes mosquitoes affect the health of human populations by transmitting diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika and filariasis. The biting nuisance of Aedes mosquitoes also impacts local tourism, affecting the sustainability of island economies. Mosquito saliva is injected during the biting process, and the response triggered by the human immune system to proteins contained in mosquito saliva was shown to be a relevant biomarker of exposure to mosquito bites. Using this approach, we have developed an immuno-epidemiological tool to investigate the exposure of people to the bites of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, two significant mosquito vectors of infectious diseases in French Polynesia and other island countries and territories in the Pacific. This novel tool proved specific and reliable. It will improve the assessment of disease transmission risk and be useful for measuring the efficacy of both conventional and innovative vector control strategies.
