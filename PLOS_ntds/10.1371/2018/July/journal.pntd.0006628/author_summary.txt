Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease that can manifest as a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome. The CCHF virus is widely spread throughout the African continent, the Balkans, the Middle East, Southern Russia and Western Asia where it remains a serious public health concern. Currently, there are no licensed treatments or vaccines available, and medical countermeasures are urgently needed. We developed an adenovirus vector vaccine based on the conserved structural nucleoprotein (N) as the antigen. A prime-boost approach showed promising efficacy in the most widely used immunocompromised mouse model. This vaccine approach demonstrates a role for N in protection and suggests its consideration for future CCHFV vaccine strategies.
