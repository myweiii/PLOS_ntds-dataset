Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and mainly transmitted through the infected faeces of insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Because these insects are sensitive to climatic conditions, it is expected that disease transmission may be affected by the increase in global land temperature, predicted under climate change. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the effect of temperature increase on the development, viability of eggs and fertility of R. prolixus, the most important vector insect in Colombia, and on the development of the parasite within this insect. We observed a decrease in the development time of R. prolixus and an increase in the number of infectious forms of T. cruzi in the insect as the temperature increased. These results suggest that if the temperature increases as expected, there may be an increase in the number of insects that can transmit the disease, as well as an increase in the likelihood of infection due to the increase in the number of infectious forms. Our data contributes to the understanding of the possible effects of the expected temperature increase under climate change on Chagas disease transmission and can be used to make predictive models that can more accurately predict the future of Chagas disease.
