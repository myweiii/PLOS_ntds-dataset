    "Background": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral human disease in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. In spite of the increasing global incidence, no specific antiviral therapy is available. Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are the main targets either for direct antibody (Ab)-independent or Ab-mediated human DENV infection, usually associated to the severe forms of disease. Since the virus entry may be a convenient therapeutic alternative, this study aimed to investigate the mode of DENV internalization into myeloid cells in the absence and presence of DENV Ab and evaluate the inhibitory activity of diverse biochemical inhibitors of endocytosis.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "By infectivity assays and quantitative RT-PCR determinations, it was demonstrated that DENV-2 entry into U937 and K562 cells in the absence of Ab was highly inhibited by the early treatment with ammonium chloride, chlorpromazine and dynasore, but it was not affected by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, indicating that DENV-2 utilizes a low pH-dependent, clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytic infectious pathway for the direct entry into both human myeloid cells. To study the Ab-mediated entry of DENV, the experimental conditions for enhancement of infection were established by inoculating immune complexes formed with DENV-2 and the Ab 2H2 or 3H5. The internalization of DENV-2-2H2 or DENV-2-3H5 complexes in both myeloid cells was also dependent on acid pH and dynamin but a differential requirement of the clathrin-mediated endocytic route was observed depending on the FcγR involved in the complex uptake: the infection through FcγRII was dependent on clathrin-coated vesicles whereas the internalization pathway mediated by FcγRI was independent of clathrin. This property was not serotype-specific.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "DENV entry into myeloid cells in the absence or presence of Ab can be blocked by diverse biochemical inhibitors affecting the cellular factors involved in endocytosis. The identification of the virus-host interactions involved in virus penetration may allow the finding of host-targeted antivirals widely active against diverse pathogenic flaviviruses with similar requirements for virus entry."
