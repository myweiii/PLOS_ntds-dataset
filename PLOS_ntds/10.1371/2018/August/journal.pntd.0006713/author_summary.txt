Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The treatment with BU-specific antibiotics is initiated after clinical suspicion based on WHO diagnostic criteria. In this study we evaluated the WHO diagnostic guidelines for BU and how these criteria could be improved. A total of 224 patients presenting with skin lesions were recruited in two BU treatment centers in southern Benin between March 2012 and March 2015. Most of the clinical and epidemiological WHO criteria were associated with a confirmed BU diagnosis although lesions on the lower limbs were rather associated with a negative PCR result. Among the additional characteristics studied, the characteristic smell of BU was most strongly associated with a positive PCR result. The WHO diagnostic criteria could therefore be improved upon by discriminating between lesions on the upper and lower limbs and by including lesion size and the characteristic smell recognized by experienced clinicians. The volatiles responsible for this smell could serve as a Point-of-Care diagnostic test, useful for non-invasive confirmation during active case-finding activities, and for training of clinicians.
