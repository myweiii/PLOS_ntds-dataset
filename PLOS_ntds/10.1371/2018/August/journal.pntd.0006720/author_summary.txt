For the past 30 years, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) has been isolated and associated with neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. It is known that the neurological disorder associated with HTLV-1 comprises HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP) or any other isolated signals and symptoms. Despite all the knowledge accumulated so far, the association of neurological diseases to HTLV-1 infection remains difficult and neglected. We designed this study in order to assess the degree of neurological impairment associated with HTLV-1 infection through a metabolic evaluation with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our results evidenced a more pronounced hypometabolism in the spinal cord of individuals with neurological impairment, but also evidenced hypometabolism in asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected individuals. We believe that areas of the CNS with lower circulatory and perfusional balance are more vulnerable to HTLV-1 infection. Mechanisms of cellular entry of the virus may be associated with loss of microcirculatory homeostasis and predisposition to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in these areas. Further studies are still necessary to shed light on the mechanisms associated with brain and spinal hypometabolism.
