Studying the relationship between soil-transmitted helminthiasis and gut microbiota is becoming more important as both have been implicated in modulating immune system in various inflammatory diseases. However, findings of previous studies of the effect of helminth on the microbiome are inconsistent. In this study, an optimal design, a placebo-controlled anthelminthic trial was conducted to dissect the effect of helminths and anthelminthic treatment on gut microbial profile. In addition, a novel statistical model was used to analyse the association by taking into account the correlation structures between bacterial categories by applying multivariate analysis whereby the multiple testing correction is not needed.
