River blindness is one of the most important causes of morbidity in the developing world. The discovery of ivermectin and the decision by its manufacturer to donate the drug for river blindness spawned the development of programs to eliminate river blindness through mass treatment of afflicted populations. But ivermectin alone will not eliminate river blindness in much of Africa; additional interventions are necessary. We show that a simple community-based approach to controlling the black fly vector results in dramatic reductions in the vector population. Such a community-based approach to vector control will be compatible with the community-driven mass drug administration programs distributing ivermectin for onchocerciasis elimination in Africa. This should help reduce the time needed to obtain elimination and help prevent recrudescence once elimination is attained.
