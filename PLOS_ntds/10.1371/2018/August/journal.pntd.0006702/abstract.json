    "Background": "Onchocerciasis a neglected tropical disease that historically has been a major cause of morbidity and an obstacle to economic development in the developing world. It is caused by infection with Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by black flies of the genus Simulium. The discovery of the potent effect of Mectizan (ivermectin) on O. volvulus microfilariae and the decision by its manufacturer to donate the drug for onchocerciasis spurred the implementation of international programs to control and, more recently, eliminate this scourge. These programs rely primarily on mass distribution of ivermectin (MDA) to the afflicted populations. However, MDA alone will not be sufficient to eliminate onchocerciasis where transmission is intense and where ivermectin MDA is precluded by co-endemicity with Loa loa. Vector control will likely be required as a supplemental intervention in these situations.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Because biting by the black fly vectors is often a major nuisance in onchocerciasis afflicted communities, we hypothesized that community members might be mobilized to clear the breeding sites of the vegetation that represents the primary black fly larvae attachment point. We evaluated the effect of such a community based \"slash and clear\" intervention in multiple communities in Northern Uganda. Slash and Clear resulted in 89\u201399% declines in vector biting rates. The effect lasted up to 120 days post intervention.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Slash and clear might represent an effective, inexpensive, community- based tool to supplement ivermectin distribution as a contributory method to eliminate onchocerciasis and prevent recrudescence."
