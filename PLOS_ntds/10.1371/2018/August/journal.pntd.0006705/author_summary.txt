The reasons for which some individuals resist Mycobacteria leprae infection, whereas others contract leprosy and only a subgroup of them become severely affected, are still poorly understood. The complement receptor 1 (CR1) serves as a gate for bacterial entry in macrophages, but its importance in the spread of infection and emergence of symptoms is unknown. Despite having many common structural and regulatory variants, the CR1 gene was investigated only once in a leprosy association study in Malawi. In order to fill in this gap, we investigated if CR1 polymorphisms are co-responsible for differential disease susceptibility in 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls, also measuring mRNA and soluble CR1 levels. Associations were dependent on specific combinations of variants in regulatory and coding regions, which were also associated with gene and protein expression. Thus, this study corroborates the importance of the CR1 receptor in the susceptibility to leprosy and is the first to bring information about CR1 polymorphisms in the Brazilian population, as well as to show the relationship between genotypes and mRNA and sCR1 levels.
