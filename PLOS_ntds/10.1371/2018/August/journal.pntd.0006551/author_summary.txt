Mass drug administration (MDA) is a key component of programs aimed at controlling soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis, diseases that disproportionately impact individuals in developing countries and adversely affect physical and cognitive development. The World Health Organization recommends evaluating the impact of mass drug administration on the prevalence of these infections after five years of MDA. We present here a study of the impact of four to five years of MDA on the prevalence and intensity of STH and schistosomiasis infections in school children in Togo. The prevalence and intensity of these infections in 2015 were significantly reduced compared to a baseline survey conducted in 2009. Local baseline prevalence in 2009 was the strongest predictor of infection in 2015. These infections are more prevalent in boys than in girls, and in older versus younger children. We found that in areas with high baseline prevalence of hookworm the risk of rebound of infection is high among children who do not receive bi-annual treatment. This information is important for programs weighing the decision to stop MDA in areas where prevalence has been reduced through treatment. This and other findings from this study may help refine treatment recommendations for these diseases.
