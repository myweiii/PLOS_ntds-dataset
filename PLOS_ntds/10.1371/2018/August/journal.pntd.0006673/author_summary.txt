Development of effective single agent therapy that could be used to treat either cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis could significantly benefit those in developing regions of the world where diagnosis may be delayed or uncertain. However, asymptomatic presentations of these diseases and overlapping symptomatology with other parasitic diarrheal diseases are significant public health challenges for which there are limited available remedies. An effective drug developed based on phenotypic properties against G. lamblia and C. parvum would likely have some impact on other diarrheal parasites and be useful as a prophylactic indication against asymptomatic diseases. An important step towards this goal is the use of fast and inexpensive methods to identify new potential drug candidates. Among the goals of this study is the design of an efficient bioluminescent assay that can be used to measure growth inhibition of G. lamblia trophozoites in an efficient, high-throughput screen of large compound libraries. Stable expression of the luciferase gene introduced into Giardia was observed over a 24-hour incubation period. The assay was validated for reproducibility and reliability against known G. lamblia drugs with the obtained EC50 values within a statistically acceptable range, compared to literature values. A test of the high-throughput drug screening capability of the assay was verified in a parallel screen of G. lamblia and C. parvum with the aim of finding potential dual pathogen-inhibiting molecules. Seven compounds inhibited both parasites at low micromolar levels as confirmed by follow up assays. This series of inhibitors could be further developed as therapeutics and potentially become an important new tool for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis treatments.
