We are grateful for the invaluable participation of the Pune city population and the study participants for having confidence and trust in the interviewers and sharing of required information with the research team. We are also appreciative of the physicians of the corporation and private clinics for allowing us to use their facilities. We received valuable support from the health officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation, the University authorities and Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, but for which the study would not have been feasible. Invaluable support from the staff members of the institute is also gratefully acknowledged.
