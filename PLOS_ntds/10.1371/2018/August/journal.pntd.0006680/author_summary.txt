Rabies transmission between dogs and from dogs to humans can be interrupted by mass vaccination of dogs. Novel geo-referenced contact sensors tracked the contacts and locations of several hundred dogs in N’Djaména, the capital of Chad. With the data generated by the sensors we developed a contact network model for rabies transmission dynamics. The model results compared well to incidence data. The model explains the relationship between vaccination campaigns and number of cases better than previous models. Highly connected dogs play a critical role in rabies transmission and targeted vaccination of these dogs would lead to more efficient vaccination campaigns.
