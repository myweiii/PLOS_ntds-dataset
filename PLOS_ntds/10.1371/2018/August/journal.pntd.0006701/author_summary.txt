The lack of effective vaccines and therapies for leishmaniasis along with the well-known resistance of the parasite to available agents prompted us to explore the effects of several mTOR inhibitors, including rapamycin, as potential therapeutics against Leishmania (L.) major, the classic Leishmania parasite strain. We found that systemic treatment with rapamycin and GSK-2126458, but not with KU-0063794, slows the progression of the disease and lowers the parasite burden in infected BALB/c mice. In addition, we observed more pronounced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes in addition to a T helper 1 (Th1)-biased cytokine profile among the splenic cells of treated mice. Importantly, rapamycin blood levels achieved after in vivo treatment with this agent was far lower than the in vitro doses of rapamycin that killed the promastigote form of the parasite. Therefore, we propose that the impressive therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin, and perhaps GSK-2126458, against L. major are likely owed to the immunomodulatory properties of these agents. Based on our findings, mTOR may be an attractive target for the development of novel and potent anti-Leishmania agents.
