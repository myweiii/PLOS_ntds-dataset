Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) causes a necrotising infection of skin and soft-tissue known as Buruli ulcer. Since the regular use of antibiotics for Buruli ulcer treatment in Australian populations was introduced at the turn of the century, treatment success rates have been very high. However there is no information from the Australian setting on the risk of recurrent disease following treatment and assumed cure, despite this being important prognostic information for patients, their families and health-care providers. Furthermore, it is also not known if recurrent disease represents late relapse of the initial treated infection or a subsequent new infection. In our study we have shown for the first time in Australian patients living in an endemic area that the incidence of recurrent Buruli ulcer following treatment and healing is low, and that this risk is similar to the estimated risk of primary infection within the general population of the endemic area. Furthermore, we have used clinical, treatment and epidemiological data supported by genomic information of M. ulcerans organisms to determine that the majority of recurrent lesions appear to result from re-infection. This suggests that for a proportion of treated patientsâ€™ acquired protective immunity against the development of recurrent M. ulcerans disease does not develop from their initial infection.
