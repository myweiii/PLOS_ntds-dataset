Leishmania donovani is an intracellular parasite which is internalized by host macrophages by subverting several intracellular signaling events. During infection suppression of p38 MAPK and activation of ERK1/2 MAPK have been acclaimed for survival and proliferation of these protozoan parasites. In this study, we show novel signaling pathways that interact with these MAPK that further contributes to determine the final fate of the disease. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that binds to a family of G-protein coupled receptors known as S1P receptors. TDM infected with Leishmania donovani showed a decrease in the expression of S1PR1-3. Moreover, the enzyme that catalyzes S1P production, Sphingosine Kinase 1, showed decreased activation in a time-dependent fashion in infected cells. Furthermore, exogenously supplementation of S1P clears intracellular parasite burden by a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IL-10 at mRNA and protein level. On the other hand, S1P induces anti-leishmanial response by activating p38 phosphorylation and IL-12 at mRNA as well as at protein level. To further gain insight on the receptors subtypes involved in the anti-leishmanial response, we specifically blocked S1PR2 and S1PR3. In this study, we found a tremendous increase in the parasite load as a result of increased IL-10 secretion and ERK1/2 phosphorylation on combination of these inhibitor doses. Taking together, our study thus suggested the possible involvement of S1PR2-3 during Leishmania donovani infection in human macrophages. These findings thus elaborate our knowledge in understanding the interaction of signaling intermediates during Leishmania infection which may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.
