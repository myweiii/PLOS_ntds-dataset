Despite the progress made in the last decade, malaria remains a serious public health issue in sub-Saharan region, where it overlaps with helminths infections. The interactions between both are manifold and complex, requiring further investigation. We report here that Trichuris trichiura or hookworm associated with schistosomiasis increase the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection; whilst schistosomiasis is independently associated with a malaria increase in young children, but not in the older children. Our finding is an additional evidence that optimizing helminth control mainly in children contributes to overcoming malaria in areas endemic for both parasitic infections where children are those who bear the highest burden of these infections.
