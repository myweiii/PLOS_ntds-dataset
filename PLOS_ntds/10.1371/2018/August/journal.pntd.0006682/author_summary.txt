In India, Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease and the burden of rabies is usually not captured by the health system due to varied reasons. Hence, an exploratory study was attempted to find out the rabid status of the biting animal through contact tracing during the first quarter of 2017 in villages coming under three Public Health Centers. A total of 69 dog/cat bite cases were identified. Majority of bites were by stray dogs, Category-III, exposure to non cases and few received PEP. Percentage of bite victims who actually required PEP was calculated. These findings support the fact that contact tracing can be used as an additional tool by the health care provider for measurement of rabid animal bites, where resources are scarce, reporting systems are weak and priorities for disease vary. A rabies check list/score card to be made available at Public Health Centers, which shall ensure better utilization of limited but lifesaving Rabies Immunobiologicals.
