The number of global cases of dengue has increased an estimated 30-fold from 1962 to 2012, and two-fifths of the worldâ€™s population are thought to be at risk for dengue. It has been recently estimated that the global incidence of dengue is between 50 and 100 million cases per year. These estimates of burden and impact are, however, are not considered very reliable. It has been previously established and reported that there is notable under-reporting of clinical cases of dengue, even those who sought medical treatment. This includes under-reporting of those hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed dengue. This lack of reliable estimates hampers efforts of public health officials in determining the of burden of disease and the costs-and-benefits of potential interventions. We estimated that multiplication factors ranging from 5 to 9 must be used to correct for under-reporting of laboratory-positive dengue inpatient cases reported to public health officials in Puerto Rico. Multiplication factors ranging from 21 to 115 must be used to correct for the underreporting of laboratory-positive dengue outpatients. Our results illustrate the need for, and thus potential benefits of, using our methodology to estimate the degree of under-reporting in passive dengue systems during epidemic and non-epidemic years.
