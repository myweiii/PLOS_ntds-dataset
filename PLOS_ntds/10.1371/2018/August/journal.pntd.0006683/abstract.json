    "Background": "Clonorchiasis, caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, remains a serious public health issue in Asia, especially in China, and its relationship with cholangiocarcinoma has highlighted the importance of C. sinensis infection. Proteins containing tandem repeats (TRs) are found in a variety of parasites and, as targets of B-cell responses, are valuable for the serodiagnosis of parasite infections. Here, we identified a novel C. sinensis-specific antigen, Cs1, containing TRs, and investigated its diagnostic value, other immunological properties, and tissue distribution.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A partial Cs1 cDNA sequence was cloned by screening an adult C. sinensis cDNA expression library. The full-length Cs1 cDNA was obtained by 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced Cs1 protein consists of a signal peptide and five TRs of 21 amino acids. The recombinant Cs1 (rCs1) was constructed and purified. rCs1 showed higher sensitivity (94.3%) and specificity (94.4%) than the C. sinensis excretory\u2013secretory products (ESPs) according to ELISA of 114 serum samples. Native Cs1 was identified in C. sinensis ESPs and crude antigens of adult C. sinensis by western blotting using an anti-rCs1 monoclonal antibody. ELISA of recombinant peptides of different Cs1 regions demonstrated that the TR region was immunodominant in Cs1. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed that Cs1 is located in a granule-like structure surrounding the acetabulum of C. sinensis adults that has not previously been described.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "We identified a novel C. sinensis-specific TR protein, Cs1, which is an antigen of high serological significance, compared with C. sinensis ESPs. The deduced features of Cs1 show a unique structure containing TRs and a signal peptide and the TR region is immunodominant in Cs1. This provides a basis for targeted screens of other antigens. The novel structure in which Cs1 is located also deserves further investigation."
