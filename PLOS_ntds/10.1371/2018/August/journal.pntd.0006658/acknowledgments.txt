We would like to thank the Department of Veterinary Services within the Kenyan Ministry of Livestock Development for their support, and all their officers who helped researchers in accessing chicken farmers and retailers. We are also grateful to Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory staff, the field International Livestock Institute staff for their precious support, and to all people interviewed in this project.
