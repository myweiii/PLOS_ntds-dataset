A subset of HIV-patients starting antiretroviral therapy are at risk of developing immune-driven worsening symptoms of a previously treated opportunistic infection. This paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been abundantly described in common co-infections such as M. tuberculosis (TB-IRIS), whereas IRIS associated with Schistosoma mansoni (Schisto-IRIS) is less well studied. Nonetheless, HIV and S. mansoni are highly co-endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and the considerable clinical burden of Schisto-IRIS in the field should not be underestimated. Moreover, no clinical definition exists to help diagnose this complication. Although little is known about the immune dysregulation in Schisto-IRIS, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been linked to schistosomiasis and TB-IRIS on account of their role in tissue-destructive inflammation. The current study is nested within a three-month case-control study in schistosomiasis/HIV co-infected fishermen starting ART in Kenya. We propose a clinical working definition for Schisto-IRIS, based on critical evaluation of symptoms developing during ART. Our study now links aberrant dynamics of MMPs and TIMPs to Schisto-IRIS as well. Given the role of MMPs and TIMPs in tissue remodeling and inflammation, our findings suggest that Schisto-IRIS is marked by unbalanced MMP/TIMP dynamics that favor inflammation.
