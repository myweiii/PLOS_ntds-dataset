The most disturbing consequence of Chagas disease, an illness due to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi parasites, is a chronic heart inflammation that affects 30â€“35% of the infected individuals. This process leads to important death rates as a consequence of cardiac tissue destruction that interferes with heart physiology. Chronic persistence of the parasite in the cardiac tissue, together with the unwanted side effects of recruited leukocytes that aim parasite elimination, are considered the main elements responsible for local tissue damage. Parasite control at the heart mostly depends on the anti-T. cruzi activity of antibodies and recruited leukocytes, but a contribution of cardiomyocytes, the cardiac muscle cells, is suggested by in vitro experiments. This study shows that the MyD88 pathway is activated in vivo in cardiomyocytes from T. cruzi infected mice, and this results in transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a chemotactic factor known to attract leukocytes to the infected tissue. Understanding the interplay of the elements involved in heart pathology is of crucial importance for the development of therapeutic strategies.
