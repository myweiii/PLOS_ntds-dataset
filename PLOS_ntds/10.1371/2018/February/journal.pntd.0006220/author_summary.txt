Exposure of Trypanosome cruzi to oxidative stress leads to damage of several macromolecules such as DNA. DNA polymerases play a very important role in DNA repair after oxidative damage. One of them is Tc DNA polymerase β. In this work, two form of this DNA polymerase were identified and overexpressed in T. cruzi cells after hydrogen peroxide treatment been one of them a phosphorylated and highly active form. The increment of Tc DNA polymerase β was not correlated with changes in mRNA levels, indicating absence of transcriptional control. We propose a mechanism where hydrogen peroxide treatment activates a pathway leading to expression and phosphorylation of Tc DNA polymerase β in response to oxidative damage.
