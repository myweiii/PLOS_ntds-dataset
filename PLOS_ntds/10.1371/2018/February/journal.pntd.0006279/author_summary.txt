P. falciparum and P. vivax infections during pregnancy have been extensively studied. Meanwhile, the dynamics of other non-falciparum malaria infections during pregnancy is not well understood. We investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. in samples collected from Beninese women early in pregnancy and at delivery using a quantitative PCR approach. Factors associated with Plasmodium spp. infection during pregnancy were assessed. P. falciparum was the most prevalent Plasmodium species detected. P. malariae and P. ovale infections were also detected early in pregnancy, and in the maternal peripheral and placental blood at delivery. Noteworthily, the high prevalence of P. malariae in the placenta of pregnant women with paired peripheral and placental samples, suggests a placental affinity of P. malariae during pregnancy. However, association of non-falciparum infections with pregnancy outcomes was not observed. This study provided insights into the molecular epidemiology of Plasmodium spp. infection during pregnancy, and highlighted the underestimated prevalence of non-falciparum infections in pregnancy-related malaria.
