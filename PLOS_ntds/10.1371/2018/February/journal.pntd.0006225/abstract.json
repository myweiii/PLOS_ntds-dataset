    "Background": "The treatment of Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis is based on a weak strength of evidence from very few clinical trials and some case series reports. Current treatment guidelines recommend pentamidine isethionate or meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) as the first-line choices. Both are parenteral drugs with a low therapeutic indexes leading to a high risk of undesired effects. Imidazole derivatives interfere with the production of leishmanial ergosterol, an essential component of their membrane structure. One drug that has been studied in different clinical presentations of Leishmania is fluconazole, a hydrophilic bis-triazole, which is easily absorbed through the oral route with a low toxicity profile and is considered safe for children. This drug is readily available in poor countries with a reasonable cost making it a potential option for treating leishmaniasis.",
    "Methods and findings": "An adaptive nonrandomized clinical trial with sequential groups with dose escalation of oral fluconazole was designed to treat adult men with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) in Manaus, Brazil. Eligible participants were patients with LCL with confirmed Leishmania guyanensis infection.",
    "Results": "Twenty adult male patients were treated with 450 mg of fluconazole daily for 30 days. One patient (5%) was cured within 30 days of treatment. Of the 19 failures (95%), 13 developed a worsening of ulcers and six evolved lymphatic spreading of the disease. Planned dose escalation was suspended after the disappointing failure rate during the first stage of the trial.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Oral fluconazole, at the dose of 450mg per day, was not efficacious against LCL caused by Leishmania guyanensis in adult men.",
    "Trial registration": "Brazilian Clinical Trial Registration (ReBec)—RBR-8w292w; UTN number—1158-2421"
