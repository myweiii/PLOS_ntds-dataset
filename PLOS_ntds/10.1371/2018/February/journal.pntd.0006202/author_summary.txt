Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas of East Asia and America, but globalization and climate changes are introducing vector and virus to the na√Øve regions of Europe and North America. In this work we conducted a statistically robust, coupled association-admixture test in two dengue cohorts from Thailand (classical dengue fever, DF, and dengue shock syndrome, DSS) and a published Vietnamese (DSS only) cohort. We identified new candidate genes associated with DF risk and confirmed known gene family association with DSS risk. In DF, phosphatase control is crucial, including through binding to viral proteins, as we showed for PPP2R5E protein co-localization with DENV1 and DENV2-NS5 proteins within liver cells and differential cellular localizations along time. In DSS, cytokine dynamics, inflammation and activation of vascular endothelium cells are dominant features. The particular genetic risk conferred by these genes indicates that Southeast and Northeast Asians are highly susceptible to both phenotypes, while Africans are best protected against DSS, and Europeans best protected against DF but the most susceptible against DSS.
