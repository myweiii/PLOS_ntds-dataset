    "Background": "Tapeworm (cestode) infections occur worldwide even in developed countries and globalization has further complicated the epidemiology of such infections. Nonetheless, recent epidemiological data on cestode infections are limited. Our objectives were to elucidate the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of diphyllobothriosis and taeniosis in Tokyo, Japan.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We retrospectively reviewed 24 cases of human intestinal cestode infection from January 2006 to December 2015 at a tertiary referral hospital in Tokyo, Japan. The patients included were diagnosed with cestode infection based on morphological and/or molecular identification of expelled proglottids and/or eggs and treated in our hospital. Fifteen and 9 patients were diagnosed with diphyllobothriosis and taeniosis, respectively. The median patient age was 31 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 26–42 years), and 13 (54%) were male. Most of the patients (91.7%) were Japanese. All patients were successfully treated with praziquantel without recurrence. Diphyllobothriosis was caused by Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense in all patients. Taeniosis was due to infection of Taenia saginata in 8 [88.9%] patients and T. asiatica in 1 [11.1%] patient. All patients with taeniosis were infected outside Japan, as opposed to those with diphyllobothriosis, which were domestic. The source locations of taeniosis were mostly in developing regions. The median duration of the stay of the patients with taeniosis at the respective source location was 1 month (IQR: 1–8).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The cestode infection, especially with D. nihonkaiense, has frequently occurred, even in Japanese cities, thereby implicating the probable increase in the prevalence of diphyllobothriosis among travelers, as the number of travelers is expected to increase owing to the Tokyo Olympics/Paralympics in 2020. In addition, medical practitioners should be aware of the importance of providing advice to travelers to endemic countries of taeniosis, including the potential risks of infection and preventive methods for these infections."
