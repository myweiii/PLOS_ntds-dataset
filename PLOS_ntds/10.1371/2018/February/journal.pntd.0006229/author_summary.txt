Strongyloides stercoralis is a worm that can potentially kill affected immunosuppressed individuals. The parasite is not easily detected with stool microscopy, hence novel tests have been implemented, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), that can detect the DNA of the parasite. This work aims at evaluating the performance of PCR for the diagnosis of S. stercoralis through a revision of diagnostic studies available in literature. According to the results of this work, PCR for S. stercoralis still misses a relevant proportion of infected people, while a positive result confirms the presence of the infection.
