Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of suffering and death in the world, particularly in tropical regions with limited health care resources. Many of the most important diarrhea-causing microbes produce toxins that activate fluid secretion in the gut. A prototype pathogen in this category is the cause of cholera, Vibrio cholerae, which is characterized by profuse diarrhea and severe electrolyte disturbances due to the release of cholera toxin. Although treatment with fluids by mouth or injection can save patients from death, they still experience the devastating symptoms of the disease. In the present study, we have developed a new intervention strategy with engineered nanoparticles, particulates than are smaller than one millionth of a meter, which can neutralize cholera toxin in the gut before it can cause the characteristic disease manifestations. This strategy represents a novel interventional approach whose mechanism of action is different from currently existing therapies, thus significantly broadening the medical armamentarium against cholera and perhaps other gut infections that cause diseases dominated by toxin production.
