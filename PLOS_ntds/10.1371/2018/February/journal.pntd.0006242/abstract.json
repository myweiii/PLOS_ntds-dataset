    "Methods": "All State TB control programmes in Nigeria were requested to submit 25–50 smear-positive Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained slides for screening during 2013–2014. DNA was extracted from 929 slides for spoligotyping and drug-resistance analysis using microbead-based flow-cytometry suspension arrays.",
    "Results": "Spoligotyping results were obtained for 549 (59.1%) of 929 samples. Lineage 4 Cameroon sublineage (L4.6.2) represented half of the patterns, Mycobacterium africanum (L5 and L6) represented one fifth of the patterns, and all other lineages, including other L4 sublineages, represented one third of the patterns. Sublineage L4.6.2 was mostly identified in the north of the country whereas L5 was mostly observed in the south and L6 was scattered. The spatial distribution of genotypes had genetic geographic gradients. We did not obtain results enabling the detection of drug-resistance mutations.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "We present the first national snapshot of the M. tuberculosis spoligotypes circulating in Nigeria based on ZN slides. Spoligotyping data can be obtained in a rapid and high-throughput manner with DNA extracted from ZN-stained slides, which may potentially improve our understanding of the genetic epidemiology of TB."
