Using a classical genotyping method designated as “spoligotyping”, which targets polymorphic repetitive DNA loci, we present a general snapshot of the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causing tuberculosis in Nigeria. Our results were obtained on a collection of 549 DNAs, extracted from Ziehl-Neelsen stained sputum smears gathered and representative from 36 Nigerian states and during 2013–2014. We show the ubiquitous presence on the Nigerian territory of a sublineage of Lineage 4, designated as L4.6.2 or “Cameroon” Lineage, which represents almost 50% of all patterns, more prevalent where Mycobacterium africanum west African 1 (Lineage 5) is absent. We also show that Lineage 5 is geographically linked to the south-east of the country, where it is the most prevalent, and represents approximately 20% of all the samples. The last third is linked to all other L4 sublineages and to L6 (M. africanum west African 2). Our results confirm the strong phylogeographical structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in Nigeria and are suggestive of a long-term coevolution history between Homo sapiens sapiens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.
