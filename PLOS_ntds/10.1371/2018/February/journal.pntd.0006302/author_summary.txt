Since the identification of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America in 1999, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) cases declined rapidly. Both viruses utilize similar avian hosts and vectors for maintenance of transmission cycles; however, they present different phenotypes in both vector and avian host. In birds, WNV develops high viremias and elicits mortality whereas SLEV has not been associated with avian virulence. West Nile viral non-structural genetic elements have been demonstrated herein to dictate higher viremias in competent avian hosts and virulence in AMCRs. In contrast, non-structural SLEV elements previously have been shown to dictate increased oral infectivity in Culex mosquitoes, likely as a compensation for the lower viremias generated by SLEV. These findings coupled with the co-circulation of WNV and SLEV in Arizona in 2015 demonstrate that pre-existing flaviviral immunity does not necessarily preclude concurrent circulation of these viruses.
