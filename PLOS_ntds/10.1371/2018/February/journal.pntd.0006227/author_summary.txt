Among the pathogens transmitted by Aedes aegypti, dengue virus is the most important due to the number of people affected or at risk and the high rate of mortality worldwide. The confirmation that Ae. aegypti is also the vector of Zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever poses serious consequences for public health, pointing to the need of reevaluating current vector control strategies. Although there is growing recognition of the importance of social participation and community engagement to prevent high levels of infestation, insecticides are considered important vector control tools. Nevertheless, the massive and indiscriminate adoption of insecticides to control larvae and adults contributes to resistance spread. In particular, the domestic use of adulticides, especially in epidemic seasons, is assumed to induce high levels of resistance in Ae. aegypti populations. However, the consequences of insecticide interruption upon the resistance of field populations has been less investigated. We evaluated, in four Brazilian regions over one year, the dynamics of dengue vector population resistance to the principal insecticides used in the country. The main resistance mechanisms were also investigated. Data are discussed taking into account the potential relationship among dengue outbreaks, public and private chemical control and insecticide resistance.
