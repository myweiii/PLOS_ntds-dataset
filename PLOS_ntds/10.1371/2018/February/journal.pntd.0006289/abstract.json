    "Background": "In 2009, three years after stopping mass treatment with azithromycin, a trachoma impact survey in four health districts in the Kayes region of Mali found a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation\u2014follicular (TF) among children aged 1 to 9 years of >5% and a trachomatous trichiasis (TT) prevalence within the general population (\u22651-year-old) of <1%. As a result, the government\u2019s national trachoma program expanded trichiasis surgery and related activities required to achieve trachoma elimination.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In 2015, to assess progress towards elimination, a follow-up impact survey was conducted in the Kayes, K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba, Nioro and Y\u00e9liman\u00e9 health districts. The survey used district level two-stage cluster random sampling methodology with 20 clusters of 30 households in each evaluation unit. Subjects were eligible for examination if they were \u22651 year. TF and TT cases were identified and confirmed by experienced ophthalmologists. In total 14,159 people were enumerated and 11,620 (82%) were examined. TF prevalence (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 0.5% (0.3\u20131%) in Kayes, 0.8% (0.4\u20131.7%) in K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba, 0.2% (0\u20130.9%) in Nioro and 0.3% (0.1\u20131%) in Y\u00e9liman\u00e9. TT prevalence (95% CI) was 0.04% (0\u20130.25%) in Kayes, 0.29% (0.11\u20130.6%) in K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba, 0.04% (0\u20130.25%) in Nioro and 0.07% (0\u20130.27%) in Y\u00e9liman\u00e9.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Eight years after stopping MDA and intensifying trichiasis surgery outreach campaigns, all four districts reached the TF elimination threshold of <5% and three of four districts reached the TT elimination threshold of <0.1%."
