Trachoma is a leading infectious cause of preventable blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that endemic states implement the SAFE strategy (surgery for trichiasis, antibiotic treatment, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) to achieve trachoma elimination by the year 2020. Mali has implemented this strategy from 2002. In the Kayes region in southwest Mali, the districts of Kayes, Kéniéba, Nioro and Yélimané stopped antibiotic treatment in 2006 after three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). In 2009 an assessment was conducted and found that the prevalence of active trachoma (TF) among children aged 1–9 years and trichiasis (TT) prevalence in adults were above the elimination thresholds in these districts. An intensified effort to expand trichiasis surgery and related interventions, including community-based behavior change communication on facial cleanliness and environmental improvement activities using women’s groups, community health workers, and radio. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2015 in the four districts to assess whether one more round of mass treatment was needed. The results showed that TF prevalence in all four health districts decreased to below the 5% elimination threshold and three of four districts achieved the TT elimination threshold of <0.1%.
