With currently no approved treatment options, dengue is a significant cause of hospitalizations and morbidity in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In recent years there is increased focus on the potential of antibody-based immunotherapy as treatment for dengue. In addition to being able to broadly neutralize all four serotypes of dengue, antibody-based therapeutics face additional challenges of interference with preexisting antibodies from the natural immune response, as well as possible viral resistance. In this study we demonstrate that VIS513, a monoclonal antibody therapeutic candidate that targets the dengue virus envelope protein, retains its anti-viral potency in the presence of preexisting antibodies, and is able to rescue mice from lethal infections. In addition, our studies indicate that VIS513 is generally refractory to emergence of viral resistance via mutations. Our data supports continued development of VIS513 as a treatment option for dengue.
