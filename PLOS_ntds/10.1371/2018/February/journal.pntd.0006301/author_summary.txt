Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. Current treatments suffer from low efficacy, toxicity issues and complex medication regimens. Moreover, an alarming number of these parasites are demonstrating resistance to current drugs. For these reasons, there is a renewed effort to develop new classes of modern therapeutics based upon the unique T. brucei cellular processes. One potential new drug target is 6-oxopurine phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase), an enzyme central to the purine salvage pathway and whose activity is critical for the production of the nucleotides (GMP and IMP) required for DNA/RNA synthesis within this protozoan parasite. We demonstrated that T. brucei encodes two isoforms of hypoxanthine-guanine PRTases (HGPRT) and one hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine PRTase (HGXPRT). The concurrent activity of these enzymes is required for the normal cell growth in vitro. Moreover, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates represent a promising class of potent and selective compounds as they inhibit the enzymes with Ki values in nanomolar range and exert cytotoxic effects on T. brucei cells grown in vitro with EC50 values in the single digit micromolar range. Our results provide a new foundation for further investigations of these compounds in vivo and suggest that 6-oxopurine salvage pathway represents a possible target for future drug discovery efforts directed at eliminating HAT.
