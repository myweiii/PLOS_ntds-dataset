Leprosy is a disease that has long since been eradicated in the developed world, but it still affects poor people in developing countries, such as India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Because the causative agent of the disease may involve the skin and peripheral nerves, the disease can cause physical disabilities and deformities. Although leprosy affects all ages, children under 15 years of age are an important epidemiological marker because infection in that age group indicates active transmission within the community. In our work, we examined 34,547 children from public schools in Manaus, a city in the north of Brazil. In this population, we found 40 new cases of leprosy that were further confirmed by clinical and laboratorial tests. We also examined 196 people who had familiar or close non-familiar contact with the affected children. Among them, we identified the possible source of infection of 21 affected children and found seven new cases of leprosy. Overall, our findings revealed a detection rate of leprosy cases that was 17 times higher than the registered number. This indicates the necessity of identifying active cases of leprosy in order to improve case detection and effectively control the disease.
