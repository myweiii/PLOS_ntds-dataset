This work describes an in-depth salivary and fat body transcriptome from the triatomine P. lignarius, the main vector of Chagas disease in Peru. Following “de novo” assembly of over 160 million reads, 11 thousand coding sequences were obtained, 9,013 of which were submitted to GenBank. Those over expressed in the salivary glands or fat bodies were identified, leading to a detailed insight of the specificities of each organ. This work will serve future scientists not only for its increased knowledge on triatomine proteins, but also for its public protein sequences that will serve scientists as a target database in mass spectrometry experiments aiming at the identification of P. lignarius salivary pharmacological peptides or immunological targets of vector exposure.
