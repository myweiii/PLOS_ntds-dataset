Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms inhabiting the human bloodstream, surrounded by and feeding on humoral and cellular components of the immune system. They are normally long-lived but the rhesus macaque is able to mount a self-cure response directed against the esophageal secretions of the adult Schistosoma japonicum so that they stop feeding and slowly starve to death. The worm esophagus is a short tube connecting mouth to gut surrounded by anterior and posterior glands and our aim in this study was to identify the genes encoding the gland secretions. For this purpose we isolated the messenger RNA from both male and female worm heads and tails and obtained many millions of sequences. These were assembled into gene coding sequences using bioinformatics and then genes differentially expressed in the head region were identified by a subtraction process. We then focused on those genes encoding proteins with a leader sequence indicating their secretory status. The result is an inventory of approximately 40 genes; some encode protein binding motifs while others encode a short helix with a hydrophobic face, which may interact with host cell membranes. Genes encoding enzymes, protease inhibitors and a venom-like protein were also found. These proteins are being evaluated for their interactions with the antibodies generated by macaques during the self-cure process.
