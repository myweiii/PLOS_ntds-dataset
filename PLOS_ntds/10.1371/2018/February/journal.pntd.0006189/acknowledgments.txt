We would like to thank community members for their willingness to participate during interviews, health workers and community leaders at different administrative levels for facilitating administrative issues, and recorders for their hard work and commitment during data collection. We are also thankful for the collaboration with the Lions-Carter Center Sight-First Initiative.
