    "Background": "In order to better assist medical professionals, this study aimed to develop and compare the performance of three models—a multivariate logistic regression (LR) model, an artificial neural network (ANN) model, and a decision tree (DT) model—to predict the prognosis of patients with advanced schistosomiasis residing in the Hubei province.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Schistosomiasis surveillance data were collected from a previous study based on a Hubei population sample including 4136 advanced schistosomiasis cases. The predictive models use LR, ANN, and DT methods. From each of the three groups, 70% of the cases (2896 cases) were used as training data for the predictive models. The remaining 30% of the cases (1240 cases) were used as validation groups for performance comparisons between the three models. Prediction performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Univariate analysis indicated that 16 risk factors were significantly associated with a patient’s outcome of prognosis. In the training group, the mean AUC was 0.8276 for LR, 0.9267 for ANN, and 0.8229 for DT. In the validation group, the mean AUC was 0.8349 for LR, 0.8318 for ANN, and 0.8148 for DT. The three models yielded similar results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Predictive models for advanced schistosomiasis prognosis, respectively using LR, ANN and DT models were proved to be effective approaches based on our dataset. The ANN model outperformed the LR and DT models in terms of AUC."
