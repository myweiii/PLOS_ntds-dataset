Until now, in trachoma elimination programmes, the WHO recommendation for district-wide annual rounds of antibiotic mass drug administration was only applicable to districts with a trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF1-9) prevalence of 10% or more. Districts with a TF1-9 prevalence of <5% were considered not to require intervention with antibiotics for trachoma. For districts with a prevalence of 5.0–9.9%, programmes were encouraged to determine the TF1-9 prevalence at sub-district or “community” level. With the recent rapid scale-up in trachoma mapping, there are now a large number of districts known to have TF1-9 prevalence of 5.0–9.9%, so this recommendation is likely to pose an implementation challenge to health ministries and their partners. In this study, we have demonstrated that in districts with TF1-9 5.0–9.9%, a single round of mass drug administration with high coverage to the whole district can be followed by an impact survey TF1-9 prevalences of <5%. This approach is likely to reduce the commodity need (one round of MDA to 100% of the population compared to 3 or more rounds to an average 50% of the population), reduce the number of surveys required, and ultimately accelerate the speed of progress to elimination. We recommend that this finding be further explored elsewhere to determine its generalizability, in order to justify consideration of global policy change.
