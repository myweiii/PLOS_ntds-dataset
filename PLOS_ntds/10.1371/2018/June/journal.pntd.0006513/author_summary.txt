Leishmaniases are a group of diseases with various clinical manifestations caused by parasites (Leishmania spp.). More than 20 Leishmania species that affect human and mammals are transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand flies. In Algeria, two main forms of the disease exist: visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Although CL is the most common form of the disease, VL is the most serious and can be fatal if untreated. The purpose of the study was to investigate sand fly species fauna, their infection rate and feeding preference determination in a hypoendemic focus of human leishmaniasis located in the province of Tipaza, northern Algeria using molecular techniques. Seven phlebotomine sand flies species were recorded in this study. In addition, natural infection by L. infantum was confirmed in two sand flies species (P. (L). perniciosus and P. (L). perfiliewi). Human blood was the second (17%) feeding source after ruminants (74.11%%).
