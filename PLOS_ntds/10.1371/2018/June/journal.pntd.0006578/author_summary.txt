To improve the health of young children with intestinal worm infections, the World Health Organization recommends that they periodically receive deworming medication. The medicines are safe and effective but young children occasionally choke on the chewable tablets. Rarely, this results in death. Consequently, the World Health Organization recommends that deworming tablets be crushed and given with water. To learn more about the risk of choking, we observed 1677 children 1â€“4 years of age being dewormed in 65 sites in India and Haiti. Of these, 18 children (1.1%) choked, none fatally. The most important factor associated with choking was giving a tablet to a child who was fussy, fearful or combative. Risk of choking could have been reduced by 79.5% if deworming was not forced on young children who were fussy, fearful, or combative or who resisted taking deworming medicine. Choking-related deaths in young children are preventable. Simple measures can reduce risk of choking and they should be more widely practiced by deworming programs for young children.
