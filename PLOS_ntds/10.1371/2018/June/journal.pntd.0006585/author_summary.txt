Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that endemic countries implement the SAFE strategy (surgery for trichiasis, antibiotic treatment, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) to achieve trachoma elimination by the year 2020. Trachoma was suspected to be endemic in Guinea in 31 health districts except those in and around the capital Conakry, based on historical records and previous studies. To facilitate planning for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, Guinea conducted 27 separate trachoma surveys between 2011 and 2016 to determine the prevalence of trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular (TF) and trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in these 31 health districts. The results showed 18 health districts requiring intervention with at least one round of mass drug administration and an estimated 32,737 persons requiring TT surgery in the country. These data provided clear evidence for Guinea to plan for national trachoma elimination.
