Cryptosporidium is a parasite that causes diarrhoea and is transmitted through faecal contamination of water and food. Though it occurs in developed nations, it is much more prevalent in developing countries and is associated with high mortality in children under 2 years old. In this review, we looked at published studies on factors that increase the risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis in Low and Middle Income Countries. These factors could be targeted to limit the transmission of the disease. Based on the selected studies, the most important risk factors identified were contacts with animals and presence of infected people in the household. Open defecation was also contributing to the risk of infection by this parasite transmitted through the faecal oral route. Breastfeeding was protective from the infection. Poor drinking water was not responsible for causing the disease.
