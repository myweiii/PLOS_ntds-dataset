This study reports on the importance of recording data related to the clinical presentation on admission in sleeping sickness. We collected data on 781 second-stage patients admitted in the Trypanosomiasis Unit of the Department of Neurology of the University of Kinshasa from 1989 to 2012. The following information were registered: age, sex, symptomatology duration, trypanosome parasites location in body fluids, clinical presentation on admission, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, CSF protein concentration, therapeutic regimen, and post-treatment outcome in terms of death or survival. Analyses demonstrated that the most influential factor on the occurrence of death was a dysfunctional clinical status on admission (reflecting advanced disease). These results support the idea that the algorithm used to categorize patients in the present work can be proposed for validation in prospective studies with the purpose of designing a standardized clinical procedure assessing disease severity and bearing predictive value of outcome.
