Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular obligatory protozoan, which causes toxoplasmosis. T. gondii infection in immunocompetent individuals is mostly asymptomatic, but it may be reactivated as a result of immune disorders inducing serious complications. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as a complex autoimmune disease, is a major cause of significant and progressive disability, articular complications, and premature death. Studies confirmed an interaction between infections and environmental factors as the potential risk or protective factors determining the development of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the association between toxoplasmosis and RA.
