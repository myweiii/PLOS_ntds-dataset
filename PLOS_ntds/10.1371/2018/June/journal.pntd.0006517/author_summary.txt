Schistosomiasis is a water-related neglected tropical disease that disproportionately affects school-aged children in poor communities of low- and middle-income countries. Schistosomiasis transmission risk is affected by environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors, including water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions. We used fine spatial resolution (10â€“30 m) remotely sensed data, in combination with measures of local water access and groundwater quality, to predict schistosomiasis risk in 73 rural Ghanaian communities. We found that applying environmental models to specific locations where people contact surface water bodies (i.e., potential transmission locations), rather than to locations where prevalence is measured, improved model performance. A remotely sensed water index and topographic variables (elevation and slope) were important environmental risk factors, while overall, groundwater iron concentration predominated. In the study area, unsatisfactory water quality in boreholes perpetuates reliance of surface water bodies, indirectly increasing schistosomiasis risk and resulting in rapid reinfection (up to 40% prevalence six months following deworming). Considering WASH-related risk factors in schistosomiasis prediction can help shift the focus of control strategies from treating symptoms to reducing exposure.
