Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease that is caused by a novel bunyavirus. The current study disclosed the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were associated with risk to disease severity of SFTS. These findings suggest that polymorphisms in TNF-α gene may play a role in mediating the risk to disease severity of SFTS in Chinese Han population. The study will be of interest to either the clinicians devoted to the prevention and therapy of SFTS or the geneticists devoted to studying the genetic susceptibility mechanisms of common diseases.
