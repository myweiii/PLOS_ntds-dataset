Malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is the most common form of the disease in Malaysia. The parasite is transmitted from monkeys to humans via the bite of an infected mosquito, with the resulting P. knowlesi infection potentially leading to severe symptoms and in some cases, death. Although adult males working close to areas with infected monkeys are at the greatest risk of infection, the true extent of the geographical boundaries of P. knowlesi transmission is as yet unknown. The ability to measure antibodies to infection is a powerful technique that would help to address this deficit. However, currently available recombinant proteins lack the required specificity for this role. Here, we have developed a panel of recombinant proteins for eventual use as serological tools, strongly supported by robust statistical methods. We envisage that these tools will complement existing approaches to identifying the geographical limits of P. knowlesi transmission.
