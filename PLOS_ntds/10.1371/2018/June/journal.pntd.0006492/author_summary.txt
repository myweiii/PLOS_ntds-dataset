Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, essentially was eliminated in the western world many decades ago, but has continued to cause many deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Asia. Cholera diagnosis in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda, is by stool culture, serology and biochemical methods. These testing methods are unable to establish the relatedness, virulence and spread of Vibrio cholerae in region. To determine the spread, relatedness and virulence of V. cholerae responsible for the various cholera outbreaks in Uganda, we used DNA-based testing methods. We tested 63 V. cholerae isolates from samples collected in Uganda from 2014â€“2016. Our results showed three distinct lineages of genetically related cholera-causing bacteria. These organisms showed internal spread in Uganda and cross-border spread to neighboring countries in East Africa. These findings provide a valuable baseline and help define the context for directing control measures and technologies for cholera prevention in East Africa.
