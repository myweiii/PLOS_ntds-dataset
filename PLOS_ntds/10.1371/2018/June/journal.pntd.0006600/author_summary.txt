Brucellosis and leptospirosis are among neglected diseases in many low-income countries affecting both animals and human populations. Despite being common, the information on their distribution are scarce. In a view of that, this study investigated the proportion of participants with positive antibody test specifically for the two diseases among slaughter house workers and meat sellers in Mwanza city. The study involved 250 participants aged between 25 and 38 years. Overall, 48.4% of participants were Brucella spp. seropositive. Proportion of participants who were positive for B. abortus specific antibodies was higher than that of B. melitensis while 21.2% of them found to have antibodies for both species studied. Furthermore, about 10% of the participants had Leptospira antibodies. Being abattoir worker, long work duration and having primary education were associated with the presence of Brucella antibodies while only being married was associated with the presence of Leptospira antibodies. The findings from this study emphasize the need for multisectoral approach in devising control strategies for these pathogens.
