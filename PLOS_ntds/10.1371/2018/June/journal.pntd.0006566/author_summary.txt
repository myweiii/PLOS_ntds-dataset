Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, and the causative agent of the human disease scrub typhus. This vector-borne bacterial infection can be life-threatening if not treated rapidly with appropriate antibiotics. Orientia is endemic across large parts of Asia and is estimated to infect at least one million people per year. O. tsutsugamushi has a highly unusual genome. At 2.1 Mbp in length, it is almost double the size of most other obligate intracellular bacterial genomes, which have undergone extensive genome reduction in their adaptation to the intracellular lifestyle. The comparatively expanded genome of Orientia is accounted for by an abundance of repeated DNA elements. Indeed, the genome of Orientia is the most highly repeated bacterial genome reported to date. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to generate complete genome assemblies of Orientia using short-read sequencing technologies. In the current report, the authors use Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing to generate six complete genomes of diverse strains of O. tsutsugamushi. By comparing these genomes, the authors show that there is very little colinearity in the ordering of genes within the genome, even between closely related strains. This lack of synteny suggests that there have been frequent events of massive chromosomal rearrangement in this species, although the underlying mechanisms for this have not been shown. The genome sequences and analysis reported here will benefit those working on various aspects of the biology of this clinically important but neglected bacterial species.
