Chagas disease (CD) is a major public health concern in Latin America and a potentially serious emerging threat in non-endemic countries. Although the association between CD and cardiac abnormalities is widely reported, study design diversity, sample size and quality challenge the information, calling for its update and synthesis, which would be very useful and relevant for physicians in non-endemic countries where health care implications of CD are real and neglected. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed population-based studies that compared prevalence of ECG abnormalities between Chagas disease (CD) and non-CD participants. Forty-nine studies were selected, including 34,023 unique participants. Our meta-analysis of observational studies indicates CD presented almost a threefold increase prevalence of ECG abnormalities than non-CD participants in the general population from Chagas endemic regions, being the most common ventricular (RBBB and LAFB), and A-V B (first-degree) node conduction abnormalities as well as arrhythmias (AF or flutter and VE).
