SFTSV was first discovered in 2009. It can be transmitted through tick bites, direct contact with SFTS patients’ blood or bloody secretion, and probable aerosol transmission. SFTS was listed as one of the nine infectious diseases on the WHO priority list in 2017 because of its trend of wider distribution and rising threat imposed on global health. It is worth mentioning that a cluster of eleven patients including eight family members and three healthcare workers developed fever and thrombocytopenia in China, from October to November 1996, but the initial investigation failed to identify its etiology. A retrospective analysis was conducted in September 2010. Based on the epidemiological, clinical, and serological findings, we speculated that SFTSV was the mysterious pathogen of the cluster. Meanwhile, high-titer SFTSV IgG antibodies were detected in four surviving patients’ sera. These SFTS patients preceded two cases in Japan in 2005 reported by Kurihara et al., which were once regarded as “the earliest SFTS cases worldwide”. These results suggest that SFTS should have existed without being diagnosed for a long time, and SFTSV IgG antibodies can persist long for 14 years, and perhaps even a lifetime after infection.
