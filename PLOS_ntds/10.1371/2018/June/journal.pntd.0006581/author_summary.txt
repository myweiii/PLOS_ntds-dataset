Poxviruses are large viruses capable of causing disease in humans. Of the known poxviruses, variola virus and monkeypox virus cause the most severe disease, smallpox and human monkeypox, respectively. Models utilizing these viruses are valuable for the study of host-virus interaction and for evaluating countermeasures. Arguably the best models utilizing variola virus or monkeypox virus involve the intravenous inoculation of nonhuman primates. Because these models have an unnatural route of infection and bypass the incubation of the disease, more genuine models are sought. Here we tested whether marmosets could be infected with monkeypox virus via a natural route and, if so, whether the model could be applied to study countermeasures. We found that the animals were susceptible to monekypox virus at a low dose via a natural route, uncannily mirrored human disease onset, and could be protected by prophylactic treatment of two novel monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, we found potential disease disparity between males and females that, if proven true, could stimulate the exploration of a mechanistic explanation to describe the disparity and deepen our understanding of poxvirus pathogenesis, immunology and/or marmoset biology.
