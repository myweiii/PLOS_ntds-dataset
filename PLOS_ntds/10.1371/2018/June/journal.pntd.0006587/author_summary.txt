Dengue fever, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease today, is caused by Dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted to human by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The key approach to mitigating dengue transmission is to control the Aedes population, and this often involve vector control strategies such as larval source reduction and preventive surveillance that are labour-intensive and require effective deployment of valuable resources. Spatial risk profiling of dengue transmission is therefore necessary to ensure the optimal utilization of limited resources, and achieving maximum impact of dengue vector control. Here, we developed a dengue risk map by stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, and the predicted risk ranks are then categorized and mapped to color-coded risk groups. The dengue risk map is a good surveillance tool to guide vector control operations. Valuable resources can be deployed in a strategic manner, mitigating the spread of dengue transmission.
