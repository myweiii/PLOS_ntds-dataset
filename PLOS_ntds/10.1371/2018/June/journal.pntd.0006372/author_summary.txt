Leptospirosis is an under-recognized but important cause of febrile illness and death in Africa. The bacteria that cause leptospirosis have their usual life cycle in animals; humans are infected as accidental hosts. There is considerable variation between countries as to which reservoir animals and human activities are important for transmission of leptospirosis to humans. In many tropical countries flooding and rodents are the dominant sources of human infection. However, in Africa it is unknown which sources of leptospirosis are most responsible for human infection and what behaviors put people at risk for infection We performed a prospective cross-sectional study, to identify risk factors for acute leptospirosis and sources of human infection. We identified contact with cattle and work in rice fields as risk factors for acute leptospirosis. Our findings indicate that cattle may be an important source for human leptospirosis, and therefore control of leptospirosis in livestock may help prevent leptospirosis in people. Further work is needed to isolate Leptospira from humans and livestock. Rice farming was an uncommon activity in our study, but strongly associated with acute leptospirosis. Efforts are warranted to prevent infection in rice farmers living in Africa.
