Plague is a highly infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium. Since the first strain of Y. pestis was isolated in Qinghai in 1954, confirmed plague cases have occurred nearly every year, and more than 240 people have died from plague over the past 60 years. In this study, we analyzed 102 Y. pestis strains collected from Qinghai Plateau between 1954 and 2011. We determined their genetic diversity and inferred their spatial-temporal distribution, based on genetic markers including SNPs, VNTRs and CRISPRs. Our results indicate that 1.IN2 is the dominant group of Y. pestis in Qinghai Plateau, and its three subpopulations revealed clear geographic clustering that might be driven by interaction with bacteriophages. We observed that the Y. pestis population has moved from the east of Qinghai Plateau to central and western regions over the past 60 years. We also found that the abundance and relative proportion of 1.IN2 subgroups varied over time, leading to fluctuations in plague epidemics. These results extend our knowledge of the genetic diversity of Y. pestis, and its population dynamics in natural plague foci over a number of years. With ongoing risk of outbreaks, we recommend enhanced surveillance in this region.
