Dengue is a febrile illness transmitted by mosquitoes, causing disease across the tropical and sub-tropical world. Antibody prevalence data and serotype distribution describe population-level risk and inform public health decision-making. We present data from a dengue seroprevalence study in children in Indonesia; circulation of the four dengue serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, -4) was assessed, by age and location. Samples collected from 30 urban Indonesian sites were tested using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which enabled us to measure prevalence and concentration of antibodies specific to dengue virus serotypes. Results were obtained from 776 subjects (mean age: 9.6 years). 765 (98.6%) neutralized â‰¥1 dengue serotype; the highest proportion was reactive against DENV-2, followed by DENV-1, and DENV-3, with some variation across the country. Reaction to multiple serotypes was observed in 50.9% of samples. The highest anti-dengue antibody titers were recorded against DENV-2, and increased with age. The fact that all four dengue serotypes have been widely circulating in urban Indonesia, and more than half of children had been exposed to >1 dengue serotype, shows intense transmission, often associated with more severe clinical episodes. These data will help inform policymakers and highlight the importance of dengue surveillance, prevention and control.
