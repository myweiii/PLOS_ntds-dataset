In many parts of the world, dengue diagnosis still relies on clinical manifestation and basic laboratory tests. However, clinical manifestation of dengue patients is usually unspecific especially during the early stage, which makes accurate dengue diagnosis a challenge for physicians. Recently, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of the NS1 antigen rapid test to assist in dengue diagnosis. Unfortunately, the rapid test is still only in limited use due to its cost and relatively low sensitivity. In this study we constructed Bayesian Network (BN) models from available data and used them to predict the probability of dengue infection. Our BN models provided good performance in making dengue diagnosis, comparable with physicianâ€™s diagnosis. Information on NS1 rapid test could improve the diagnostic performance by improving specificity of dengue diagnosis. This study suggested that BN models can be useful to assist physicians in dengue diagnosis, particularly in areas where experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.
