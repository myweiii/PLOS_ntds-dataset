Onchocerciasis is a chronic disease of humans that affects mainly the skin and eyes. It is an insect-borne disease, caused by a nematode worm, Onchocerca volvulus. It is a public health problem and an obstacle to socio-economic development in affected communities. There is currently no vaccine, and no adult worm drug to cure the infection. The only recommended drug, ivermectin can give short-term relief by killing the microfilariae of the parasite but cannot always be safely administered in mass drug administration (MDA) in areas where another filarial worm, Loa loa is co-endemic. To prevent infection and completely eradicate the disease there is an urgent need for alternative drugs that can kill the adult worms but to a lesser extent Loa loa. In the past, medicinal plants have served as good starting points for the development of drugs. In the present study, we determined the filaricidal properties of extracts, chromatographic fractions of Lantana camara and Tamarindus indica and lantadene A against Onchocerca ochengi, the bovine model of the parasite and L. loa. Interestingly, most of the active extracts were more active against O. ochengi than on L. loa mf. No death was recorded following oral administration of the active extracts to BALB/c mice. Lantadene A is a potential lead molecule for the development of a cure for onchocerciasis.
