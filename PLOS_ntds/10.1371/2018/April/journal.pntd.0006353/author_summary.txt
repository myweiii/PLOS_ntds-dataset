Occurrence of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak is associated with heavy El-Niño rainfall. In July 2015, an alert on the likelihood of El-Niño rainfall and RVF outbreak in Eastern Africa region was issued by the United States, Food and Agriculture Organization, and Kenya Meteorological Department. In response to the alert, the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services (KDVS) carried out an enhanced syndromic surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016 in the 22 counties that had previously been identified as RVF high-risk counties. The surveillance system collected data on RVF-associated syndromes and risk factors in cattle, sheep, goats and camels from more than 1100 farmers. Of the 10,958 field reports submitted, 45 were consistent with suspect RVF disease and 24 of these identified as probable RVF, triggering an immediate response. Whereas investigations of the suspect cases and laboratory testing did not confirm RVF cases, the surveillance system served as an excellent early warning system that could detect disease in animal before spillover to humans.
