We analyzed cholera epidemics from Benin to Mauritania, during 2009 to 2015, and performed a series of field visits as well as molecular epidemiology analyses of V. cholerae isolates from most recent epidemics throughout West Africa. We found that at least 54% of cases concerned populations living in the three urban areas of Accra, Freetown, and Conakry. Accra, Ghana represented the main cholera hotspot in the entire study region. Our findings indicate that the water network system in Accra may play a role in the rapid diffusion of cholera throughout the city. As observed in Accra, Conakry, and Freetown, once cholera cases arrive in overpopulated urban settings with poor sanitation, increased rainfall facilitated the contamination of unprotected water sources with human waste from cholera patients, thus promoting a rapid increase in cholera incidence. To more efficiently and effectively combat cholera in West Africa, these findings may serve as a guide to better target cholera prevention and control interventions.
