In the Central African Republic (CAR), due to 20 years of conflict, the health system has been disorganized. This could contribute to maintenance of high transmission levels of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and its satellite Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). This work studies the evolution of both infections 25 years after a fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak occurring in the mid-1980s associated with HDV superinfection. In young asymptomatic adults, the results show that both HBV and HDV were still actively circulating in CAR in 2010. Indeed, more than one third of HBV-infected individuals were chronic HBV carriers. Furthermore, HDV infection could be spreading among 10% of them through blood and sexual transmission. The past FH outbreak and contemporary infections were both associated with heterogeneous HDV-1 strains, combined with HBV-E. Vaccination against HBV was uncommon among pregnant women and students, even among medical students. The study constitutes warning signals to help CAR health-care reconstruction and underlines the importance of HBV vaccination. The high level of HBV infection creates a background for HDV superinfection. Neonatal HBV vaccination is needed, together with vaccination of unprotected populations. Awareness of health authorities as well as the general public would help reduce HBV and HDV infections.
