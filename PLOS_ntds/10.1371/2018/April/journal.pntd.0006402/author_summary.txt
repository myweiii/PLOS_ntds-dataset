The diagnosis of zoonotic ocular onchocercosis caused by Onchocerca lupi (Spirurida: Onchocercidae) is currently based on microscopic examination of skin snip sediments and on the identification of adults embedded in ocular nodules. These methods are labour-intensive and require multiple steps to achieve the diagnosis. In this context, a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay (qPCR) has been herein standardized and analytical specificity and sensitivity assessed. The results indicate that the qPCR assay could represent an important step forward in the diagnosis of onchocercosis, in carnivores and in insect species acting as potential intermediate hosts.
