Outbreaks of flea-borne rickettsiosis are rare despite the endemic status in Los Angeles County. In the spring of 2015 three human cases of flea-borne rickettsiosis among residents of a mobile home community (MHC) prompted an investigation. Fleas were found in all common areas at the MHC due to presence of flea-infested opossums and overabundant outdoor cats and dogs. The MHC was summarily abated in June 2015, and within five months, flea control and removal of animals significantly reduced the flea population. Two additional epidemiologically-linked human cases detected at the MHC were considered to have occurred before control efforts began. Molecular testing of cat fleas, immunological testing of opossums and feral cats collected at the site indicated active transmission of flea-borne rickettsiosis. This study represents the first flea-borne rickettsial outbreak that summary abatement approach was used to reduce its intensity.
