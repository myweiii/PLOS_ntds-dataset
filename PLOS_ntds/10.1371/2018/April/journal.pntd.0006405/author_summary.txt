Dengue infection along with its related disease conditions poses a significant threat to human populations. The pathogen responsible for this infection is dengue virus (DENV), which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Unavailability of vaccines has recently sparked research endeavours aimed at vector control. To date, Wolbachia as an endosymbiotic bacterium, has shown promises as a novel biocontrol agent to restrict DENV replication in mosquitoes through a mechanism that is still elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of pelo in Wolbachia-mosquito-DENV interactions. We found that the pelo protein is upregulated upon DENV infection facilitating its replication, but Wolbachia infection leads to the suppression of the protein that may contribute to inhibition of DENV replication. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of the pelo protein in Wolbachia-mediated antiviral effect against DENV in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.
