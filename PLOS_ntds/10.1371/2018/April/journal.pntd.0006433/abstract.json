    "Abstract": "Alternative methods of mosquito control are needed to tackle the rising burden of mosquito-borne diseases while minimizing the use of synthetic insecticides, which are threatened by the rapid increase in insecticide resistance in mosquito populations. Fungal biopesticides show great promise as potential alternatives because of their ecofriendly nature and ability to infect mosquitoes on contact. Here we describe the temporospatial interactions between the mosquito Aedes aegypti and several entomopathogenic fungi. Fungal infection assays followed by the molecular assessment of infection-responsive genes revealed an intricate interaction between the mosquito immune system and entomopathogenic fungi. We observed contrasting tissue and time-specific differences in the activation of immune signaling pathways and antimicrobial peptide expression. In addition, these antifungal responses appear to vary according to the fungal entomopathogen used in the infection. Enzyme activity-based assays coupled with gene expression analysis of prophenoloxidase genes revealed a reduction in phenoloxidase (PO) activity in mosquitoes infected with the most virulent fungal strains at 3 and 6d post-fungal infection. Moreover, fungal infection led to an increase in midgut microbiota that appear to be attributed in part to reduced midgut reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. This indicates that the fungal infection has far reaching effects on other microbes naturally associated with mosquitoes. This study also revealed that despite fungal recognition and immune elicitation by the mosquito, it is unable to successfully eliminate the entomopathogenic fungal infection. Our study provides new insights into this intricate multipartite interaction and contributes to a better understanding of mosquito antifungal immunity."
