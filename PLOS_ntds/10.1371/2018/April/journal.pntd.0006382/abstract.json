    "Background": "The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an acellular chitin-containing envelope which in most blood sucking insects encloses the ingested blood meal and protects the midgut epithelium. Type I PM present in sand flies and other blood sucking batch feeders is secreted around the meal by the entire midgut in response to feeding. Here we tested the hypothesis that in Sergentomyia schwetzi the PM creates a physical barrier that prevents escape of Leishmania parasites from the endoperitrophic space.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Morphology and ultrastructure of the PM as well the production of endogenous chitinase in S. schwetzi were compared with three sand fly species, which are natural vectors of Leishmania. Long persistence of the PM in S. schwetzi was not accompanied by different morphology or decreased production of chitinase. To confirm the role of the PM in refractoriness of S. schwetzi to Leishmania parasites, culture supernatant from the fungus Beauveria bassiana containing chitinase was added to the infective bloodmeal to disintegrate the PM artificially. In females treated with B. bassiana culture supernatants the PM was weakened and permeable, lacking multilayered inner structure; Leishmania colonized the midgut and the stomodeal valve and produced metacyclic forms. In control females Leishmania infections were lost during defecation.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Persistence of the PM till defecation of the bloodmeal represents an important factor responsible for refractoriness of S. schwetzi to Leishmania development. Leishmania major as well as L. donovani promastigotes survived defecation and developed late-stage infections only in females with PM disintegrated artificially by B. bassiana culture supernatants containing exogenous chitinase."
