5â€“8 million people in Latin America are infected with the single-cell parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Of these, approximately one-third will develop chronic disease pathology, leading to disability and premature death. Only two drugs are available, both of which can have severe side effects. We know relatively little about the chronic phase of this infection because the parasite burden is extremely low, and animal models have limitations. Here, we describe a T. cruzi reporter strain that has been genetically modified to express a fusion protein which is both bioluminescent and fluorescent. These parasites can be monitored throughout the infection, and individual parasites identified in tissue sections from infected mice. This allows us for the first time to analyse host-parasite interactions at a cellular level in the chronic phase of infection. We have also incorporated a streamlined version of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system into the reporter strain. We demonstrated the utility of this system by generating null mutants in the flagellar attachment protein GP72, by replacing the green fluorescent protein with a red fluorescent protein, and by tagging the endogenous protein DNA topoisomerase 1A. This T. cruzi reporter line will significantly enhance our ability to unravel the pathogenesis and immunology of chronic Chagas disease.
