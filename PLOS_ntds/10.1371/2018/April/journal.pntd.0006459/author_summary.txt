Clonorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis. C. sinensis is a biological carcinogen, causing cholangiocarcinoma in humans. Juvenile flukes migrate to and grow to adults in the bile ducts. The bile is chemo-attractive to the flukes and stimulates growth and egg production, and therefore is essential for their physiological and reproductive activities. However, excess bile accumulation can be toxic to the flukes. Several bile transporters are indispensable for C. sinensis to maintain homeostasis of bile acids in the bile duct. The C. sinensis organic solute transporter (CsOST) was presently cloned and characterized for the first time in trematodes. Interestingly, CsOST might include OST α- and β-subunits based on the positional sequence and overall structural conservation, although OSTβ was not reported from invertebrates. Our findings suggest that CsOST takes part in the export of bile acids and inhibitors. This study will stimulate further research on the functions of OST of liver flukes.
