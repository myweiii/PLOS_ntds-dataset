Sporotrichosis is a cosmopolitan disease, considered the most important subcutaneous mycosis in Latin America. Since 1998, there is an ongoing cat-transmitted zoonotic epidemic of sporotrichosis occurring in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pregnant women are a vulnerable population occasionally affected that require special attention regarding sporotrichosis treatment. Antifungal drugs should be avoided because of their potential risks to the fetus, unless in severe cases when amphotericin B (an intravenous antifungal drug) can be indicated. In this context, local measures are the treatment of choice. Cryosurgery consists in local application of intense cold using liquid nitrogen to destroy some infectious, tumoral and inflammatory cutaneous diseases. It is scarcely reported in the literature for the treatment of sporotrichosis, especially in pregnant women for whom local heat is most used. This works aims to describe the clinical response and outcome of cryosurgery for the treatment of sporotrichosis in four pregnant women. All patients reached clinical cure after one to three sessions. These results suggest that cryosurgery can be a well-tolerated, safe, and efficient method for the treatment of sporotrichosis in pregnancy.
