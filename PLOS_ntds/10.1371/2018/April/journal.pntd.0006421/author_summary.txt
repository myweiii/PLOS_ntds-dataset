Dengue virus is a world-wide public health menace estimated to infect hundreds of millions of people per year. Vaccines to prevent dengue virus infection have had limited success due in part to the requirement to elicit effective immune responses against the four dengue serotypes. There is an urgent unmet need for anti-dengue virus therapies. Nucleosides are effective antiviral small molecules which usually work by inhibiting the accurate replication of the viral genome. Typically, nucleosides must be converted within the cell to their triphosphate form to inhibit virus replication, thus inefficient phosphorylation often leads to suboptimal activity. We screened a small library of nucleobases that require an activation pathway different from nucleosides to achieve the same active form. We identified some known and previously undescribed dengue virus nucleobase inhibitors and their corresponding nucleosides. Our investigation of the mechanism of action of one nucleobase and its corresponding nucleoside found evidence for enhanced mutagenesis of the dengue virus genome in the presence of the compounds in cell culture. A wide screening of nucleobases libraries is a promising strategy to discover dengue virus inhibitors including potential viral mutagens.
