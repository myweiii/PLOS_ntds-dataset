The rapid growth in cross-border trade and transportation networks has led to massive population movements across borders, which increase the risk of disease spread across countries. A regional surveillance network, where disease outbreak data of each member country are shared through the network, plays an important role in prevention and control of cross-border outbreaks. However, variation in national outbreak reporting systems and guidelines used for outbreak detection and response in different countries can pose a challenge to cross-border communication for outbreak investigation. In this study, we evaluated outbreak data reported from four countries, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam, in the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance network (MBDS). We found that the definition of outbreak varied across countries. Vietnam reported severe diarrhea outbreaks when only 1–2 cases were detected, whereas severe diarrhea outbreak reported in Myanmar consisted of more than 20 cases per outbreak. Overall, the outbreak was reported and responded within 1–15 days after the first case was detected, depending on country and how fast each disease requires public health response. Understanding outbreak reporting data would help not only to improve disease reporting systems in each country, but also improve communication and response to cross-border outbreaks among neighboring countries.
