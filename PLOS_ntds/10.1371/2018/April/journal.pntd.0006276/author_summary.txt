Gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is transmitted by the tsetse fly and affects rural populations in Western and Central Africa. It is a deadly disease if untreated, and it is therefore important to find people in the early stages of disease so that appropriate care and medication can be provided. Because of this, much emphasis is put on mobile teams going from village to village and actively finding as many potential patients as possible. This does not reach all infected people, though, and some are only detected passively, that is they report themselves to a health provider, often in advanced stages of disease. It is not clear what proportion of cases of sleeping sickness are detected in this way, or how much onwards transmission is prevented. Here we used a mathematical model to analyse data from a sleeping sickness control programme in Uganda and South Sudan, in order to identify which proportion of people infected with the disease are identified through passive case detection. We found that only a minority of patients are identified in this way in the early stages of disease, but around half are identified if they are in the later stages. We further found that passive screening reduced transmission in affected areas by between 30 and 50%. This suggests that there is great potential value in improving the rates of passive case detection, and we recommend that more emphasis is put on tackling potential barriers that prevent people being detected.
