Human challenge models can provide a platform for the initial evaluation of vaccine efficacy to down-select vaccine candidates before more expensive phase III trials are conducted. An ideal challenge model would need to reproducibly induce diarrhea in a high proportion of volunteers using the lowest possible inoculum to better maximize the sensitivity of the model. In this study, we attempted to refine the ETEC H10407 challenge model by characterizing the clinical illness induced by lower ETEC challenge doses. We also performed a comprehensive dose and clinical diarrhea severity dependent assessment of the immune responses. We found that some volunteers do become ill when challenged with these low doses, but the rates of moderate to severe diarrhea observed with these doses were too low to be useful for such volunteer studies. Therefore, we conclude a dose of 2x107 H10407 remains the lowest practical dose when evaluating candidate vaccines or other preventive or therapeutic ETEC interventions. Diarrheal illness, when it occurred, was associated with higher fecal shedding levels of H10407. The magnitudes of immune responses were dependent on the dose, antigen and severity of diarrhea. This new knowledge may contribute to a better overall understanding of the immune responses to ETEC and its relation to diarrhea severity which will help facilitate and guide ETEC vaccine development strategies.
