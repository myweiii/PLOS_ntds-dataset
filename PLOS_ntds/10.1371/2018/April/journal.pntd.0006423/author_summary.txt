Volatile organic compounds released by bacteria growing on human skin are mediating human-blood-sucking insects interactions. In this study we were interested in those volatile organic compounds produced in vitro by skin bacterial metabolism that are involved in the Rhodnius prolixus interaction with humans. Rhodnius prolixus is the main vector of Chagas disease in Northern South America. Using behavioral experiments, chemical analysis and microbiological techniques we determined the volatile organic compounds released in vitro by bacteria isolated from human faces and its effects on Rhodnius prolixus. We found that most of the Staphylococcus species tested here are mediating attraction, while non-Staphylococcus species are non-attractive. As a conclusion, our results showed that volatile organic compounds released by bacteria isolated from human faces have a potential for biotechnological uses as a strategy to control the vectorial transmission of Chagas disease mediated by Rhodnius prolixus.
