In this work, we investigate cellular events and mechanisms involved in in cellulo envenomation by Lachesis muta muta snake, which is one of the snakes responsible for the ophidic accidents in Brazil. Since the venom pathological effects are related to local symptoms such as edema and tissue necrosis, we evaluate venom action on normal human keratinocytes, skin cells directly affected during envenomation. Our data show the chronological analysis of cellular events triggered by L. m. muta venom, which stimulates autophagy, affects mitochondrial membrane potential and activates mechanisms that lead to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. Crude venom also causes cell morphology and epithelial colony alterations. These findings give the first evidence about which cell death mechanisms are elicited by L. m. muta venom in skin cells. Understanding the pathways that underlie cellular damage will be useful to explain some of the pathological effects observed in local envenomation.
