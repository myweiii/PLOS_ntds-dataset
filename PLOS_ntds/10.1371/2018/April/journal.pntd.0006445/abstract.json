    "Abstract": "The spleen is one of the main affected organs in canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Disorganization of the splenic white pulp (SWP) has been associated with immunosuppression and disease progression. This study aims to assess structural and cellular changes in the splenic extracellular matrix of dogs with CVL, correlating these changes with the parasite load and clinical signs. Splenic fragments were collected from 41 naturally infected animals for parasite load quantification by quantitative PCR, histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells; CD21+ B cells; Ki-67+, IFN-Î³+, and IL-10+ cells; and the MMP-9 and ADAM-10 enzymes. Laminin, collagen and fibronectin deposition were also evaluated. The animals were grouped according to the level of SWP organization. SWP disorganization was accompanied by a reduction in the quantity of lymphoid follicles/mm2 (p > 0.0001). Animals with moderate to intense SWP disorganization showed more clinical signs (p = 0.021), higher laminin (p = 0.045) and collagen deposition (p = 0.036), higher MMP-9 expression (p = 0.035) and lower numbers of CD4+ T cells (p = 0.027) in the spleen than the animals with organized SWP. These data suggest that splenic structure and function are drastically altered and compromised during CVL."
