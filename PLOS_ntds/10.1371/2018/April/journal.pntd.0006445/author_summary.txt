Infected dogs play important roles in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis. These dogs are considered reservoirs of parasites in urban areas and fail to mount an efficient anti-Leishmania immune response. However, the specific immunosuppression profile is not completely understood. In our report, we evaluate and discuss the morphophysiological alterations in the spleens of dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. We found an association between extracellular matrix alterations and a failure to control the parasite load. We suggest a role for these alterations in hindering an immune response that is otherwise able to control the parasite load, thereby leading to disease progression. Our research contributes to the current knowledge of the immunopathology of canine visceral leishmaniasis.
