Schistosomiasis control currently focuses on preventive chemotherapy (PC) with praziquantel, which is effective, safe, and inexpensive. However, this treatment does not prevent subsequent reinfection. As schistosomiasis control targets become more ambitious and move towards elimination, interest is increasing in the potentially complementary roles of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions which may disrupt transmission of the parasite, thereby slowing reinfection following treatment. Water treatment for schistosomiasis control seeks to eliminate viable schistosome cercariae from water. We carried out a systematic review to summarize the existing knowledge on the effectiveness of water treatment for the removal or inactivation of cercariae, by processes including chlorination, filtration, UV disinfection, heating, and water storage. This is the first review of its kind and provides a concise summary of what is known to-date regarding water treatment against cercariae of different Schistosoma species. The review also identifies gaps in knowledge and provides crucial and timely guidance for the control and elimination of schistosomiasis, by highlighting the requirements for designing effective and sustainable water infrastructure for schistosomiasis-endemic regions.
