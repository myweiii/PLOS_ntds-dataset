Chagas disease is one of the most important neglected diseases with an estimated number of 6â€“7 million infected individuals, the majority living in Central and South America. The Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi) protozoan parasite is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. T.cruzi is highly genetically diverse and a new nomenclature assigned each strain to seven genetic groups (TcI-TcVI and Tcbat), named Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), based on their biochemical, immunological and phenotypical characteristics. T.cruzi DTUs have been correlated to diverse clinical outcomes highlighting the importance of molecular epidemiological screens. Despite the development of T.cruzi typing methods based on genetic signatures, each method presents its own advantages and challenges. The work presented here shows the application of mass spectrometry for Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Typing Assay using MS2 peptide spectral libraries (Tc-STAMS2). The novelty of the method is based on the use of peptide fragmentation spectra as strain-specific fingerprints to classify and identify DTUs. Initially, a spectra library is generated from characterized T.cruzi strains. The library is subsequently inspected using MS/MS spectra from unknown strains and confidently assigned to a specific strain in an automated and computationally-driven approach. The Tc-STAMS2 method was challenged to test several variables such as sample type and preparation, instrument setup and identification platform. Tc-STAMS2 provided high confidence and robustness in T.cruzi strain typing. The Tc-STAMS2 method represents a proof-of-concept of a complementary strategy to the current DNA-based T. cruzi genotyping methods. Moreover, the method allows the identification of strain-specific features that could be related to the biology of T.cruzi strains and their clinical outcomes.
