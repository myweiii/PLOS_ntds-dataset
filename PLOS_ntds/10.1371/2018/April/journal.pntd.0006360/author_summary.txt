Syphilis and yaws are closely related bacterial infections. In many countries where the diseases are found there is limited access to diagnostic testing. Recently a point of care test for both diseases has been developed. In the current study we evaluated the experience of healthcare workers and patients in using the test in the Solomon Islands. Both healthcare workers and patients valued the improved access to testing that provided by the point of care test. Experience of healthcare workers in using similar tests for other diseases, such as malaria, had both positive and negative impacts on their beliefs about the syphilis and yaws test.
