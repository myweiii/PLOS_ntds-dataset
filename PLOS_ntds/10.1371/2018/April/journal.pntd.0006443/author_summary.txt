The global burden of dengue cannot be overstated, and lack of effective control measures, besides avoiding contact with the mosquito vector, creates an urgent need to develop new strategies to control the disease. Here we elucidate the mechanism by which a natural soil bacterium inhibits DENV infection. Chromobacterium sp. Panama secretes a protease that is able to undermine the integrity of the viral particles, preventing their attachment and thus infection of host cells. This study contributes towards understanding how natural bacteria of the vector gut may limit disease transmission, and provides new candidate tools for the development of dengue transmission-blocking and therapeutic agents.
