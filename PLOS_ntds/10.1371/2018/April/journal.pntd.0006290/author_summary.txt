Rabies is caused by at least fourteen different viruses of the genus Lyssavirus. Although the classical rabies virus transmitted by the dog accounts for most human cases, most lyssaviruses are hosted by bats, which are able to transmit the disease to humans. The European bat lyssaviruses 1 (EBLV-1) and 2 (EBLV-2) have caused human rabies in Europe, while more than 90% of the bat rabies cases have been reported from serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) infected by EBLV-1. These cases clearly accumulate in certain areas of Europe, but the factors driving this distribution are unknown. The evolutionary relationships among these viral strains provide valuable information, however, they are only partially known. The south of the Iberian Peninsula is the only location within Europe with an additional reservoir for EBLV-1, the isabelline serotine bat (Eptesicus isabellinus) which is present also in North Africa. In this study we have reconstructed the EBLV-1 phylogeny and phylodynamics in the Iberian Peninsula in the context of the European continent. Our results suggest that some lineages have longer evolutionary history in their distribution areas, than others which seem to be in the process of a geographical expansion.
