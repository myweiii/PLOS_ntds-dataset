    "Introduction": "Rabies is caused by viruses of the genus Lyssavirus, which includes so far fourteen species recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), plus the recently proposed Lleida bat Lyssavirus (LLEBV) [1] and Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus (GBLV) [2]. Three of the viruses of the phylogroup 1 are associated with European bats of the family Vespertilionidae: the European bat Lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) and the Bokeloh bat Lyssavirus (BBLV). Besides, the other two lyssaviruses described so far in Europe (West Caucasian bat virus, WCBV; and LLEBV) are hosted by the cave bat Miniopterus schreibersii (Family Miniopteridae) [1, 3]. Out of all of them, only EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 have caused rabies in humans, while more than 90% of the bat rabies cases have been reported from serotine bats (E. serotinus) infected by EBLV-1 [4]. EBLV-1 is divided in two main subtypes: EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b. The first one is found in an East-west axis from Ukraine to the north of France, while EBLV-1b is reported from France, southern Germany and the Netherlands [5]. EBLV-1a has been recently described also from Southern France [6]. Nevertheless, the evolutionary relationships among these viral subtypes in Western Europe are only partially known and previous attempts of evolutionary analyses [7] were hampered either by uneven available sampling or the dearth of molecular markers.\nTwo cryptic species of serotine bats (E. serotinus and E. isabellinus) have been lately found within the genus Eptesicus in the Iberian Peninsula [8]. While E. serotinus is distributed across Northern Iberia as well as the rest of Western Europe, the sibling species.\nE. isabellinus is restricted to the Southern half of the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa [9]. So far, EBLV-1 infection has been declared only from E. isabellinus in Spain [7], forming an exclusive monophyletic clade, possibly related to the EBLV-1b subtype.\nIn this study, we described the first EBLV-1 associated to E. serotinus South of the Pyrenees, and show how the inclusion of these new strains in phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses together with the use of newly developed molecular markers have substantially improved our present knowledge of EBLV-1 molecular epidemiology in Europe and the Iberian Peninsula.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nNo live animals were used for this study. All the work has been done with bat carcasses from, either animals directly submitted to the Laboratory by public health services, or admitted in wildlife care Centers, which submitted to the laboratory those bats which could not be recovered after treatment. Consequently, the need for approval by an IACUC/ethics committee does not apply.\n\n\nSamples\nWe have sequenced three fragments of the viral genome of 23 EBLV-1 strains detected in brains of nine E. serotinus and 14 E. isabellinus sent to the National Center for Microbiology (Majadahonda, Spain) for rabies diagnosis and that were found positive for Lyssavirus antigen by the fluorescence antibody test and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [10].\nMorphological bat identification was confirmed in most cases by genomic sequencing of several diagnostic mtDNA fragments [9]: 69R99 (MG211681), 80R99 (MG211682), 56R00 (MG211683), 69R00Eis (MG211684), 211R07 (MG211685), 86R08 (MG211686), 2011Riglos (MG211687), 201127004 (MG211688), 201149008 (MG211689), 201238163 (MG211690), 201325895 (MG211691), 200928458 (MG211692), 201544034 (MG211693), 201548093 (MG211694), 201539228 (MG211695), 201427094 (MG211696), 201539226 (MG211697), 44R02 (MG211698), 292R07 (MG211699).\n\n\nLyssavirus RT-PCR amplification methods\nThe 400-bp-5' terminal sequence of the nucleoprotein (N-400) gene was amplified and sequenced as described previously [7]. Besides, a 686-bp variable region of the phosphoprotein (P) and a 763-bp fragment including the glycoprotein-polymerase (G-L) intergenic region were amplified by EBLV-1 specific primers in nested RT-PCR reactions specific for each region (Table 1).\n\n\nPhylogenetic analyses\nAll 23 N-400 sequences from Spain were aligned using the MAFFT software (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) together with 162 sequences from other European countries available on GenBank (S1 Table). The fittest nucleotide substitution model was selected according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) using jModelTest v.2.1.10 (http://darwin.uvigo.es/our-software/). For the Iberian samples we selected the substitution models HKY, K80 + I, K80 for the alignments of the P, G-L and N400 markers respectively. Besides, a GTR model was selected for the alignment of all Iberian and European N400 fragments.\nOnly for the Iberian samples, the N, P and G-L fragments were concatenated into a 1809 base pair (bp) alignment using Sea View v.4.6. (Table 1) and a HKY nucleotide substitution model was selected from this concatenated alignment using Partition Finder v.1.1.1. (http://www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder/).\nPhylogenetic relationships were reconstructed for each alignment using a Bayesian approach with the program MrBayes (version 3.1.2) with two runs of 1 x 106 generations. Additional phylogenies were reconstructed using other three optimality criteria: Minimum Evolution (ME), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum Parsimony (MP). ME was obtained through a Neighbor-Joining algorithm with MEGA7 (http://www.megasoftware.net/), ML was constructed with PHYML software (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) and finally, MP trees were inferred with PAUP* 4.0b10 (http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/) weighting transversions differentially according to the transitions/transversion ratio of the selected substitution model. Confidence in the topologies was inferred after 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Trees were edited using the FigTree v1.4.1 program (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).\nViral genetic geographic structure across Europe was examined for each lineage data set, EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, through parsimony-based haplotype networks employing the Median Joining (MJ) algorithm implemented in Network (v5.0, Fluxus Technology (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/sharenet.htm), without star-contraction pre-processing or post-processing clean-up options.\nTo reconstruct phylodynamic patterns of EBLV-1 we analysed the N-400 sequence dataset in a Bayesian framework implemented in the BEAST software (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/) [11]. For model parameters we follow Hughes 2008\u2019s analyses that use similar sequences of the same marker and virus. Accordingly, evolution rates were assumed to fit an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock [12] and two MCMC chains were run for 5 x 107 generations each with trees and parameters sampled every 1000 steps. We used the SRD06 option for codon partition and substitution model according to the recommendation of Hughes 2008. This option includes an HKY substitution model and four gamma rates with two codon partitions for the alignment: first and second codons were analysed together and separately from the third codon. Analyses started with a random starting tree with a constant population size prior, according to Hughes 2008. Then, chains were run to an effective sample size (ESS) of parameters higher than 200 (following BEAST\u2019s recommendations) and chains convergence was assessed from standard deviation and likelihood values using Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) with the first 10% of the trees discarded as burning. Bayesian credible intervals or 95% Highest Posterior Density (95% HDP) were inferred as uncertainty evaluation. Finally, the consensus phylogenetic tree was built with TreeAnnotator (BEAST software package) and edited in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",
    "Results and discussion": "EBLV-1 is mostly found associated with the bat E. serotinus north of the high mountain ranges of Southern Europe, such as the Alps or the Pyrenees, which seem to hinder virus expansion to the south. However, a group of sequences from Southern Spain were found to cluster in a monophyletic group associated with a different bat, the sibling species E. isabellinus [7]. In this study, we report for the first time nine EBLV-1 strains found in E. serotinus south of the Pyrenees and describe their evolutionary relationships (Fig 1A and 1B). Two of them grouped within the recently described cluster of EBLV-1a sequences from Southern France [6], extending this group now to Northern Spain. The EBLV-1a subtype is otherwise typically distributed through Northern Europe, along an east-west axis from The Netherlands to Ukraine [5]. The shallow genetic differentiation (Figs 1B and 2A) found between the strains on both slopes of the Pyrenees of this Southern group of EBLV-1a suggests a recent geographical expansion of this subtype across southern France, with very recent arrival to the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, one of the new EBLV-1a strains was found only 24 km away from the nearest Iberian EBLV-1b strain (Fig 1A), with no significant geographical barriers between them. This supports a hypothesis of current southwards expansion of EBLV-1a, as was proposed for Western Europe by V\u00e1zquez-Mor\u00f3n et al. [7]. The clear star-like structure observed for EBLV-1a in the haplotype network provides additional support for this hypothesis (Fig 2A).\n1A: Geographical distribution of the lineages described within the EBLV-1 rabies virus across Western Europe: EBLV-1a (red dots) along Northern, Central Europe. EBLV-1b (yellow dots) along Central Europe and the Iberian EBLV-1b, with a further subdivision between Southwestern major (purple diamonds), Southwestern minor (blue diamonds) Southeastern (black diamonds) and Northwestern. (green diamonds) strains. Two strains from the same location (R76, 292R07) not grouping in any of the previous lineages are represented by a dotted diamond.

Colored circles correspond to the main phylogenetic groups.\n2A: EBLV-1a lineage. Circle\u2019s sizes are proportional to the number of individuals sharing this particular haplotype and color code the regions of origin of haplotypes, Red: Germany; Dark Blue: France; Brown: Denmark; Grey: Hungary; Purple: Poland; Orange: The Netherlands; Light Green: Spain. Reconstructed haplotypes are represented as small red squares. 2B: EBLV-1b lineage. Circle\u2019s sizes are proportional to the number of individuals sharing this particular haplotype and colors code the regions of origin of haplotypes, Red: Central France; Dark Blue: North-west France; Yellow: North-east France; Black: Germany; Orange: The Netherlands; Light Green: Southern Spain; Dark Green: Northern Spain. Reconstructed haplotypes are represented as small red squares.\nThe remaining seven new EBLV-1 sequences detected in E. serotinus cluster together with the Iberian clade that had been exclusively found in E. isabellinus in the Southern half of the Iberian Peninsula [7] (Fig 1B). This Iberian clade was considered to be differentiated from both EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b [7]. However, our new phylogenetic analyses show that this Iberian lineage shared by the two species of Eptesicus is actually part of the EBLV-1b subtype. This fact points again to a more predominant role of geographical factors than the host species in determining EBLV-1\u2019s phylogenetic structure in Iberia. Both Eptesicus species are phylogenetically close and show some overlap in their geographical distribution in Iberia [13]. Interestingly, phylogenetic relatedness and geographic contact, were considered the two main conditions for interspecific transmission of rabies among bats in America [14]. The haplotype network (Fig 2B) shows a much more complex structure and higher haplotype diversity for EBLV-1b than for EBLV-1a, suggesting a much longer evolutionary history. The analyses also suggest that Iberian EBLV-1b has evolved isolated from the rest of European EBLV-1b, from a still unknown common ancestor, although more geographic coverage is still necessary to fully reconstruct this event.\nOur coalescence based analysis (S3 Fig) suggests that the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) for the entire EBLV-1 lineage currently circulating in Eptesicus bats dates to 175 years ago ([47; 260] HDP). This value is remarkably similar (just five years older) to the date previously proposed [12], but with narrower 95% HDP intervals. The tMRCA estimated for the whole EBLV-1a lineage was approximately 70 years ([59; 158] HDP), while the Iberian EBLV-1a strains could have emerged less than 15 years ago, ([4; 13] HDP) giving additional support to the hypothesis of a recent southward expansion from France across the Pyrenees.\nOn the other hand, the tMRCA for the subtype EBLV-1b is estimated be around 110 years ago, ([53; 187] HDP). This result suggests a longer evolutionary history than EBLV-1a in agreement with the Network analysis. The Iberian EBLV-1b strains would have spawned approximately 55 years ago, ([31; 82] HDP). Nevertheless, we suggest caution on this dating since some uncertainty for the marginal posterior distribution of all the tMRCA was noticed, which will, most probably, be solved when additional cases of Iberian EBLV-1 infection are available.\nIn addition to the nucleoprotein gene, the two hypervariable regions studied enlighten the internal structure within the Iberian EBLV-1b cluster. The strains associated with E. serotinus seem particularly related to those associated with E. isabellinus from the South West (Fig 3). In fact, the presence of a strain (69R00_SE) from Seville (South West) in the new group of viruses associated with E. serotinus (North East) points to an inter-specific transmission of EBLV-1 (Fig 1A and Fig 3) and suggests that this particular Iberian lineage has extended northwards from E. isabellinus to E. serotinus. In fact, the Network shows the Northern Iberian EBLV-1b strains associated with E. serotinus branching off from a common Southern haplotype (in an expansion star-like shape), providing additional support for this hypothesis (Fig 2B). On the other hand, the Iberian South West seems to concentrate the highest variability within the Iberian EBLV-1b lineage (Fig 1A), including a sub-lineage represented by two sequences (155R99, R75) which occupied the most basal position and have never been detected after 1999 (Fig 3). An east-west discrimination of two groups of viruses in the South is in agreement with the east-west population subdivision described for the host bat E. isabellinus [9]. Interestingly, this study suggests a close genetic relatedness between South Western Iberian and North-African populations for E. isabellinus [9]. This genetic pattern strongly supports the possibility of the presence of EBLV-1 in North Africa from where it has not been reported yet.\nTree nodes show posterior probability (black) and Maximum-Parsimony (red), Neighbor-Joining (blue) and Maximum-Likelihood (green) bootstrap support values. Two Iberian EBLV-1a sequences (2011_Riglos, 201539226_HU) have been included as outgroup. Color code of the diamonds associated to the main groups is the same than in Fig 1A. Two Iberian EBLV-1a sequences (2011_Riglos, 201539226_HU) are included as outgroup. The sequence 69R00_SE, marked with a black dot within the north-east-E. serotinus group, was obtained from an E. isabellinus from the south-west (see text).\nIn conclusion, the increasing involvement of wild life rescue centers in bat rabies surveillance has allowed us to detect the first cases in Iberian E. serotinus and we hope it will allow us to increase the overall number of Iberian strains in the upcoming years. Unfortunately, active screening of healthy bats captured in colonies by testing oral fluids and blood does not usually provide enough genomic material to perform this kind of study [15]. The use of highly variable genomic regions (Fig 3, S3A and S3B Fig) has clearly improved the resolution of the virus evolutionary phylogenetic reconstructions [16], and has provided a better understanding of the phylogenetic structure of the Iberian EBLV-1 populations, pointing to evolutionary patterns at a continental level that deserve further research."
