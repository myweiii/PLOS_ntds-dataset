All types of cells were proved to secrete nano-spheres called extracellular vesicles (EVs). Parasites derived-EVs have the ability to manipulate the immune system, and carry many proteins that have been used as a vaccine candidate. In this study, the author used EVs derived from cultured Schistosome mansoni eggs as an immunizing agent against experimental schistosomiasis. Mice were immunized with three subcutaneous doses of EVs. Two weeks after the last vaccination dose mice were exposed to cercarial challenge. Six weeks later mice were sacrificed and vaccine efficacy was evaluated using different parasitological, histopathological and immunological parameters. Results showed significant reduction in the parasite burden especially the hepatic and intestinal egg count. Adults obtained from the vaccinated mice showed sever derangement in their protective tegumental layer with loss of muscle tone when examined by electron microscope. EVs induced high level of protective IFN Î³ and antibody. This was accompanied by amelioration of the hepatic histopathology which is the main cause of the clinical manifestation.
