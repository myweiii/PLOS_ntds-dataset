First and foremost, the authors would like to express their gratitude towards all the children, their parents, the schoolteachers and principals who participated in this study. Second, we wish to specifically thank all the people who provided the necessary laboratory and logistic support in each of the four different sampling sites. This work would not have been possible without their willful participation and assistance.
