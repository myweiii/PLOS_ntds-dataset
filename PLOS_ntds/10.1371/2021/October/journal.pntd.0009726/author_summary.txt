Diarrheal diseases are leading causes of illness and death among children throughout the world, and children in Haiti were particularly impacted by diarrhea during the cholera outbreak that started in 2010. Between 2012 and 2016, data were collected as part of a case-control study of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) effectiveness in Haiti. We analyzed data from that study to identify factors associated with diarrheal illness, including cholera and non-cholera diarrhea, among children ages one through five years old. We found a direct association between longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding and supplementation with vitamin A and zinc and a reduced risk of diarrhea. These findings shed light on potentially important components of efforts to reduce pediatric diarrheal illness in Haiti generally, and to reduce pediatric diarrhea in the context of cholera outbreaks in Haiti and elsewhere.
