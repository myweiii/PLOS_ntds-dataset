In the previous study, a Trichinella spiralis inorganic pyrophosphatase (TsPPase) was expressed and its role in larval molting and development was observed. In this study, a recombinant TsPPase/pSIP409-pgsA′ plasmid was constructed and transferred into Lactobacillus plantarum NC8, the rTsPPase was expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum NC8. Oral immunization of mice with rTsPPase DNA vaccine elicited a high level of specific serum IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA). The levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 released from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches were evidently increased at 2–4 weeks following vaccination. Immunization of mice with rTsPPase showed a significant reduction of intestinal infective larvae, adult worms and muscle larvae, and intestinal larval molting and development was significantly suppressed. The results indicated that oral vaccination with rTsPPase elicited a significant local mucosal sIgA response and specific systemic Th1/Th2 immune response, and an obvious protective immunity against T. spiralis infection.
