Neurocysticercosis, caused by the ingestion of Taenia solium eggs, is a major cause of human epilepsy around the world. A wide spectrum of tools to fight T. solium is are now available and include antiparasitic treatment for pigs and humans, porcine vaccines, and sanitation improvements; however, the ideal combination of interventions applied to populations to maximize effectiveness and feasibility is not known. Transmission models are one tool that can be used to compare and evaluate different intervention strategies, but no currently available T. solium models have been tested for accuracy. In this research, we validated our model (“CystiAgent”) by comparing simulations of the model to the results of a large-scale trial testing a variety of T. solium control interventions. The model was calibrated using observed epidemiological data from these villages and evaluated for its ability to reproduce the effect of T. solium control interventions. The validation showed that the model was able to reproduce the baseline levels of disease, but generally overestimated the effect that each intervention would have on transmission. These results will allow us to identify limitations of the current model to improve future versions, and represent a step forward in the creation of a tool to design and evaluate future programs to control and eliminate T. solium.
