Traditional surveillance of onchocerciasis relies on the detection of Onchocerca volvulus microfilaria or antibodies in human skin or blood samples. Molecular xenomonitoring, the detection of parasite nucleic acid in vector insects, provides a non-invasive alternative. The sensitivity of molecular xenomonitoring to areas where infected people are found has not previously been evaluated and the extent to which xenomonitoring can be used to predict human prevalence is unknown. We searched for previous studies that reported the infection rates in humans and detection rates in black flies, finding 15 studies comprising 34 study communities that contributed to our analyses. Studies were conducted across Africa and the Americas, mostly in areas of very low prevalence. The findings show molecular xenomonitoring was sensitive to areas with greater than 1% microfilaria prevalence in the human population, indicating that molecular xenomonitoring is effective at detecting ongoing transmission. We further found evidence that infection rates in humans and detection rates in flies were related, providing scope for the use of xenomonitoring to predict human prevalence. With further research to better understand this relationship, control programmes may be able to use xenomonitoring for other purposes such as identifying areas that require intervention and monitoring the impact of treatments.
