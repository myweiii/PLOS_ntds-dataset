Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is usually neglected clinically in chronic hepatic schistosomiasis (CHS) patients. The diffusion change in substantia nigra-striatum system of MHE patients has been reported. We hypothesized that the change could be better detected by DWI-based radiomics. A radiomics nomogram combining radiomics and clinical predictors of MHE was built to predict MHE in CHS patients. The results demonstrate that the radiomics nomogram would be useful for predicting MHE in CHS patients.
