Malaria and sleeping sickness are parasitic illnesses that overlap geographically, making it likely that co-infections between the two causative parasites occur. It was previously shown that when mice are first infected with Trypanosoma brucei, there was an attenuation of the subsequent infection by Plasmodium. Here we sought to assess whether an active T. brucei infection was required for this impairment, and to unravel the mechanism behind this phenomenon. We found that not only T. brucei total lysates are able to inhibit Plasmodium liver infection, but also that mice that received these lysates are partly protected from developing severe malaria pathology. We further showed that this protective effect is mediated by proteins excreted by trypanosomes. Our study paves the way to the development of novel antiplasmodial intervention strategies, based on the mechanism involved during the co-infection between T. brucei and Plasmodium.
