Dengue is a major public health concern in China. The rapid development of urbanization along with climate change increases the challenge for dengue prevention and control. Previous research has mainly focused on the meteorological variables whereas land use and land cover (LULC) change received comparatively less attention. Our review identified that the regional research hotspots of dengue epidemics in China were Guangdong Province and southern Taiwan. Though inconsistent, most included studies somehow observed associations between at least one of the LULC change factors and dengue. A geographical information system (GIS) was widely used to perform spatial analysis in the selected literature. Its application provided a novel view to describe the relationships between environmental factors and the situation of dengue, which enabled scholars to explore more characteristics of dengue transmission. Meanwhile, the use of remote sensing (RS) enriched the means of environmental monitoring. However, there are research gaps in the area of dengue and LULC change, such as the less consideration of dengue vector study, the lack of interplays between factors, and the lack of considering interventions and policies. Furthermore, because of different research settings, results from these studies were difficult to compare. Thus, further comprehensive and comparable investigations are necessary to better understand the effects of LULC change on dengue in China. This review is the first to expound the studies on the associations between LULC change and dengue dynamics in China. It demonstrates the findings and methodologies and provided insights for future research.
