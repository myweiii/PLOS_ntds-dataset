Dengue is among the rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases and is widespread in tropical and subtropical areas. In China, dengue is a serious public health problem, especially in the southeastern regions with rapid urbanization, such as Guangzhou City. Since 1998, more than 40,000 dengue cases have been reported in Guangzhou. Dengue transmission is affected by multiple factors, including climate and different socio-ecological factors. This study indicates that temperature has a significant effect on the long-time series of dengue transmission, while socio-ecological factors play an important role in dengue outbreaks. The interactive effect of temperature and socio-ecological factors contributes to dengue outbreak in Guangzhou. Increasing temperature and surge in travel could cause a dengue outbreak in the future. We have made suggestions about policies and measures regarding its prevention in Guangzhou.
