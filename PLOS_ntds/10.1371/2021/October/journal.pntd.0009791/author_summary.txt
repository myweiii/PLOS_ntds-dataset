Podoconiosis is preventable if genetically susceptible people wear shoes starting from an early age and do so consistently. However, lack of routine use of footwear since early childhood has been observed to be a major covariate of vulnerability to podoconiosis. The present study assessed the extent of protective footwear use and associated family socioeconomic factors among school-age rural children at high risk of the disease. Household heads and their children (aged between 9 and 15 years) participated in household surveys. Nearly half (49.5%) of the children were found to have less-protective use of footwear, either walking barefoot or wearing under-protective footwear in a range of situations. Girls, older children, those in higher school grades, those from families with higher socio-economic status, and those who owned a larger number of pairs of footwear reported more protective use of footwear. The protective footwear use among children is likely to increase with increase in family socioeconomic status and number of pairs of different types of footwear owned by the children. Increased adoption of protective footwear is needed to prevent school-age children living in endemic areas from developing podoconiosis and other neglected tropical diseases. Interventions aimed to encourage ownership of multiple pairs of footwear should use approaches that also increase the socio-economic capacity of podoconiosis-affected families.
