Sand flies transmit Leishmania parasites between infected dogs and humans leading to the life-threatening tropical disease Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Identifying which dogs transmit parasites well to sand flies is important to curb disease spread. The offspring of both dogs and humans can also be infected vertically while in utero. Despite this, the infectiousness of dogs that receive parasites in utero to sand flies has not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, we allowed sand flies to feed on a group of vertically infected dogs at varying stages of VL disease severity and measured sand fly parasite uptake. We found vertically infected dogs were readily able to transmit parasites to the sand flies. Dogs that were most infectious had mild to moderate clinical disease and relatively high levels of parasite infection in their blood and skin. However, the level of skin infection was significantly higher than that observed in the blood, and the skin parasite load had the strongest correlation with sand fly parasite uptake. This implicates the skin may be an underappreciated driver of canine infectiousness to the sand fly vector. In addition, this work highlights that vertically infected dogs are very important parts of the transmission cycle and must be considered in all public health efforts addressing VL.
