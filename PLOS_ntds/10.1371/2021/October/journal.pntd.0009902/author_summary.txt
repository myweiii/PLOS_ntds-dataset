Trachoma, a leading cause of blindness, is caused by repeated infection that is spread from person to person via contaminated ocular and nasal discharge. Having a clean face is protective against trachoma. In the past, long distances to water were associated with unclean faces. Other environmental elements have not been extensively explored. We need improved clarity on the environmental factors affecting facial cleanliness and trachoma prevalence, especially when the disease burden is low but still above 5%. We conducted a household survey in every village in Kongwa district, Tanzania, and found that access to water has significantly improved and is no longer a limiting factor in childrenâ€™s facial cleanliness. When households have more storage capacity for water used for washing, wash their clothes frequently and clean their yards, young children in the households are more likely to have clean faces. We then created a household cleanliness index that comprises a clean yard, washed clothes, an improved latrine and at least one child in the household having a clean face. We found that an increased average index score in the community is associated with a decreased prevalence of trachoma, suggesting that a multi-pronged approach to improve household cleanliness is valuable.
