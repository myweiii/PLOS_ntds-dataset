Brazil is one of the world’s most social-economically unequal countries, with a rising homeless population potentialized by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in its largest city, São Paulo. While few studies, mostly in high-income countries, have addressed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on homeless populations, none has been carried out in Brazil. Herein, we report a high SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in a homeless population, with 111/203 (54.7%) seropositive individuals. At the time of the study (August 25th- 27th 2020), both homeless and social worker populations showed no active SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that they were likely exposed sometime within the pandemic’s first peak in the city. Our study has also shown significant risk and protective factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including that Black shelter workers were at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with the white shelter workers.
