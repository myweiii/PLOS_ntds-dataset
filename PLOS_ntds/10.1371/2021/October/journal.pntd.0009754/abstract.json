    "Abstract": "Brazil presents one of the highest COVID-19 death tolls in the world. The initial SARS-CoV-2 epicenter was São Paulo city. As of 2019, the homeless population of São Paulo city was estimated at 24,344 individuals, the largest national homeless population. The present study aimed to concomitantly assess the molecular and serological prevalence and associated risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a homeless population and related shelter workers from a day-shelter. Serum samples, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs of persons who are homeless and shelter workers collected from August 25th to 27th, 2020 were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, respectively. All swab samples tested negative by RT-qPCR. Seropositivity of IgM and IgG was 5/203 (2.5%) and 111/203 (54.7%) in persons who are homeless, and 5/87 (5.7%) and 41/87 (47.1%) in shelter workers, respectively, with no statistical differences between groups. The high seroprevalence found herein indicates early environmental and urban spreading of SARS-CoV-2, associated with sociodemographic and economic vulnerability."
