    "Introduction": "Dengue fever is an acute mosquito-borne viral disease caused by infection of any of four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1\u20134) that predominantly circulates in tropics and subtropics, subjecting over 3 billion individuals to the risk of infection [1]. DENV accounts for an annual occurrence of ~ 400 million cases across 129 countries [2], though only \u00bc is symptomatic [3].\nDengue clinical manifestation varies greatly from self-limiting febrile illness to fatal outcomes without clear-cut hallmarks to assist diagnosis. These life-threatening complications occur relatively late during the disease course\u2014often day 4 of fever onset or around the critical phase [4,5]. At present, no therapeutics are available for dengue except supportive care as an off-label approach. Furthermore, dengue vaccine has acquired specific achievements, but on the horns of a dilemma, restricting the vaccinations only to those with dengue-infection history. Therefore, dengue management continues to rely upon constant examination and round-the-clock nursing care, imposing a burden on clinical triage and economy in resource-limited settings [1].\nRepresenting a potential breakthrough in the proactive management of dengue, the effort to some extent has shifted to the search for means that can foretell the outcomes at the inception of disease. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised dengue case classification in light of multi-centre study findings known as \u201cDENCO\u201d (DENgue COntrol), which was proved more sensitive to predicting severe cases [6,7]. The adapted classification, although improved, has demonstrated limited performance in the early prognosis of severe complications [8,9]. Given the betterment of pathogenesis understanding, accumulating evidence has associated numerous predictive candidates with severe dengue progression [10,11].\nNevertheless, the reported evidence is conflicting [12\u201314]. These conflicts arise from insufficient study power or inconsistency in the timeframe during which markers are recorded [15,16], often late in the disease course [15,16]. Additionally, the combination of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) as a severe form is frequently seen [14,17\u201319], which could mislead clinical triage given that management strategies differ between these two groups [20,21].\nPrevious systematic reviews offer insight as to predictive methods for severe dengue. Notwithstanding, the conclusions went hand in hand with the study limitations that formed the body of evidence, say the combination of DHF and DSS or late measurement [12,14,19,22,23]. Besides, studies have focused concern on immunogenetic markers that benefit pathophysiology rather than medical case management [18,24\u201327]. Here we advance the findings of prior work to illustrate the association of available markers and severe dengue in a different context.",
    "Methods": "Protocol registration\nWe previously developed and registered the systematic review protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42018104495; S1 Protocol). We followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines (S1 Table).\n\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included observational studies that reported on the association of host markers and dengue severities categorized by WHO classifications. The markers were measured within 72 hours of fever onset and before the occurrence of any severe complication, including shock, bleeding, and organ impairment.\n\n\nSearch strategy\nOn 7th June 2018, we searched for articles using nine databases, including Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, EMBASE, Google Scholar, POPLINE, PubMed, Scopus, SIGLE, and Web of Science (ISI). We updated the systematic search before the inception of data analysis (on 17th December 2019; without POPLINE database as no longer available) and before the submission for peer review (on 20th September 2020) by using the identical search terms (S1 Text). We manually searched preprint sites (bioRxiv and medRxiv), in-text citations from eligible articles, and previous reviews on the related topics. Concerning articles with insufficient information, we contacted the authors.\n\n\nStudy selection\nWe screened titles and abstracts for the relevance of the content that was continued by reviewing full texts. Three reviewers independently worked on tasks with an agreement reached through a discussion amongst the reviewers, and in case of discrepancy, we consulted the empirical authors (KH, NTH, SPD). We used the Kappa statistic to appraise the inter-rater reliability amongst the reviewers.\n\n\nData extraction\nWe piloted the in-house data collection tool for its applicability before the official extraction by three reviewers working independently (S1 Data). We collected data for study characteristics, population baseline characteristics, measurement times, pre-admission treatments, dengue case classifications, dengue serotypes, serostatus (primary or secondary infection), and host marker data collected in the pre-specified time window.\nFor data reported by days before fever subsided, we included data reported within 3 days before defervescence, depending on the availability of data and the similarity of timeframe varying from study to study, assuming that day 4 was the day fever subsided [4,5,10,28]. Accordingly, we chose data from day 1\u20133 when authors reported data corresponding to the day since fever onset. For data graphically presented, we requested data from authors or used a web-based software program, available at https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/, to collect the summary information of the outcomes or individual participant data by which the latter was then checked for normal distribution and normalized before computing mean and standard deviation (SD). For missing SD, we outsourced data from other articles based upon the similarity of population, measurement time, and severe outcomes that patients developed [29]. If neither of these methods satisfied, we considered synthesizing the evidence by narrative review in tabular formats. Concerning the overlapping data, we chose outcomes with a larger sample size for meta-analysis.\n\n\nQuality assessment\nAt the study level, we used NHLBI quality assessment and Q-genie scoring to rate the risk of bias of the component studies corresponding to their designs, case-control or cohort [30] or genetic association studies [31] and presented them in the characteristics of included studies table. Briefly, each study underwent a set of signalling questions about the potential bias that a study may present. We mainly based the appraisal on the resemblance of the population, including age structures, enrollment times, and locations alongside the clear sample size justification. When the reviewers could not provide sound judgement due to insufficient information, the study was of unclear risk of bias.\nAt the outcome level, we used the GRADE approach to grade the certainty of our findings for their clinical applicability [32] and to generate an evidence profile, including the judgements on the risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness of the findings [33\u201336]. We graded down the robustness of evidence when serious concern arose from any of the four domains.\n\n\nOutcomes and definition of markers\nOutcomes were the differences in host marker data between severe and non-severe dengue cases. To uniform the severity levels through the series of WHO dengue classifications, to those of the 1997 classification or earlier, we grouped dengue fever, dengue hemorrhage fever grade 1 and grade 2 into non-severe cases; grade 3 and grade 4 (dengue shock syndrome) were defined as severe cases. Similarly, the 2009 WHO classification or later, we combined dengue with and without warning signs to form a group of non-severe cases.\nThe markers were biochemical substances (e.g., liver enzymes, VEGF), hematopoietic parameters (e.g., leukocyte, neutrophil), immune mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines), and viral footprints (e.g., viral load, NS1 antigen detected in any of host tissue or biological fluid), or clinical symptoms or signs, which altered or occurred due to dengue infection.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo ensure the appropriateness of conducting a meta-analysis, we initially examined the similarity across the studies based upon three dimensions, including clinical traits, methodology and observed effects [37,38]. Next, we performed a meta-analysis of the relationship between patient-derived data and severe dengue development using the Sidik-Jonkman method for a random-effect model that bears an adequate error rate in estimating the between-study variance [39]. We used Hedges\u2019s g\u2014a standardized mean difference (SMD)\u2014as the pooled estimates for continuous variables [40] and natural logarithm odd ratios (LORs) for binary outcomes [41], followed by 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the articles that were of unmet similarity, we performed the narrative review in tabular formats.\nAs the rule of thumb, the statistical approaches of heterogeneity that we incorporated into the principal analysis (I2, \u03c42, and Q test) reflected the arithmetical variability in estimates and the overlapping in confidence intervals [33]\u2014rather than either actual clinical or methodological differences; therefore, we did not mainly base the exploration of the inconsistency on these approaches but the examination of clinical key features by GRADE approach. However, we could not fully perform the subgroup analysis and meta-regression to see the impact of the a priori hypotheses such as age, gender, pre-admission treatments, dengue case classifications, serotypes, serostatus, and study limitations (risk of bias) due to sporadic reporting data. We estimated mean and SD using the methods published elsewhere [42\u201344].",
    "Results": "The systematic search identified 4000 records through the three different operations of search against time. After removing duplicates, 2666 records were included for the title and abstract screening. The manual search identified eight additional articles. We updated the systematic search and found two research articles. In total, 40 articles were utilized to generate the body of evidence. Of these, 19 articles underwent meta-analysis. For the remaining articles, we mainly focused on the central findings in tandem with the methodological flaws, as presented in Fig 1.\nKappa statistics showed that the strength of agreement between the reviewers at any cross-checked screening step was moderate, by which the index varied from 0.42 to 0.56, with 95% CI varied from 0.30 to 0.65.\nThe 40 studies involved approximate 6160 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients who met our pre-specified criteria from three endemic continents of dengue: Asia (especially South-East Asia countries), Latin America, and the Pacific Islands. Of these, 19 studies reported data on children; 11 included all age groups; eight included only adults; two did not describe the target population (Table 1).\nAt the study level, risk of bias varied from low to high. Of the 40 studies, 57.5% were of a high risk of bias, 30.0% and 12.5% had low and unclear risk, respectively. We performed an additional assessment concerning the genetic association study indicating a good study design (Table 1). The robustness of evidence was extremely low to moderate based on GRADE scoring (Table 2).\nOverall, 14 studies assessed 15 hematopoietic parameters, the meta-analyses of four eligible parameters indicated significantly lower platelet counts in those who subsequently developed severe dengue than those who did not (n = 3671, SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.32; Fig 2). By contrast, there were no differences in leukocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts between those with and without severe dengue (S1, S2, and S3 Figs).\nOne study was an outlier [67]; the estimated effects remained unaltered after the sensitivity analysis. The red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nThirteen studies examined 18 biochemical markers. However, only four markers were eligible for meta-analysis, which showed significantly higher AST levels in severe dengue than in non-severe dengue (n = 3610, SMD 0.87, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; Fig 3). No relationship was found between the alteration of ALT, albumin, and sodium levels with severe dengue (S4, S5, and S6 Figs).\nOne study was an outlier [67]; the estimated effects remained unaltered after the sensitivity analysis. The red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nFour studies monitored a total of four clinical signs in connection with the progression of severe dengue. The meta-analyses revealed the association of the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and liver enlargement with the increased risk of severe dengue (n = 3384, lnOR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.80; n = 3405, lnOR 1.12, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.87; n = 1314, lnOR = 2.54, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.96, respectively; Figs 4, 5, and 6). No relationship between mucosal bleeding and severe dengue risk was detected within this study (S7 Fig).\nThe red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nThe red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nThe red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nSeven studies proposed 13 host cell structure-associated markers. We could only estimate the effects of one marker, hyaluronan, which demonstrated significantly higher levels in those who subsequently progressed to severe dengue (n = 211, SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.05; Fig 7).\nThe red dashed line represented the overall effect size.\nSeventeen studies reported the alterations of 25 immune mediators. Four eligible biomarkers, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3, found no significant variation in marker levels when comparing severe and non-severe dengue (S8\u2013S11 Figs).\nEight studies correlated either the quantity of virus or NS1 antigen in the bloodstream with severity levels. The estimated effect pooled from three studies found no association between viral load in the early stage and the subsequent progression of severe dengue (S12 Fig).\nAlthough statistical evidence implied the variation amongst the studies involving AST levels and platelet counts, the substantial heterogeneity ensued from the differences between small and large study effects rather than direction, which was apparent when we removed the most extensive study (Nguyen et al., 2016)\u2014as was the outlier here\u2014from the estimates (S13 and S14 Figs). On the other hand, other possible inconsistencies were not serious to compromise the estimated effects. In contrast, abdominal pain, vomiting, and enlarged liver showed low statistical heterogeneity despite the marked differences in the definition of severe outcomes.",
    "Discussion": "This review found 40 studies comparing 108 host and viral markers amongst patients with varying dengue severity, published from 1989 to September 2020. Our findings suggested that the alterations of platelet counts and AST levels within 72 hours of fever onset were associated with severe dengue development. Similarly, the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, liver enlargement and altered hyaluronan level were suggestive of the higher risk of severe dengue progression, but with exceptionally low robustness of the evidence.\nThrombocytopenia is commonly seen in dengue patients [84]. For this reason, platelet counts have long been used as a parameter to keep track of dengue progression. Our finding revealed an association between platelet counts and severe dengue, consistent with the previous systematic reviews [19,22], although we restricted the assessment to the first 72 hours following fever onset. The platelet decline occurs due to the massive activation of itself, apoptosis, and bone marrow hypoplasia, on which DENV initially has a direct or indirect impact [85\u201387]. In addition, the hyper-activated platelets, per se, could induce the extravasation by local secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as serotonin and VEGF [88,89].\nAs the findings have shown, AST level was significantly higher in severe than in non-severe patients during the early stage. Our analysis supported existing evidence of AST elevation in complicated dengue regardless of the time window [19,22,90,91]. Moreover, AST elevation alone was more indicative of systemic inflammation than hepatic injury, although DENV highly infects hepatocytes in the context of dengue tropism [92]. Generally, the elevation rate of AST is greater than that of ALT in dengue infection [93\u201397]. Wang et al., 2016 reported that 52% and 54% of mild and complicated dengue, respectively, demonstrated elevated ALT. When considering AST, these proportions increased to 75% and 80% [91]. The temporal change of liver transaminases begins early in the illness course, and elevations are significantly higher in severe dengue. Still, with moderate prediction power, especially in the case of ALT [62]. Instead, the combined index, such as AST2/ALT, could improve discriminative performance [98]. On this point, our finding was inconsistent with most previous systematic reviews in which the ALT level was significantly higher in severe dengue [12,19,22]. This could be attributed to the time window that we used\u2014the first 3 days versus 4 days or later in these studies\u2014which could be premature for the hepatocellular damage to be noted.\nWe observed the association between abdominal pain, vomiting, liver enlargement, and altered serum hyaluronan level with severe dengue progression. However, our findings were unable to firmly confer their benefits in clinical practice due to weak evidence. Alternatively, our study puts forward several points that medical care may find helpful.\nThe major inconsistency in our findings regarding clinical signs was the existence of different case classifications. Given that the updated WHO classification, which includes broader clinical outcomes, is more sensitive to detecting severe cases than the 1997 guideline [6,99], the estimated effect of the markers defined was larger. This was apparent when comparing the effects of abdominal pain between two large cohorts, Nguyen et al., 2016 versus Lam et al., 2017, corresponding to the 2009 versus 1997 WHO classification (Fig 4). In the same way, vomiting was assigned more weights in Nguyen et al., 2016 study than that by Lam et al., 2017, but as yet, the difference was weaker (Fig 5).\nFurther, at the outcome level, bias and inconsistency may arise from the measurements of abdominal pain and vomiting. The effects could vary in terms of a \u201cdose-response\u201d relationship\u2014referring to the resulting progressions of different clinical manifestations. Regarding vomiting, Vuong et al., 2016 suggested two episodes per day to predict severe dengue in general [80]; another study proposed three times per day associated with plasma leak [100]. Next, many causes explain the acute abdominal pain in dengue, from non-specific to the more specific causes such as hepatitis, acalculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or several unusual causes [101\u2013104], still having been merely referred to as \u201cabdominal pain\u201d. It is clear that individuals who have a greater number of vomiting episodes are more likely to experience complicated dengue, and different clinical manifestations could speak to the different progressions. As such, vomiting and abdominal pain fulfill their prognostic tasks, but not optimally relax case-management pressure when using these signs\u2014which ignores the beneficial cutoffs or hallmarks\u2014goes with the umbrella admission. It also underscores the need to properly report clinical signs, featuring how the symptoms manifest\u2014rather than whether they do present\u2014in association with severe dengue.\nThere was evidence that hepatomegaly is more prevalent in complicated dengue [14,22,105\u2013107]. Liver enlargement occurred in 1.0\u201334.6% of dengue infected adults [78,97,108\u2013112]. The rate was even higher in children, 43.0\u201397.4% [107,110,113\u2013119]. Nevertheless, the hepatomegaly rate was lower than expected in our study, despite the vast majority of participants being under 15 years old. One ultrasound study reported that 21.8% of children had an enlarged liver in the first 3 days of fever onset [120]. Based on this scenario, the optimal information size is approximately 300 events in total sample size, at the power of 80% and confidence level of 95%, to capture the real effects [34]. In comparison, the number of events in our analysis was shorter than the required size to provoke a precise point estimate. Despite this, the finding was consistent, underpinning the unclear liver involvement at the early stage of dengue infection\u2014as no evidence of the substantial ALT and albumin differences between the clinical severities during this period.\nThe modest detection rate of hepatomegaly may require a re-evaluation of ultrasound benefits in the early stage, despite its proficiency in identifying sophisticated disturbances undetectable by physical examinations. Only few patients who subsequently developed complicated dengue exhibited fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity and peritoneal recesses (rectovesical pouch or pouch of Douglas), were reported during the first 72 hours of fever onset [121]. Gallbladder wall abnormalities became detectable on days 3\u20138 of the disease course [120\u2013125]. Overall, the relationship between plasma leak signs\u2014detected by ultrasound\u2014and complicated dengue is undeniable. However, the sonographic hallmarks allow for reliable prediction mostly around the critical phase or later [121]. The plausible explanation, supported by Srikiatkhachorn et al., 2007, is that ultrasound requires a significant fluid accumulation to detect the differences. For this reason, although the differences between severe and non-severe dengue were detected during the first 3 days, a high false-negative prediction rate may occur. This explained the relatively low event rates in our study and the previous ones. To the best of our knowledge and as observed throughout this project, no evidence ascertains the performance of individual plasma leak signs by ultrasound during the first 72 hours of fever onset. The recent systematic review provided the broad landscape demonstrating a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity alongside the late presence of sonography signs or unclear measurement time [126].\nHyaluronan is the structural component maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix in connective tissues [127]. Hyaluronan increases during the inflammatory responses, reflecting the de novo synthesis and perturbed degradation that leads to its accumulation in the circulation [128]. However, few studies advance hyaluronan to explain dengue infection pathogenesis. Honsawek et al., 2007 first demonstrated the significantly increased hyaluronan level in children with DSS during the acute stage defined as days 3\u20137 [129]. Other studies noticed no differences in hyaluronan level between DHF and DF on day 3 of fever onset [77,130]. The different time windows and insufficient sample size appeared to render the inharmonious conclusions. Thus, further studies with a larger size are needed to explore this association.\nThis study also has several limitations. First, the restrictive time window and \u201csevere outcome\u201d definitions yielded few studies as well as participants, which impacted in the capturing of the markers. Second, lacking data from Latin America and Africa\u2014the frequent or continuous dengue risk areas\u2014diminished our conclusions on the markers for these sites. Third, given that dengue patients reach the clinical outcomes do so by the multifactorial interactions, immune status and viral factors probably introduced noise into the findings. Nevertheless, such information was not always explicitly described for examining its potential impact on the inferences.\nIn conclusion, our review highlights the topics which merit further consideration. First, although the early alterations of platelets and AST levels indicate a higher risk of severe dengue development, these indicators require establishing quantitative diagnostic values and additional validation through prospective studies. Finally, decreased platelet counts in the first 72 hours could serve as an independent warning sign, instead of combining with elevated hematocrit detectable when plasma leak has implicitly occurred, often on day 3 or around the critical phase [61,74,131\u2013133]."
