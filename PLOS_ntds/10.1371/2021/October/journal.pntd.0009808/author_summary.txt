The major concern in dengue fever is the abrupt occurrence of severe complications, for which only close monitoring of patients is the treatment scheme. Thus, the markers managing to predict the subsequent progression of complications—in the early stage of disease course—could alleviate the clinical management burden. Ideally, the predictors foretell the outcomes before the severe complications occur—usually on days 4–7 following fever onset. In this study, therefore, we reviewed the available markers collected during the first 3 days of fever onset. We found robust evidence of significantly lower platelet counts and higher AST levels in those who subsequently developed severe dengue than those who did not. In this regard, platelet count could serve as an independent warning sign rather than combining with hematocrit—as seen in the current classification—which remains unaltered during this time window. Also, abdominal pain and vomiting could predict the outcomes, but using these signs is arduous when their manifestations vary as per the patient without cutoffs. Hepatomegaly rate is substantially higher in severe dengue, but likely yields a high false-negative prediction rate. There is a need for larger studies to confirm the relatedness of hyaluronan in severe dengue.
