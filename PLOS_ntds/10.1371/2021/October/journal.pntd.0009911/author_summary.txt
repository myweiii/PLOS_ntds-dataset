The mosquitoes Aedes albopictus, Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, Culex pipiens and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus are native to China and the major vectors in the transmission of arboviruses, protozoans and nematodes. Recently, an innovative biocontrol strategy has been developed and evaluated based on the ability of Wolbachia to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), as well as interfere with the infection and replication of pathogens. Since the ability to induce CI largely depends on the density and diversity of Wolbachia, we investigated and characterized the natural infection of Wolbachia in above-mentioned five species of field-collected mosquitoes in 25 provinces of China. The results showed that the positive rates of Wolbachia infection were high in mosquitoes of Ae. albopictus, Ar. subalbatus and Cx. pipiens in large-scale regions of China and low in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Guizhou province. Phylogenetic analysis based on Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene and five multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci indicated the high polymorphism of Wolbachia in Ae. albopictus, and low polymorphisms in Ar. subalbatus and Cx. pipiens. This finding contributes to the understanding of the nationwide distribution of Wolbachia and the potential application of this biocontrol strategy in China.
