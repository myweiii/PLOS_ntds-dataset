Detection of the snake species responsible for the envenomation in a victim is crucial for clinical and forensic management of poisoning cases. Polyvalent antivenom therapy can seldom lead to immunological complications manifested in the form of symptoms ranging from serum sickness to myalgia. Use of monovalent antivenom therapy is being recommended for targeted venom neutralization in envenomed individuals with minimum side effects. Moreover, the development of field applicable venom detection devices is the need of the hour for enabling orderly detection of poisoning cases at the crime scene, besides testing for illegal trade of snake parts, including venom, protected under the Wildlife Act. The monovalent antivenom therapy and the field level detection of venom conducive to adequate crime scene management is limited by the tools available for species or family-specific identification of the venom under question. For differential detection of the Elapids of the big four snakes from the Viperidae, we have developed a monoclonal antibody-based lateral flow assay kit using recombinant Cytotoxin– 7 protein. The limit of quantitation for the detection of venoms of N. naja and B. caeruleus was ascertained to be 170 pg/μL and 2.1 ng/ μL in spiked buffer samples and 28.7 ng/ μL and 110 ng/ μL in spiked serum samples, respectively. Thus, the kit can effectively detect the venoms of elapids of the big four snakes in both simple and complex matrices of the samples and can be adapted for its use in differential diagnosis.
