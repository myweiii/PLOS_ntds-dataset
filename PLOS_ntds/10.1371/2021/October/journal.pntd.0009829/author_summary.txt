In Africa, dengue viruses 1 to 4 are transmitted to primates by Aedes mosquitoes in a sylvatic cycle or an urban/epidemic cycle involving humans. Infection in humans may be asymptomatic or may range from mild flu-like illness to severe hemorrhagic fever. The dengue viruses have a pantropical distribution, mostly in urbanized areas where vectors have become well adapted. This report shows dengue can also emerge in desert areas, as seen for the first time in an outbreak in 2014 in Nouakchott, Mauritania, where climatic, environmental, and human behavioral changes favor the emergence of Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue virus 2 was found in multiple human samples collected during the outbreak. Genomic analysis of dengue virus 2 isolates from the Mauritanian outbreak and from infected travelers revealed the rapid emergence of a specific “West African epidemic strain” of the virus throughout West Africa during the last decade, which is distinct from other strains found elsewhere and from historical or sylvatic strains. More genomic data would help us understand the circulation of dengue virus in West Africa, to help forecast and mitigate outbreaks in this region.
