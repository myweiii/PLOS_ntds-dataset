Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect marginalised and underserved populations with sub-national levels providing first contact healthcare services to the afflicted communities. NTDs amenable to chemoprophylaxis are primarily controlled through mass treatment interventions. However, identification of disease transmission hotspots requires strengthened health information systems (HIS) to inform targeted public health action and response. Using a multi-phased approach, we developed and validated a framework, which provided a logical approach for guiding actions to strengthen surveillance system functions in view of NTDs. Framework development involved undertaking a systematic literature review to retrieve generalised recommendations for improving surveillance system functions within the African context, conducting primary data surveys to identify disease-specific recommendations on improving surveillance system core, support and attribute functions regarding NTDs and determining feasibility for implementing recommended actions at the sub-national levels. A review of relevant conceptual frameworks provided information underpinning overall framework development. The study identified framework component interlinkages to achieve the desired results of reduced costs for implementing treatment interventions, halted disease transmission and reduced disease burden. Overall, the framework provides a logical approach for strengthening HIS at sub-national levels in NTD endemic regions, considering stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives and the available resources to achieve the ultimate goal of disease elimination.
