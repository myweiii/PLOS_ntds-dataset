Billions of people are infected with parasitic helminths across the globe, especially in resource poor regions. These infections can result in severe developmental delay, disability, and death. Adequate management of helminth infection would benefit from the identification of host biomarkers in easily obtained samples (e.g. serum or urine) that correlate to infection state. Our goal was to determine if specific proteins involved in tissue repair and immune modulation are altered by infection with specific helminth species in Brazil (hookworm and S. mansoni species of blood fluke) or Nigeria (S. haematobium species of blood fluke). One of these proteins, Trefoil Factor 2 (TFF2), was elevated in the serum of hookworm infected women from Brazil, while another, TFF3 is higher in women than men, but also increased by S. mansoni blood fluke infection. In contrast, both TFFs were decreased in the serum of Nigerian children infected by S. haematobium, while many pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in the urine, where the eggs emerge from host tissue.
