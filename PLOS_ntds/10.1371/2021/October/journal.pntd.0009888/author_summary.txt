More than 500 million children worldwide receive a single oral dose of albendazole or mebendazole annually to reduce disease caused by intestinal worms (roundworm, whipworm and hookworm). However, it is unclear whether individuals respond differently to treatment. We re-analyzed 645 individual patient data from three standardized clinical trials with albendazole using a statistical method and explored how drug responses among individuals from study sites with different prior rounds of drug distribution. We found that individualsâ€™ responses were worse when drug pressure and infection intensity were greater. Individual age and sex also affected the response, but these were often of negligible clinical significance and not consistent across worm species and study sites. We confirmed that albendazole is ineffective against whipworm on Pemba Island, but given the high intensity of infection at this study side, it remains unclear whether this treatment failure is explained by high drug pressure (and emerging anthelmintic resistance) or high infection intensity. Nevertheless, our results indicate that alternative treatment regimens are required to control intestinal worms in Pemba Island.
