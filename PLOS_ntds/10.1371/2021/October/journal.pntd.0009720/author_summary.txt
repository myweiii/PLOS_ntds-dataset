Malaria is caused by five species of parasites; of these Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax cause the majority of global morbidity and mortality. Plasmodium vivax infection is an emerging public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, including Sudan. Primaquine and other 8-aminoquinolines including tafenoquine are the primary treatments to target the silent liver stage (hypnozoites) in P. vivax infections. However, these regimens can cause severe intravascular hemolysis in patients suffering from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd). To support safe and efficacious use of primaquine, and potentially tafenoquine in Sudan, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of G6PDd across two sites in Sudan using spectrophotometry and a qualitative CareStart rapid diagnostic test. Subsequent genetic analysis by PCR/RFLP and sequencing of G6PD genetic variants was performed. This survey found an overall prevalence was 5.5% (27/491; 30% of adjusted male median, AMM), and 27.3% (134/491; 70% of AMM) and 13.1% (64/490) by qualitative CareStart rapid diagnostic test. Important differences in distribution of genetic variants of G6PD were found across the two sites, and the African A- was not observed. In univariate analysis a few parameters showed significant association with G6PD deficiency. In conclusion the prevalence of G6PDd was low to moderate but heterogonous, and the first-generation qualitative CareStart rapid diagnostic test showed moderate performance in both males and females.
