Malaria still poses as one of the most important parasitic diseases in the world. The advance of molecular diagnosis brought to light the existence of asymptomatic infections, which may represent most of the infections in some areas. Importantly, the role of asymptomatic carriers in the natural history of malaria is not completely understood. Herein we describe the general characteristics of asymptomatic individuals infected with Plasmodium vivax, and provide evidence of their potential as parasitic reservoirs, even when molecular methods fail to detect the infection. Our findings reinforce the need for better diagnostic tests and open a new window of complexity to be considered in control programs.
