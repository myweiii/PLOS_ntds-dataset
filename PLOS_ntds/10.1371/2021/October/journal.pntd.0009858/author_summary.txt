Scrub typhus is a febrile illness most commonly found in rural tropical areas. It is caused by a Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Rickettsiaceae and transmitted by mites when they feed on vertebrates. There is an estimate of one million cases annually, with an estimated one billion people at risk, mostly in Asia-Oceania. But relative to the scale of the problem, scrub typhus is largely understudied. Evidence-based treatment recommendations by policymakers vary or are non-existent. We searched databases and registries for prospective scrub typhus clinical treatment studies published from 1998 to 2020 and reviewed them. Data from clinical trials and particularly for specific groups, such as pregnant women and children, were minimal. The methods used to measure treatment efficacy were heterogeneous, making it difficult to directly compare or conduct a meta-analysis based on aggregated data. One way to improve the current level of evidence would be by pooling and analysing individual participant-level data (IPD), i.e. the raw data from individual participants in completed studies. This review demonstrated that there is scope for developing a database for individual participant data to enable more detailed analyses. IPD meta-analyses could be a way to address knowledge gaps such as optimum dosing for children and pregnant women.
