China has achieved the goal of leprosy elimination established by the WHO. The overall incidence and prevalence rates of leprosy indicate a low endemic level in China. However, there are still specific areas with leprosy transmission in some parts of China, especially Yunnan Province. This study aimed to reveal the epidemic state and identify spatial and spatiotemporal clusters of leprosy in Yunnan, China, from 2011â€“2020. A total of 1907 newly detected cases were identified; 67.07% were MB and 32.93% were PB leprosy cases. Males were predominant (66.07%), 17.99% of patients presented with G2D, and 2.83% of patients were under 15 years old. Performed with ArcGIS 10.6.1, GeoDa 1.8.8, and SaTScan 9.4.3 software, three significant spatial clusters (hot spots) and three significant spatiotemporal clusters (high-risk areas) were observed. These results highlight the at-risk areas for prioritization and further intervention.
