Vector-transmitted human diseases, such as dengue fever, represent serious global health burdens. Pyrethroids, including transfluthrin, are widely used as insecticides and repellents due to their low mammalian toxicity and relatively benign environmental impact. Pyrethroids target voltage-gated sodium channels for their insecticidal action. However, the mechanism of pyrethroid repellency remains unclear and controversial. Insect repellency is traditionally thought to be mediated by olfactory receptors. We made two important discoveries in this study, showing that transfluthrin repellency is via activation of sodium channels and transfluthrin enhances DEET repellency. Discovery of sodium channel activation as a major mechanism of pyrethroid repellency has broad significance in insect olfaction study, repellents development, and control of human disease vectors.
