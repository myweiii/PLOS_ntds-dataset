Diagnosis of schistosomiasis has relied on the Kato-Katz technique which remains challenging due to its low sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, the Point-of-care-Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) test has been developed to detect CCA produced by adult living worm. However, this test is sold for qualitative use only because it is difficult to estimate the intensity of the positive band by eye. This study was designed with the aim of comparing the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infections by KK and POC-CCA and quantifying under field conditions on fresh and frozen (<-20°C) urine samples, CCA using the visual scores and the ESEquant LR3 reader. We conducted the KK and POC-CCA tests on stool and urine samples collected from SAC (5 to 4 years) in Makenene, Cameroon. Our results showed discrepancies between results from KK and POC-CCA test. The numerical values generated by the reader made it possible to avoid subjective visual interpretation of POC-CCA results. This study also identified children with high levels of CCA in their urine but without schistosome eggs in their stools. The good correlation observed between results obtained on fresh and frozen urine samples confirmed that POC-CCA test can be used on samples stored for one year at -20° C.
