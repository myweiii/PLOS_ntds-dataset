Members of the United Nations agreed on a goal of eliminating dog-mediated rabies by 2030. To achieve this goal, China and other endemic rabies countries will need to increase dog rabies vaccination coverage as well as ensure proper administration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for patients with animal wounds. PEP includes wound washing, timely vaccination, and rabies immune globulin (RIG) according to the type and severity of patientsâ€™ wounds. The authors conducted an observational assessment of PEP clinics in a high-risk county in Hunan Province. Most patients at these clinics received PEP according to the national guidelines; however, certain patients received PEP, when not warranted, and others did not receive RIG, as recommended for severe animal wounds. Wound type categorization and corresponding use of PEP were most accurate at the single urban clinic and least accurate at the rural clinics in the project county. RIG was only available at the single urban clinic. These findings highlight the importance of improving the use of PEP and access to RIG, particularly in rural areas, and exploring the use of risk-based approaches for evaluating human rabies virus exposures. These steps can contribute to eliminating dog-mediated rabies in the project county as well as elsewhere in China.
