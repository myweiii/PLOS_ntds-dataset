We greatly appreciate the time and commitment of the rabies PEP clinic staff in county A who participated in this project and provided important feedback to the project team on challenges and opportunities for improving PEP services. We also thank Lance Owen at the US CDC for developing the map in Fig 1 and Yishan Chen at China CDC for her contribution in translating the protocol.
