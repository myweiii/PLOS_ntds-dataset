The global eradication effort for Guinea worm disease has dramatically decreased the global burden of the disease and enabled 187 countries to be certified by the World Health Organization to be free of endemic transmission. Despite this progress, several countries continue to have endemic transmission. In Chad, a long absence of reported cases was interrupted with the identification of new Guinea worm cases, prompting a substantial scale up of surveillance and intervention efforts. Here, we study the value of increasing genomic surveillance as a tool for programmatic evaluation of surveillance and intervention efforts in Chad. Linking surveillance and genomic samples, parsimonious spatial models help reveal a consistent geographic clustering of similar genetic sequences across Chad. We also demonstrate that expanding the sequencing can offer better resolution for distinguishing Guinea worm samples. In this retrospective study, we found evidence that scaling up genomic surveillance can be an important monitoring and evaluation tool for the eradication program in Chad.
