Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in an intense inflammatory response that is dependent on several immune mediators. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, an interaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and M. leprae infection has been considered a possibility. Protective effects of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and clofazimine and dapsone treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. Patients at risk for leprosy represent an interesting model for assessing the effects of these therapies on the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. We assessed the influence of leprosy-related variables in the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. We performed a 14-month study. Among the 406 included patients, 113 were diagnosed with leprosy. During follow-up, 69 (16.99%) patients contracted COVID-19. Our analysis showed that only COVID-19-positive household contacts and diabetes mellitus were significant risk factors for COVID-19. Leprosy patients are vulnerable to COVID-19 because they have more frequent contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, possibly due to social and economic limitations. Our model showed that the use of clofazimine or dapsone or BCG vaccination did not affect the occurrence or severity of COVID-19.
