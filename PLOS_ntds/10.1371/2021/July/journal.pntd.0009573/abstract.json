    "Introduction": "Acute Q fever is endemic in Israel, yet the clinical and laboratory picture is poorly defined.",
    "Methods": "A retrospective study reviewing the medical records of acute Q fever patients, conducted in a single hospital in the Sharon district, Israel. Serum samples from suspected cases were preliminary tested by a qualitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Confirmatory testing at the reference laboratory used an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Positive cases were defined as fever with at least one other symptom and accepted laboratory criteria such as a single-phase II immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer â‰¥1:200. Cases not fulfilling these criteria and in which acute Q fever was excluded, served as a control group.",
    "Results": "Between January 2012 and May 2018, 484 patients tested positive. After confirmatory testing, 65 (13.4%) were positive for acute Q fever (with requisite clinical picture), 171 (35.3%) were definitely not infected, the remaining 248 were excluded because of past/chronic/undetermined infection. The average age was 58 years and 66% were males. Most resided in urban areas with rare animal exposure. Pneumonia was seen in 57% of cases and a combination with headache/hepatitis was highly suggestive of acute Q fever diagnosis. Syncope/presyncope, fall and arthritis were more common in acute Q fever cases. Laboratory indexes were similar to the control group, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) which was more common and higher in the study group.",
    "Conclusion": "Acute Q fever in the Sharon district could be better diagnosed by using a syndromic approach in combination with improved rapid diagnostic testing."
