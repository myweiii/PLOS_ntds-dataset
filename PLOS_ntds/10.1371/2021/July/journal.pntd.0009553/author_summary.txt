Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is a mosquito-borne virus (arbovirus) classified into the California serogroup. JCV is distributed widely throughout North America and is considered one of the potentially re-emerging viruses due to the recent spurt in JCV cases in the region. JCV infection often leads to an acute febrile illness, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis mainly among adults. Currently, no antiviral therapy against JCV is approved. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir (FPV), ribavirin (RBV), and 2’-fluoro-2’-deoxycytidine (2’-FdC) against JCV infection in cultured cells and mice. As a result, FPV, RBV, and 2’-FdC effectively inhibited JCV replication in Vero and Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, FPV delayed the onset of neurological symptoms in mice intracerebrally inoculated with JCV. Notably, although most patients infected with JCV do not present severe disease, neuroinvasive cases are not rare and may result in residual neurological sequelae such as persisting cognitive deficits. Therefore, this study contributes to the development of a specific antiviral treatment for patients with JCV infection.
