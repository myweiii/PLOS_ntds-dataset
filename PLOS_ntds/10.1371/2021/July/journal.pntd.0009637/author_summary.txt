Wolbachia are widespread endosymbiotic bacteria of insects that cause Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking (WMPB) and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The latter mediated by cif genes localized in the prophage WO region. Because of that, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are currently being used in field to fight the transmission of vector-borne viruses such as Dengue (DENV) to human populations. Aided by a previous artificial selection experiment that generated lines with variable (High and Low) DENV blocking strength, we tested for a potential link between WMPB and phage WO. There was no evidence that Wolbachia nor phage WO densities predict DENV blocking strength. However, we found that the Low blocking line had reduced phage WO density, and lower expression of the cif genes in a tissue-specific manner. We demonstrate that in addition to previous report of reduced fitness, the Low blocking line also exhibited increased frequency of potential deleterious SNPs on chromosome 1. Our hypotheses are that reduction in phage WO may have resulted from changes in the loci directly under selection for blocking, or by linkage disequilibrium events linked to the accumulation of mosquito predicted deleterious alleles. Our results highlight the importance of chromosome 1 for WMPB and its potential impact for other Wolbachia-associated factors like phage WO.
