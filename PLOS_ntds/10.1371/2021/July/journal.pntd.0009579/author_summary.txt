Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease in the southern cone countries of South America. A number of sylvatic species of triatomines have been reported dispersing actively into man-made habitats. The study of the ecological mechanisms associated with the active dispersion of sylvatic triatomines into domestic environments becomes relevant in terms of the potential risk of T. cruzi introduction from the wild cycle into the domestic transmission cycle. Anthropic modification of the landscape is mentioned as one of the possible causes of the increase in the active dispersion, due to the negative impact of habitat fragmentation on the availability of food sources (populations of birds and mammals) and wild ecotopes for sylvatic triatomines. Before the present study there have been no evidences testing this hypothesis. Previous authors focused on determining the effect of environmental disturbance considering one geographical scale. In this article we describe the occurrence and frequency of sylvatic triatomines invasion into rural houses, and discuss the effect of habitat fragmentation considering a multiple landscape-scale approach. This approach allowed testing the effect of compositional and configurational landscape properties around the house and environmental anthropic disturbance, among other ecological factors.
