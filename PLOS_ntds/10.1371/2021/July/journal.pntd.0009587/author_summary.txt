Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes provoke diseases in hundreds of million people yearly. The massive use of neurotoxic insecticides caused the emergence and dispersion of mosquito resistant populations, reducing the available options for vector control. In this context, the implementation of alternative methods is urgent. In order to take full advantage of natural compounds with larvicidal activity, a better understanding of their mode of action and detoxification in Ae. aegypti larva is necessary. Here, we used transcriptomic and bioinformatic approaches to study the detoxificant response in Ae. aegypti larvae exposed to an Eucalyptus camaldulensis-derived larvicide. Our results revealed a conserved transcriptomic response respect to the intoxication with different xenobiotics. Also, the results suggest an involvement of chemosensory proteins in detoxification. Understanding the mode of detoxification of Eucalyptus distilled compounds could contribute to their use in vector control campaigns.
