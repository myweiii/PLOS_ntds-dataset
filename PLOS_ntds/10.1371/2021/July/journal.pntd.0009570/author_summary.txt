American trypanosomiasis, an infection affecting more than 7 million people, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, a mammal-specific protozoan transmitted to humans by kissing-bugs. The sylvatic cycle of this parasite is exceptional in that both parasite and invertebrate hosts are not specialized, being able to infect a wide range of mammals and feed on an even wider range of vertebrates, respectively. This complex scenario allows parasites to find diverse transmission pathways, as mammal hosts become infected by ingesting infected mammals or bugs, or by mucosal/skin contact with infected bug feces. Most human cases are due to the latter pathway, but human oral infection is relatively frequent and triggers a very aggressive acute phase that can be lethal. The manipulation of intermediate host behavior by parasites is a frequent mechanism promoting host predation and, which in turn induces parasite transmission to final hosts. Even though the oral route is probably the most important means of T. cruzi transmission in sylvatic environments, the induction of bug predation by behavioral manipulation has not been tested so far. Our study presents clear evidence showing that T. cruzi promotes higher risk taking in infected bugs, which in its turn induces increased predation rates on them. Interestingly, this impact is not attained by increasing bug foraging activity, but mostly through promoting specifically risky behavior when approaching the host. We suggest that this is a form of behavioral manipulation that evolved because it promotes increased parasite circulation between bugs and mammals.
