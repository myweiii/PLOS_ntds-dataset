    "Background": "The leishmaniases are a group of sandfly-transmitted diseases caused by species of the protozoan parasite, Leishmania. With an annual incidence of 1 million cases, 1 billion people living in Leishmania-endemic regions, and nearly 30,000 deaths each year, leishmaniasis is a major global public health concern. While phlebotomine sandflies are well-known as vectors of Leishmania, they are also the vectors of various phleboviruses, including Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus (SFSV).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In vitro, we observed modulation by SFSV in MAP kinase signaling as well as in the IRF3 pathway that resulted in a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, we found that SFSV and L. major co-infection resulted in an exacerbation of leishmaniasis in vivo, and by using endosomal (Toll-like receptor) TLR3, and MAVS knock-out mice, deduced that SFSVâ€™s hyperinflammatory effect was TLR3- and MAVS-dependent. Critically, we observed that L. major and SFSV co-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated significantly higher parasite burden than mice solely infected with L. major. Furthermore, viral presence increased leukocyte influx in vivo. This influx was accompanied by elevated total extracellular vesicle numbers. Interestingly, L. major displayed higher infectiveness with coincident phleboviral infection compared to L. major infection alone.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Overall our work represents novel findings that contribute towards understanding the causal mechanisms governing cutaneous leishmaniasis pathology. Better comprehension of the potential role of viral co-infection could lead to treatment regimens with enhanced effectiveness."
