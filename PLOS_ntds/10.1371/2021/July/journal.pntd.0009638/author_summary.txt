The leishmaniases are a group of chronic infectious diseases caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. The disease poses a great public health risk; millions of people are affected annually. In addition, leishmaniasis is characterized by widely varying clinical manifestations, for which the cause is still unknown. Parasites of the genus Leishmania are the ethological agents of the disease and are vectored by phlebotomine sandflies.
While examining sections of the sandfly midgut, we noted viral entities, later identified as phleboviruses. Interestingly, there is a large overlap in the geographic distribution of L. major and Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus (SFSV); this led us to hypothesize that viral presence could influence disease severity. With the use of various wild-type and knock-out mouse models, we deduced that co-infection with SFSV indeed affected disease severity, leading to exacerbated skin lesions and higher parasite numbers. However, this was not paralleled by the modulation of immunomodulatory molecules. Our findings demonstrate that viral presence may facilitate parasite entry into host cells.
Overall, our research constitutes novel findings that contribute toward a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying leishmaniasis infections.
