The author is pleased to acknowledge with gratitude, all individuals and institutions who tirelessly contributed to the success of the mapping to assess the endemicity status of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases. This includes Ministry of Health and Social Welfare management and all the mapping teams, and their supervisors. Our sincere appreciation to The Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education for allowing us to carry out this exercise in their institutions. Finally, we express our appreciation and thanks to Mr. Lamin E. Manneh and Dr. Claire Scantlebury for their time and effort in proofreading the manuscript.
