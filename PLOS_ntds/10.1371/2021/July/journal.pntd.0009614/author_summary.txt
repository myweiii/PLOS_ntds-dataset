Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. Due to the limited mobility of the mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus, human mobility is a key variable to understanding the spread of dengue through a population. Recently it was shown that individuals with symptomatic dengue have significantly reduced mobility patterns. To better understand how dengue illness affects the behavior of visitors and caregivers, we examined the nature and frequency of a symptomatic individual’s social contacts to determine if their behaviors changed due to social distancing or caregiving. While many participants had a drop off in visitor frequency when ill, almost all participants received help from their housemates. These caregivers were most likely to have their work impacted when helping participants whose quality of life was most negatively affected by illness. We quantified how often these behavioral changes had a discernable effect on the social contact’s mobility patterns. Accounting for mobility changes by social contacts provides a more accurate understanding of infection risk and potential for virus spread through a population. Dengue transmission models that incorporate mobility changes of symptomatic individuals and their social contacts will add currently missing epidemiologically relevant detail for evaluating different disease prevention strategies.
