We conducted a prospective, observational longitudinal study of Malawian children 2â€“24 months hospitalized with diarrhea. NP swabs, induced sputum and stool specimens were collected. Participants that were positive by Cryptosporidium PCR in any of the three compartments were followed up with fortnightly visits up to 8 weeks post-enrollment. Cryptosporidium was detected by PCR in 21%, 7% and 3% in stool, sputum and nasopharynx of children hospitalized with diarrhea. Of those positive at enrollment, detection was noted in 44%, 20%, and 8%, respectively, by 8 weeks post-enrollment.
