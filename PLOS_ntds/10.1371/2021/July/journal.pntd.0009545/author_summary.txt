This is the first community-based study investigating the prevalence and associated risk factors of Leishmania infection among immunocompetent individuals, demonstrating the situation of Leishmania infection in endemic areas of Thailand. An outbreak investigation and a cross-sectional study were conducted following one index case of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. martiniquensis in an immunocompetent male patient reported in August 2015, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Of 392 participants, 28 (7.1%) were positive for Leishmania infection of which 1 (4.8%) was L. martiniquensis, 12 (57.1%) were L. orientalis and 8 (38.1%) were Leishmania spp. The factors associated with Leishmania infection included being female, increasing age, having an animal enclosure in a housing area, being exposed to termite mounds and having domestic animals in a housing area. This information revealed the first burden and risk factors of Leishmania infection among immunocompetent individuals in Thailand and highlighted the urgent need for effective interventions to prevent and control the disease in high risk populations in endemic areas.
