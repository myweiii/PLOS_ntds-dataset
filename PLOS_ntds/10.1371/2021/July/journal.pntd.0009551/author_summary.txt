Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) elicits adaptive immunological responses, including immunoglobulins A, M, and G and neutralising antibodies. Neutralising antibodies are considered markers of functional immunity and protection. However, not all individuals with proven infections have detectable neutralising antibodies. In this systematic review, we investigated the proportion of individuals with former SARS-CoV-2 infections who develop neutralising antibodies, whether their titres vary with disease severity, and their correlation with Immunoglobulin G. We found that approximately 85% of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have detectable neutralising antibodies. This proportion was higher among patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 19 and lower in asymptomatic infections. The variation across studies reflected the wide range of methods used to measure both immunoglobulins and neutralising antibodies, and highlight the need for an international reference standard to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
