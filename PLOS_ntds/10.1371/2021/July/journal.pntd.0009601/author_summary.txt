Mosquito control interventions are widely used to reduce mosquito-borne diseases, but it is unclear what combination of interventions are most effective in reducing human disease. Given the wide range of mosquito species and the diseases they transmit, different interventions strategies have been implemented across many regions globally, with varying degrees of success. This literature review identified three intervention studies which did not include non-targeted use of insecticide and were associated with statistically significant reductions in the disease of interest and in entomological indicators following the intervention. High community engagement is vital for the success of a cluster randomised control study aiming to reduce mosquito-borne disease with a mosquito control intervention, such as breeding source reduction for Aedes control. In two studies, large buffer zones reduced contamination between study intervention and control arms. Differences between the study arms were reduced through increasing study cluster numbers, cluster matching and randomisation. Regular administration of larvicide to potential breeding sites that are unsuitable for source reduction may supplement this intervention strategy.
