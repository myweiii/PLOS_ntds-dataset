Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum. In the Western Mediterranean basin, Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi are the main vectors of L. infantum, and dogs are the main reservoir host of the parasite. In Northern Africa, ZVL affect mostly children less than 5 years. Understanding the chemical ecology governing the relationships between the vector, the parasite and the reservoir host is of major epidemiological importance. Previous studies based on rodent models have shown that the infection with L. infantum enhanced the attractiveness towards Lutzomyia longipaplis, the main vector of ZVL in the Americas. In this study, we reported for the first time that infected dogs are highly attractive to both male and female P. perniciosus under laboratory and filed conditions compared to uninfected dogs. Similar patterns were observed with wild populations of P. perfiliewi. Our results provided strong evidence that the parasite manipulate the reservoir hosts to enhance its transmission success by the vector.
