In sub-Saharan Africa, human schistosomiasis is a neglected disease of public health concern caused mostly by Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni. The overlapping range of both species in Africa considerably increases the chance of co-infection. School-aged children are the most vulnerable, as they participate in water contact activities that expose them to free-swimming cercariae released by infected snail species in freshwater. This study examined the probable mixed human Schistosoma infections and associated disease variables in school children in the communities of Ilie and Ore in southwest Nigeria. This study reveals a high prevalence of mixed S. haematobium and S. mansoni, and ectopic S. mansoni eggs (S. mansoni eggs in urine) elimination, highlighting the possible ongoing control challenges in this area. Furthermore, this study indicates that some form of inter-specific interaction exists between S. haematobium and S. mansoni, and may produce potentially significant consequences for developing morbidity in the study areas.
