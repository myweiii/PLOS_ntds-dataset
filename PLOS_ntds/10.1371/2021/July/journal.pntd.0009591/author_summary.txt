In recent months’ variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have more mutations on the Spike protein has brought concern all over the world. These have been called ‘variants of concern’ (VOC) as it has been suggested that their genome mutations might impact transmission, immune control, and virulence. The P.1 variant, also known as 20J/501Y.V3, was first identified in travelers from Brazil during routine airport screening in Tokyo, Japan, in early January 2021. This VOC has 17 amino acid changes, ten of which are in its spike protein, including three designated to be of particular concern: N501Y, E484K and K417T. Since its first detection, despite it has presented sustained transmission worldwide, much is still unknown about its circulation into Brazilian regions. Here, through an active monitoring conducted by public health authorities of the Bahia state (Northeast Brazil), we report genetic evidence for circulation of the P.1 variant into the state. Our findings reinforce that continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to assist in the monitoring and understanding of the circulating and co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, which might help to attenuate their public health impact worldwide.
