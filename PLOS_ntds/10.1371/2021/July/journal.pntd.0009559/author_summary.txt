Human infections with the virus HTLV-1 and the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis are co-endemic throughout much of their worldwide ranges resulting in a significant incidence of coinfection. The coincident infections result in S. stercoralis hyperinfection and an alteration of the balance of the immune responses to the virus and to the worm. In this study, a novel model of HTLV-1 and S. stercoralis coinfection was established in humanized mice. Mortality was increased in the HTLV-1 and coinfected animals as compared to the S. stercoralis infected group. Analysis of cytokine profiles showed a distinct shift towards Th1 responses in HTLV-1 infected animals, a shift towards Th2 cytokines in S. stercoralis infected animals and elevated TNF-Î± responses in coinfected animals. Numbers of worms in the coinfection group did not differ from those of the S. stercoralis infected group, however, infective larvae recovered from the coinfection group showed a significant enhancement in growth. Humanized mice coinfected with S. stercoralis and HTLV-1 demonstrate features associated with human infection with these pathogens and provide a unique opportunity to study the interaction between these two infections.
