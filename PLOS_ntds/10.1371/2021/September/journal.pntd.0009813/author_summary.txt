Ticks are one of the important vectors and reservoirs of multiple pathogens infecting humans and animals such as bacteria, protozoans, viruses, and helminths. Nevertheless, studies on ticks and tick-borne infections remain limited in Vietnam. That said, serological and molecular evidence of tick infections in animals and humans have been reported on several occasions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia in recent decades. The identification of ticks and tick-associated diseases has an important role to play in epidemiological investigation and in assessing the risks of disease transmission to humans and animals. Recently, MALDI-TOF MS has been used as an innovative tool for the rapid and accurate identification of alcohol-preserved ticks based on proteins from extracted legs. This procedure represents a time-cost saving and does not require expert knowledge. This goal of this study was to assess the efficiency and reliability of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of alcohol-preserved ticks collected in Vietnam and to determine the presence of their relative pathogens. Our study revealed 97% correspondence between morphological and MALDI-TOF MS identification. The detected microorganisms that were confirmed by sequencing belonged to the Anaplasmataceae and Piroplasmida families. These findings suggested that ticks and tick-associated pathogens are likely to pose challenges to public and veterinary health in Vietnam.
