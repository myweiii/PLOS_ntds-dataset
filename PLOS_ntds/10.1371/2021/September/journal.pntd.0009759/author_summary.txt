Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoa Leishmania infantum and L. donovani. This illness affects millions of people in various regions of the world and can be fatal if not early treated. In the Americas and Southern Europe, the VL is a zoonotic disease, being the dog its main reservoir. The early and correct diagnosis of dogs and humans infected with Leishmania is essential for the efficient disease control. However, current diagnostic methods have limitations, as they are not sufficiently sensitive and/or specific, and may not be able to identify all cases of VL or exhibit cross-reactions with other infections. We produced a recombinant protein, rKDDR-plus, constituted only by highly repetitive sequences kinesin-derived from L. infantum, and compare its performance with other kinesin-derived antigens (rK39 and rKDDR), but that have less repetitive sequences. The rKDDR-plus protein exhibited the best performance among the studied antigens, presenting a greater specificity in the VL diagnosis, both in the ELISA and rapid test platforms. Therefore, this antigen can contribute to the control of leishmaniasis in humans and dogs, through a diagnostic test with high specificity, achieved due to the use of the new rKDDR-plus antigen.
