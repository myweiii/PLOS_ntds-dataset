We thank Professor Woon-Mok Sohn of the Department of Parasitology, Gyeongsang National University College of Medicine, Jinju, Korea. He kindly provided live C. sinensis metacercariae collected from an endemic area in Korea. He also gave us the 8-week-old adult worms used in the supplementary experiment shown in S3 Fig. Without his help, this investigation might not have been possible.
