Syphilis continues to be a disease of global and public health concern, even though the infection can be easily diagnosed and effectively treated with penicillin. Although infected individuals often develop a strong immunity to the pathogen, repeated infection with the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum), is possible. Several studies point at antigenic variation of the T. pallidum TprK protein as the mechanism responsible for evasion of the immunity that develops during infection, pathogen persistence, and re-infection. Past studies have highlighted the importance of immune clearance of dominant variants that, in turn, allows less represented variants to emerge. The contribution of an immunity-independent baseline generation of variability in the tprK gene is less clear. Here, we used deep sequencing to profile tprK variants using a laboratory-isolated T. pallidum strain nearly isogenic for tprK that was propagated over time in vitro, where no immune pressure is exerted on the pathogen, as well as in samples obtained from immunosuppressed and immunocompetent rabbits infected with the same strain. We confirmed that tprK accumulates significantly more diversity under immune pressure, and demonstrated a low but discernible basal rate of gene conversion in complete absence of immune pressure.
