The anthropic action in the Amazon region directly influences the relationship among pathogens, and animal hosts. This kind of action could move different species of animals from their natural habitat to urban or rural areas, which can lead to the dispersion of different etiological agents such rotavirus and picobirnavirus, showing their zoonotic potential, and increasing their genetic diversity. This study detected the circulation of rotavirus in 9/23 samples of wild, and exotic avian, and 1/23 for picobirnavirus from different cities of Par√° state, Brazil. We report the first occurrence of rotavirus A, D, F, G, and Genogroup I of picobirnavirus in wild, exotic birds in Brazil, and worldwide. Our data correlated the pathogens with cities, and symptoms. The data emphasize the scarce of epidemiological monitoring of these pathogens, and the importance of epidemiological studies to obtain the ecology, and evolution of rotavirus, and picobirnavirus in animals population as well as the negative impacts in animal health.
