Parasitic helminths (worms) cause long-lasting infections. In order to survive in their hosts, this class of pathogens has developed various strategies; one of them consists of releasing soluble mediators (e.g., excretory/secretory (ES) proteins), which dampen the host immune response. Here, we analyzed and compared published ES protein catalogs of parasitic nematodes to identify common patterns as well as species-specific traits. Many proteins were common to multiple species, and a few were absent in secretions from the non-parasitic species Caenorhabditis elegans. This was the case of two glycolytic enzymes, aldolase and enolase, for which alternative functions have been proposed by others. A role in parasitic processes is intriguing. Our workflow enabled the identification of conserved protein families and pinpointed elements that may have evolved as to enable parasitism. This may prove useful in the future to identify and prioritize potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
