Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease, caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. The infective cercariae are released by freshwater snails belonging to three genera: Biomphalaria, Bulinus and Oncomelania. It is one of the most significant neglected infectious diseases in the world. Snail identification is tremendously important for monitoring snail populations and schistosomiasis. Identification is currently based on morphological criteria and molecular biology, both of which present several drawbacks. Many studies have reported the performance of MALDI-TOF MS, a technology that allows species identification based on their proteins, as a reliable, rapid, and easy-to-use tool in many fields. The aim of our study was to create a snail database and assess the efficiency of MALDI-TOF MS for snail identification. This study shows that MALDI-TOF MS can rapidly identify both frozen and ethanol-stored specimens of different species. These results support the use of MALDI-TOF MS in the context of epidemiological studies in Schistosoma-endemic areas.
