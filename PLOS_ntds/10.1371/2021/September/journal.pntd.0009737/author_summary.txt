Brazil is the country in South America with the most reported snake envenomations, however, the incidence of snake envenomations is not equal throughout the country. In most cases, the occurrence of snake envenomations is related to environmental factors (e.g., climate) and the increase of human activity in fieldwork. Besides those factors, problems in urban infrastructure, municipality size, or population size are also variables that can influence the number of snake envenomations in a region. The authors found that in the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil, the number of snake envenomations is low when compared with Mato Grosso and Goi√°s states, and the national average. Despite this, snake envenomations in Mato Grosso do Sul confirmed trends observed in other Brazilian regions, happening mainly in October and April. Most of the envenomations occurred in males by Bothrops snakes and with an attendance time of 3 hours. Also, the authors found that there is a relationship between municipality areas with the number of snake envenomations. Seen this, municipalities with larger areas usually have a mosaic of environments, which may harbor higher richness and abundance of snakes, and can cause more snake encounters with the population, resulting in more snake envenomations.
