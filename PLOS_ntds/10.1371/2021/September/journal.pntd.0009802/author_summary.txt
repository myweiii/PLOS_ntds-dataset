Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many different types of infectious pathogens and parasites to humans. Some of these pathogens include viruses like dengue and chikungunya viruses which cause diseases in humans. Dengue virus has four different types (1, 2, 3, and 4) present in nature. In this study, we detected all four dengue virus types in hospitalized patients in Lahore and Rawalpindi. While only dengue virus type-2 was detected from Peshawar city. The secondary infections with different dengue virus types than the previous one might result in a more severe form of the disease. Therefore, the population of Peshawar is at risk of developing a severe form of dengue fever in the future in case of infection from another dengue virus type. The data of hospitalized patients showed that other diseases in addition to dengue fever result in an increased hospital stay. Comorbidities like diabetes also increase the risk of developing a more severe form of dengue fever. Combined infections of both dengue and chikungunya viruses were detected from Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar. The transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses and the co-circulation of multiple dengue virus types not only impose public health burden but also result in economic losses.
