Leprosy, also called Hansen’s disease, is a neglected infectious disease leading to deformity and disability. Late presentation and hidden cases are the major risks of leprosy-associated disability. Although leprosy endemic pocket areas and grade II disability with a high proportion were reported in Ethiopia, studies on the burden of hidden leprosy cases are limited. Therefore, this study determined the extent of hidden leprosy cases among the general population in leprosy endemic settings in eastern Ethiopia through active case findings and contact tracing. In this community-based survey, leprosy-suspected individuals in the general population and household contacts of newly diagnosed patients with leprosy were included. Health extension workers, community-based health workers in Ethiopia, visited 16107 individuals in the selected villages and 214 leprosy suspects were enrolled in the study based on the clinical signs of leprosy suspects. Leprosy experts examined all leprosy suspects clinically and a skin slit sample was taken for bacteriological examination. After the confirmation of new cases, 48 of their households’ contacts were then examined by leprosy experts. Of 262 suspects and household contacts evaluated for leprosy, 15 hidden cases confirmed, giving an overall prevalence of 9.3 per 10, 000 population. Most of them were Multi-bacillary (MB) type, and one-fourth of them were younger than 15 years of age, and three cases presented with grade II disability. Hidden leprosy was not statistically associated with participants’ sex, age category, and contact history.
