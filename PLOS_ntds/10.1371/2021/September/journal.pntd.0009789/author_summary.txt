Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) is a disease of the female reproductive system caused by infection with Schistosoma haematobium, a parasite acquired through skin contact with infested water. Although this disease is highly endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and associated with serious effects on reproductive and mental health, FGS is often neglected by public health professionals and policy makers. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of FGS in endemic communities—important for adherence to intervention measures—are unknown. This study used qualitative research methods to explore community members’ KAP on and health seeking behavior for FGS. Overall, community members knew about urogenital schistosomiasis, but lacked knowledge of FGS. Misconceptions on its cause, symptoms and modes of transmission were common. Our study highlights the need for public health education to address FGS as part of community-based mass drug administration (MDA) programs. In mainland Tanzania, as is in Zanzibar, MDA should be extended to the communities, targeting women and adolescent girls, in order to reduce the burden of FGS. For the long-term impact of these interventions, improving the supply of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is an essential part of the intervention package to end both urogenital schistosomiasis and FGS.
