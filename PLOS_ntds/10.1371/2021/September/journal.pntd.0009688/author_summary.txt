Rabies is a zoonotic disease, caused by a lyssavirus, resulting in thousands of deaths every year, particularly in low-resource endemic regions in Asia and Africa. High quality rabies vaccines have been available since decades to guarantee protection of the dog population against rabies. Furthermore, maintaining a high vaccination coverage and herd immunity until the subsequent vaccination campaign is essential for preventing circulation of rabies virus within dog populations. However, the percentage of dogs that maintain an adequate level of rabies antibodies one year after vaccination and factors influencing such a maintenance is unknown for the dog populations on Flores Island, Indonesia. This study aimed at understanding the risk factors associated with loss of adequate level of binding antibodies amongst vaccinated dogs that developed antibody titre ≥0.5 EU/ml after parenteral vaccination, following a longitudinal study over one year. The study identified body condition score of the dogs, their previous vaccination, and their age as factors that influence the maintenance of an adequate level of antibodies. For dogs without previous vaccination and vaccination being applied more than 12 months ago, a booster is recommended within 3 months after the first vaccination to guarantee an antibody levels that lasts for at least one year. In addition, a low BCS should be considered as one of the risk factors of losing measurable immunity. Therefore, improving the dogs’ poor BCS should also be promoted to enhance immune response and ensure longer presence of antibodies against rabies.
