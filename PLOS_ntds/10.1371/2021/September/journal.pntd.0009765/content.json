    "Introduction": "Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) is a fungal disease caused by two closely related pathogens: Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii. Coccidioides immitis is endemic to the San Joaquin Valley of California. Coccidioides posadasii is found in the desert regions of the southwestern United States, including Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and West Texas, and parts of Mexico, Argentina, Paraguay, and Central America [1]. Coccidioides immitis is likely to present outside the recognized endemic area as evident from human infections and DNA-positive soil samples from Washington state [2,3].\nThe number of Valley fever cases has increased over the years with 2,271 cases reported in 1998, and 18, 407 cases in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/statistics.html). Notably, in 2011, more than 20,000 cases were reported in the US, twice as many cases as tuberculosis [4]. Further documentation of yearly Valley fever cases from Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and other jurisdictions are published in the recent updates (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/statistics.html) [5,6]. It is believed that C. immitis and C. posadasii infect \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of people per year and many of whom are sick without knowing the cause or have cases so mild that they are not detected [4]. The rise in Coccidioides infection is attributed to increased travel, relocation to endemic areas, and possible broader distribution of C. immitis and C. posadasii than previously recognized [7,8]. Arthroconidia produced by these fungi are highly infectious, and climate change, including dry and hot weather followed by dust storms makes these conidia easily air borne to cause pulmonary infection [9]. Lung infections typically resolve rapidly leaving the patient with a robust acquired immunity to re-infection [10]. However, in some individuals, the disease may progress to a chronic pulmonary condition or to a systemic disease involving the meninges, bones, joints, subcutaneous, and cutaneous tissues [11]. Identifying Coccidioides to the species level is likely beneficial in the proper treatment of the patients and disease surveillance. Such a laboratory test could also become an important tool in ongoing studies aimed at defining similarities and differences in Valley fever caused by C. immitis and C. posadasii [7,8,12].\nCoccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are not easily differentiated in the clinical laboratory on account of similar morphology. Coccidioides posadasii was first differentiated from C. immitis by microsatellite analysis [13,14]. However, this approach was time consuming and technically challenging. Subsequently, several real-time PCR assays, based on LightCycler and TaqMan chemistries, were developed to differentiate C. immitis from C. posadasii [15,16]. Both approaches rely on a single nucleotide polymorphism in different regions of the target gene, and it may have limitations when large number of strains of C. immitis and C. posadasii are tested. Umeyama et al [17] described disparity PCR using species-specific primers designed from the Ci45815 PCR fragment (GenBank AB597180.1). Contiguous deletion of 86-bp nucleotides in corresponding C. posadasii contig Cp45810 PCR fragment (GenBank AB597183.1) resulted in convenient distinction of C. immitis from C. posadasii by conventional PCR. In the present study, we describe a TaqMan duplex real-time PCR assay using PRA2 gene encoding proline-rich antigen specific for the Coccidioides genus and C. immitis PCR fragment Ci45815 specific for C. immitis. The first set of primers and probe targets the PRA2 gene specific for Coccidioides genus. The second set of primers and probe targets C. immitis contig Ci45815 (CiC). The duplex real-time PCR assay was compared against redesigned diagnostic conventional PCR with 100% concordance for culture isolates. We show that duplex real-time PCR assay is highly sensitive (10 gene copies) and identifies C. immitis and C. posadasii from culture and primary specimens. The reliable, and sensitive duplex real-time PCR assay will allow rapid differentiation of C. immitis and C. posadasii from culture and clinical specimens, and further augment the treatment and surveillance of coccidioidomycosis.",
    "Materials and methods": "Coccidioides isolates and primary specimens\nTwo hundred and seventeen suspected isolates of Coccidioides species, 10 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, three vials of rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) cell (Lot # A491216B) [18], six lung tissue, three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), two bone marrow, one plural fluid, and one whole blood sample, received as a part of reference service from 1995- to 2020, from various diagnostic laboratories of the New York State and neighboring states\u2019 laboratories were part of this investigation. Seventeen isolates of C. immitis were received from the Microbial Diseases Laboratory, California State Department of Public Health. All cultures were stored as sterile water and glycerol stocks at 30\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C, respectively. Fifteen residual CSF and pleural fluids, which tested positive for coccidioidomycosis by immunodiffusion and complement fixation at the University of California Davis, were also included in the study.\n\n\nDNA extraction\nExtraction of DNA from culture of Coccidioides spp. was carried out in the biological safety cabinet 2 (BSC 2) in the biological safety level 3 (BSL 3) laboratory, and DNA extraction from primary human and animal specimens was carried out in BSC 2 in the BSL 2 laboratory. Qiagen DNA mini kit on the QIAcube automated extractor was used for DNA extraction from all sample types. In brief, for Coccidioides isolates, approximately 5 x 5 mm size of fungal mat grown on SDA slant for 7 to 10 days was removed by sterile loop and suspended in lysis buffer containing approximately 0.2 g of glass beads and incubated for 1 h at 90\u00b0C in the BSL 3 laboratory. Heat-killed fungal cells along with the beads was brought to the BSL 2 laboratory, bead-beating in the Precellys homogenizer at 6,500 rpm for 15\u2009sec. for three times using program number 5 (6500-3x60-015). The homogenized fungal suspension was transferred to a 2-ml screw-cap tube, leaving behind the beads. DNA from homogenized samples was extracted using the Qiagen DNA mini kit in the QIAcube semiautomated DNA extractor, resulting in 50\u2009\u03bcl of eluted DNA. For DNA extraction from fungal mat grown in the RhMK cell line, approximately 2 ml RhMK medium containing fungal growth was first centrifuged at 12,000 RPM; the supernatant was decanted, and fungal pellet was suspended in lysis buffer containing beads and heat-killed at 90\u00b0C for 1 h in the BSL 3 laboratory followed by DNA extraction in the BSL 2 laboratory as described above. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were processed by placing 10 sections of 10 \u03bcm each into 2-ml tube containing 1 ml of xylene (Sigma Aldrich). The sections were then incubated in xylene for 5 min at room temperature and xylene was removed with fine-tip disposable pipette. A second incubation of 1 ml of xylene was performed followed by centrifugation and removal of xylene. To the sample pallet, 1 ml of 100% ethanol was added, gently vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, followed by centrifugation and removal of ethanol. The pellet was washed one more time with 1 ml of 100% ethanol. The tissue was dried at room temperature for 15\u201320 min, followed by addition of lysis buffer, incubation at 70\u00b0C for 1 h, bead-beating and DNA extraction using QIAcube as described above. For other primary samples (blood, CSF, pleural fluid, and bone marrow), approximately 400 \u03bcl of each sample was directly mixed with lysis buffer containing beads, heated at 56\u00b0C for 10 min followed by bead beating and DNA extraction in QIAcube as described above. Lung tissues were minced with sterile blade followed by lysis and DNA extraction as described for other primary samples. All extracted DNAs were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. DNA of fungi (yeasts and molds) other than Coccidioides spp. were procured from the Wadsworth Center Mycology Laboratory (WCML) DNA Collection Repository. DNA from bacterial species including Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Nocardia farcinica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumonia was procured from the Wadsworth Center Bacteriology Laboratory.\n\n\nModified conventional PCR\nA modification of conventional diagnostic PCR described by Umeyama et. al [17] was used. The primers were designed from the conserved region of Ci45815 (GenBank No. AB597180.1) and Cp45810 (GenBank No. AB597183.1) flanking the deleted region of C. posadasii (S1A Fig). The nucleotide sequences of the diagnostic primers were V2119 5\u2019-CCGGGTACTCCGTACATCAC-3\u2019, and V2120 5\u2019-ATGCGTGAAGCCAATTCTTT-3\u2019 and the PCR conditions were initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles consisted of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1 min followed by final extension at 68\u00b0C for 3 min.\n\n\nDuplex real-time PCR assay\nThe PRA2 gene and contig Ci45815/Cp45810 [17] were used to design the duplex real-time PCR assay (S1B and S1C Fig). The nucleotide sequences of primers and probe for PRA2 gene target were forward primer V1753 5\u2019GTGCGAGAAGTTGACCGACTT-3\u2019, reverse primer V1754 5\u2019AGGCGTGATCTTTCCTGGAA-3\u2019, probe V1755 5\u2019-Cy5\u2019-AAGTGCCACTGCGCCAAGCCC-3BHQ and primers and probe for contig Ci45815 target were forward primer V2116 5\u2019-GGTGAAATGCCCGAAAAGAG-3\u2019 reverse primers V2118 5\u2019-CCAATCCTTAGGTAACCGTGAG-3\u2019, and probe V2117 5\u2019/56FAMTTGCACTTT/ZEN/CGTTGACTAGCCGC/3IABkFQ/-3\u2019. Reaction for each real-time PCR contained 1\u00d7 PerfeCTa multiplex qPCR ToughMix (Quanta Biosciences), a 1,000\u2009nM concentration of primers and a 250\u2009nM concentration of probes, and 2\u2009\u03bcl of genomic DNA (approximately 1 to 10\u2009ng) from isolates or 5 \u03bcl of tissue DNA extracted from primary clinical specimens in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. Each PCR run also included 2\u2009\u03bcl (1\u2009ng) of positive extraction control (C735; C. posadasii), 2\u2009\u03bcl (1\u2009ng) of positive amplification controls (C735, C. posadasii and 249, C. immitis), and 2\u2009\u03bcl of negative extraction (extraction reagents only) and negative amplification (sterilized nuclease-free water) controls. Parallel to each PCR assay, inhibitory PCR was also performed by incorporating 1 ng of Coccidioides gDNA into each primary clinical DNA sample. The unidirectional workflow kept the reagent preparation, specimen preparation, and amplification and detection areas separate to avoid cross-contamination. Cycling conditions on the ABI 7500 FAST system (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) were initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. Based on the limit of detection (LOD), a cycle threshold (Ct) value of \u226438 was reported as positive; and >38 was reported as negative. For all primary samples, specimens were reported as inconclusive if PCR inhibition was observed for the primary specimens.\n\n\nAnalytical sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the duplex real-time PCR assay\nThe 10-fold serial dilutions of genomic DNA from one isolate each of C. posadasii (C-735) and C. immits (249) were used to assess the analytical sensitivity of the duplex real-time PCR assay. The assay specificity was assessed by using an extensive DNA panel comprising various fungi both closely and distantly related to Coccidioides spp. and few bacterial pathogens primarily responsible for causing pulmonary infection (S1 Table). The assay reproducibility was determined by using varying concentration of gDNA from three isolates each of C. posadasii and C. immitis, ran on three different days in duplicate (inter-assay reproducibility), and on the same day in triplicate (intra-assay reproducibility). The assay\u2019s precision was assessed using blinded panel with varying concentration of gDNA from 20 isolates each of C. posadassii and C. immitis, and 10 isolates of fungi other than Coccidioides spp.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe GraphPad Prism 8.0 software for macOS was used for calculation of mean, standard deviation, and percent coefficient of variance (CV) for Ct values generated for assay sensitivity and reproducibility. The student t test was used for the analysis of means, and variance, and P value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
    "Results": "Modified conventional PCR assay\nInitially, we modified conventional diagnostic PCR assay using species-specific primers designed from the Ci45815 PCR fragment (GenBank AB597180.1) described by Umeyama et al [17]. The modification reduced the amplicon length down to 200-bp for C. immitis and 114-bp for C. posadasii, yielding better electrophoretic separation (Fig 1). Also, PCR efficiency was higher, with a smaller amplicon size. Of 234 human isolates suspected of Coccidioides were investigated, 172 were C. posadasii, and 43 were C. immitis by conventional PCR, and 19 isolates were negative for Coccidioides spp. (Table 1). This approach was not successful for the analysis of Coccidioides DNA from primary specimens except for three RhMK cell samples (Tables 1 and S2). Overall, our results showed that the conventional diagnostic PCR could be used successfully to identify C. immitis and C. posadasii from culture isolates but not from the primary specimens.\nA modification of assay described by Umeyama et al. (2006) allowed generation of smaller amplicons and better electrophoretic separation while maintaining test accuracy. First and last lane 100-bp DNA ladder; lane 1 non-template control (NTC), lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 C. posadasii; lanes 3, 5, and 7 C. immitis.\n\n\nDuplex real-time PCR assay sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility\nWe designed a duplex real-time PCR assay with the first set of primers and probe targeting PRA2 gene identifying Coccidioides species (S1B Fig), and the second set of primers and probe targeting C. immitis contig Ci45815 (CiC) identifying C. immitis but not C. posadasii due to 86-bp deletion in the corresponding C. posadasii contig 45810 (S1C Fig). The duplex real-time PCR assay was highly sensitive, with the limit of detection was 0.1 pg gDNA/PCR reaction, which was equivalent to approximately ten genome copies of C. immitis or C. posadasii (Fig 2 and Table 2). None of the other fungal or bacterial DNA yielded any Ct value, confirming the high specificity of the duplex real-time PCR assay (S1 Table). The assay was highly reproducible as it yielded correct ID for C. immitis and C. posadasii when varying concentration of gDNA tested within the same day or on different days (S3A and S3B Table), and when samples were blinded by one operator and tested by another operator (S4 Table). Since Coccidioides genus comprises only two species, positive results with both probes identified C. immitis while the positive, negative results with PRA2 and Ci45815 contig (CiC) probes, respectively, identified C. posadasii (Table 3).\nGenomic DNA from two control strains of Coccidioides species, C. immitis (249) and C. posadasii (C-735) were serially diluted and tested in triplicate in duplex real-time PCR assay. The assay was linear over 5 orders of magnitude and the limit of detection was 0.001 ng or 1 picogram gDNA/PCR reactions at 45 PCR cycles confirming high sensitivity. As indicated, the assay targeting CiC gene did not yield Ct values against C. posadasii DNA. The test was repeated with similar results.\n\n\nPerformance of the duplex real-time PCR assay\nThe duplex real-time PCR assay correctly identified all cultures of Coccidioides species to either C. immitis or C. posadasii, and the results were corroborated with modified diagnostic PCR assay, confirming the high utility of the duplex real-time PCR assay (Table 1). Of 217 human fungal isolates suspected of Coccidioides received for reference testing, 168 were identified as C. posadasii, representing 125 cases, and 30 isolates were identified as C. immitis, representing 23 cases (Fig 3). Of 17 isolates received from California, 13 were confirmed as C. immtits and four were confirmed as C. posadasii (Tables 1 and S5). Next, we assessed the duplex real-time PCR assay\u2019s ability to detect Coccidioides species DNA from 42 primary specimens. Nine of the ten paraffin-embedded tissues including four human and five animal, and three vials of RhMK cells were positive for C. posadassi DNA (S2 Table). All of the three RhMK cell vials positive for C. posadasii DNA also yielded Coccidioides in culture, and subsequently confirmed as C. posadasii (Tables 1 and S2). We also evaluated 15 residual CSF and pleural fluid samples, which were earlier tested positive for coccidoidomycosis by immunodiffusion and complement fixations tests. Of these samples, only two were positive for C. posadasii DNA by duplex real-time PCR assay (Tables 1 and S6).\nIsolates received from various facilities from New York and neighboring states were analyzed retrospectively by newly developed duplex real-time PCR assay. Of 152 cases, 129 were confirmed as being caused by C. posadasii, and 23 were caused by C. immitis. The predominance of C. posadasii over C. immitis was observed in the isolates analyzed. Four of the 129 cases were defined based on primary specimens positive for C. posadasii DNA.",
    "Discussion": "PCR-based fungal diagnostic methods offer accuracy, sensitivity, and speed of identification, and the use of DNA instead of highly infectious live cultures. Microsatellite analysis has been the primary molecular method used to distinguish the two species of Coccidioides [13,14]. However, this method is both time consuming and technically challenging for clinical and reference laboratories. The light-cycler PCR assay developed by Binnicker et al. [19] was highly sensitive and specific for Coccidioides species, but this assay could not distinguish C. immitis from C. posadasii. Umeyama et al. [17] described disparity PCR using species-specific primers that resulted in different size amplicons for a convenient distinction of C. immitis from C. posadasii by conventional PCR. In the present study, we modified the Umeyama et. al. [17] disparity PCR, which led to the reduction in amplicon size of 200-bp for C. immitis and 114-bp for C. posadasii. The conventional diagnostic PCR assay was excellent for the identification of C. immitis and C. posadasii from culture, but it was not good for the analysis of Coccidioides DNA from primary specimens. One reason could be that the amount of Coccidioides DNA present in the primary samples were below the threshold for detection by conventional PCR, or the template was degraded beyond the capacity of the conventional PCR to yield a positive result. PCR allelic-discrimination assay, referred to as CocciDiff, was developed using TaqMan chemistry [16]. This assay could effectively identify Coccidioides cultures and could accurately distinguish C. immitis from C. posadasii based upon the presence of an individual highly informative canonical SNP [16]. CocciDiff has yet to be validated with clinical specimens. Although, the CocciDiff assay appears to be quite promising, the assay specificity based on canonical SNP can be problematic if such mutations are not consistently present in a given strain of Coccidioides. In the present study, while developing a duplex real-time PCR assay, we used more stringent conditions where the first set of primers and probe targeting PRA2 gene identified Coccidioides to the genus level, and the second set of primers and probe targeting C. immitis contig, Ci45815 (CiC), identified C. immitis but not C. posadasii due to a deletion of 86-bp sequence in the corresponding Cp45810 contig. Since there are only two species within the Coccidioides genus, the positive results with both probes of the duplex assay allowed the identification of C. immitis while positive, negative results with probes PRA2 and Ci45815, respectively, led to the identification of C. posadasii.\nOf 168 C. posadasii, 151 isolates were from patients from New York, followed by eight isolates from patients from New Jersey, two isolates each from patients from Pennsylvania and Arizona, one isolate from a patient from Washington DC. All 30 C. immitis isolates were from patients from NY. Since Coccidioides is not found in the soil of New York and other states in the northeast region, the findings of positive isolates suggested that the patients acquired Coccidioides infection while travelling to a known area of endemicity. These findings are consistent with our earlier study where travel history to endemic areas for Coccidioides was linked to positive clinical cases from New York [20]. In the present study, we confirmed over five-fold more isolates as C. posadasii than as C. immitis; this observation supports a previous publication on possible larger population size and more diverse distribution of C. posadasii vis-a-vis C. immitis [21]. Among a smaller sampling of isolates from California, we found four C. posadasii isolates. Also, positive RhMK cell samples from a monkey housed in California were also identified as C. posadasii. These results raised the possibility that a small niche of C. posadasii exists in California or patients might have traveled to areas where C. posadasii is endemic. Further studies are needed to delineate the geographic distribution of C. immitis and C. posadasii and the areas of overlap if any.\nSerology tests are the mainstay of coccidioidomycosis diagnosis [22,23]. Our study included a small sample size of serology-positive clinical specimens, but the findings do not permit firm correlation with real-time PCR test. The gold standard for the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is the culture of the organism from primary specimens. Culture is highly sensitive, and the DNA probe for confirmatory testing of culture isolates has yielded excellent specificity [24,25]. However, growth in culture may take several days to weeks resulting in a delay in diagnosing and initiating treatment in infected individuals. The highly infectious nature of arthroconidia produced by Coccidioides species presents a safety risk to the laboratory personnel if a culture is not quickly identified and handled appropriately under biosafety level 3 containment. It is important to note that laboratory-acquired infections due to Coccidioides species have been reported in the literature [26]. A rapid Coccidioides DNA test could become an adjunct surveillance tool to study the incidence, prevalence, and overlapping features of Valley fever caused by Coccidioides species [7,8]. In summary, our modified diagnostic conventional PCR assay was excellent for the culture identification of C. immitis and C. posadasii, and the new duplex real-time PCR assay had broader utility for identifying two Coccidioides species from culture and primary specimens. The Coccidioides spp. duplex real-time PCR will allow rapid differentiation of C. immitis and C. posadasii from clinical specimens and further augment coccidioidomycosis treatment and surveillance."
