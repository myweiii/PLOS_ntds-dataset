Hantavirus transmission to humans occurs via inhalation of aerosolized excreta, including urine, feces, and saliva of infected rodents. Currently, no report for the etiological evidence associated with urinary Hantaan virus (HTNV) from patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is available. Here, we conducted multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) using urine and serum specimens from four Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) patients with HFRS. The epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses using whole or partial genome sequences of HTNV from urine and serum demonstrated homogenous genetic clustering with HTNV from clinical specimens, circulating at highly endemic sites of patient infection. Among the sequences from ROKA patients, the genomic configuration of ROKA16-10 demonstrated occurrences of the genetic reassortment. Our results suggest that whole or partial genome sequences of HTNV from the urine enabled to track the putative infection sites of patients with HFRS by phylogeographically linking to the zoonotic HTNV from the reservoir host captured at endemic regions. This result provides new insights into presence of HTNV in the urine of patients with HFRS among physicians.
