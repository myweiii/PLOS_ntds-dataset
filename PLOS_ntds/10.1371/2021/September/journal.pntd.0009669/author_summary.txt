This is the first paper to describe the prevalence of human schistosomiasis in South Africa using nationally representative data. The prevalence remained consistent during the eight-year period, independent of increasing annual testing volumes. Groups with the highest burden included males and individuals aged 5â€“19 years. The schistosomiasis-endemic provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal emerged as the highest-burdened areas, and ongoing endemicity in Eastern Cape Province was demonstrated. Western Cape Province likely reported cases imported from endemic provinces rather than being acquired by local transmission. In summary, schistosomiasis remains an important public health problem in South Africa that needs long-term sustainable, effective standardised interventions to reduce the burden. Passive laboratory-based surveillance is a practical tool for reporting prevalence, and could be used to monitor and evaluate future intervention programs.
