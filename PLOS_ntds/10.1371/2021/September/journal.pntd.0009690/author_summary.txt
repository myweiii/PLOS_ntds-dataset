At presentation of acute Plasmodium vivax malaria, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PDd) males have low G6PD activity that is unrelated to baseline reticulocyte counts; they were all detected by the qualitative fluorescent spot test. The number of G6PDd heterozygous females was too small to draw meaningful inferences. Enzyme activity rose in parallel with posttreatment reticulocytosis.
