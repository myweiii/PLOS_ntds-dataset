Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with Leishmania parasites. In regions with the presence of Leishmania parasites, all people do not develop the disease despite similar exposure. Only a proportion of inhabitants progress to the development of disease. Clinical manifestations depend on the vector and Leishmania species, as well the host genetic background and genetically determined immune responses. miRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression and many biological processes including immune pathways. miR-146a targets TRAF6 and IRAK1 genes, that encode key adaptor molecules downstream of toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are critical in immune response to Leishmania-infection. miR499-a modulates inflammation-related signalling pathways such as TGFβ, TNFα and TLR pathways. In this study, we showed that MIR146A and MIR499A variants are risk factors to developing cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. guyanensis in Amazonas state of Brazil. Individuals with these variants are susceptible to the development of CL.
