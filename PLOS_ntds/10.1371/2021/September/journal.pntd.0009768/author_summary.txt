Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a causative agent of acute respiratory illness in humans in tropical and sub-tropical regions in Southeast Asia. PRVs have been originally isolated from fruit bats, and it is assumed that PRVs spread to humans by both bat-to-human and human-to-human transmission. Recently, an PRV was also detected from a fruit bat in the Afrotropical region and might potentially cause an emerging infection of the bat-borne zoonotic virus in Africa. However, little is known about the prevalence of PRV infection in Africa. In this study, we demonstrated the high prevalence of PRV infection in bat populations in Zambia and isolated a new strain of PRV from Egyptian fruit bats. In addition, we found that the bat-derived PRV strain had lower pathogenicity in mice than a human-derived PRV strain isolated from a patient in Southeast Asia. Our findings provide new epidemiological information about PRV in fruit bats in the Afrotropical region and indicate the first isolation of an PRV strain that may cause attenuated infection in humans.
