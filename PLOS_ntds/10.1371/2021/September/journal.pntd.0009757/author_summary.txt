The present study aimed to determine prevalence and risk factors of intestinal schistosomiasis and investigate its impact on nutritional status and anemia among schoolchildren in Sana’a Governorate, Yemen. It was conducted in 2018 on 445 schoolchildren aged 5–15 years. Information was collected using a standard questionnaire. S. mansoni was identified by microscopic examination of Kato-Katz fecal smear. Hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric measurements were estimated using standard methods. The prevalence of S. mansoni was highly focal (1.4–33.9%). Schoolchildren living in households without tap water had significantly high infection rate of S. mansoni. The prevalence of wasting, stunting, underweight and anemia among schoolchildren was 25.0%, 45.8%, 27.3% and 31.7%, respectively. Although S. mansoni was significantly associated with stunting, no significant association was found between S. mansoni and wasting, underweight or anemia. The stunting was higher among early adolescent than young schoolchildren. The early adolescent schoolchildren and children from families with low or moderate wealth were significantly more wasted than schoolchildren from families with high wealth. Schoolchildren in the early adolescence, being female or living in Al-Haimah Al-Dakheliah District were at high risk of anemia. The study suggests implementation of control measures to combat schistosomiasis and integrated diseases control programmes to improve the health status of schoolchildren in Sana’a Governorate.
