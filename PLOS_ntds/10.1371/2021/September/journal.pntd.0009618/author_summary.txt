Bangladesh observed a large-scale arrival of forcibly displaced individuals from Myanmar in August 2017. The Bangladesh Government, UN agencies, and international and national non-governmental organizations responded immediately with extensive humanitarian response. However, threats of cholera outbreaks were prevailing. The Government of Bangladesh as lead, with technical support from icddr,b collaborating with international agencies undertook a massive oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign immediately as a pre-emptive measure to alleviate threats of the cholera outbreak. Despite that mass OCV campaign, threats of cholera outbreak were existing due to new arrivals of the displaced population with compromised host susceptibility, frequent visits to settlements by Bangladesh nationals without exposure to OCV, and the declining vaccine immunity among OCV recipients as well as an increasing number of cohort children without any exposure to OCV. The population faced a cholera outbreak during September-December 2019. This study aims to describe the characteristics of cholera patients, their care-seeking pattern, camp-wise distribution, source of drinking water, sanitation facility, OCV status, and share the experiences from effective interventions to prevent a cholera outbreak. Vigilance for cholera patients by routine surveillance, preparedness for both preventive and control measures, and response readiness for surges and OCV campaigns can alleviate the threats of cholera.
