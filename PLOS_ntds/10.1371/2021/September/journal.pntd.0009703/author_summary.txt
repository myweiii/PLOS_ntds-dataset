The epidemiology of adulthood Japanese encephalitis (JE) remains limited, and data on the economic burden associated with JE is lacking. This study is the first to comprehensively examine the healthcare burden (i.e., healthcare utilization and costs, neurological complications, all-cause mortality) of an adult population with JE, utilizing a nationwide cohort of JE-infected adults with up to 16 years of follow-up. In the first 6 months following JE diagnosis, a higher rate of neurological disorders was found, compared to the years after the diagnosis, with stroke being the most common neurological complication, followed by epilepsy/convulsions. The healthcare utilization of JE patients was higher in the first 6 months after the diagnosis compared to the years following the diagnosis. Medical costs increased considerably at JE diagnosis and subsequent-year costs after diagnosis remained higher than the cost before diagnosis. Having comorbid diabetes or incident epilepsy/convulsion events was a significant risk factor for mortality of adults with JE. Being born after 1976 in Taiwan, and thus likely receiving a four-dose schedule of vaccination, was associated with reduced mortality. Therefore, special attention is required for JE patients with comorbid diabetes or incident epilepsy/convulsion events, and JE vaccination should be considered to prevent this sporadic but lethal viral infection.
