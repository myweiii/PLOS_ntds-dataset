Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that is a public health threat in many countries worldwide. Hundreds of millions of people live in endemic areas and are at risk for this disease. PZQ is the drug of choice for many parasitic infections and is the primary drug used to treat schistosomiasis. PZQ resistance is a problem in endemic areas, emphasizing the need for novel drugs in the fight against schistosomiasis. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how PZQ affects schistosomes and thereby identify novel targets for anthelminthic drug development. Our findings highlighted the anandamide and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways as important targets of the anti-schistosomal effects of PZQ. These pathways might present valid targets for drug development for the treatment of schistosomiasis.
