Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates were reported for the first time in Dhaka in 1993, but then declined and seemed to disappear as a threat. It was never isolated from patients in Africa. Data from the diarrhoeal diseases surveillance systems of hospitals in Dhaka and Matlab, Bangladesh were reviewed to observe the trends in isolation of Vibrio cholerae O139. Based on a representative 2% sample of patients at the Dhaka hospital, about 650 cholera patients were infected with V. cholerae O139 in recent years except during a gap period between 2005 and 2008 when no isolates were identified. The illnesses due to serotype O139 represent less than 1% of all cholera patients seen at the Dhaka hospital. The last patient with cholera due to V cholerae O139 in Matlab was detected in 2005. Clinical signs and symptoms of cholera due to serogroup O139 and serogroup O1 were similar though more of the O139 cases were not dehydrated. Most isolates of O139 remained susceptible to tetracycline, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin; however, sensitivity to erythromycin changed following the gap years. Prior to 2005, they were sensitive, but they were resistant when they returned in 2009. We conclude that cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O139 has not disappeared but continues at a low level in Dhaka, Bangladesh and surveillance needs to continue for this serogroup in Bangladesh.
