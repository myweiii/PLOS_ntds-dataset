Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed parasite worldwide. But it is a rare malaria parasite in Africa, except in the eastern part of the region. Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa where the two principal human malaria parasite, P. falciparum and P. vivax co-exist. Finding of the current review showed that a pooled estimate prevalence of P. vivax was 8.93% with significant heterogeneity. The prevalence was varied across different regions in the country, eco-epidemiological zones and study settings, where the highest prevalence was documented in the South Nations and Nationalities Peoples’ Region, highlands at an altitude of 2000-2500masl and at health facilities, respectively, while study years (before and after the scaling up of malaria interventional activities) didn’t show any effect on the pooled estimate prevalence of P. vivax. Overall, P. vivax showed high prevalence in the western central region of the country, but gradually spreading to the far-western part, previously assumed to be free of malaria. The spread of malaria in general and P. vivax in particular to malaria free regions could have far reaching consequences and calls for periodic surveillance of the disease to curb the potential public health risks.
