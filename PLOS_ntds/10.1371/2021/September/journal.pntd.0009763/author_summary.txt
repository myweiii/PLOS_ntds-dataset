Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems are useful tools for mass screening of Helicobacter pylori infection but their use encounters important challenges in Africa. This is mainly due to the specific genetic background of African H. pylori that may jeopardize the accuracy of currently available ELISA kits. In this study, we developed a new ELISA system, i.e. HpAfr-ELISA, based on pooled antigens of H. pylori that represent main genetic populations colonizing Africa. This new assay could be validated analytically using training samples collected in H. pylori positive and negative patients from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Then, the tool was successfully applied to a real-world community-based mass survey aiming at assessing the epidemiology of H. pylori in a rural area of the DRC. The characteristics of the HpAfr-ELISA assay indicated good robustness and high performances for detection of H. pylori. Statistical modeling enabled estimating the true latent prevalence of H. pylori infection and identifying factors predicting the exposition to the infection in the study population. This outcome will be useful for drawing efficient health policies and optimally allocating available resources to fight the H. pylori infection and related complications (e.g., gastric cancer) in the study area and globally in Africa.
