Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of Rift Valley fever, which is primarily endemic in African countries. The virus infects a wide variety of mammalian species, including ruminants and humans, and causes devastating effects on public health and the livestock industry. Because RVFV is transmitted by several mosquito species that are ubiquitous in non-endemic areas, there is a potential risk that the virus will spread outside of the current endemic areas. However, there are no effective therapeutics nor commercially available vaccines for human use. RVFV encodes a 78kDa protein (P78) of unidentified biological function in mammalian cells. We found that a mutant RVFV expressing a higher level of P78 (P78-High virus) showed lower infectivity and less efficient replication than parental RVFV in macrophage cell lines. P78-High virus and a mutant RVFV lacking P78 expression showed lower and higher virulence than the parental virus, respectively, in mice, suggesting that high levels of P78 expression prevent efficient virus replication in macrophages, leading to attenuation of virus virulence. Genetic alteration leading to increased P78 expression may serve as a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated RVFV as vaccine candidates.
