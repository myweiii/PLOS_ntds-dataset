Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, with water buffalo (carabao) constituting a major non-human reservoir. In the Philippines, previous reports based on conventional coprological examination of carabao feces have concluded that the prevalence of S. japonicum infection is low. We now report schistosome worm burden data by perfusion from water buffalo that were previously uninfected and subsequently exposed to Sj by moving to highly endemic villages. Perfusion of 34 water buffalo in Macanip, Leyte, Philippines revealed that 33 out of the 34 animals (97%) had at least one pair of S. japonicum worms in the mesenteric veins after 10 months of exposure. To date, no direct worm recovery report from naturally exposed water buffalo in the Philippines has been published. Our data suggested that urgent attention is needed to qualify the integrated measurements for Sj infection control in the Philippines, considering water buffalo as an important drought animal and its role in human schistosomiasis transmission.
