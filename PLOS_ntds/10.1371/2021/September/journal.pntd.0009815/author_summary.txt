Controlling mosquitoes and the disease agents they transmit during blood feeding remains a global public heath priority. Some vector control tools in development target the mosquito reproductive system as a means of control. The transfer of semen to a female during mating profoundly impacts her biology by inhibiting re-mating and stimulating egg production and laying. Previous studies in Aedes aegypti that examined potential effects of mating on blood feeding yielded contradictory results. We examined the potential of mating and seminal fluids to modulate female blood feeding and controlled for numerous experimental factors, such as ingestion of sugar prior to blood feeding, that may have led to conflicting results in prior studies. In laboratory studies with field-derived Thai mosquitoes, we show that mating and seminal fluids do not impact blood feeding during a mosquitoâ€™s first meal, but prior sugar feeding does. Furthermore, we show that mating, seminal fluids, and sugar feeding can impact blood feeding across multiple consecutive meals. Furthermore, field studies in Colombia show that virgin and mated females were equally likely to contain blood. Our research clarifies the impact of mating on blood feeding and suggests ways to improve our understanding of these behaviors in nature.
