Benzimidazole (BZ) drugs remain the standard of treatment in large-scale deworming programs that aim to control the morbidity caused by intestinal worms. As these deworming programs are expanding world-wide, there is an increasing risk of worms becoming resistant to BZ drugs, highlighting the necessity for tools to detect gene mutations associated with drug resistance. However, the development of such tools is impeded by a lack of insights into the genes that are coding for β-tubulin proteins, which are the principal targets of BZ drugs. The aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize these genes in the worm species Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum. The findings highlight that these species have at least seven β-tubulin genes. Only two genes are highly expressed throughout the different life stages of the worm, and hence are more likely to be involved in the development of BZ resistance. No mutations that have previously been associated with BZ resistance in other intestinal worms were found. This study provides a baseline towards more efficient and accurate monitoring of drug resistance in large-scale deworming programs.
