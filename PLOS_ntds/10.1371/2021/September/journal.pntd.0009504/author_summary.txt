Trypanosoma brucei ssp. are single-celled parasites that cause two tropical diseases: sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in domestic animals. Parasites survive in the host bloodstream because they periodically change their surface coats and also because they can switch from slender dividing forms to stumpy non-dividing forms. The latter can be transmitted to their second host, the tsetse fly. Although closely related, different geographical isolates differ in their repertoire of surface coats and have small, but important differences in their DNA sequences. In addition, laboratory strains that are transferred between mammals by needle passage lose the ability to produce stumpy forms and to infect flies. The isolate T. b. brucei EATRO1125 is often used for research as it produces stumpy forms and is fly transmissible. We provide an assembly of the genome of this isolate, including part of the repertoire of coat proteins, and a detailed analysis of the genes that the parasites express as they establish infection and progress through the fly. This has provided new insights into trypanosome biology. The combined genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) data will be useful resources for the trypanosome research community.
