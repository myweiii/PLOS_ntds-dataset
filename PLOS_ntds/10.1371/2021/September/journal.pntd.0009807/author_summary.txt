Following the guidance from World Health Organization (WHO) on April 1, 2020 in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Guinea Ministry of Health (MoH) suspended mass drug administration (MDA) for neglected tropical diseases. WHO updated guidance on the resumption of field-based NTD activities on July 27, 2020 and the Guinea MoH and its partners planned and resumed MDA in mid-August to September 2020 in 19 health districts. The risks related to the process of MDA were assessed and a contingency plan and tools were developed to guide MDA implementation during the pandemic, adopting risk mitigation measures, such as testing for all national staff leaving Conakry, mask wearing, social distancing of 2 meters, and hand washing. A supervision checklist was used by supervisors to monitor compliance with these measures by the community drug distributors (CDDs) and household members during door-to-door MDA. It was shown that 68.3% of CDD teams practiced hand washing or sanitizing, compared to 45.0% by household members, and 64.2% of CDD teams respected social distancing of two meters during their distribution at households. There were 79.2% of CDD teams and 23.3% of household members wearing face masks. Among household participants 87.5% did not touch the dose pole and among CDD teams 88.3% did not touch the hands of the participants while giving the drugs. CDD teams and household participants (both 94.2%) were equally willing to participate in the MDA despite the COVID-19 context. The treatment coverage for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and soil-transmitted helminths was more than 65% in 10 out of 19 HDs and that for schistosomiasis was more than 75% for SAC in 7 out of 11 HDs. Guinea was one of the first countries in Africa to successfully resume MDA activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a risk mitigation plan and a method to monitor adherence to barrier measures was critical to this unprecedented effort.
