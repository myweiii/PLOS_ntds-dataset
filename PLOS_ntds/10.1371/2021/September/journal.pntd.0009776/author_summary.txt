Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical infectious disease, has been increasingly serious in recent decades, causing great healthcare burden in low-latitude regions and countries. Aedes is the vector of dengue fever, particularly sensitive to climatic conditions during all stages of the life cycle. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between dengue fever and meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation and relative humidity). Tropical cyclones are a common extreme weather events in the low latitude and have been associated with the outbreak of several infectious diseases. However, the impact of tropical cyclones on the incidence of dengue fever has not been well clarified. In this study, we explored the association between tropical cyclones and dengue fever in the Pearl River Delta region, China. The results showed that the local incidence of dengue fever was substantially associated with tropical cyclones over a certain lag period, with the effect estimate greater for stronger tropical cyclones. The elderly was more vulnerable than any other population subgroups. The findings highlighted the importance of developing public health surveillance, preparedness, and response targeting the outbreak of dengue fever during the tropical cyclone season.
