The leishmaniases are potentially vaccine-preventable diseases of global importance, yet no vaccines for human use have attained registration. This work sheds lights on the potential size of demand for a human vaccine for the prevention of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis as well as for the prevention and treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. The analysis is grounded in the definition of vaccine use cases which, by transparently defining different applications of the vaccines in the immunisation programs, provides the basis for defining the target populations and vaccine characteristics. The output of this work, the first-of-its-kind for leishmaniasis, fills a critical information gap and will provide policy makers and vaccine developers with important insights into the public health relevance of a human leishmaniasis vaccine and the strengths of its commercial value proposition. Ultimately this research aims to inform future decisions on disease prioritization and on investments by key stakeholders, as well as to identify areas for further research.
