    "Background": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a category of lethal hepatobiliary malignancies. Previous studies have found that Opisthorchis viverrini infection and diabetes mellitus (DM) are closely correlated with CCA. However, few studies have discussed the association of CCA with a combination of both O. viverrini infection and DM. This study aimed to assess the correlation of CCA with various combinations of O. viverrini infection and DM among a high-risk population in northeastern Thailand.",
    "Methodology": "This study included participants from 20 provinces in northeastern Thailand who had been screened for CCA in the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program (CASCAP) between 2013 and 2019. Histories of O. viverrini infection and DM diagnosis were obtained using a health questionnaire. CCA screening used ultrasonography with a definitive diagnosis based on histopathology. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to quantify the association, which is presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).",
    "Principal findings": "Overall, 263,776 participants were included, of whom 32.4% were infected with O. viverrini, 8.2% were diagnosed with DM, and 2.9% had a history of both O. viverrini infection and DM. The overall rate of CCA was 0.36%. Of those infected with O. viverrini, 0.47% had CCA; among those with DM, 0.59% had CCA and among those infected with O. viverrini and had DM, 0.73% had CCA. Compared with participants who were not infected with O. viverrini and were non-DM, the aOR for those infected with O. viverrini and with DM was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.74â€“3.21; p-value <0.001).",
    "Conclusions": "The combination of O. viverrini infection and DM was highly associated with CCA, and these two conditions had a combined effect on this association that was greater than that of either alone. These findings suggest that CCA screening should have a strong focus on people with a combination of O. viverrini infection and DM."
