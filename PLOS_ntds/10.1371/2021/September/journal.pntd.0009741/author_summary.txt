Northeastern Thailand has a high prevalence of liver fluke infection and increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus. These two conditions are individually risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in at-risk populations. This study used data from the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program to assess association of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with combinations of O. viverrini infection history and diabetes mellitus diagnosis in the high-risk area of northeastern Thailand. We found that infection with O. viverrini and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) was highly associated with CCA. The risk of CCA in individuals with both of these conditions was higher than in individuals with only one of them.
