Distribution of poor quality medicines are an increasing global concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the effectiveness of antimicrobials can be a matter of life-or-death for patients with malaria and other potentially fatal infectious diseases. Substandard and falsified antimalarial drugs, including artemisinin-based combination therapies are widely distributed across LMICs. This endangers patients and in the longer term threatens malaria control and elimination campaigns by promoting the development of drug resistance. New field detection devices are increasingly available and could enhance the inspection process with prompt and actionable, real-time results. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the implementation of six portable devices for medicine quality screening during pharmacy post-market surveillances in Laos. This analysis conservatively focused only on the benefits of these devices in detecting substandard and falsified artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), measured in terms of health outcomes for malaria patients obtaining treatment from pharmacies. Our findings suggest that using these portable devices for routine surveillance of ACT quality is likely to be cost-effective. Policy-makers and regulators might therefore consider investment in these field detection devices to minimise undesired health and economic burdens associated with substandard and falsified medicines.
