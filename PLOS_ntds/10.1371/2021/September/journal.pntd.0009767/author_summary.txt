Vector Borne Diseases (VBDs) are considered emerging and re-emerging diseases that represent a global burden. Diagnosis of these diseases is challenging due to nonspecific febrile illness, difficulty of isolation, and cross-reactivity of serological methods. Therefore, the current study is the first large-scale epidemiological study in which molecular screening and characterization of multiple vector-borne pathogens in different animal hosts were performed to better understand the endemicity of VBDs in Egypt. We detected for the first time Anaplasma centrale, An. ovis, a novel An. platys-like and Borrelia theileri in cattle, a new An. platys-like in buffaloes, An. marginale, An. ovis, a new An. platys-like and Bo. theileri in sheep, An. platys, a new An. platys-like and Setaria digitata in camels and Rickettsia africae-like, An. platys, Dirofilaria repens and Acanthocheilonema reconditum in dogs, in Egypt. These results imply that ruminants and dogs in Egypt are reservoirs for several neglected, emerging and re-emerging potentially new vector-borne pathogens that have significant implications in human health.
