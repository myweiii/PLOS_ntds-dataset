Schistosome parasites infect more than 200 million people worldwide, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people are at-risk for infection by multiple schistosome species simultaneously. To reduce the global burden of schistosomiasis, control of the parasites’ intermediate host–specific species of freshwater snails–has been elevated in priority to complement mass drug administration campaigns in endemic areas. To maximize the efficacy and efficiency of snail control efforts, a better understanding of where to target intermediate host snails is badly needed. This includes a better understanding of the spatial scale at which snails in the environment contribute to human infection risk, and, in co-endemic settings, how ecological determinants of infection risk vary by schistosome species. We used quantitative snail sampling and remotely-sensed data at 16 villages in the Senegal River Basin to compare and contrast ecological correlates and spatial scales of infection risk from freshwater snails that transmit Schistosoma haematobium versus S. mansoni. We found that infection risk for S. haematobium was associated with snail habitat at a larger spatial radius than is typically considered for schistosomiasis monitoring and control, whereas infection risk for S. mansoni was not positively correlated with snail habitat at any spatial sampling radius, but was associated with small water access sites enclosed by emergent vegetation. Our findings highlight the need to consider the different ecological and environmental factors driving the transmission of each schistosome species in co-endemic landscapes.
