As the most prevalent mosquito-borne infection in the world, the dengue fever (DF) outbreaks were increasingly serious in China in recent years. In particular, almost 85% of the total cases in the mainland China were reported in the PRD region, which has been attributed in previous studies to its suitable subtropical climate with hot, wet summers and mild autumns, as well as the highest urbanization, crowded and large floating population in some informal urban settlements. In consideration of an expected rapid socioeconomic development in the PRD region in the future, the climatic and socioeconomic variables were comprehensively integrated into the ecological niche models (ENM) for projecting the spatial distribution of DF risk in 2050 and 2070. The results showed that more detailed geographic distribution of DF risk zones (grids) was appropriately identified for the current and future scenarios through the models aggregating both climatic and socioeconomic variables. In comparison, the socioeconomic variables presented better capability of identifying the risk zones in detail. Along with continuously rapid socioeconomic development and global warming in the future, the PRD region may be confronted by increasing zones and population of high/moderate DF risk, as well as their spatial expansion during the 2050 and 2070. Accordingly, a forward-looking public health planning should be appropriately made so as to address the DF risk posed by global warming and the expected socioeconomic growth in this region in the future.
