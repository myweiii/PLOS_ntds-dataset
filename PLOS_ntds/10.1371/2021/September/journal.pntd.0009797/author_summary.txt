Many insect-borne diseases are controlled by methods that kill the insects responsible for disease transmission. Estimating the age structure of populations of disease-transmitting insects provides information on mortality rates and on the capacity of the population to maintain disease transmission, and should form part of the detailed monitoring that occurs in the wake of control programmes, yet tools for obtaining estimates of individual age remain limited. We investigate the potential of using markers of gene expression to predict age in tsetse flies, which are the vectors of deadly and economically damaging African trypanosomiases, such as sleeping sickness. We use RNA sequencing to identify candidate genes, and test their accuracy in laboratory-reared tsetse flies of known age. Measuring the expression of six genes was sufficient to obtain a prediction of age with root mean squared error of less than 8 days, while just two genes were sufficient to classify flies into age categories of â‰¤15 and >15 days old. Further testing of these markers in field-caught samples and in other species will determine the accuracy of these markers in the field.
