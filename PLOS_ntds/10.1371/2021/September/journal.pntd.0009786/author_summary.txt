Arboviral infection in humans and animals is on the rise globally due to expansion of vector habitats. Despite the economic and social impact of diseases caused by arboviral infection such as chikungunya, dengue, and Rift Valley fever, little is known in terms of community knowledge, beliefs, and management. Evaluating community knowledge, beliefs, and management practices of arboviral diseases is important for better policy guidance and public health investment. We conducted a survey in Kenyaâ€™s three hotspot counties of Baringo, Kwale, and Kilifi to understand the factors influencing knowledge, beliefs, and management of arboviral diseases. We found low levels of knowledge and poor managerial skills of arboviral diseases that were largely driven by access to information and asset ownership. Thus, community sensitization through improved access to information is important in increasing awareness and increase the management of arboviral diseases among rural communities in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries.
