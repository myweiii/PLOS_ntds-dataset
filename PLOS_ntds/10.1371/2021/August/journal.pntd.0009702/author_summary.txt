Annually, about 2.7 million snakebite envenomings occur globally. Treatment requires the use of antivenom, and often additional care to treat envenoming symptoms or side effects of antivenom use is also needed. Considering snakebite is common in Kenya but evidence from the ground is scarce, we set out to collect data on the availability, affordability, and stock-outs of antivenom and other commodities commonly used in the treatment of snakebite. We found that overall availability of snakebite commodities was low in Kenya, with antivenom available at 45% of public facilities, and less than 20% of private facilities. The snakebite commodities were also commonly stocked out, which seemed to have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Affordability was not a problem in the public sector, where commodities were free for the patient. In the private sector, especially antivenom was unaffordable. These results highlight that the biggest issue with access to snakebite care in both the public and private sectors of Kenya was related to availability of commodities. Efforts to improve access to snakebite care in Kenya should focus on ensuring availability of the commodities at both lower- and higher-level facilities, and improving the supply chain to reduce stock-outs.
