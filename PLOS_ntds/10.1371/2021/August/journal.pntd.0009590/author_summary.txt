Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by thin worms transmitted to humans by the bites of mosquitoes. LF is a leading cause of disability globally, resulting from the long-term physical (swelling of legs and genitals) and psycho-social impacts on affected individuals. The Dominican Republic is one of four LF-endemic countries in the Americas. This report describes the efforts to eliminate the disease in the country, including a review of disease mapping and implementation of mass drug administration (MDA)—the provision of safe and effective medicine to at-risk communities—to interrupt parasite transmission. Particular emphasis is given to program planning and community mobilization for MDA due to the divergent environments of endemic foci, which ranged from rural agricultural regions to densely populated urban neighborhoods. Impact evaluation data for each focus demonstrates interruption of LF transmission and that criteria to stop MDA have been met. Finally, plans for post-treatment surveillance and the scale-up of clinical care services for those who remain affected by chronic LF are presented—required elements for eliminating LF as a public health problem.
