Coagulation mechanisms are reported to be affected in dengue illness and evidenced by prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). The magnitude of prolonged APTT and PT among patients with dengue fever infection were 42.91% (95% CI: 30.95, 54.87) I2 = 99.1% and 16.48% (95% CI: 10.95, 22.01) I2 = 97.0%, respectively. The magnitude of thrombocytopenia among dengue fever patients was 70.29% (95% CI: 62.69, 77.89) I2 = 99.3%.Screening and early correction of coagulation abnormalities may be helpful to reduce further complications in those patients.
