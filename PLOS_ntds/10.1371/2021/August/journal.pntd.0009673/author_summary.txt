This study conducted a long-term and systematic study on the epidemiological characteristics of HFRS in Zhejiang Province from 1963 to 2020 through a combination of time and space analysis and epidemiology, aiming to analyze the distribution characteristics of HFRS and explore the high incidence of epidemics in Zhejiang Province Regional influence. From 1963 to 2020, all 11 prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang Province reported HFRS cases, and the morbidity and mortality rates decreased significantly. However, the geographical distribution of endemic areas has been expanding to eastern Zhejiang Province. Moreover, the age of high-risk groups increases over time. Although the incidence rate has declined in recent years, HFRS is still a huge threat to peopleâ€™s health. As the incidence rate changes, some epidemiological characteristics have also changed. Comprehensive interventions should also be adjusted, including rodent control in endemic areas, health education, vaccination, and improved detection and diagnosis capabilities for HFRS epidemiological changes.
