Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex disease for which a clear understanding of clinical manifestations is needed to avoid misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and severe complications. The development of a laboratory test able to assess CE cyst viability and reactivation over time would facilitate the classification of patients and cysts, their rational assignment to a clinical management option and the implementation of a regular follow-up. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of a cytokine-based whole-blood test to detect the reactivation and the viability of hepatic CE cysts. The results showed that IL-4-response to AgB is not modulated over-time after treatment, while, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, FGF levels significantly decreased in active CE during follow-up. Additional studies are needed to understand whether these findings might have a clinical significance for patients’ follow-up.
