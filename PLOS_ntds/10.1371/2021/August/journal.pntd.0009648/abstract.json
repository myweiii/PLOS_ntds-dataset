    "Background": "Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex disease for which clear understanding of clinical manifestations is needed to avoid misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and severe complications. We evaluated the accuracy of a whole-blood stimulation test based on Interleukin (IL)-4 detection in response to Antigen B (AgB) of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato to discriminate cyst viability and detect cyst reactivation in patients with hepatic CE.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Thirty patients with CE3b cysts and 37 patients with spontaneously-inactivated CE4-CE5 cysts were recruited (T0). After enrollment, 5 patients with CE3b cysts received albendazole, resulting in cyst solidification (CE4) in 4/5. Within a two-year follow-up, the whole-blood test was repeated at two time-points, in \u226514 (T1) and in \u22654 (T2) patients per group. IL-4 and a panel of other soluble factors were measured in the stimulated plasma.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Whole-blood IL-4-response to AgB is significantly higher in patients with active compared to inactive CE but apparently not modulated over time after treatment. On the contrary, the levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, FGF significantly decreased in active CE during follow-up. Additional studies are needed to understand whether these findings might have a clinical significance for patients\u2019 follow-up."
