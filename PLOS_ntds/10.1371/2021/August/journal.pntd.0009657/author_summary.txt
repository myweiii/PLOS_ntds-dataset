Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease and responsible for an estimated 130,000 deaths per year. Coagulopathy is the commonest clinical manifestation of systemic snakebite envenoming and is indicative of a need for antivenom. The 20WBCT is a simple, cheap and quick bedside clotting test devised to detect coagulopathy after snakebite. The test is used widely and is incorporated in multiple national and WHO guidelines. However, following a publication questioning its diagnostic accuracy, there is a lack of consensus regarding its diagnostic accuracy and utility. In this review, we conclude that the 20WBCT is capable of detecting coagulopathy following snakebite with high specificity and acceptable sensitivity. Diagnostic test accuracy of the 20WBCT is improved when assessing for the presence of severe coagulopathy. Inclusion of data in this analysis from a variety of countries, make the findings widely applicable. However, the heterogeneity in study findings indicates the need for local assessment of external validity. The results of this study support the WHO guidelines that recommend its continued use in the absence of conventional laboratory clotting assays. Urgent efforts are required to identify an optimal method of detecting systemic snakebite envenoming and the response to treatment through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of venom and antivenom.
