Snakebite is a major public health concern that causes extensive death and disability in the tropical world. Variation in venom composition causes major challenges for snakebite therapy by typically restricting antivenom efficacy to only the few snake species that each product was designed against, meaning that many geographically restricted therapeutics are manufactured for different parts of the world. In this study, we explored the feasibility of generating a global pathology-specific antivenom by using two different sets of haemotoxic venoms as immunogens, one including seven venoms and the other twelve venoms, to generate ovine polyclonal antibodies. Our in vitro immunological cross-reactivity and venom functional-neutralisation findings demonstrated broadly comparable venom recognition and inhibition against the various venom immunogens, irrespective of whether they were included in the immunising mixture. However, assessments of murine in vivo protection against venom-induced lethality revealed that the antivenom generated with fewer immunogens outperformed the comparator, and provided broader preclinical efficacy, even against some venoms not used to raise the antibodies. These findings suggest that careful selection of venoms used as immunogens is crucial for maintaining antivenom potency, and that a small subset of venoms may be capable of generating an antivenom with potential global efficacy against a specific pathology commonly observed after snakebite.
