Leprosy remains an important public health problem with many new leprosy patients diagnosed with visible physical deformities, indicating a long delay in the detection of cases. For effective prevention programs, it is important to know the factors at the level of the individual and the community that contribute to the delay. We reviewed all published studies that reported individual and community factors related to delayed case detection in leprosy and included 27 studies in our analysis, published between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2021. Health-service-seeking behavior was the most common factor associated with delay in case detection. The most common individual factors were older age, being male, having a lower disease-symptom perception, having multibacillary leprosy, and lack of knowledge about leprosy. The most common socioeconomic factors were living in a rural area, performing agricultural labor, and being unemployed. Stigma was the most common social and community factor associated with detection delay.
The presence of physical disability in newly diagnosed leprosy patients is clearly related to the delay in detecting these patients. Leprosy control interventions should take factors related to detection delay into account more comprehensively. Also, there is a need to study health service-related factors that contribute to detection delay of leprosy patients.
