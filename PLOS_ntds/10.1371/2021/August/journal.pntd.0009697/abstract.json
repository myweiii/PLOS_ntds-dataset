    "Background": "Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects ~6\u20137 million people worldwide. Significant limitations still exist in our understanding of CD. Harnessing individual participant data (IPD) from studies could support more in-depth analyses to address the many outstanding research questions. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics and treatment practices of clinical studies in CD and assess the breadth and availability of research data for the potential establishment of a data-sharing platform.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This review includes prospective CD clinical studies published after 1997 with patients receiving a trypanocidal treatment. The following electronic databases and clinical trial registry platforms were searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scielo, Clintrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This review demonstrates the heterogeneity of clinical practice in CD treatment and in the conduct of clinical studies. The sheer volume of potential IPD identified demonstrates the potential for development of an IPD platform for CD and that such efforts would enable in-depth analyses to optimise the limited pharmacopoeia of CD and inform prospective data collection."
