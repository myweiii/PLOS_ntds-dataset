In resource limited settings there is a pressing need for more efficient, more targeted ways of controlling transmission and preventing outbreaks. One option is to use case-area targeted interventions (CATI) that are focussed on areas that have recently reported disease cases. The effectiveness of such CATI strategies is highly dependent on how the disease spreads. Despite CATI strategies being widely used to control the vector-transmitted disease dengue, little evidence underpins its effectiveness.
In this analysis we formulate a mathematical model designed to test the effectiveness of CATI strategies for dengue control in Singapore- a best case test scenario for the approach. Simulation from this model suggested CATI are likely to be effective for dengue, but need to have large (250m+) radii around index cases and may not be suitable in higher transmission areas.
These results, when combined with limited field evidence of efficacy, suggest that CATI strategies are unlikely to be universally applicable dengue control tools. Only once high coverage with other (non-reactive) interventions has been achieved and comprehensive rapid disease surveillance has been established are CATI strategies likely to become efficient methods of disease control.
