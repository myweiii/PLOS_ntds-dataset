Sporotrichosis is an infectious disease caused by fungi belonging to Sporothrix species. These microorganisms can be found in nature, specifically in the soil and decomposing wood. In the past, sporotrichosis was known as a “rose gardener’s disease”. It is still commonly acquired through injuries with plant debris in most countries around the world. However, a remarkable host shift has happened, allowing Sporothrix to survive in feline hosts (domestic cats) in Brazil. Therefore, the novel discovered fungal species was named Sporothrix brasiliensis. This fungus can grow at a cat´s body temperature (approximately 39°C) and may be found on their claws, blood, and saliva. Because these animals usually bite and scratch each other and their owners, an alternative route of transmission emerged in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the late nineties. Since then, the disease has become an epidemic, and here we demonstrated that it is spreading towards the Northeast region of the country (2,860 km away from Rio de Janeiro). One hundred and twenty one patients were diagnosed with cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, mainly women who work as cleaners or house cleaners and housewives. Nevertheless, all the patients were successfully treated mainly with an antifungal drug called itraconazole.
