We are honored to submit an original research article entitled “Cutaneous anthrax associated with handling carcasses of animals that died suddenly of unknown cause: Arua District, Uganda, January 2015–August 2017”. Anthrax is a vaccine-preventable disease that can be transmitted to humans from infected animals. Our paper is based on 68 cutaneous anthrax case-patients and cases occurred throughout the three-year period, peaking during dry seasons in Arua District of Uganda. All cases occurred following sudden livestock deaths in the villages. Our findings are based on outbreak investigation which gives a better representation of the actual situation. Our article looks at the scope of the anthrax outbreak, exposures associated with illness, and evidence-based control measures. In this manuscript, we show that exposure to carcasses of animals that died suddenly was a risk factor for cutaneous anthrax in Arua District during 2015–2017. We believe the content and objectives of our work provide knowledge on epidemiology of cutaneous anthrax.
