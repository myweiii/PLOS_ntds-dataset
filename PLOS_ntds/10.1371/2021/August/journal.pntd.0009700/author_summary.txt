Leprosy remains an important public health problem that affects vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we estimated how many cases were not detected in each Brazilian microregion by the surveillance system during the period of 2007 until 2015. Using a mathematical model, we found out that around 10% of the estimated number of cases occurring in the country in the study period were missed by the health system, and this represented over 33 thousand cases overall. These findings are important as undetected and therefore untreated cases can progress and lead to lifelong disabilities. In addition, missing cases prevents the health system from evaluating exposed contacts, which could lead to further delays in diagnosis. Describing the magnitude, location and correlates of leprosy underreporting at the microregional level will inform the efforts of policymakers and program managers in designing interventions and allocating resources to achieve leprosy control targets.
