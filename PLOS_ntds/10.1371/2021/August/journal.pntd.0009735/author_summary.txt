Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne disease of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) origin that shares similar symptoms with malaria fever. The symptoms include fever, joint pains, muscle pains, skin rashes and headache. There is a paucity of information about CHIKV epidemiology in Ghana although the mosquito vector (Aedes) responsible for the transmission is present in the country. Ghanaâ€™s neighbours (Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso) have also reported isolated cases of CHIKV infections. The authors sought to find evidence of the circulation of CHIKV among suspected malaria patients in Ghana and to shed light on the importance of the investigation of non-malaria causes of fever such as chikungunya fever. And the possible inclusion of chikungunya fever in the differential diagnoses of unexplained febrile cases in Ghana. We found out that 6% of the 600 people studied had antibodies to the CHIKV i.e. they were previously infected with CHIKV. Malaria prevalence was 32.3% among the study participants. The rate of malaria-chikungunya co-infections was 1.8% among the study participants. Our findings show a low-level exposure to the CHIKV suggesting the virus is circulating and potentially causing morbidity in Ghana that may be misdiagnosed as malaria.
