Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance. The performance of diagnostic tests is variable in different epidemiological settings. Therefore, estimating the setting-specific performance of diagnostic tests for Brucella spp. exposure is important in generating robust surveillance data. The performance of the Rose Bengal plate test (RBT) and a competitive ELISA (cELISA) in detecting Brucella spp. exposure at the individual animal-level for cattle, sheep, and goats from Tanzania was estimated. The RBT and cELISA median estimates for specificity were consistently high, whereas median estimates for sensitivity were more variable between tests and across livestock species. A parallel diagnostic testing approach (i.e., testing all animals by both RBT and cELISA, where a sample positive by either test was considered a parallel positive) gave the best overall test performance, as compared to a series approach (i.e., testing all animals by RBT, with RBT positive animals confirmed by cELISA, where a sample positive for both RBT and cELISA was considered a series positive). There is a need to further investigate strategies for implementing parallel testing at the herd- and flock-level. Our findings can assist in generating robust estimates for Brucella spp. exposure for livestock in Tanzania and similar settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The adoption of locally evaluated robust diagnostic tests in surveillance is an important step towards the prevention and control of brucellosis.
