Fasciola hepatica, a liver parasite, infects a wide variety of hosts, mostly ruminants. Ruminant infections with this parasite cause economic losses worldwide, mainly in livestock. Given its importance, much research has been carried out on this parasite, a lot of which has focused on its ability to alter the immune responses of its host. However, little is known about the numerous other interactions it has with the host and how they might affect the hostâ€™s intestinal microbiota. Here, we observed a reduction in the abundance of microorganisms associated with the fermentation and digestion of vegetable fiber, two important processes in animal health and productivity. Therefore, it is possible that F. hepatica, in addition to the previously documented liver alterations, also generates changes in the intestinal microbiota that may impact its bovine host. These findings are a small first step in the research of microbial populations in cattle infected with liver helminths which open the door to further research aimed at identifying alternative treatments for parasites such as F. hepatica.
