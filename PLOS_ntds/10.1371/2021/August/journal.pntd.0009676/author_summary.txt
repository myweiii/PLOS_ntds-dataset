Phlebotomines are the subject of much research because of the role of their females as the only proven natural vectors of Leishmania species, the parasitic protozoans that are the causative agents of the neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis. The lack of ecology knowledge of immature stages of this vector limits their prevention and control strategies. We identified the rural breeding environments of immature stages of Ny. whitmani, that is the vector of tegumentary leishmaniasis in the north of Misiones province, Argentina, and compared the environmental and structural characteristics of those sites. We also identified the season of greatest emergence and its relationship with adult abundance. These results open the possibility of experimental evaluation of environmental management practices for prevention and control of the immature stages through strategies different from the ones usually conducted for adults.
