    "Background": "Previous studies exploring the factors associated with the incidence of syphilis have mostly focused on individual-level factors. However, recent evidence has indicated that social-level factors, such as sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, also affect the incidence of syphilis. Studies on the sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors associated with syphilis incidence are scarce, and they have rarely controlled for spatial effects, even though syphilis shows spatial autocorrelation.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Syphilis data from 21 cities in Guangdong province between 2005 and 2017 were provided by the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System. The incidence time series, incidence map, and space-time scanning data were used to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution. The spatial panel data model was then applied to explore the relationship between sociodemographic factors (population density, net migration rate, male:female ratio, and the number of health institutions per 1,000 residents), socioeconomic factors (gross domestic product per capita, the proportion of secondary/tertiary industry), and the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis after controlling for spatial effects. The incidence of syphilis increased slowly from 2005 (11.91 per 100,000) to 2011 (13.42 per 100,000) and then began to decrease, reaching 6.55 per 100,000 in 2017. High-risk clusters of syphilis tended to shift from developed areas to underdeveloped areas. An inverted U-shaped relationship was found between syphilis incidence and gross domestic product per capita. Moreover, syphilis incidence was significantly associated with population density (β = 2.844, P = 0.006), the number of health institutions per 1,000 residents (β = -0.095, P = 0.007), and the net migration rate (β = -0.219, P = 0.002).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our findings suggest that the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis first increase before decreasing as economic development increases further. These results emphasize the necessity to prevent syphilis in regions at the early stages of economic growth."
