Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), targets the skin and nerves and often results in irreversible disabilities as well as social exclusion. Though the disease can be efficiently treated, leprosy elimination is hampered by ongoing transmission of M. leprae. Currently, elimination is monitored by the number of new cases. Since only a small percentage of individuals infected with M. leprae develops disease, this does not accommodate monitoring of transmission. Previous studies have shown that antibody levels against M. leprae in blood correspond to the bacterial load in an individual and can be used as a proxy for infection, although antibodies cannot distinguish between past and present infection. In young children, infection is recent by definition, which allows assessment of more current state of transmission in an area. Thus, this literature review investigated studies on leprosy serology in children without leprosy. Our findings underscore that young children are a fitting group for up-to-date monitoring of M. leprae transmission in an area as seropositivity is inversely related with age. Importantly, a standardized, field-friendly test quantitatively measuring anti-M. leprae antibodies should be applied for population screening to monitor the status of transmission and thereby elimination in an area.
