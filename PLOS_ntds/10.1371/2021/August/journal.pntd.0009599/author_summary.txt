Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital infection and in endemic areas schistosomiasis is usually contracted during the first 5 years of life, thus it is critical to look at how the infection manifests in this age group. Prompt diagnosis of acute schistosomiasis is required to benefit the individuals and provide opportunities for early treatment and public health intervention. The study examined symptoms that correlated with early disease progression and risk scored to develop an easy to use clinical algorithm to identify early S. haematobium infection cases. The children received standard full clinical evaluations by clinicians who were blinded from schistosomiasis diagnosis by parasitological examination. An algorithm was created based on the predictor risk scores and participants had the following prodromal signs and symptoms; pruritic rash, abdominal pain, pallor, abdominal pain, inguinal lymphadenopathy and a history of facial/body swelling within the previous month. A risk score model, diagnostic algorithm, was created that compared to urine dipstick and parasitology. This study demonstrates the clinical signs and symptoms associated with early S. haematobium infection in pre-school age children. These prodromal signs and symptoms pave way for early intervention and management, thus decreasing the harm of late diagnosis common in populations from endemic areas.
