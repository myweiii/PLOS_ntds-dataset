    "Background": "Hematocrit measurement has been an indispensable tool for monitoring plasma leakage and bleeding in dengue patients. However, hematocrit measurement by automated methods is hampered by frequent venipunctures. Utility of point-of-care hemoglobin (POC-Hb) test for monitoring dengue patients has not been established. We evaluated the relationship between hemoglobin measured by POC-Hb testing and hematocrit measured by the automated method in adult dengue patients.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "Adult dengue patients were recruited at two university hospitals in Thailand from October 2019 to December 2020. POC-Hb test was performed using capillary blood simultaneously with venipuncture to obtain whole blood for an automated complete blood count (CBC) analysis. The correlation of hemoglobin and hematocrit measurement was evaluated. A total of 44 dengue patients were enrolled. Twenty-nine patients (65.9%) were female, with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range 22–41). Of the enrolled patients, 30 (68.2%), 11 (25.0%), and 3 (6.8%) were classified as dengue without warning signs, with warning signs, and severe dengue, respectively. Seven patients (15.9%) had hemoconcentration, and five patients (11.3%) had bleeding. A total of 216 pairs of POC-Hb and CBC were evaluated. A significant positive correlation was observed between hemoglobin measured by POC-Hb testing and hematocrit measured by an automated CBC (r = 0.869, p <0.001). Bland-Altman analysis between hemoglobin measured by POC-Hb testing and an automated CBC showed a bias of -0.43 (95% limit of agreement of -1.81 and 0.95). Using the cutoff of POC-Hb ≥20% as a criteria for hemoconcentration, the sensitivity and specificity of hemoconcentration detected by POC-Hb device were 71.4% and 100.0%, respectively.",
    "Conclusions": "Hemoglobin measurement by POC-Hb testing has a strong correlation with hematocrit in adult patients with dengue fever. However, the sensitivity in detecting hemoconcentration is fair. The adjunct use of capillary POC-Hb testing can decrease the frequency of venipuncture. Further study in children is encouraged."
