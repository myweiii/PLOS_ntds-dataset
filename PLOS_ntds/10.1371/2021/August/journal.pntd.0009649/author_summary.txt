G6PD deficiency affects an estimated 500 million people worldwide and is prevalent in many malaria-endemic settings. People with G6PD deficiency are at risk of hemolysis when exposed to certain medications, including 8-aminoquinoline drugs used to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. Increased access to testing for G6PD deficiency at or near the point of care is critical for expanding the safe treatment of P. vivax malaria. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a point-of-care, semi-quantitative test for G6PD deficiency, the STANDARD G6PD Test, in a malaria-endemic setting in Brazil. The test was evaluated on both capillary and venous blood samples across a broad range of operating temperatures. The findings show that the STANDARD G6PD Test performed equivalently to the reference test in its ability to diagnose G6PD deficiency at the point of care. The STANDARD G6PD Test is a promising tool to aid in detecting G6PD deficiency at the point of care in Brazil.
