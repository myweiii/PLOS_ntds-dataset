Chagas Disease (CD) is a chronic, neglected infectious disease that affects several low-to-middle income countries. Besides its usual vector transmission, the etiological agent (Trypanosoma cruzi) can be transmitted through blood transfusion, so that migration from individuals with CD to Europe and North America. The scarcity and lack of evidence for therapeutic options is a major challenge for clinical approach of CD patients. Most of those patients are diagnosed while in asymptomatic, indeterminate chronic form (ICF). Our study aimed at identifying factors associated with progression from ICF to cardiac or digestive disorders. We studied a cohort of 379 IFC patients in inner Brazil, of which 87 and 100 developed cardiac and digestive disorders. In univariate and multivariable analyses, the use of Benznidazole (one of the few drugs used for CD therapy) was statistically protective for progression to cardiac, but not to digestive CD forms. These findings emphasize the importance of novel research aimed at developing more effective therapeutic options.
