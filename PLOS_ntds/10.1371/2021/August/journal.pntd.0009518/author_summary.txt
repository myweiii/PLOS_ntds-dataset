Antivenom is the first-choice treatment of systemic snake envenoming that annually affects between 1.8â€“2.7 million victims globally. Access to antivenom is especially poor for those in greatest need because they typically reside in impoverished, rural tropical communities dependent upon health facilities with limited resources. In addition, clinical treatment of snakebite victims is further complicated by early adverse reactions (EARs) to antivenom-treatment. The causes of antivenom-associated EARs are poorly understood and under-researched. Despite antivenom producers instituting costly remedial manufacturing steps (removal of pyrogens and other impurities) to make their products safer, EARs still affect a high proportion of antivenom-treated patients. Instigated by anecdotal observations to the corresponding author from clinicians in rural Nigerian hospitals that snakebite victims of cattle-herding occupation, and especially those of Fulani ethnicity, suffer more frequent EARs than other groups, this cross-sectional study identified that risks of developing EARs to antivenom treatment include the ethnicity and pastoral lifestyle of snakebite patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify that EARs to antivenom-treatment include factors associated with the victim, as well as factors related to the antivenom itself. We emphasise the need for more research on the causes of adverse reactions to antivenom so that strategies to reduce incidence can be implemented.
