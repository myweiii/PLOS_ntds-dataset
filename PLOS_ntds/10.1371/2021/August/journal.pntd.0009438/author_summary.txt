The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito which is now established in at least 40 states in the USA. Lack of efficient surveillance and control methods against Ae. albopictus, in addition to human-aided accidental transportations, have played a great role in its rapid expansion. Although surveillance measures are becoming more systematic and effective, control of this species still poses a great challenge. Aedes albopictus is difficult to control in the larval stage because it primarily develops in artificial containers that are widespread in peridomestic habitats. These habitats are not only ubiquitous in these environments, they are also cryptic, inaccessible, and extremely difficult to control. Therefore, control of Ae. albopictus in these environments often relies on adult control measures which utilize insecticides dispersed through ultra-low volume equipment as a cold aerosol space spray. These adulticide applications are often conducted at night against endemic mosquito species which are primarily active between dawn and dusk. However, since Ae. albopictus has been traditionally classified as a day-biting mosquito, mosquito control specialists have had doubts about the efficacy of a nocturnal application against a diurnally active mosquito. These uncertainties about intervention efforts become even more important during public health outbreaks of mosquito-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue, or Zika viruses when protection of public health is of paramount importance in peridomestic habitats. Our investigations provide evidence that Ae. albopictus exhibits activity throughout the day and night and that nighttime adulticide applications may indeed be effective against this species, and should not be disregarded.
