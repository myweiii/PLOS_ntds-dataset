Dengue virus causes substantial suffering in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with roughly 400 million infections and 40,000 deaths each year. In 2020, we witnessed unprecedented changes in human movement as the world tried to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including in countries that regularly experience dengue epidemics, such as Thailand and Peru. These changes could affect transmission of dengue virus, though it is unclear whether transmission will decrease, as people reduce their movements between houses, or increase, as people spend more time at home and campaigns to control the mosquito vector of dengue virus are interrupted. We used a simulation model to estimate the impact of these changes on dengue virus transmission. Our model describes the locations of buildings and the movement of people between them, allowing us to directly estimate what happens when human movement patterns change. We found that as people spend more time at home, transmission is likely to increase moderately. If these changes also lead to disruption to vector control, the magnitude of the increase is greater. Our results reinforce concerns about the complexity of public health responses to multiple overlapping epidemics and support the need for policy makers and health authorities to think holistically in their intervention planning.
