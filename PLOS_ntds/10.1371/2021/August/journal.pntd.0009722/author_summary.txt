Tungiasis is a disease caused by Tunga penetrans that affects regions with low socioeconomic status and a lack of proper sanitation. The disease usually has a self-limiting course or can be cured by simple extraction, but complications are not uncommon. In vulnerable populations, such as indigenous communities, children and people with disseminated tungiasis, the development of new treatment strategies is essential for the prevention of undesirable secondary outcomes. We performed a comprehensive systematic review of the literature by searching the most important scientific databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scielo and LILACS BVS. We aimed to assess the efficacy of topical, oral and surgical interventions for the treatment of tungiasis. We included 19 articles, 9 of which were classified as clinical trials. Six clinical trials evaluated topical products for the treatment of tungiasis; 2 evaluated dimeticone-based compounds and reported positive results in lesion reduction and cure. None reported significant adverse reactions. We concluded that, although mechanical extraction is the most commonly used treatment, there is sufficient evidence supporting the use of occlusive agents, especially manufactured dimeticone-based products.
