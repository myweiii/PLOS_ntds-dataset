Dengue fever is a mosquito borne viral disease caused by a single stranded RNA virus with four serotypes. DENV infection can cause various diseases, such as breakbone fever, haemorrhagic fever, and shock syndrome. As one of the most viral diseases leading to incidence rate and mortality in animal arthropods, Dengue fever has become an increasingly serious global health threat. However, the pathogenesis of dengue fever has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we used bioinformatics analysis to identify potential biomarkers associated with dengue fever and elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we predicted that IFI44L and IFI6 might be potential biomarkers of DENV infection. This finding provides a promising target for the treatment of dengue fever to a certain extent. In addition, the Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network were implemented to analyze the key differentially expressed genes after DENV infection, and the related mechanisms were illuminated by this study.
