Infection with Blastocystis, a neglected enteric pathogen, is frequently reported in tropical and sub-tropical countries. However, the epidemiology, pathogenicity and associated outcomes of Blastocystis in relation to enteric infections and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) remain inconclusive. In this study, the authors investigated the factors associated with Blastocystis infection and examined its association with enteric infections as well as fecal biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction among slum-dwelling malnourished adults in Bangladesh. The study findings exhibited that nearly 80% of the participants were infected with Blastocystis demonstrating a positive association with crowded living conditions. The authors observed a positive association of Blastocystis with atypical strain of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Trichuris trichiura. The study results also corroborate that infection with Blastocystis had significant negative association with alpha-1 antitrypsin and Reg1B concentrations measured in the stool samples of the study participants. The findings of this study would help to reveal the pathogenic potential of Blastocystis and determine its role in contributing to altered gut health as well as EED in malnourished adults living in resource limited environments.
