Infections with T. spiralis that lives in host muscles for long periods of time are commonly difficult to diagnosis without causing a strong immune response or symptoms. The habit of eating raw/undercooked pork meat accidentally introduces humans into the exposure of T. spiralis that circulates between herds and rodents. There is an urgent need for serological antibody test of T. spiralis to monitor the infection of humans as well as hosts in the food chain, which is restricted by the mixture type of current used antigens and species-specific secondary antibodies for different hosts. We developed a novel recombinant cystatin-like protein-based competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rCLP-cELISA) employing monoclonal antibody. The proposed method showed considerable sensitivity and specificity in filed swine sera and human serum samples with good versatility in mice. Taking advantage of its controllable quality stability, the rCLP-cELISA had potential applications for screening of T. spiralis infections for multihost sera in one test. With the development of monoclonal antibody modification strategies and the discovery of antigenic proteins from parasitic pathogens, the proposed competition ELISA also provides useful reference for the improvement of serological assay for monitoring the exposure of zoonotic parasites.
