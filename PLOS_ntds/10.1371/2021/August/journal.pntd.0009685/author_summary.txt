These data from Laos strongly support the hypothesis that murine typhus and scrub typhus are more urban and rural diseases, respectively. Risks of scrub typhus were associated with visiting rice fields and forests, with surface flooding and higher vegetation density. Risks of murine typhus were living in Vientiane City and not having visited rice fields and forests. Homes of patients with scrub typhus were consistently further away from the city centre and from roads than for those of patients with murine typhus. With the outward spread of higher house density with city expansion during the study, murine typhus spread outwards whilst scrub typhus receded. Temporal trends in incidence were associated, for murine typhus, with higher temperature and, for scrub typhus, with higher rainfall, humidity and flooding. In areas where both diseases are found, these data suggest that residence, occupational and climatic differential risks are useful for assisting with identifying patients. The data also suggest that as cities further enlarge, high risk areas for murine typhus will expand. With global heating and risks of attendant higher precipitation, these data also suggest that the incidence and spatial distribution of both murine typhus and scrub typhus will increase.
