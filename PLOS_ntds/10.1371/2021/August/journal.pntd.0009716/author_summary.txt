The study was conducted in a Female Penitentiary-Brazil. The Leprosy Suspicion Questionnaire (LSQ) was administered to all the inmates who also underwent, specialized dermato-neurological exam, and anti-PGL-I serology. We evaluated 404 female inmates, 14 new cases were diagnosed (LG-leprosy group), and 390 constituted the Non-Leprosy group (NLG), a new case detection rate of 3.4%. The confinement time was shorter than the time of leprosy incubation. Leprosy cases were followed up during multidrug therapy and it showed clinical improvement. Regarding the LSQ, the most important neurological symptoms were Q1–numbness, Q3–anesthetized areas, Q5–Stinging sensation, and Q7–pain in the nerves, while Q4-spots were fewer. When more than one question was marked, it meant a 12.8 higher chance to get leprosy. The high anti-PGL-I seropositivity among females was higher in the LG than in the NLG. Afterwards, we reevaluated the inmates and 6 additional leprosy cases were diagnosed in two visits. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments demonstrated that the lower limbs (32.2%) were more affected than the upper limbs (25%) with improvement during the follow-up. Thus, our study in this population showed hidden leprosy as in the male prison. It also showed how efficient the search by a specialized staff with the aid of LSQ, as an auxiliary tracking tool, is.
