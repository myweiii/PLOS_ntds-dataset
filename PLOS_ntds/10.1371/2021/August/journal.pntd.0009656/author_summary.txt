As human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is approaching elimination, case management is progressively transferred from specialized teams to front line health care centres. This approach raises practical questions. What clinical symptoms and signs should trigger HAT testing? What rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are suitable for screening? Which unconfirmed serological suspects should be examined further? During this study conducted in Côte d’Ivoire, individuals with sleep disturbances, motor disorders, convulsions, severe weight loss, or psychiatric problems were more often positive in RDTs. These symptoms and signs should trigger referral for HAT screening. Our results confirm appropriateness of the existing HAT screening strategy with SD Bioline HAT or HAT Sero-K-Set having specificities of 97.8% and 98.9%. Subsequent tests on dried blood spots from RDT positives were 93.3% to 98.9% specific, and increased the positive predictive value from below 15% up to 67%. For selection of RDT seropositives for additional parasitological examinations, trypanolysis on dried blood spots is suitable, but could be replaced by ELISA, which can be performed locally. The optimal diagnostic test algorithm for Côte d’Ivoire, in terms of cost-effectiveness, remains to be determined.
