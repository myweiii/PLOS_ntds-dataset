Toxocariasis has been described as a worldwide cosmopolitan anthropozoonosis with high risk to those in in vulnerable populations and particularly during pregnancy and childhood. Although the prevalence of anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies has been extensively studied, risk factors of pregnant women of different ages remains to be established. This study was designed to assess the presence of anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies in pregnant women presented to the public health system in a city of southeastern Brazil, and determine the risk factors for toxocariasis in adolescent and adult pregnant women. Our results show that Toxocara spp. seroprevalence in pregnant women may be influenced by age; with younger age identified as a risk factor for Toxocara spp. seropositivity. Toxocariasis is likely underreported and neglected in adolescent pregnant women; this age group should always be monitored for toxocariasis and correspondent clinical signs, particularly at late pregnancy. This data may be useful as background information for educational programs on toxocariasis prevention in pregnant women, particularly adolescents.
