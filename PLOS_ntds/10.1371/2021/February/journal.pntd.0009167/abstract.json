    "Abstract": "A key issue for persons with leprosy-, lymphatic filariasis- and podoconiosis-related disabilities is the life-long need to practice self-management routines. This is difficult to sustain without regular encouragement and support of others. Family-based support may be a sustainable and feasible strategy to practice self-management routines. This proof of concept study aimed to develop and pilot a family-based intervention to support prevention and self-management of leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis-related disabilities in Ethiopia."
