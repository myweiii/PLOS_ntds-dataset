Brucella abortus (Ba) is an intracellular bacterium that causes zoonotic and clinical problems worldwide. Although the common route of infection is through oral and nasal, the mechanisms toward the gastrointestinal mucosa response is still unexplored. It is well known that microbiota promotes and maintains host intestinal homeostasis during bacterial infections. However, mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects the Ba infection have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we provide significant insights into the relationship between gut microbiota and B. abortus oral infection and demonstrate the gut microbiota contribution to the gut permeability and dissemination of Ba. Furthermore, we investigated the participation of the gut microbiota from Nlrp6 deficient mice, on the gut permeability and Ba infection. Substantial experiments performed, mostly in vivo, showed that gut microbiota alterations promote gut barrier disruption, as indicated by increased gut permeability after Ba oral infection. Thus, our work highlights the role of gut mucosal environment through gut microbiota and Nlrp6 molecule involved in host innate immune responses to Ba infection.
