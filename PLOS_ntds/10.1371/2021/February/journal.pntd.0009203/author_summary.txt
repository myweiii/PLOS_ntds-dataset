The Ebola epidemic of 2014â€“2016 in West Africa was the largest in history, resulting in over 28,000 infections and more than 11,300 deaths across Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. Little is known about the lived experiences of communities, families, and children during and after the epidemic, and this qualitative study sought to better understand these experiences in a community in Sierra Leone. Through focus groups and individual interviews, we discovered that participants endured daily life challenges pertaining to fear, financial distress, and school closures. They also experienced suffering, loss, isolation, grief, and compromised culture, especially regarding funeral traditions. Children expressed being unhappy while schools were closed due to their inability to learn and interact with their classmates. Healthcare workers reported the stigmatization that they experienced, along with fear of an unfamiliar disease that led to the deaths of their colleagues. Distrust in the government, particularly due to their epidemic response, fueled feelings of confusion about Ebola transmission and treatment, and an overall lack of trust in healthcare services. Despite Sierra Leone being declared Ebola-free in March 2016, stigma and fear persisted and community members shared their continuing distrust of the government.
