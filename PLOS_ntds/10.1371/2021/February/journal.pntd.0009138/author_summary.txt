Updated evidence is needed to guide the planning and implementation of appropriate interventions for control of mixed infections involving malaria and worms affecting children living in endemic countries. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to update current knowledge on the magnitude of the burden of dual infections with malaria and worms in children in the developing world. We searched all published articles available in Medline, Embase, Global Health and Web of Science from the database inception until 16 March 2020, without any language restriction. We found 55 eligible studies, and 28 of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. A summary of the evidence synthesis showed that the burden of dual infections involving malaria and worm parasites is high in children and varies significantly across endemic countries. There was a lower risk of P. falciparum infection in children infected with soil transmitted helminths (STH) or S. haematobium or S.mansoni. Conversely, the odds of anaemia were higher in children who had dual infections with Plasmodium and STH parasites than in children with a Plasmodium infection alone while the odds of anaemia were almost equal in children who were co-infected with Plasmodium-Schistosoma compared to those with a Plasmodium infection alone. These findings underscore the need to further understand the epidemiology of malaria-helminth co-infections in order to support implementation of appropriate interventions for control and, ultimately, elimination of the dual infections in children living in endemic countries, especially low and middle-income countries (LMIC).
