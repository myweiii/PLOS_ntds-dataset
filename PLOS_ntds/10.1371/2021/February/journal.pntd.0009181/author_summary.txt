Even though more than 1 billion people are at the risk of leishmaniasis infection, one of the neglected tropical diseases, there is limited access to essential medicines for the treatment of leishmaniasis. We compared the procurement data collected from major procurers with the global needs estimated from the number of cases reported to WHO and the first-line treatment regimen used in each country for the past 5 years to better understand the market landscape and supply and demand dynamics. The results showed imbalances and mismatches in supply and demand at global and national levels. Improved coordination among national leishmaniasis control programmes, procurers, manufacturers and partners is needed to address access barriers. This should include proactive engagement of manufacturers to secure uninterrupted supply of quality-assured medicines, setting up the procurement coordination mechanism with major procurers for the development of joint forecasting and market shaping interventions, and promoting high-level advocacy.
