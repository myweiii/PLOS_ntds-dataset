River blindness affects people living in mostly remote and underserved rural communities in some of the poorest areas of the world. Although significant efforts have been achieved towards the reduction of disease morbidity, onchocerciasis still affects millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current control strategy is the annual mass administration of ivermectin which has accumulated several drawbacks over time, especially the action of the drug is solely microfilaricidal, very long treatment period (15â€“17 years) and reports of ivermectin losing its efficacy; thus, raising the urgent need for new adulticidal compounds. Our study has established an in vitro platform capable of supporting the growth and development of Onchocerca volvulus for up to 315 days, enabling the observation of parasite developmental processes: moulting (from the infective L3 stage to adults), increase in morphometry, the attachment of adult male and female worms and the potential initiation of nodulogenesis. Moreover, the platform might provide more insight into O. volvulus adult worms behavioural pattern in vitro. Also, our findings provide more avenues for mass production of different parasite stages, the investigation of parasite developmental biology and the identification of targets for drug discovery against different developmental stages of this filarial parasite within 315 days.
