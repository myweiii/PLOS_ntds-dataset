Paragonimiasis is a lung disease caused by food-borne zoonotic trematodes of Paragonimus spp., multi-host parasites whose complex life cycle includes primary (snail), secondary (freshwater decapod crustacea), and mammalian definitive hosts. In Africa, paragonimiasis is a particularly neglected disease, where prevalence has likely been underestimated through under reporting and misdiagnosis as tuberculosis; and it remains the only human parasite without a fully known life-cycle. We present the first systematic review of paragonimiasis in Africa, including 143 publications. In human studies, we uncovered substantial recent transmission in Southeast Nigeria, and recent transmission also in Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon in endemic foci; significantly higher prevalence of P. uterobilateralis than P. africanus; and evidence supporting the existence of P. africanus in Côte d’Ivoire. In freshwater crab intermediate hosts, prevalence and intensity of either P. uterobilateralis or P. africanus varied across genera and species, suggesting differences in susceptibility. Mapping revealed evidence of temporal stability at endemic foci in rainforest regions; and widespread outliers. Numerous reports of significant recent transmission, particularly in Southeast Nigeria should be heeded by the international NTD research community. Increased studies are urgently needed to ascertain the real distribution and diversity of Paragonimus species in Africa.
