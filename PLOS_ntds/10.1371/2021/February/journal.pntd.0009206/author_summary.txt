Regions where onchocerciasis–a parasitical infection transmitted by blackflies–is endemic also tend to suffer from high levels of epilepsy. Recent studies suggest that ivermectin, an anti- onchocerciasis drug distributed annually to entire populations in onchocerciasis-endemic regions, may protect against developing onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE). As the link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy has been poorly understood and scientifically neglected in the past, our mixed methods research investigated how residents in an affected Cameroonian area perceive and cope with epilepsy; how they interpret the (causes of the) illness; where they seek care and why there. Armed with this knowledge, epilepsy control programs can optimize interventions geared at relieving the burden of epilepsy–and potentially OAE–which is essential given the fact that, despite 15–20 years of ivermectin distribution, onchocerciasis transmission persists and epilepsy prevalence in these regions remains high. Our findings illustrate how crucial it is to ensure locally accessible, uninterrupted, sustainable and comprehensive health service delivery for epilepsy. Furthermore, the structural challenges associated with the mass ivermectin distribution campaign must be addressed in order to relieve the burden of onchocerciasis, and potentially OAE. Without first addressing these structural bottlenecks, uptake and adherence to ivermectin treatment will remain insufficient.
