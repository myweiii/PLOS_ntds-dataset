Acquired syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that continues to impact health services around the world. For decades, studies and public health policies in the fight against syphilis have focused on syphilis in pregnant women and congenital, mainly because of their importance in the health of women and children. However, the behavior of the epidemic in people aged over 13 years shows that the epidemic is comprehensive and challenging. The exponential increase in the syphilis epidemic in the general population is one of the most neglected in many parts of the world. Primary health care plays a fundamental role in the control of syphilis, but few studies have sought to analyze the impact of primary health care on the growth of acquired syphilis. Our work used two large databases of the national notification systems of the 5570 Brazilian cities and a database of 37,350 primary health care teams, as well as municipal sociodemographic indicators. Our results demonstrated several indicators that influence the growth of acquired syphilis, especially the most neglected, which can guide more effective strategies to fight the syphilis epidemic in several countries.
