Côte d’Ivoire is endemic for onchocerciasis (also known as “river blindness”). This neglected tropical disease is transmitted by biting black flies that breed in fast flowing rivers. From 1975 to 1991, onchocerciasis control was based on weekly aerial spraying of the insecticide temephos, on black fly breeding sites. Vector control, however, was mostly focused on the northern and central parts of the country. From 1992 to present, mass treatment with ivermectin was implemented in all endemic areas, including forested regions in the south. Here we present the first geospatial estimates of onchocerciasis endemicity over time. Using the machine learning algorithm quantile regression forest, we implemented models to: identify important socio-demographic and environmental factors that correlate with onchocerciasis infection; predict the prevalence and density of infection in areas without ground-truth data; delineate remaining infection hotspots. Our results show that Côte d’Ivoire has made very significant progress in reducing infection parameters over time, and they may help to inform future interventions to achieve the goal of onchocerciasis elimination in Côte d’Ivoire.
