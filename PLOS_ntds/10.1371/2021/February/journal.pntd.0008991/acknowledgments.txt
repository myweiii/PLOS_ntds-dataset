We are grateful to the parents, guardians, and children from the Siaya District community for their participation in this study. We thank the LANL sequencing team: Cheryl Gleasner, Kim Mcmurry and Yuliya Kunde for producing the Illumina and PacBio sequence data, and Gordon Pusch of the RAST team for running the pseudogene detection tool. We also thank the University of New Mexico/KEMRI laboratories and the Siaya District Hospital staff for their support during the study. Many thanks to the children of Kenya, without whose participation, this study would not have been possible.
