This study shares the rabies diagnosis proficiency test results of 73 laboratories on animal specimens using four techniques (FAT, RTCIT, conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR) organised over a 10-year period. This long-term exercise allowed us to compute accurate sensitivity and specificity values for the rabies diagnosis test for a large panel of laboratories. Conventional RT-PCR provided a better diagnostic sensitivity level than FAT, real-time RT-PCR and RTCIT. Regarding diagnostic specificity, RTCIT was the most specific technique followed closely by FAT, real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. The specificity of molecular biology techniques was found to be lower than expected. The potential reasons for such findings are discussed herein. The regular organisation of performance tests has contributed to an increase in the performance of participating laboratories over time, demonstrating the likely benefits of such testing.
