Rodent-borne Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) has provoked human cases from Asia to the Americas and Europe whereas most orthohantaviruses cause regional cases. Despite this, SEOV gets less attention than other orthohantaviruses. In Korea, 2019, a middle-aged man was initially diagnosed with Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) and treated accordingly. However, next-generation sequencing identified SEOV, not HTNV, in the patientâ€™s serum. Given its global outbreaks and public health threats, zoonotic SEOV should be diagnosed correctly on point of care to reduce unnecessary medical costs.
