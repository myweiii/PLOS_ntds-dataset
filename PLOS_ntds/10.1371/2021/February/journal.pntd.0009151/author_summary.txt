Mosquitoes and ticks are medically important and ubiquitous hematophagous arthropods that require considerable amounts of protein for egg production. Vertebrate blood is the source of protein for adult mosquitoes and ticks to mature eggs. Culex pipiens is a vector of the filarial agent Wuchereria bancrofti and Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Sindbis (SINV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses. Ticks transmit many diseases to domestic animals and rank second to mosquitoes as vectors of human diseases. However, ticks increase potential health hazards several fold since they act as both vectors and reservoirs of pathogens though transstadial and transovarial disease transmission. Most of the nutritional value of a blood meal is proteinaceous, and the largest quantity of protein is contained inside erythrocytes. The digestive features and utilization of dietary components are similar in mosquitoes and soft ticks, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examines the hemolytic activity, lytic cycles, characteristics, and nature of hemolytic factors in the mosquito C. pipiens and the fowl tick A. persicus. The work reveals new insights into the distinct digestive processes in both species, improving our understanding of the basic biology of arthropod vectors.
