    "Abstract": "Vector control largely relies on neurotoxic chemicals, and insecticide resistance (IR) directly threatens their effectiveness. In some cases, specific alleles cause IR, and knowledge of the genetic diversity and gene flow among mosquito populations is crucial to track their arrival, rise, and spread. Here we evaluated Aedes aegypti populations\u2019 susceptibility status, collected in 2016 from six different municipalities of Rio de Janeiro state (RJ), to temephos, pyriproxyfen, malathion, and deltamethrin. We collected eggs of Ae. aegypti in Campos dos Goytacazes (Cgy), Itaperuna (Ipn), Iguaba Grande (Igg), Itabora\u00ed (Ibr), Mangaratiba (Mgr), and Vassouras (Vsr). We followed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and investigated the degree of susceptibility/resistance of mosquitoes to these insecticides. We used the Rockefeller strain as a susceptible positive control. We genotyped the V1016I and F1534C knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles using qPCR TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Besides, with the use of Ae. aegypti SNP-chip, we performed genomic population analyses by genotyping more than 15,000 biallelic SNPs in mosquitoes from each population. We added previous data from populations from other countries to evaluate the ancestry of RJ populations."
