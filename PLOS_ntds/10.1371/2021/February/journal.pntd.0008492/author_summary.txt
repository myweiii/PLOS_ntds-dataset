Monitoring of insecticide resistance (IR) is mandatory for the effectiveness of vector control programs. We investigate six populations of Aedes aegypti regarding their IR status towards insecticides previously or currently in use, their frequency of IR alleles and resistance ratio, their genetic ancestry and structure, and the gene flow. We observed that Ae. aegypti populations from RJ are becoming susceptible to the larvicide organophosphate temephos. The resistance ratios of temephos are lower among populations where gene flow might be occurring. All RJ populations are highly resistant to deltamethrin, partially explained by the high frequency of kdr alleles. Besides, all populations are susceptible to pyriproxyfen’s insect growth regulator and the organophosphate malathion. Population genomic analyses using more than 15,000 SNPs identified three potential genetic clusters within RJ populations, with higher gene flow to and out of the touristic region called Região dos Lagos. IR data, together with knowledge of the genetic structure and gene flow among different mosquito populations, can help with vector control program decisions.
