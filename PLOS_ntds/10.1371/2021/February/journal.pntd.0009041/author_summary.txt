Plant feeding as an essential resource of sand flies, primary vectors of Leishmania parasites, is largely understudied for Afrotropical species. Here, we combined field ecology, biochemical, molecular and chemical approaches, to decipher plant feeding associations in field-collected sand flies from a dry ecology endemic for leishmaniasis in Kenya revealing i) similar rates of plant feeding among sand fly sexes sampled from indoor and outdoor environments, ii) Acacia plants in the family Fabaceae as those readily foraged on by sand fly species in Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia, iii) fructose as the common sugar in sand flies and leaves of selected plant species in the Fabaceae family, iv) compounds namely benzyl alcohol, (Z)-linalool oxide, (E)-Î²-ocimene, p-cymene, p-cresol, and m-cresol, as discriminating volatile organic compounds between volatiles of selected Fabaceae plants. The findings indicate selective sand fly plant feeding and suggest that the discriminating volatile organic compounds could be exploited in attractive toxic sugar- and odor-bait technologies for sand fly control.
