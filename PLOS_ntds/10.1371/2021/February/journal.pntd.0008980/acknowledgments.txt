We would like to thank Florent Engelmann, the director of the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) de Cotonou and its staff for their collaboration on the field mission in Benin. We also thank Dorothée Kindé-Gazard for allowing use to use her laboratory for the isolation protocol at the Faculté des Sciences de la Santé in Cotonou, and Melkior Kouchade, superior officer of Water, Forests and Hunting and Nagoya focal point in Benin for meeting and helping us build the Protocol on Access and Benefit sharing. Finally, yet importantly, we are incredibly grateful to the poultry owners in Benin for accepting to participate to this study.
