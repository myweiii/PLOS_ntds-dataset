Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and one of the major transmission routes is the contaminated feces of blood-feeding triatomine insect vectors, popularly known as kissing bugs. In recent years, this disease has become an important public health concern to the United States and other nonendemic regions of the world. Despite many studies about the prevalence of T. cruzi in triatomines, and domestic, feral and wild animals in central and southern Texas, there have been no studies in west Texas and New Mexico. In this study, we report the presence of triatomines in residences in El Paso County, TX, and surrounding communities in New Mexico (cities of Anthony and Las Cruces), as well as T. cruzi infections in feral and wild animals. Using two molecular techniques to analyze the bloodmeal source in triatomines, we detected 12 different mammalian bloodmeal sources, including human and canine. Finally, parasite genotyping showed that most (95%) of the samples belonged to the genotype TcI, which is prevalent in North America. Our findings indicate that the El Paso County and surrounding communities (>950,000 people) are high risk areas for T. cruzi transmission to humans, feral cats and dogs, and wild animals. Thus, there is an urgent necessity for a public health epidemiological surveillance program for T. cruzi infections in kissing bugs, feral and wild animals, and in the human population in the U.S.-Mexico border region.
