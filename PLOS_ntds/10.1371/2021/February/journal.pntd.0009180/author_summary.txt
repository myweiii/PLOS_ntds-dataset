Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum pertenue is one of the most prevalent skin ulcer diseases among children in tropical and sub-tropical countries in Africa and the South-Pacific region. In Cameroon, outbreaks of yaws occur among populations living in remote areas where health infrastructure is lacking. The yaws diagnosis is frequently made clinically, even though rapid and simple serological assays were also introduced to confirm active yaws infection. Lately, studies using molecular amplification assays and performed in the South Pacific and Ghana reported that apart from T. p. pertenue, Haemophiluys ducreyi is also detected in children presenting with yaws-like lesions. This study was performed in the context of the surveillance of yaws in the East and South region of Cameroon. Molecular tools were used to detect and confirm the presence T. p. pertenue in samples suspected of yaws and collected during three outbreaks of ulcerative skin lesions among children in Cameroon. In addition, all samples were analysed for H. ducreyi. We found that H. ducreyi was present in samples from all three outbreaks, but T. p. pertenue was only detected among samples collected during the first outbreak. We concluded that yaws was present in Cameroun but that not all outbreaks of yaws-like skin lesions were attributable to T. p. pertenue infection.
