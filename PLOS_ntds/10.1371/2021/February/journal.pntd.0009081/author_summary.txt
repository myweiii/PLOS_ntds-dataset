Spatial variation of African Trypanosomiasis burden depends on distribution of biotopes necessary for tsetse flies to thrive. Therefore, mapping the occurrence of the tsetse fly species is a useful predictor of African Trypanosomiasis transmission risk areas. Climate is a major determining factor for occurrence and survival of tsetse flies, the vector responsible for both HAT and AAT. Since resources for prevention and control of tsetse fly species and the disease they transmit are generally scarce in endemic settings, understanding potential impacts of climate change on tsetse fly species distribution in space and time is essential for informing coherent strategies for vector and disease control at a local scale.
