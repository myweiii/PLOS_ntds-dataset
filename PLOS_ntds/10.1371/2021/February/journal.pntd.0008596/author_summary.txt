India has highest incidence of deaths due to snakebite in the world. Echis carinatus (EC) is known as saw-scaled viper and its bite causes major mortality and morbidity in the Indian subcontinent. The abundant presence of zinc (Zn++) metalloproteases in Echis carinatus venom (ECV) is responsible for local tissue necrosis. An earlier report has shown that ECV activates neutrophils and leads to NETosis that blocks blood vessels leading to tissue necrosis. However, the toxin in ECV responsible for NETosis has not addressed. Here we investigated the Echis carinatus venom metalloproteases (ECVMPs) are responsible for NETosis and its associated tissue necrosis using Zn++ specific chelator, Tetraethyl thiuram disulfide (TTD). TTD inhibited ECVMPs-induced skin hemorrhage and footpad tissue necrosis by reduced expression of citrullinated H3 (citH3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in mice footpad tissue. TTD also neutralized ECV-induced systemic hemorrhage and conferred protection against lethality in mice. Moreover, TTD inhibited ECV-induced NETosis in human neutrophils and decreased the expression of p-ERK and NETosis markers. Further, we demonstrated that ECV-induced NETosis and tissue necrosis is mediated via PAR-1-ERK axis. Overall, our results provide an insight into SVMPs-induced toxicities and the promising protective efficacy of TTD can be extrapolated to treat severe tissue necrosis complementing anti-snake venom (ASV).
