Colombia is one of the countries most affected by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in the Americas and are diseases of mandatory reporting to the national surveillance system. Surveillance systems are vital components of disease control programs to understand disease burden, trends, and to detect outbreaks. However, underreporting can bias estimates and greatly reduce surveillance data utility. We used a capture-recapture analysis to identify cases that were diagnosed at the healthcare facilities (capture) and those that were reported to SIVIGILA (recapture) in order to assess the degree of overlapping between diagnosis and reporting. Our study was conducted in three different endemicity settings and showed that the overall reporting of arboviruses was variable in magnitude and dependent on several factors including age of the case, year of diagnosis, and type of health care provider. We also identify the need to correct for misclassification when estimating arboviral burden based on clinical diagnosis in endemic settings using data from passive surveillance systems.
