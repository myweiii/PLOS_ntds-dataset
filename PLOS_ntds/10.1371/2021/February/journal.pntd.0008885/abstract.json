    "Background": "While hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is primarily self-resolvingâ€”soaring incidence rate of symptomatic HFMD effectuates economic burden in the Asia-Pacific region. Singapore has seen a conspicuous rise in the number of HFMD cases from 2010s. Here, we aims to identify the serology and genotypes responsible for such outbreaks in hospitals and childcare facilities.",
    "Methods": "We studied symptomatic paediatric HFMD cases from 2013 to 2018 in Singapore. Surveillance for subclinical enterovirus infections was also performed in childcares at the same time period.",
    "Results": "Genotyping 101 symptomatic HFMD samples revealed CV-A6 as the major etiological agent for recent outbreaks. We detected infections with CV-A6 (41.0%), EV-A71 (7%), CV-A16 (3.0%), coxsackievirus A2, CV-A2 (1.0%) and coxsackievirus A10, CV-A10 (1.0%). Phylogenetic analysis of local CV-A6 strains revealed a high level of heterogeneity compared against others worldwide, dissimilar to other HFMD causative enteroviruses for which the dominant strains and genotypes are highly region specific. We detected sub-clinical enterovirus infections in childcare centres; 17.1% (n = 245) tested positive for enterovirus in saliva, without HFMD indicative symptoms at the point of sample collection.",
    "Conclusions": "CV-A6 remained as the dominant HFMD causative strain in Singapore. Silent subclinical enteroviral infections were detected and warrant further investigations."
