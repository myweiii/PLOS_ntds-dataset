In most cases, Hand Foot and Mouth Disease or HFMD typically manifest in mild fever along with sore throat and rashes on the body. From 2010 onwards, Singapore has seen a steady increase in the case number of HFMD reaching tens of thousands in recent years. HFMD is caused by intestinal viruses and in this study, we established with molecular surveillance methods that one of the causative serotypes, CV-A6 is the major etiological agent for HFMD in Singapore for the current decade. We discovered that circulating enterovirus, CV-A6 in Singapore share similarities in genetic make-up to those currently circulating strains found worldwide and found to be especially close to the ones in neighbouring countries. HFMD spreads from person to person, especially in high-risk areas such as childcare centers where children congregate. Therefore, we conducted saliva collections routinely from childcare centers across Singapore and found that subclinical enterovirus infections have also been prevailing in clusters, occurring silently and unnoticed.
