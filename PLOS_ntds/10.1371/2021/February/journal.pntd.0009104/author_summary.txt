Human neurocysticercosis is a major neglected tropical disease caused by Taenia solium. As part of their natural metabolism, cysticerci release molecules into their microenvironment within the host. Secreted molecules could be useful in the design of vaccine candidates or diagnostic methods, or as therapeutic targets. Unfortunately, most secreted proteins cannot be identified by mass spectrometry sequencing due to their low concentration in the sample. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy to predict the sequence of T. solium secreted proteins using 2D-PAGE proteomic analysis and the T. solium genome. This approach allowed us to identify proteins with potential applications in the diagnosis and/or prevention of neurocysticercosis.
