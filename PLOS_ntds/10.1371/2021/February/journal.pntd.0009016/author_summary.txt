Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacteria that causes the disease melioidosis. Disease is usually caused by bacteria entering cuts in the skin or by breathing in the bacteria. But disease can also be caused by drinking water containing the bacteria, but this form of the disease is not well understand. Other researchers have looked at what happens when mice are given the bacteria via the mouth. This manuscripts looks at what happens when small monkeys, marmoset drink the bacteria. Different amounts of bacteria were given to the marmosets to determine how many bacteria are needed to cause disease. More than 6 million bacteria caused animals to have a fever and become sick enough to be euthanized. The bacteria travelled from the stomach to the intestine where there were small areas of swelling with lots of immune cells than caused damage to the tissue. The bacteria then went to the lungs really early in the disease and then spread to other parts of the body.
