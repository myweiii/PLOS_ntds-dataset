    "Abstract": "To systematically characterize the prevalence and evolution of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection among voluntary blood donors (BDs) in Guangdong province, China. A three-year survey for HTLV epidemiology among BDs was performed in Guangdong during 2016â€“2018. Anti-HTLV-1/2 was screened by ELISA and ECLIA, and subsequently confirmed by western blot (WB) and nucleic acid testing (NAT). The prevalence of HTLV in donors from different cities was calculated. The identified HTLV-positive cases were phylogenetically genotyped and analyzed in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Among 3,262,271 BDs, 59 were confirmed positive for HTLV-1 (1.81 per 100,000) and no HTLV-2 infection was found. The prevalence of HTLV-1 varied significantly among 21 cities in Guangdong province, China. The highest prevalence was found in donors from Shanwei (13.94 per 100,000), which is a coastal city in eastern Guangdong. Viral genomic sequences genotyped from 55 HTLV-1 carriers showed that 39 were transcontinental subtype and 16 were Japanese subtype. Specially, 13 out of 39 transcontinental subtype sequences were characterized with L55P mutation and 21 out of 55 sequences were characterized with L19F mutation in viral gp46 protein. The L55P mutation seemed be specific to eastern Asia since it only presented in the sequences from Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of gp46 gene shows that HTLV-1a may have been introduced to Guangdong through four different introduction events and formed major transmission clusters: clades I(13,602 years ago), II(16, 010 years ago), III(15,639 years ago) and IV(16,517 years ago). In general, Guangdong is considered to be a low-prevalence region for HTLV-1 infection, but the prevalence is significantly higher in Shanwei city. Transcontinental and Japanese subtype lineages dominate the prevalence in Guangdong. In terms of blood safety, HTLV antibody screening for first-time blood donors can effectively reduce the risk of HTLV transmission."
