    "Introduction": "Snakebite envenoming is an occupational hazard and a WHO category A neglected tropical disease (NTD) [1] that annually kills 81,000\u2013138,000 people living in economically depressed rural communities of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where the provision of health services is limited or inexistent [2,3]. Snakebite leaves victims with permanent physical sequelae and chronic mental morbidity that affects not only the surviving victims, often young agricultural workers but also their entire families, which enter a cycle of generational poverty that is difficult to break [4\u20136].\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean 137,000\u2013150,000 snakebite envenomings occur each year, resulting in 3,400\u20135,000 deaths [2]. With 40,820\u201344,230 snakebite accidents a year and a mortality rate of 0.05\u20130.5% [7], the South American subcontinent stands as the most affected region of the New World. Bothropic envenoming is caused by snake species of genera Bothrops, Bothriechis, Bothrocophias and Porthidium. Among them, Bothrops species have the highest epidemiological importance. Particularly B. asper, a species complex widely distributed from M\u00e9xico to Per\u00fa, where it is commonly known as nauyaca, barba amarilla, terciopelo, equis/talla equis, equis patiana, cacica, pelo de gato, boquidor\u00e1, mapan\u00e1, dam\u00e1, tapa, etc. (http://snakedatabase.org/species/Bothrops/asper) [8\u201310], is responsible for 50\u201380% of the snakebites and 60\u201390% of fatalities over much of its range [10,11]. It inhabits the tropical rainforest and tropical evergreen forest more frequently, but due to its ease of adapting to different environments it is also found close to crops or human dwellings [12]. B. asper has crepuscular and nocturnal habits and is recognized as an extremely dangerous snake by its reputation as an irritable snake of large size, rapid reactions and unpredictable behavior, and the high quantity of highly lethal venom (LD50 between 2.06 (1.89\u20132.04) \u03bcg newborns' venom/g mouse body weight and 3.82 (3.65\u20134.00) \u03bcg adults' venom/g mouse; doses reported for snakes from Pacific Costa Rican population) that can deliver in a bite [12,13]. Envenomings by B. asper are characterized by local effects such as edema detectable in the first minutes after the bite; local hemorrhage evident as bleeding or ecchymosis; blisters, regional lymphadenitis, paresthesia, hypothermia, compartment syndrome, dermonecrosis, myonecrosis, abscesses, and gangrene [10,11]. Frequent systemic effects include defibrinogenation, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, massive pulmonary and/or mesenteric capillary micro thrombosis, and these clinical manifestations may become life-threatening as the result of shock and multi-organ failure [10,11].\nIn Colombia, along the period 2008\u20132019, the annual cases of snakebites reported by the National Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) of the National Health Institute (INS) were 3,129 to 5,603 (7\u201311.1 cases/100,000 population per year) [14\u201317]. The majority of snakebite envenomings (90\u201395%) are inflicted by pitvipers of the Viperidae family and involve species from the genera Bothrops (Bothrops asper, B. atrox, B. bilineatus, B. pulcher, B. punctatus, B. taeniatus), Bothriechis (B. schlegelii), Bothrocophias (B. campbelli, B. colombianus, B. hyoprora, B. microphthalmus, B. myersi) and Porthidium (P. lansbergii, P. nasutum), most notably (50\u201380%) by B. asper in lowlands and inter-Andean valleys. Two percent of snakebites is due to the bushmaster Lachesis spp. (L. acrochorda and L. muta) in tropical rain forest; and 1% of envenomings are due to bites by the rattlesnake Crotalus durissus cumanensis, a species inhabiting desertic dry or semidry lowlands in the Caribbean region, in the high valley of the Magdalena River, in the Orinochian region, and savannahs (Yar\u00ed River) of the Caquet\u00e1 Department. Ophidian accidents caused by coral snakes (e.g., M. ancoralis, M. clarki, M. dissoleucus, M. dumerilii, M. mipartitus, M. nigrocinctus, M. lemniscatus, Micrurus surinamensis) account for about 1% of the total snakebite envenomings in Colombia. The remaining 1\u20135% are inflicted by other aglyphous and opisthoglyphous snake species, mainly from the Colubridae family [10,18]. The estimated fatality rate is 1\u20133% [11,18], although with a pattern of notorious regional variation, and 6\u201310% of patients suffer some type of life-long sequelae, mainly as a result of dermonecrosis and myonecrosis. Due to their low population density and abundant ophidian fauna, the highest snakebite incidence occurs in the Orinochian and Amazonian regions (Fig 1) [15\u201317,19], where B. atrox inflicts 90% of the snakebites [20]\nThe figure is adapted from the event report, epidemiological period XIII, Colombia, 2019 [17]. White dashed lines delimit the Colombian Insular (1), Caribbean (2), Andean (3), Pacific (4), Orinochian (5) and Amazonian (6) natural regions. Snakebite incidence data from the Insular region (San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia, and Santa Catalina) were \"missing or excluded\" in the 2019 SIVIGILA-INS event report. The left panel highlights species within the clinically important snake families Viperidae and Elapidae with distribution in the Departments of Nari\u00f1o and/or Cauca, which can potentially cause snakebite accidents in this region. The list was compiled from Ayerbe and Latorre [22] and Sevilla-S\u00e1nchez et al. [21]. 1B. asper includes the lineages B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus and B. ayerbei. The map was prepared in the QGIS software, version 3.14.15-Pi, using public domain maps available in QGIS OpenLayers Plugin, and the Geoportals of the Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Agust\u00edn Codazzi-IGAC (https://geoportal.igac.gov.co/contenido/datos-abiertos-cartografia-y-geografia) and the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica-DANE (https://geoportal.dane.gov.co/servicios/descarga-y-metadatos/descarga-mgn-marco-geoestadistico-nacional/) from Colombia. All maps were used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nThe SW Colombian Departments of Nari\u00f1o and Cauca are characterized by their impressive mountainous relief belonging to the northern portion of the great Andean mountain system, which extends along the Pacific coast of South America. Its orogeny makes the Colombian Andean natural region one of the most biodiverse in the country, including venomous snakes of the Viperidae and Elapidae families (Fig 1) [21,22]. Saldarriaga-C\u00f3rdoba et al. [23] and Salazar-Valenzuela et al. [24] have recently described the existence of phylogeographic structure across B. asper distribution. Three B. asper lineages found in Nari\u00f1o and Cauca Departments (Colombia), B. asper (sensu stricto) on the Pacific versant of the western mountain range, B. ayerbei in the upper Patia river valley and B. rhombeatus in the Cauca river valley [25], account for the largest proportion of snakebites in SW Colombia [22]. Two hundred and thirty-nine snakebite cases occurred in Nari\u00f1o and Cauca in 2019, 56 cases more than 2018. Fig 1 lists the species that potentially cause these accidents in the Departments of Nari\u00f1o and Cauca. Although this figure is lower than those documented in other Departments (e.g. Antioquia and Norte de Santander) [14\u201317], the marginal areas where accidents occur along with the limited distribution of antivenoms, among others factors, prevent victims from accessing proper treatment and, as a consequence, there is high underreporting of cases, deaths increase, and physical, psychological, social and economic sequelae are serious [3,21].\nThe Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) and Laboratorios Probiol (PROBIOL) manufacture and commercialize in Colombia antivenoms generated from plasma of hyperimmunized horses with mixtures of venoms from B. asper (sensu lato), B. atrox and Crotalus durissus cumanensis, and Laboratorios Probiol additionally includes venom of Lachesis muta in the immunization mixture [26]. However, antivenom supply in the country has traditionally been insufficient and the Colombian Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social has issued several resolutions and decrees declaring health emergencies owing to the scarcity of antivenoms, having been necessary to import them from other countries, particularly M\u00e9xico and Costa Rica [11,27]. An analysis of the availability of antivenom in the period 1992 to 2016 revealed that compared to the need for +30,000 vials per year, the average national production in that period was 22,000 vials; production exceeded the demand only in some years [27]. Despite antivenom shortage is clearly related to an increase in the mortality rate, and the impact of snakebites could be reduced by the Government demonstrating more interest in this public health issue, initiatives such as the creation of additional antivenom-producing companies have not been materialized [26,27]. In addition, to complicate the picture, clinical observations over two decades have evidenced distinctive local and systemic signs and symptoms of envenoming caused by different B. asper lineages [28\u201331], with B. asper (sensu stricto) venom causing stronger myotoxic activity than those of B. ayerbei and B. rhombeatus, with the latter venom being the most coagulant, whereas B. ayerbei venom is poorly myotoxic but the most hemorrhagic among the three lineage venoms [28,29]. In line with these functional data, comparative venomics of B. asper lineages distributed from M\u00e9xico to Ecuador, including venoms from M\u00e9xico, Costa Rica, and populations from the Pacific side of Ecuador and SW Colombia, revealed similar overall toxin family compositions albeit exhibiting quantitative differences chiefly in the relative abundance of their four major protein families, snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP), serine proteinase (SVSP), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and C-type lectin-like (CTL) [32].\nThe cross-reactivity of mono- and polyvalent antivenoms manufactured in M\u00e9xico (Birmex, Bioclon), Costa Rica (ICP), Venezuela (UCV), and Colombia (INS-COL, PROBIOL) towards B. asper venoms from M\u00e9xico [33], Guatemala [34], Costa Rica [35,36], Panam\u00e1 [37], northern Colombia [38], and Ecuador [39] have been reported. The aim of this work was to perform a detailed comparative preclinical analysis of a panel of six antivenoms manufactured in Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Per\u00fa and Argentina to quantify their capability to immunorecognize the toxins of B. asper lineage venoms (B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei) from Department of Cauca (Colombia). The neutralization of the lethal and major toxic activities of these B. asper lineage venoms by the polyvalent Colombian (INS-COL, PROBIOL) and Costa Rican (ICP) antivenoms was also assessed through combined in vivo and in vitro assays.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAssays performed in mice were approved by the Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUA) of the University of Costa Rica (approval number 082\u201308).\n\n\nSnake venoms\nVenoms of adult snakes from Department of Cauca (Colombia), two of B. asper from the municipalities of Playa Rica and Huisit\u00f3 (El Tambo in the Pacific coast), four of B. ayerbei from the Alto Pat\u00eda river valley (El Tambo, San Joaqu\u00edn, Pomorroso, Cauca) and four of B. rhombeatus from Cauca river valley (Popay\u00e1n and Cajib\u00edo municipalities), were obtained from wild-caught specimens maintained in the serpentarium of the Centro de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas de la Universidad del Cauca-Bioterio (CIBUC-Bioterio). Venoms were collected by allowing the snake to bite on a glass conical funnel covered with Parafilm. Crude venom was lyophilized and stored at -20\u00b0C until used. Equal quantities of each lineage venom were pooled to perform the in vitro and in vivo assays.\n\n\nAntivenoms\nSix commercial polyvalent antivenoms (Table 1) were tested: INS-COL from the Instituto Nacional de Salud of Colombia, batch numbers 15SAP01 and 16SAP01 with expiry dates 12/2018 and 04/2019, respectively; PROBIOL produced by Laboratorios Probiol S.A. (Colombia), batch number AP066XI16-ES with expiry date 11/2018; ICP-polyvalent from Instituto Clodomiro Picado (Costa Rica), batch 6060618 POLF with expiry date 12/2023; INS-PERU from Instituto Nacional de Salud of Per\u00fa, batch 10200045 with expiry date 02/2018; UCV, produced by Centro de Biotecnolog\u00eda de la Unidad de Farmacia of the Universidad Central de Venezuela, batch 179 with expiry date 07/2017; and BIOL produced by Instituto Biol\u00f3gico Argentino S.A.I.C., batch 3664 with expiry date 10/2018.\nAll antivenoms were generated from plasma of horses hyperimmunized against different mixtures of venoms: B. atrox (Meta and Casanare, Orinoqu\u00eda; Amazonas and Caquet\u00e1, Amazon\u00eda), B. asper (sensu stricto, Departments of Atl\u00e1ntico, Bol\u00edvar, Cauca (Isla Gorgona), Cauca river valley (Pacific region), and Tolima); B. rhombeatus, Antioquia), and Crotalus. d. cumanensis (INS-COL); B. atrox (Meta and Casanare, Orinoquia; Amazonas and Caquet\u00e1, Amazon\u00eda), B. asper (sensu stricto, Costa Atl\u00e1ntica; B. rhombeatus, Magdalena Medio river valley and Cauca river valley), Crotalus. d. cumanensis, and Lachesis muta (PROBIOL); B. asper, C. simus, Crotalus vegrandis and L. stenophrys (ICP); B. atrox, B. barnetti, B. brazili, B. pictus, and Bothrocophias hyoprora (INS-PERU); B. atrox, B. colombiensis, B. venezuelensis, Porthidium lansbergii hutmanni; C.d. cumanensis, and C.d. ruruima (UCV); and B. asper, C. simus, and L. muta (BIOL). INS-COL, PROBIOL, ICP, INS-PERU antivenoms are composed of whole immunoglobulins (IgGs), whereas the UCV and BIOL antivenoms are made up of the antigen-binding fragments F(ab')2 purified from pepsin-digested whole hyperimmune serum.\n\n\nCharacterization of the antivenoms\nPhysicochemical characteristics of the antivenoms, such as color, odor, and pH were examined and recorded. The antivenom total protein concentration (mg/mL) was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient for a 1 mg/mL concentration (\u03b50.1%) at 280 nm of 1.36 (mg/mL)\u22121 cm\u22121 [40,41]. The homogeneity and purity of the antivenoms were assessed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis in 8.5% polyacrylamide gels and proteomics characterization of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250-stained protein bands [42]. To this end, protein bands of interest were excised, subjected to in-gel reduction (10 mM dithiothreitol, 30 min at 65\u00b0C) and alkylation (50 mM iodacetamide, 2 h in the dark at room temperature), followed by overnight digestion with sequencing-grade trypsin (66 ng/\u03bcL in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 10% ACN; 0.25 \u03bcg/sample) using an automated Genomics Solution ProGest Protein Digestion Workstation. Tryptic digests were dried in a vacuum centrifuge (SPD SpeedVac, ThermoSavant), redissolved in 15 \u03bcL of 5% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid, and submitted to LC-MS/MS. Tryptic peptides were separated by nano-Acquity UltraPerformance LC (UPLC) using BEH130 C18 (100\u03bcm \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7\u03bcm particle size) column in-line with a Waters SYNAPT G2 High Definition Mass Spectrometry System. The flow rate was set to 0.6 \u03bcL/min with a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water (solution A) and 0.1% formic acid in ACN (solution B) with the following conditions: isocratically 1% B for 1 min, followed by 1\u201312% B for 1 min, 12\u201340% B for 15 min, 40\u201385% B for 2 min. For CID-MS/MS, the electrospray ionization source was operated in positive ion mode and both singly- and multiply-charged ions were selected for CID-MS/MS at sample cone voltage of 28 V and source temperature of 100\u00b0C. The LC\u2013MS eluate was continuously scanned from 300 to 1990 m/z in 1 sec and peptide ion MS/MS analysis was performed over the range m/z 50\u20132000 with scan time of 0.6 sec. Fragmentation spectra were i) match against the last update of the NCBI non-redundant database (release 239.0 of 8/18/2020) using the on-line form of the MASCOT Server (version 2.6) at http://www.matrixscience.com, and ii) processed in Waters Corporation's ProteinLynx Global SERVER 2013 version 2.5.2. (with Expression version 2.0). The following search parameters were used: Taxonomy: all entries; enzyme: trypsin (2 missed cleavage allowed); MS/MS mass tolerance was set to \u00b1 0.6 Da; carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidation of methionine were selected as fixed and variable modifications, respectively. The relative abundances (% of total protein bands area) of antivenom components were estimated by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using Image Studio Lite, version 5.2 (LI-COR Biosciences) software, and the relative abundances of different proteins contained in the same SDS-PAGE bands were estimated based on the relative ion intensities of the most abundant MS/MS-derived tryptic peptide ions associated with each protein.\n\n\nThird-generation antivenomics\nThird-generation antivenomics was applied to assess the immunorecognition ability of the antivenom [43,44]. Antivenoms (INS-COL, PROBIOL, ICP, INS-PERU, UCV, BIOL) were dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and reconstituted in coupling buffer (0.2 M NaHCO3, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3). Affinity columns were prepared in batch as follow: 3 mL of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix (Ge Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) packed in an ABT column (Agarose Bead Technologies, Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, Madrid), later washed with 10x matrix volumes of cold 1 mM HCl (to preserve the activity of reactive groups) followed by two matrix volumes of coupling buffer to adjust the pH of the column to 7.0\u20138.0. ~100 mg of each lyophilized antivenom was dissolved in 2x matrix volumes of coupling buffer and incubated with 3 mL CNBr-activated matrix overnight at 4\u00b0C. The amount of coupled protein (IgG or F(ab\u2019)2) was determined as the difference between the quantity of protein incubated and the quantity uncoupled measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm before and after incubation with the matrix. After the coupling, any remaining active-matrix groups were blocked with 6 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 overnight at 4\u00b0C and the excess of uncoupled antibody was eliminated by alternatively washing 6 times with 3x matrix volumes of 0.1 M acetate buffer (0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.0\u20135.0), and 3x matrix volumes of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.5). Five affinity columns each containing 8 mg of immobilized antivenom were equilibrated with three volumes of PBS (20 mM phosphate buffer, 135 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with increasing amounts (100\u20131200 \u03bcg of total venom proteins) of venom (B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, or B. ayerbei) dissolved in 350 \u03bcL of PBS, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker. In parallel, as specificity controls, the highest amount of venom was incubated with 350 \u03bcL of mock matrix and 350 \u03bcL of matrix coupled with 8 mg of na\u00efve equine IgG. The non-retained fractions of columns incubated with 100\u2013300 \u03bcg, 600 \u03bcg, 900 \u03bcg, and 1200 \u03bcg were recovered with 2x, 4x, 6x and 8x matrix volumes of PBS, respectively, and the immunocaptured proteins were eluted with 3x (100\u2013300 \u03bcg) and 6x (600\u20131200 \u03bcg) matrix volumes of 0.1M glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 buffer and brought to neutral pH with 1M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The column fractions (non-retained and retained) with highest volume (600\u20131200 \u03bcg) were divided equally to avoid concentrating or diluting the total proteins too much as follows: fractions recovered in 600 \u03bcg, ; non-retained and retained fractions in 900 \u03bcg,  and ; non-retained and retained fractions in 1200 \u03bcg,  and . These aliquots were concentrated in a Savant SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) to 40 \u03bcL and fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC using an Agilent LC 1260 High-Pressure Gradient System (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Discovery BIO Wide Pore C18 (15 cm\u00d72.1 mm, 3 \u03bcm particle size, 300 \u00c5 pore size) column and a DAD detector. Elution was monitored at 215 nm with a reference wavelength of 400 nm [43,44].\nThe percentage of immunorecognition was obtained by the integration of RP-HPLC profiles of retained and non-retained fractions. The fraction of non-immunocaptured molecules was estimated as the relative ratio of the chromatographic areas of the proteins recovered in the non-retained (NR) and retained (R) affinity chromatography fractions applying the equation %NRi = 100-[(Ri|(Ri+NRi)) x 100], where Ri corresponds to the area of the same protein \u201ci\u201d in the chromatogram of the fraction retained and eluted from the affinity column. This result was corrected for toxins such as SVMP which elute with difficulty from the column due to their high binding affinity to the immobilized antivenom. In this case, the percentage of non-immunocaptured toxin \u201ci\u201d (% NRtoxin\u201ci\u201d) was calculated as the ratio between the chromatographic areas of the same peak recovered in the non-retained fraction (NRtoxin\u201ci\u201d) and in a reference venom (Vtoxin\u201ci\u201d) containing the same amount of total protein that the parent venom sample and run under identical chromatographic and experimental conditions, using the equation %NRtoxin \"i\" = (NRtoxin \"i\"/Vtoxin \"i\") x 100 [45].\n\n\nNeutralization of biological effects of venoms\nThe neutralizing capacity of antivenoms manufactured in Colombia (INS-COL, PROBIOL) and Costa Rica (ICP) towards major bothropic biological effects (i.e., lethality, hemorrhagic, coagulant, myotoxic, defibrinogenating, edematogenic, indirect hemolytic, and proteolytic), determined in this study or previously reported by Mora-Obando et al. [28] and Rengifo-R\u00edos et al. [29] for the same venoms, was tested using standardized protocols recommended by the WHO [46\u201348] with slight modifications. In particular, although WHO recommends \"using groups of 5\u20136 mice (of the same strain and weight range used for the LD50 assay) for ED50 determinations, although 10 mice may be needed for some venoms\". In our experience with bothropoid venoms 4 mice groups and 4\u20136 levels of antivenom:venom ratios provide strong statistics for calculating ED50s with narrow 95% confidence intervals. Thus, to comply with the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) and the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of in vivo Experiments) (NC3Rs, https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arriveguidelines), without compromising the robustness of the ED50 data, here the number of animals was 4 per antivenom:venom level. The median lethal dose (LD50) of Bothrops rhombeatus venom was determined using Probits [28,49]. All neutralization assays were performed by incubating for 30 min at 37\u00b0C constant amounts of venom (challenge dose) (Table 2) with increasing dilutions of antivenoms, previously dialyzed and lyophilized and dissolved to a final concentration of 70 mg/mL in PBS [50]. In each experiment, positive and negative control mice groups were injected, respectively, with venom in PBS and antivenom alone. After each assay, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation [48].\n\nNeutralization of venom lethality.Groups of four CD-1 mice (16\u201318 g) received intraperitoneal injections of four LD50s (challenge dose) (Table 2) mixed with antivenom in different proportions (250\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom) dissolved in PBS. Forty-eight hours later, the number of surviving mice in each group was recorded. The antivenoms' capacity to neutralize the venoms' lethal activity was expressed as median effective dose (ED50), which corresponds to the amount of antivenom that protects 50% of the injected mice [35]. ED50 value and its 95% confidence limits for each venom was calculated using Probit analyses with software BioStat v. 2008.\n\nCalculation of the venom toxin-specific and venom neutralizing antibody content of antivenoms.The data from the antivenomics and ED50 experiments were combined to calculate the fraction of anti-toxin and venom neutralizing IgG or F(ab\u2019)2 molecules [41]. Briefly, the percentage of anti-toxin IgG or F(ab\u2019)2 molecules in the antivenoms was calculated by dividing [(1/2 maximal amount (in \u03bcmoles) of total venom proteins bound per antivenom vial) x molecular mass (in kDa) of antibody (IgG, 160 kDa or F(ab\u2019)2, 110 kDa) molecule] by the [total amount of antibody (IgG or F(ab\u2019)2) (in mg) per antivenom vial] [44,51,52]. To calculate the percentage of lethality neutralizing antibodies, the potency (P) of the antivenoms was first obtained, i.e. the amount of venom (mg) neutralized per 1 mL of each antivenom, was calculated as P = [(n-1)/ ED50]\u00d7LD50, where \u201cn\u201d is the number of LD50s used as challenge dose to determine the ED50 and, \"n-1\" is used because at the endpoint of the neutralization assay, the remaining activity of one LD50 remains unneutralized causing the death of 50% of mice [53,54]. For the calculation of P, LD50 and ED50 values were expressed, respectively, in mg venom/mouse and mL of antivenom that protect 50% of the mice population inoculated with n\u00d7LD50. Finally, the antivenom's potency (P) was divided by the maximal amount of total venom proteins bound by mL of antivenom [41].\n\nNeutralization of hemorrhagic activity.Groups of four mice (18\u201320 g) received intradermal injections of 0.1 mL each containing 10 Minimum Hemorrhagic Doses (MHDs) of venom (Table 2) incubated with increasing dilutions of antivenom (62.5\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom). Two hours post-injection mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, their skin removed, and the area of the hemorrhagic lesion photographed. The images were processed with software Inkscape v. 0.92 as described by Jenkins et al. [55]. The antivenom neutralization capacity (MHDED50) was defined as the venom/antivenom ratio that reduced the diameter of the hemorrhagic lesion to 50% compared to the diameter of the lesion in the positive control [50].\n\nNeutralization of coagulant activity.0.1 mL aliquots each containing a fixed-dose of venom (Table 2) incubated with antivenom at different ratios (7.8\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom) were added to 0.2 mL of citrated human plasma preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Clotting times were recorded and the Effective Dose (ED) of the antivenom was calculated as the venom/antivenom ratio which prolonged the clotting time three times compared to that of plasma incubated with venom alone [56].\n\nNeutralization of defibrinogenating activity.Groups of four CD-1 mice (18\u201320 g) received intravenous injections of 200 \u03bcL of PBS containing two Minimum Defibrinogenating doses (MDDs) (Table 2) incubated with antivenom at different ratios (62.5\u20132000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom). One hour post-injection the animals were anesthetized and bled to obtain around 0.2 mL of blood, which was left undisturbed for two hours at room temperature. Neutralization ability of the antivenom was expressed as effective dose (ED), defined as the lowest venom/antivenom ratio in which blood coagulation occurred in all the mice [56].\n\nNeutralization of myotoxic activity.A fixed-dose of venom (50 \u03bcg) incubated with antivenom at ratios of 250, 500, and 1000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom were injected in groups of four mice (18\u201320 g) into the right gastrocnemius muscle. 3 h later, a blood sample was obtained from the caudal vein and the plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, expressed as units/L, was measured using a UV kinetic assay (CK-Nac, Biocon Diagnostik). The neutralization capacity of the antivenom was expressed as ED50, defined as the venom/antivenom ratio where CK levels were reduced by 50% compared to the positive control [48,57].\n\nNeutralization of edematogenic activity.Each animal of groups of four mice (18\u201320 g) received a subcutaneous injection in the right footpad, containing a mixture of 5 \u03bcg of venom incubated with antivenoms at final ratios of 250\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom, in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL of PBS. The left footpad injected with PBS alone served as negative control. Footpads' thickness, measured using a low-pressure spring caliper (Oditest) 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h post-injection, was considered a quantitative indicator of edema, and the data were expressed as percentage. The antivenoms' neutralizing capacities were determined at 60 min and the ED50 expressed as the venom/antivenom ratio in which edema was reduced by 50% compared to the positive control [58].\n\nNeutralization of indirect hemolytic activity.The indirect hemolytic activity of each venom was determined following the method described by Arce-Bejarano et al. [59], with slight modifications, using rabbit erythrocytes in a tube fluid phase system. Briefly, rabbit blood was collected by venipuncture in Falcon tubes containing Alsever's solution (2.05% dextrose, 0.8% sodium citrate, 0.055% citric acid, and 0.42% sodium chloride) as anticoagulant, and centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min. Red blood cells were washed five times in 0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris, pH 7.7 (TBS). 50 \u03bcL of a reaction mixture containing a 5% suspension of erythrocytes in TBS gently mixed with 0.25% w/v sn-3-phosphatidylcholine was incubated with 250 \u03bcL containing various amounts of venom diluted in TBS-Ca2+ (TBS supplemented with 10mMCaCl2, pH 7.7) in 96-well plates. Identical mixtures without venom or replacing venom by 0.1% Triton X-100 in water were included as negative (0% hemolysis) and positive (100% hemolysis) controls, respectively. The plates were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C with mild stirring every 20 min, centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min, and the absorbance of the supernatants measured at 540 nm using a microwell plate reader was considered a quantitative index of hemolysis. Experiments were performed in triplicates and the results were expressed as percentages of the hemolysis recorded for the positive control. For assessing an antivenom's neutralization activity, a fixed challenge dose defined as three times the amount of venom that hemolyzed 50% of the erythrocytes was incubated at increasing ratios of antivenom (250\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom /mg venom) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, after which 50 \u03bcL of the 5% suspension of erythrocytes/0.25% w/v sn-3-phosphatidylcholine was added, and the indirect hemolytic activity measured as above. The neutralizing capacity of antivenom (ED50) was defined as the venom/antivenom ratio in which the venom-induced hemolytic activity was reduced by 50% compared to the positive control [59].\n\nNeutralization of proteolytic activity.The proteolytic activity of each venom was determined according to the method described by Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [50]. Briefly, 20 \u03bcL aliquots containing 2.5\u201340 \u03bcg of venom were added to 100 \u03bcL of substrate (10 mg/mL azocasein in 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min in 96-well plates. Reactions were stopped by adding 200 \u03bcL of 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged (350 xg x 5 min). Hundred fifty \u03bcL of supernatant were mixed with the same volume of 0.5 M NaOH and the absorbance at 450 nm recorded. For antivenom neutralization testing, the challenge dose corresponded to the amount of venom capable of inducing a change in absorbance of 0.5 at 450 nm. Challenge doses of each venom, either alone or incubated with antivenom at several ratios of (250, 500, and 1000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom) in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL, were tested as above. The ED50 antivenom's neutralizing capacity was expressed as the venom/antivenom ratio in which proteolysis was reduced by 50% compared to the positive control [50].\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Antibody titers of the antivenoms were determined by ELISA. For this end, 1 \u03bcg samples of venom dissolved in 100 \u03bcL of PBS (20 mM phosphate, 135 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C per well of 96-well plates (Dynatech Immulon, Alexandria, VA). Thereafter, the plates were decanted and free sites in each venom-coated well was blocked with 100 \u03bcl/well of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Antivenoms dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 70 mg/mL were serially diluted (1:1000\u20131:128000) in PBS containing 1% BSA, added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed five times with PBS and bound antibodies detected following incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 100 \u03bcL of a 1:2000 dilution of anti-horse IgG-phosphatase-conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in FALC buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 \u03bcM ZnCl2, 1mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA. Finally, the plates were washed five times with FALC buffer, the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1mg/ml) in diethanolamine buffer (1mM MgCl2, 90mM diethanolamine, pH 9.8) was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded for 5\u201360 min using a microplate reader (Multiskan Labsystems Ltd., Helsinki, Finland).\n\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nResults were represented as dose-response graphs and reported as the mean \u00b1 SD of duplicate, triplicate, or quadruplicate determinations depending on the biological activity assessed. Antivenom ED50s against venom lethality was calculated using the software BioStat v. 2008, and the values were considered significantly different among groups when the 95% confidence limits did not overlap. ED50s towards venom hemorrhagic, coagulant, edematogenic, proteolytic and myotoxic activities were calculated from the equations of the regression analyses in Excel (Microsoft Office 2019). The significance of the differences between the experimental groups was determined by parametric or non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA or Kruskal\u2013Wallis, respectively), followed by post hoc tests to identify significant differences between group pairs. Differences with p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using Software IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.",
    "Results and discussion": "The ability of different mono- and polyvalent experimental and commercial bothropic antivenoms to neutralize the most relevant toxic effects produced by B. asper bites was demonstrated in the late 1990s [60\u201362], and the outcome clearly showed that the antivenoms were more effective in preventing the systemic than the local (myotoxic, dermonecrotic and hemorrhagic) tissue damaging effects [63\u201365]. Current antivenoms manufactured in Colombia are generated from plasma of horses hyperimmunized with mixtures of B. atrox, B. asper and C.d. cumanensis venoms supplemented (Laboratorios Probiol) or not (Instituto Nacional de Salud, INS-COL) with venom of the bushmaster L. muta. Given the wide range of B. asper and the occurrence of intraspecific phylogeographic structure [23,24,32], it is not surprising [62] that different antivenom effectiveness has been observed regarding the number of vials needed in the treatment of envenomings inflicted by snakes from Pacific region than from the Andean region (S. Ayerbe, personal communication). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the immunological characteristics of a panel of bothropic antivenoms that includes the national products as well as those imported or potentially importable antivenoms, which may complement national production in the treatment of envenomings caused by the three lineages of the B. asper complex distributed in SW Colombia, B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei, whose structural and functional venomics profiles have recently been reported [28,32].\n\nPhysicochemical characterization of the antivenoms\nTable 1 summarizes the physicochemical characteristics of the 6 antivenoms (INS-COL, PROBIOL, INS-PERU, ICP, UCV, BIOL) examined. Total protein concentration was similar among INS-COL, INS-PERU, ICP and BIOL antivenoms, ranging from 56.8 to 59.7 mg/mL, whereas UCV had lowest (41.9 mg/mL) and PROBIOL presented a much higher (200.7 mg/mL) protein content. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig 2) confirmed the type of antibody molecule specified in the products' inserts (IgG or F(ab\u2019)2) (Table 1), but also revealed a number of other protein bands. Protein spots excised from the SDS-PAGE gels were identified through tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis as aggregation and degradation products of IgG (Fig 2, yellow-filled circles) and non-IgG proteins (Fig 2, red-filled circles) (S1 Table)\nLanes 1a/b or 2a/b, vials used in the experiments. Molecular weight markers (MW) are indicated on the left. Coomassie Brilliant blue-stained bands labeled 1\u201337 were excised and submitted to tandem mass spectrometry analysis (S1 Table). Bands containing IgG aggregation or degradation products are identified by yellow-filled circles. Red-filled circles denote non-IgG proteins bands.\nThe INS-COL antivenom showed a predominance (82.3%) of intact IgG glycoforms (Fig 2, bands 2 and 3) and their aggregation (band 1, 2.9%) and degradation (4, 11.6%; 5, 1.3%; 6, 0.7%) products, and a 1.1% of \u03b11B-glycoprotein (Fig 2, band 7). In comparison, PROBIOL antivenom contained significantly lower intact IgG bands (41.8%), comparable IgG degradation 137 kDa product (7.1%), and much higher non-IgG contaminants, notably albumin found in band 16 (Fig 2), accounting for 30.8% of the total antivenom proteins, and other plasma proteins in bands 8 (\u03b12-macroglobulin, 7.9%), 12 and 13 (haptoglobin, 3.7%), 14 (serotransferrin, 4.1%), and 15 (\u03b11B-glycoprotein, 3.7%) (Fig 2 and S1 Table).\nCosta Rican ICP and Peruvian INS-PERU antivenoms displayed a very similar SDS-PAGE banding patterns and MS/MS-derived protein profiles, characterized by 80% intact IgGs, 3\u20134% IgG aggregates, 12\u201315% IgG degradation products, and minor non-IgG contaminants (0.9% vs 1.5% \u03b11B-glycoprotein in bands 22 and 29, respectively; and 2.5% haptoglobin in band 27 of ICP antivenom) (Fig 2).\nThe F(ab')2 antivenoms manufactured in Venezuela (UCV) and Argentina (BIOL) exhibit similar qualitative SDS-PAGE profiles (Fig 2), though the latter represents a better purified product (88% F(ab')2, 7.3% IgG degradation product, and 4.4% non-IgG (fibrinogen \u03b3-chain) contaminant) than the fabotherapic produced by the Universidad Central de Venezuela (70% F(ab')2, 9.9% non- processed IgG, 0.5% IgG aggregates, 13.3% IgG degradation products, and 6% \u03b12-macroglobulin) (S1 Table).\nThe presence of IgG aggregates and non-IgG protein impurities contribute to the reduced safety profile of the products by increasing the possibility of early (anaphylactoid) reactions and anaphylactic shock due to IgE antibodies against these heterologous animal proteins [62,66\u201369]. The outcome of our present study indicates a need for improving the fractionation of the hyperimmune plasma, particularly the PROBIOL and UCV products.\n\n\nImmunoreactivity profile of antivenoms: third-generation antivenomics\nThe immunoreactivity of the six antivenoms against the venom components of B. asper (sensu stricto), B. ayerbei, and B. rhombeatus, previously identified by Mora-Obando et al. [28,32] was investigated by third-generation antivenomics [43\u201345] (Figs 3\u20135 and S1\u2013S3). Table 3 summarizes the antivenoms' immunorecognition capabilities. All the antivenoms recognized around 12\u201314% of the low-molecular mass components eluted during the first 10 min in chromatographic fractions 1\u20133. These fractions comprise endogenous tripeptide inhibitors of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPi) [70\u201373], 10\u201312 amino acid residue bradykinin-potentiating-like peptides (BPPs) [72,74,75], and disintegrin (DIS) molecules. Among these early-eluting venom components only disintegrin are immunogenic [76\u201379], and therefore, the immunoretained fraction may comprise this class of toxins, which in B. ayerbei [28], B. asper, and B. rhombeatus [32] represent 2.3\u20135.6% of their total venom proteins. On the other hand, chromatographic fractions 4\u20137, eluted between 10\u201330 min, comprised disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich (DC) fragments of PIII-SVMPs, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) molecules, cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) and serine proteinases (SVSP), and were immunocaptured at maximal immunoaffinity column binding capacity with average efficacy of 62% (B. asper), 70% (B. rhombeatus), and 80% (B. ayerbei) (Table 3). Chromatographic fractions 8\u201314 eluted between 30\u201345 min contained SVMP, C-type lectin-like proteins (CTL), SVSP, L-amino acid oxidase (LAO), and phosphodiesterase (PDE), and were immunoretained in the affinity matrices with average efficacy of 80% (B. asper), 87% (B. rhombeatus), and 69% (B. ayerbei) (Table 3). Table 4 shows a summary of the maximum total toxin binding capacity of each of the B. asper linage venoms by the different antivenoms. Extrapolated to mg venom immunocaptured per gram of antivenom the ranking of antivenoms according to their respective highest to lowest binding capacity towards total components was [BIOL > INS-PERU > UCV > INS-COL > ICP > PROBIOL] for B. asper (sensu stricto), [BIOL > INS-COL > (UCV ~ INS-PERU) > ICP > PROBIOL] for B. rhombeatus, and [INS-COL > (BIOL ~ INS-PERU) > UCV > ICP > PROBIOL] for B. ayerbei. In terms of percentage of toxin-binding antibodies, the order from highest to lowest relative abundance was [INS-PERU > (BIOL ~ INS-COL) > UCV > ICP > PROBIOL] for B. asper (sensu stricto), [INS-COL > (BIOL ~ INS-PERU) > (ICP ~ UCV ~ PROBIOL)] for B. rhombeatus, and [(INS-COL ~ INS-PERU) > BIOL > ( ICP ~ UCV ~ PROBIOL)] for B. ayerbei.\nPanel A displays the fractionation by reverse-phase HPLC of the venom components. Proteins eluting in each peak (1\u201314) were assigned using the venomics information reported by Mora-Obando et al. [32]. SVMP, snake venom Zn2+-metalloproteinase and their proteolytic fragments Disintegrin/Cysteine fragments (DC-frag); PLA2-K49/D49, phospholipase types Lys49 and Asp49; SVSP, serine proteinase; CTL, C-type lectin-like; DIS, disintegrin; CRISP, cysteine-rich secretory protein; LAO, L-amino acid oxidase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; SVMPi, SVMP inhibitors; BPP, bradykinin-potentiating-like peptides.

Panels H and I display to chromatographic separations of the venom fraction not retained in the mock matrix control and the na\u00efve equine immunoglobulins control, respectively. The numbers on top of the chromatographic peaks represent the percentage of each fraction.\nPanel A displays the fractionation by reverse-phase HPLC of the venom components.

Panel A displays the fractionation by reverse-phase HPLC of the venom components. Proteins eluting in each peak (1\u201314) were assigned using the venomics information reported by Mora-Obando et al. [28]. Panels B-G represent RP-HPLC fractionations of the non-immunoretained fractions recovered from the affinity columns of immobilized antivenoms INS-COL (B), PROBIOL (C), ICP (D), INS-PERU (E), UCV (F), BIOL (G) incubated with increasing amounts of venom (100\u20131200 \u03bcg). Panels H and I display to chromatographic separations of the venom fraction not retained in the mock matrix control and the na\u00efve equine immunoglobulins control, respectively. The numbers on top of the chromatographic peaks represent the percentage of each fraction.\nAlthough none of the antivenom affinity matrices outshined all the others in its ability to immunocapture each and every one of the components of the three B. asper lineage venoms, the results displayed in S2\u2013S19 Tables and summarized in Tables 3 and 4 clearly classify the antivenoms into two groups according to their antivenomics immunocapturing features, with [BIOL, INS-PERU, INS-COL and UCV] (61.3 \u00b1 9.9 (BAS), 63.2 \u00b1 9.7 (BRH), and 52.7 \u00b1 6.9 (BAY) mgV/gAV) in the top group and [ICP > PROBIOL] (26.2 \u00b1 8.8 (BAS), 37.2 \u00b1 5.7 (BRH), and 29.5 \u00b1 6.0 (BAY) mgV/gAV) in the least effective group. The same trend was observed when the immunoreactivity of INS-COL, ICP, and PROBIOL against the three B. asper lineage venoms was comparatively assessed by ELISA: INS-COL showed the highest titer against all the venoms and the lower levels of cross-reactivity of ICP and PROBIOL against the three venoms were similar and indistinguishable between themselves (Fig 6). In addition, comparison of the relative amounts (%) of anti-toxin antibodies in the different antivenoms (Table 4), calculated assuming one antigen binding site occupied per immobilized antibody molecule, revealed that, on average, 28.5 \u00b1 8.1%, 27.6 \u00b1 5.2%, and 22.5 \u00b1 7.3% of INS-COL, INS-PERU, and BIOL antivenom antibodies, respectively, recognized antigenic determinants on toxins from each of the three B. asper lineage venoms, whereas these figures were 18.7 \u00b1 6.5%, 18.1 \u00b1 5.6% and 13.9 \u00b1 6.3% in the case of UCV, ICP and PROBIOL antivenoms, respectively. INS-COL, PROBIOL and ICP showed higher percentages of anti-BRH than anti-BAS and anti-BAY antibodies, whereas BIOL and UCV contained equivalent relative amounts of anti-BAS and anti-BRH, but significantly lower % of anti-BAY antibodies, and the relative amounts of anti-toxin antibodies in INS-PERU were BAS > BRH > BAY (Table 4). These figures fall within the range of percentages (6\u201328%) of anti-toxin antibodies determined for other commercial antivenoms [48,51,52,79\u201381]. The distinct cross-reactive profiles of the different bothropic antivenoms may be ascribed to the immunization process, in particular to the use of venoms from different Bothrops species or from different geographic variations of the same nominal species used by the different manufacturers, i.e. INS-COL and PROBIOL (B. atrox, B. asper), INS-PERU (B. atrox, B. pictus, B. barnetti, B. brazili [82]), ICP (Costa Rican B. asper from Caribbean and Pacific populations), UCV (B. atrox, B. colombiensis, B. venezuelensis), BIOL (B. asper of undisclosed geographic origin) [63].\nAntivenoms INS-COL (\u25cf), PROBIOL (), ICP (\u25cb) were serially diluted by a factor of two (starting from a dilution of 1/1000) and tested by ELISA against the following crude venoms: B. asper (sensu stricto) (A), B. rhombeatus (B) and B. ayerbei (C). Equine normal serum was included as negative control (\u25c6). Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent determinations. Statistically significant differences were observed among the titers of the antivenoms INS-COL vs. PROBIOL and/or ICP against the venoms of B. asper (dilutions 1: 1000, 8000, 16000, 64000), B. rhombeatus (dilutions 1:2000\u2013128000) and B. ayerbei (dilutions 1:1000\u201316000).\n\n\nNeutralization of the biological effects of B. asper venoms by INS-COL, PROBIOL, and ICP antivenoms\nLethality.As a rule of thumb, immunocapturing capacity \u2265 20\u201325% of total venom proteins has been proposed to correlate with a promising outcome in an in vivo lethality neutralization assay [83], and increasing percentages of immunocapturing indicate greater neutralizing potencies of the corresponding bait antivenoms. Table 5 summarizes the results of the neutralizing capacities of the Colombian antivenoms INS-COL and PROBIOL and the Costa Rican ICP towards the lethal, hemorrhagic (Fig 7), coagulant (Fig 8), defibrinogenating, myotoxic (Fig 9), edematogenic (Fig 10), proteolytic (Fig 11), and indirect hemolytic (Fig 12) effects of the venoms of SW Colombian B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei. All three antivenoms followed the \"antivenomics rule\" regarding their potency to neutralize the lethal effect of the three B. asper lineage venoms, as well as the coagulant and proteolytic effects (Table 5). Antivenoms INS-COL and ICP showed statistically indistinguishable capacities to neutralize the indirect hemolytic effect of B. asper and B. rhombeatus venoms, the coagulant effect of B. rhombeatus venom, and the defibrinogenating and myotoxic effects of B. rhombeatus and B. ayerbei venoms (Table 5).\nComparison of the neutralizing capacity of the antivenoms manufactured by INS-COL (A-C), PROBIOL (D-F), ICP (G-I) towards the hemorrhagic effect caused by the venoms of B. asper (sensu stricto) (\u25cf), B. rhombeatus (), B. ayerbei (\u25cb). Hemorrhagic lesions were measured as hemorrhagic units (HaU) [55] 2 h after intradermal injection of 10 MHD (challenge dose) mixed with antivenom in the ratios indicated in the figure. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of four replicates. In all assays, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed among the ratios 500\u20131000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom compared to the positive control.\nComparison of the neutralizing capacity of the antivenoms manufactured by INS-COL (A-C), PROBIOL (D-F), ICP (G-I) towards the coagulant effect caused by the venoms of B. asper (sensu stricto) (\u25cf), B. rhombeatus (), B. ayerbei (\u25cb). Clotting time was recorded after mixing and incubating 2 MCD (challenge dose) with different ratios of antivenom, as indicated in the figure, and adding them to human citrated plasma. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of replicates of two independent experiments.\nComparison of the neutralizing capacity of the antivenoms manufactured by INS-COL (A-D), PROBIOL (E-H), ICP (I-L) towards the myotoxic effect caused by the venoms of B. asper (sensu stricto) (A, E, I), B. rhombeatus (B, F, J), B. ayerbei (C, D, G, H, K, L). Muscle damage was measured as plasma creatine kinase activity 3 h after intramuscular injection of 50 \u03bcg of venom mixed with antivenom in the ratios indicated in the figure (\u25cf). Antivenom control (\u25cb). PBS control (---). Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of four replicates. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) compared to the venom control are represented by asterisks.\nComparison of the neutralizing capacity of the antivenom manufactured by INS-COL (A-C), PROBIOL (D-F), ICP (G-I) towards the edematogenic effect caused by the venom of B. asper (sensu stricto) (A, D, G), B. rhombeatus (B, E, H) and B. ayerbei (C, F, I). Edema was measured as the increase in the thickness of footpad compared to the negative control (PBS) and monitored during 6 h after subcutaneous injection of 5 \u03bcg of venom (\u25cf) mixed with antivenom in the ratios: 1000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom (\u25cb), 500 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom (\u0394), 250 \u03bcL antivenom/ mg venom (). Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of four replicates. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) compared to the venom control are represented by asterisks.\nProteolytic activity of the venoms of B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei (A) and neutralizing capacity of the antivenoms manufactured by INS-COL (\u25cf), PROBIOL (\u25cb) and ICP () towards B. asper (B), B. rhombeatus (C) and B. ayerbei (D). Neutralization of the proteolytic activity was measured on azocasein, as described in the Material and methods section, 90 min after mixing and incubating 12.5 \u03bcg of venom (challenge dose) with antivenom in the ratios indicated in the figure. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three replicates. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) compared to the venom controls are represented by asterisks.\nIndirect hemolytic effect produced by venoms of B. asper, B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei (A) and neutralizing capacity of the antivenoms INS-COL (\u25cf), PROBIOL (\u25cb) and ICP () towards B. asper (sensu stricto) venom (B) and B. rhombeatus (C). Neutralization of indirect hemolysis was measured on rabbit erythrocytes, as described in the Material and methods section, 1 h after mixing and incubating of 5.1 \u03bcg of venom (challenge dose) with antivenom in the ratios indicated in the figure. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three replicates. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) compared to the venom control are represented by asterisks.\nThe fraction of toxin-binding antibody molecules present in the antivenoms INS-COL, PROBIOL, and ICP, which contributed to protect the test animals from the lethal effect of the three B. asper lineage venoms, was derived by dividing the percentage of neutralizing antibodies (calculated from the antivenom's potency, S20 Table) by the percentage of toxin-binding antibodies (calculated from the maximal total venom protein binding capacity of the antivenom) (B. asper, S2\u2013S4 Tables; B. rhombeatus, S8\u2013S10 Tables; B. ayerbei, S14\u2013S16 Tables). For these calculations, it was assumed that antibodies immobilized in the affinity columns bound on average one antigen molecule per IgG/F(ab')2 molecule, while in solution the same antibodies would have their two antigen-binding sites occupied. These conditions are based on the most coherent fitting of the data from a number of combined antivenomics and in vivo neutralization studies carried out in our laboratory during the last years. The results listed in Table 4 unveiled that 60.4 \u00b1 12.3%, 50.1 \u00b1 5.2% and 26.8 \u00b1 9.1% of the toxin-binding antibodies of ICP, INS-COL, and PROBIOL contribute to the lethality neutralization activity of these antivenoms, respectively. Expressed as relative abundance of toxin-neutralizing antibodies per vial, INS-COL contained the highest value (14.0 \u00b1 2.6%), followed by ICP (10.5 \u00b1 1.4%) and PROBIOL (3.5 \u00b1 0.9%) (Table 4). The potency (in mg of venom neutralized per gram of antivenom antibodies) of INS-COL, ICP and PROBIOL were roughly similar for the three B. asper lineage venoms (Table 5), with average values of 58.2 \u00b1 4.1, 42.9 \u00b1 7.1, and 13.6 \u00b1 4.1 mg V/g AV, respectively.\n\nVenoms' toxic activities.Hemorrhage induced by the three venoms was almost completely neutralized by INS-COL and ICP antivenoms at a ratio of 1000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom (Fig 7A\u20137C and 7G\u20137I). At the same ratio, a hemorrhagic lesion between 50 and 100 mm2 was observed with PROBIOL antivenom (Fig 7D\u20137F). Except for the B. rhombeatus venom's lethal effect, which was neutralized with statistically indistinguishable ED50 by INS-COL and ICP, the neutralizing efficacy of the antivenoms followed the order INS-COL > ICP > PROBIOL (Table 5). The antivenoms followed the same trend regarding their coagulant, defibrinogenating neutralization activities (Table 5). In this sense, INS-COL and ICP antivenoms extended the coagulation time above 30 min at a ratio of 250 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom (Fig 8A\u20138C and 8G\u20138I), while even at a ratio of 500 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom PROBIOL did not triple the coagulation time compared to the positive control (Fig 8D\u20138F). The ED50 of PROBIOL to neutralize the coagulant and the defibrinogenating activity of the three venoms was 2\u20134 times less effective than those of INS-COL and ICP (p<0.05) (Table 5).\nThe myotoxic effect of the venoms was nearly abrogated by INS-COL and ICP antivenoms at a ratio of 1000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom (Fig 9A\u20139D and 9I\u20139L). Conversely, PROBIOL antivenom only showed an average neutralization capacity of about 60% at the highest antivenom/venom ratios tested (Fig 9E\u20139H). Consequently, the ED50s of INS-COL and ICP are statistically indistinguishable from each other and significantly (p<0.05) higher (more effective) than that of PROBIOL towards each Colombian B. asper lineage venom tested (Table 5).\nBoth INS-COL and ICP antivenoms effectively neutralized, albeit the Colombian product exhibiting slightly higher ED50 compared to the Costa Rican antivenom, the edematogenic effect of B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus, and B. ayerbei venoms (Table 5). However, even at the highest antivenom/venom ratio tested, PROBIOL was unable to reduce the effect to 50% (Table 5). Edematogenic activity curves, in which the injected animals were monitored during 360 min (Fig 10A\u201310I), showed that both INS-COL and ICP antivenoms reduced, at the highest ratio of antivenom tested and within the first 30 min, > 50% of the edema produced by all the venoms (Fig 10A\u201310C and 10G\u201310I). On the contrary, PROBIOL was only capable of partly neutralizing (by 30%) the edema triggered by B. rhombeatus venom (Fig 10D\u201310F). In general, the neutralizing effect of antivenoms was maintained six hours after venom injection (Fig 10); besides, INS-COL and ICP antivenoms neutralized the vasculotoxic effect produced by the venom, contributing in parallel to the neutralization of bleeding.\nInterestingly, in some experiments involving PROBIOL antivenom/venom mixtures the edema increased above the size of the positive control (mice injected with venom alone) (Fig 10D\u201310F). Previous studies performed with B. asper venom from Costa Rica have also described this circumstance [84]. Proteolytic release of vasoactive peptides from serum protein contaminants (i.e., \u03b12-globulins) during the incubation time of the antivenom/venom mixture, affecting vascular permeability and edema formation, has been invoked to explain this phenomenon. The fact that this event was mainly observed in experiments involving the antivenom with the most impurities of plasma proteins, PROBIOL (Fig 1 and S1 Table), would support this explanation.\nProteolytic activity of the three venoms was similar (Fig 11A). This effect is attributed mainly to the action of serine proteinases and Zn2+-dependent SVMPs present in B. asper venom [50]. INS-COL antivenom effectively neutralized the proteolytic activity of the three Colombian B. asper lineage venoms (ED50 = 42.3 \u00b1 7.7 mg venom/g antivenom), followed in order of potency by ICP and PROBIOL (23.5 \u00b1 5.3, and 14.9 \u00b1 2.8 mg venom/g antivenom), respectively (Fig 11B and 11C and Table 5).\nIndirect hemolytic activity was recorded in B. asper (sensu stricto) and B. rhombeatus venoms, but not in B. ayerbei venom (Fig 12A), as has been previously noted [28]. This effect is associated to high abundance of myotoxic PLA2s [85] and was quantified measuring the venom's phospholipase activity on phosphatidylcholine using erythrocyte lysis as an indicator [86]. The equivalent indirect hemolytic activity of B. asper (sensu stricto) and B. rhombeatus (Fig 12B) venoms was neutralized by INS-COL and ICP antivenoms with similar ED50 of 24.0 \u00b1 0.5 mg venom/g antivenom (Table 5), while PROBIOL did not show neutralization efficacy of the indirect hemolytic activity of B. asper (sensu stricto) and B. rhombeatus venoms even at a ratio of 2000 \u03bcL antivenom/mg venom.",
    "Concluding remarks": "Our data confirm and expand previous studies. Otero et al. (2002) reported a comparative study of the neutralizing capacity of four polyvalent antivenoms manufactured in Colombia (INS-COL, PROBIOL), Venezuela (UCV), and M\u00e9xico (Antivipmyn, Instituto Bioclon) against the pharmacological and enzymatic effects of the venoms of B. asper and Porthidium nasutum from Antioquia (northwest Colombia) and Choc\u00f3 (west Colombia) [38]. In their study, INS-COL and Antivipmyn antivenoms showed the highest neutralizing efficacy against the lethal and other pharmacological (hemorrhagic, edema-forming, myonecrotic, defibrinogenating and indirect hemolytic) effects of B. asper venom pooled from 40\u201345 specimens from different regions of Antioquia and Choc\u00f3. Conversely, antivenom PROBIOL presented the lowest neutralizing capacity towards the same activities, and the Venezuelan UCV antivenom had intermediate neutralization abilities. Understanding the basis of the effectivity of antivenoms against homologous and heterologous venoms demands the quantitative assessment of its toxin-resolved immunorecognition profile. Here we have applied third-generation antivenomics to compare the specific and paraspecific immunoreactivity of six bothropic antivenoms against three Colombian B. asper lineage venoms. The antivenomics outcome showed that all the major toxin families, i.e., SVMP, PLA2, CRISP, SVSP, CTL [32], were immunocaptured at maximal immunoaffinity column binding capacity with average efficacy of 62\u201387% (Table 3). These results clearly indicate that the paraspecificity exhibited by the six bothropic antivenoms against the three Colombian B. asper lineage venoms is not biased towards any particular family of toxins but is well balanced among the different venom protein families. Therefore, our study provides a solid experimental ground to rationalize the reported immunological profiles of INS-COL, UCV, and PROBIOL [38], and other bothropic antivenoms (INS-PERU, ICP, and BIOL), against B. asper venoms from different geographic Colombian ecoregions. These results strongly suggest the feasibility of adding these antivenoms to the list of candidates for the treatment of snakebite accidents caused by the species of the B. asper complex from SW Colombia, B. asper (sensu stricto), B. rhombeatus and B. ayerbei in the Departments of Nari\u00f1o and Cauca.\nQueiroz and co-workers [87] have reported in vitro qualitative (Western blot) and semi-quantitative (ELISA) evidence that Brazilian polyspecific pentabothropic (SAB) or antibothropic-lachesic F(ab')2 antivenoms exhibited variable paraspecific immunoreactivity towards nineteen venoms of bothropic snakes, including B. brazili, B. alternatus, B. atrox, B. bilineatus, B. castelnaudi, B. cotiara, B. erythromelas, B. fonsecai, B. insularis, B. itapetiningae, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, B. leucurus, B. marajoensis, B. moojeni, B. neuwiedi, B. pirajai, B. pradoi, and Bothrocophias hyoprorus. The remarkable para-specificity exhibited by antivenoms generated against immunization mixtures that included venoms from phylogenetic distant Bothrops species may be ascribed to large conservation of immunoreactive epitope on venom toxins across much of the natural history of Bothrops, a genus that had its roots in South America during the middle Miocene, 14.07 (CI95: 16.37\u201311.75) Mya [88,89] (Fig 13). Biogeographic studies support B. asper as the first species complex to split from the B. atrox group in the Pliocene, around 3.02\u20132.32 Mya [90], and cladogenesis into lineages began soon thereafter, towards the end of the Pliocene [23]. The realization of the existence of large immunological conservation across Bothrops phylogeny emerged also from studies of the paraspecific effectiveness of the pentabothropic polyvalent antivenom SAB (soro antibotr\u00f3pico pentavalente) produced by Instituto Butantan (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) [52,76,79,91\u201394] using a pool of venoms from B. jararaca (50%), B. jararacussu (12.5%), B. moojeni (12.5%), B. alternatus (12.5%) and B. neuwiedi (12.5%) [95,96]. Further, an assessment of the ability of seven polyspecific antivenoms, produced in Argentina, Brazil, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Colombia and Costa Rica using different immunization mixtures, to neutralize lethal, hemorrhagic, coagulant, defibrinogenating and myotoxic activities of the venoms of B. diporus (Argentina), B. jararaca (Brazil), B. matogrossensis (Bolivia), B. atrox (Per\u00fa and Colombia) and B. asper (Costa Rica) also showed a pattern of extensive cross-neutralization of all the venoms tested, with quantitative differences in the values of the effective doses of the antivenoms [93,97]. Similar results were obtained in a comparative a preclinical assessment of the efficacy of two whole IgG antivenoms, prepared in Per\u00fa and Costa Rica, to neutralize the most relevant toxic effects induced by the venoms of Peruvian Bothrops atrox, B. brazili, B. barnetti and B. pictus [98]. Both antivenoms were effective in the neutralization of these four venoms in a rodent model of envenoming, indicating an extensive immunological cross-reactivity exists between Bothrops spp. venoms from Per\u00fa and Costa Rica.\nAll the species complex groups within genus Bothrops include taxa that represent the main medically important venomous snakes in their range [9,99]. Our present results converge with previous studies in revealing the capacity of a number of bothropic antivenoms to neutralize, in preclinical tests, homologous and heterologous Bothrops venoms in Central and South America, and also highlight quantitative differences in their ED50s. The combination of antivenomics and in vivo neutralization assays provides relevant information to delineate the species spectrum and geographic range of clinical applicability of an antivenom. Now, the challenge is to conduct an extensive study to define the matrix of preclinical effectiveness of all the bothropic antivenoms against all the venoms of (medically relevant) species within the genus Bothrops."
