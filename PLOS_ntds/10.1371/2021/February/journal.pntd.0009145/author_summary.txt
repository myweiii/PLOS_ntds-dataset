Here we describe the identification of high confidence mutations among Mycobacterium bovis lineages associated with resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. Resistance to isoniazid, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones among non-human hosts is of importance because of the risk of emergence of multi- and extensively-drug resistance. Further research is warranted for the identification of the mechanisms responsible for acquisition of such mutations as well as the routes of transmissions involved in this process, including selective use of antibiotics or anthroponotic transmission. Our findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance to monitor the emergence or introduction of strains carrying mutations related to MDR and XDR. This could potentially help to limit the transmission of pathogenic and difficult to treat TB.
