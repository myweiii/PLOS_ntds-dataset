Scabies is a skin disease caused by infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The mite burrows under the skin causing intense itch. Scabies lesions are commonly infected with bacteria, causing impetigo. Pacific Island countries have a high burden of scabies due to overcrowding, the tropical environment and limited access to treatment. We aimed to assess the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in 20 villages in Western Province of Solomon Islands. We used the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies 2020 diagnostic criteria to diagnoses scabies. We found that 15% of the 5239 people surveyed had scabies, and 5.6% had impetigo. While the prevalence of scabies was comparable to other studies there were fewer cases of impetigo than observed previously. The burden of disease was highest among children. Mass drug administration, where the whole community is given treatment for a condition regardless of whether they have symptoms of the disease, has been shown to reduce the prevalence of scabies. This study supports the need for mass drug administration for scabies in Solomon Islands.
