Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a potentially lethal zoonosis during which metacestode larval tissue of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis grows like a malignant tumor, infiltrating the human liver. Current AE diagnosis, which mainly relies on imaging techniques (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance tomography) supported by serology, is not always suitable to unequivocally identify an infection. In this work the authors present a PCR-based approach to detect the parasite in biopsy material taken from patients. The method was first validated for routine laboratory use employing isolated parasite DNA as well as defined numbers of parasite cells in clinically relevant settings. The method was then verified under clinically relevant settings using pathology samples from patients with defined AE. Particularly in cases when these samples had been stored for less than 6 years, the PCR methodology was highly suitable to identify the infection, even when serology was negative. The authors show that small particles of E. multilocularis (spems), containing surface material of the parasite and often located in the draining adjacent lymph nodes, are PCR negative and, thus, most probably do not contain viable parasite cells. The authors conclude that in cases of doubtful serology and imaging, a combination of immunochemical staining methods with PCR are reliable means to unequivocally detect the infection.
