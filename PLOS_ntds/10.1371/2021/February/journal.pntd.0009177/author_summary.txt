Infectious diseases in tropical regions may have a variety of viral, bacterial or parasitic origins and a patient may suffer from several diseases simultaneously, each presenting with acute fever as a clinical symptom. This makes it difficult to determine the origin of the pathogen causing the disease(s). In addition to the endemic infectious diseases, outbreaks of epidemics frequently complicate diagnostic demands. Accurate diagnosis for proper patient management requires the utilization of highly sensitive and specific, rapid, easy-to-use diagnostic tools compatible with point-of-care settings. We describe the use of a disk-shaped microfluidic platform, the “FeverDisk”, for differential diagnosis of acute fever. Our FeverDisk platform demonstrated its capability to detect bacteria, viruses and parasites that are typical of tropical single and co-infections from biobanked samples within only 2 hours and in very good agreement with reference method results. This, in combination with its easy-to-use and point-of-care compatible nature, render our platform a promising candidate for detection of tropical diseases and precise identification of the cause of acute fever, in endemic and epidemic settings. Future work will involve extensive clinical characterization of the platform in prospective studies.
