Mycobacterium ulcerans causes a skin-based disease known as Buruli ulcer. How the bacteria are transmitted and what mechanisms they use to establish the infection of the skin is poorly understood. The only well characterized bacterial factor in Buruli ulcer pathogenesis is mycolactone, a toxin produced by the bacteria. Mycolactone causes apoptosis in human cells, leading to destruction of the skin around extracellular clusters of the mycobacteria. Human cells, like cells of all orders of life, are coated in complex sugar structures and these glycans are one of the major targets of bacteria and viruses for the interaction with host cells. Here we describe the glycan binding of whole Mycobacterium ulcerans cells and a mycobacterial protein, MUL_3720, thought to be involved in glycan binding. We show that both the bacterial cells and MUL_3720 bind to glycans known to be associated with human skin keratin and to skin keratin extracts. This binding of keratin extracts may explain initial bacterial attachment and clustering of the bacteria in the skin, ultimately leading to tissue destruction and ulceration caused by a cloud of secreted mycolactone at the site of infection.
