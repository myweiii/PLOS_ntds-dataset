    "Background": "Effective case identification strategies are fundamental to capturing the remaining visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases in India. To inform government strategies to reach and sustain elimination benchmarks, this study presents costs of active- and passive- case detection (ACD and PCD) strategies used in India’s most VL-endemic state, Bihar, with a focus on programme outcomes stratified by district-level incidence.",
    "Methods": "Expenditure analysis was complemented by onsite micro-costing to compare the cost of PCD in hospitals alongside index case-based ACD and a combination of blanket (house-to-house) and camp ACD from January to December 2018. From the provider’s perspective, a cost analysis evaluated the overall programme cost of each activity, the cost per case detected, and the cost of scaling up ACD.",
    "Results": "During 2018, index case-based ACD, blanket and camp ACD, and PCD reported 1,497, 131, and 1,983 VL-positive cases at a unit cost of $522.81, $4,186.81, and $246.79, respectively. In high endemic districts, more VL cases were identified through PCD while in meso- and low-endemic districts more cases were identified through ACD. The cost of scaling up ACD to identify 3,000 additional cases ranged from $1.6–4 million, depending on the extent to which blanket and camp ACD was relied upon.",
    "Conclusion": "Cost per VL test conducted (rather than VL-positive case identified) may be a better metric estimating unit costs to scale up ACD in Bihar. As more VL cases were identified in meso-and low-endemic districts through ACD than PCD, health authorities in India should consider bolstering ACD in these areas. Blanket and camp ACD identified fewer cases at a higher unit cost than index case-based ACD. However, the value of detecting additional VL cases early outweighs long-term costs for reaching and sustaining VL elimination benchmarks in India."
