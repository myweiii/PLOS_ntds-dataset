The continued global expansion of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which transmit viruses causing dengue and Zika, necessitates the further development of effective mosquito traps for monitoring and predicting transmission risk. Mosquito sound traps attract male mosquitoes by producing a frequency which mimics the wingbeat sound of female mosquitoes. As few insects will respond to such sounds, these traps can be highly species-specific, saving significant person-time to sort samples, potentially paving the way for more accurate smart-trap systems and reduced surveillance costs. To date, limited research has occurred within field-settings investigating the capture rates of male mosquitoes in sound traps set to different frequencies. To this point, we performed trials in dengue endemic environments to quantify capture rates of mosquitoes in Male Aedes Sound Traps set to different frequencies in Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Belize. We found that both male Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus responded positively to frequencies between 450 and 600 Hz. Additionally, male Culex mosquitoes were also caught, but at lower abundances in traps set to higher sound frequencies. These traps, when set to 550 Hz, effectively capture male Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus with limited bycatch.
