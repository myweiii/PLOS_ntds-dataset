Zika and dengue virus infections present a wide variety of symptoms that overlap with other acute illnesses. Our study helps characterize the variety and duration of clinical features in patients with Zika, dengue and other acute illnesses of unidentified origin (AIUO). We collected data from 441 patients seeking care for symptoms compatible with Zika infection based on a PAHO definition with onset in the previous 7 days in Tapachula, Mexico. We identified Zika, dengue, and chikungunya infections using an RT-PCR in serum and urine. We could not determine which pathogen caused the symptoms in most episodes (67%) and these were classified as AIUO. We observed differences in frequency and duration of clinical manifestations between patients with Zika, dengue and AIUO. Dengue tended to be a more symptomatic and disabling disease with generalized symptoms and more laboratory alterations that lasted longer than Zika and AIUO. Patients with Zika presented more frequently eye symptoms and localized rash. Nonetheless, we observed substantial overlap across diseases, and it remains unclear whether symptoms alone can distinguish these diseases in individual patients. The lack of diagnosis in most patients points to need for better diagnostics to assist clinicians in making specific etiologic diagnoses.
