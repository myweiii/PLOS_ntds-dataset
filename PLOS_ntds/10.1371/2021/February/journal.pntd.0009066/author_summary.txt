What is the prevalence of HTLV-1 among the largest world population of Japanese immigrants and their descendants outside Japan? There are approximately 1.5 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil and most of them living in São Paulo state, Southeast Brazil. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 5.1% among 2,139 individuals from five Japanese associations in São Paulo. The prevalence of 5.1% (95% CI: 4.2–6.0) of HTLV-1 infection found in this study is higher than those observed in other studies conducted in HTLV-1 endemic areas and in specific groups at high risk from Brazil. Among HTLV-infected individuals, the majority (86.2%) were unaware of their HTLV diagnosis. The HTLV-1 infection was associated with the age ≥ 45 years, being the first and second generation of Japanese immigrants, and having sexual partners with a history of blood transfusion. Epidemiological data, along with molecular results also demonstrated high occurrence of similar sequences transmitted intra- and interfamily. The high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection found in this studied population presents an urgent call for preventive and control responses of this infection in Brazil.
