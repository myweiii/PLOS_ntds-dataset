Rift Valley Fever is a viral disease that affects both humans and animals. It is categorized as one of the re-emerging and neglected tropical diseases that mainly affects the poor and marginalized populations that lack access to health services and are readily ignored. Humans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes. Infections also occur when humans are exposed to the body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Hence the risk of infection is greatest when slaughtering in the context of traditional sacrificial practices. This is the major reason outbreak of RVF is commonly associated with people whose livelihoods revolve around livestock rearing. In East Africa, RVF is mainly experienced in arid and semi-arid areas predominantly inhabited by the pastoralists. These areas experience epidemics of the disease at intervals of approximately 10 years associated with Elnino events. Understanding the knowledge base of the people in terms of RVF signs and symptoms and risk factors and pathways is important for the adoption of effective prevention and control measures. This study findings suggest that even though the Somali nomads are adept at recognizing RVF, this knowledge has not been translated into appropriate health practices due to the deep-seated socio-cultural practices. Hence, there is need for health authorities to mount locally appropriate public health advocacy campaigns, empower the livestock keepers to report observable changes in livestock and environment using their mobile phone devices and promote cross-disciplinary studies on RVF.
