Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease that is common in most tropical countries. VL has high morbidity and leads to death if not properly treated. In Brazil, Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum is the main causative agent of VL. Golden hamsters have proven to be a suitable model for VL. Despite the importance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbances in infectious disease, few studies have addressed this issue in VL. In this study, we showed that L. infantum-infected hamsters present augmented levels of plasmatic cortisol in association with increased spleen parasite burden. Indeed, a strong positive correlation was observed between cortisol and biochemical parameters (AST/ALT/ALP) related to liver damage, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), and the arginase enzyme that may favor the progression of infection. On the other side, cortisol was negatively correlated with leucocytes, except monocytes, and with IFN-γ and iNOS, which are involved in parasite-killing macrophage function. These results shed light on an unexplored aspect of VL pathogenesis, which is the importance of cortisol production in the disease-associated immune dysfunction.
