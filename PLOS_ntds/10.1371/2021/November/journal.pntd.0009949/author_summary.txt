Cryptosporidium parvum is an emerging zoonotic pathogen transmitted via the fecalâ€“oral route, and is considered a leading cause of moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease in young children in resource limited areas. After infection, C. parvum parasitizes intestinal epithelial cells and evokes an inflammatory immune response, leading to severe damage of the intestinal mucosa. The infection can be lethal to immunosuppressed individuals. However, no fully effective drug or vaccine is available for cryptosporidiosis, and the pathogenesis and immune mechanisms during C. parvum infection are obscure. Thus, an in-depth understanding of host-parasite interaction is needed. Hence, we established a C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cell model and performed comparative quantitative proteomic analyses to profile global host-parasite interactions and determine the molecular mechanisms that are activated during infection, aiming to offer new insights into the treatment of Cryptosporidium.
