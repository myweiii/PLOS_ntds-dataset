Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), firstly identified in the mid-1980, is a type of antimicrobial resistance bacteria. In recent years, they were found more colonization in patients with critical diseases, showing new resistance to many antibacterial drugs, which is a worrisome clinical problem worldwide. Traditionally, VRE testing is performed mainly by culture which is a standard reference but requires complex steps and takes a long time. Currently, GeneXpert vanA/vanB were approved as a rapid and sensitive molecular assay for detecting VRE. However, the accuracy of GeneXpert vanA/vanB is without systematic-analyses in evidence-based medicine. Therefore, we conducted a data integration and analysis in this study. Finally, we draw a conclusion that GeneXpert vanA/vanB has a high accuracy diagnosing VRE in comparation with conventional culture and PCR. Furthermore, GeneXpert vanA/vanB shows more accuracy in diagnosing vanA. In addition, we suggest that an additional test is needed for further detecting vanB. This finding provides a promising direction for the diagnosis of VRE to a certain extent.
