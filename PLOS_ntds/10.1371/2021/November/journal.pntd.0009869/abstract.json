    "Purpose": "Vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection is a worrying worldwide clinical problem. To evaluate the accuracy of GeneXpert vanA/vanB in the diagnosis of VRE, we conducted a systematic review in the study.",
    "Methods": "Experimental data were extracted from publications until May 03 2021 related to the diagnostic accuracy of GeneXpert vanA/vanB for VRE in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. The accuracy of GeneXpert vanA/vanB for VRE was evaluated using summary receiver to operate characteristic curve, pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio.",
    "Results": "8 publications were divided into 3 groups according to two golden standard references, vanA and vanB group, vanA group, vanB group, including 6 researches, 5 researches and 5 researches, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of group vanA and vanB were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93\u20130.98) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88\u20130.91) respectively. The DOR was 440.77 (95% CI, 37.92\u20135123.55). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of group vanA were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81\u20130.90) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99\u20130.99) respectively, and those of group vanB were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.63\u20130.97) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80\u20130.83) respectively.",
    "Conclusion": "GeneXpert vanA/vanB can diagnose VRE with high-accuracy and shows greater accuracy in diagnosing vanA."
