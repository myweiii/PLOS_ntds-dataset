Plasmodium vivax infection can result in a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic malaria to severe life-threatening disease. Despite significant advances in the current understanding of the critical factors associated with the disease outcomes in vivax malaria, the immunopathological events responsible for the diversity of severe manifestations in the disease remain deeply unknown. Here, a large panel of cytokines/chemokines were assessed in plasma samples from a Brazilian cohort of P. vivax patients presenting with asymptomatic infection or symptomatic malaria at the time of diagnosis, as well as from uninfected endemic controls, to define the relationships between systemic inflammation, disease presentation, parasitemia, and epidemiologic characteristics. In-depth analyses using the molecular degree of perturbation were employed to reveal nuances of a unique profile of systemic inflammation and imbalanced immune activation directly linked to disease severity. Moreover, the discoveries diagrammed the occurrence of disease tolerance by narrowing down the interactions between the systemic degree of inflammatory perturbation and parasitemia values in vivax malaria patients.
