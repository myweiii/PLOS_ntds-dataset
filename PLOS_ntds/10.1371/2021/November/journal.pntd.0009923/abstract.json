    "Background": "Leprosy is potentially debilitating. The risk factors related to physical disabilities associated with leprosy disease in Yunnan, China was not clear.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We studied 10644 newly detected leprosy patients from Yunnan, China, from 1990 to 2019. Factors associated with Grade 1 (G1D) and Grade 2 (G2D) physical disabilities or overall physical disabilities (combined G1D and G2D) associated with leprosy were analyzed using multinomial and ordinal logistic regression analyses. The following factors were associated with the development of physical disability in these patients with leprosy: delayed diagnosis [odds ratio (OR): 5.652, 4.399, and 2.275; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 4.516–7.073, 3.714–5.212, and 2.063–2.509; for ≥ 10, 5–10 y, and 2–5 years, respectively], nerve damage (OR: 3.474 and 2.428; 95% CI: 2.843–4.244, and 1.959–3.008; for 2 and 1 damaged nerves, respectively), WHO classification of PB (OR: 1.759; 95% CI: 1.341–2.307), Ridley-Jopling classification (OR: 1.479, 1.438, 1.522 and 1.239; 95% CI: 1.052–2.079, 1.075–1.923, 1.261–1.838, and 1.072–1.431; for TT, BT, BB, and BL when compared with LL, respectively), advanced age (OR: 1.472 and 2.053; 95% CI: 1.106–1.960 and 1.498–2.814; for 15–59 and over 60 years old, respectively), zero skin lesions (OR: 1.916; 95% CI: 1.522–2.413), leprosy reaction (OR: 1.528; 95% CI: 1.195–1.952), rural occupation (OR: 1.364; 95% CI: 1.128–1.650), Han ethnicity (OR: 1.268; 95% CI: 1.159–1.386), and male sex (OR: 1.128; 95% CI: 1.024–1.243).",
    "Conclusions": "Delayed diagnosis, nerve damage, no skin lesions, WHO and Ridley-Jopling classifications, leprosy reactions, advanced age, rural occupation, Han ethnicity, and male sex were associated with disability in leprosy patients. Identifying risk factors could help to prevent physical disability."
