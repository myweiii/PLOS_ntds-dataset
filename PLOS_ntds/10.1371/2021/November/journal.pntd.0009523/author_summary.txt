The supply chain to deliver donated preventive chemotherapy medicines is complex due to the many stakeholders and partnerships participating, as well as challenging because the logistics are further complicated by delivery to remote destinations in developing countries. As mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns involve treating hundreds of thousands to millions of patients in endemic regions within entire countries over the course of days or weeks, close coordination and timing of medicine delivery is critical. Inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems and limited transparency on supply chain performance further challenges the ability to identify shipment issues and explore the root cause of the issues. Prior to 2016, delivery was performing below standards, lagging as much as 40% below the WHO target of 80% on-time delivery. These delays result in wasted medicine donations, increased program costs, delayed MDAs, or sometimes even completely missed MDAs. In September 2016, an online supply chain performance measurement system, “NTDeliver,” was launched by the NTD Supply Chain Forum (a public-private partnership focused on managing and improving the preventive chemotherapy (PC) donation supply chain) to enhance supply chain performance and information transparency. Our findings suggest that information sharing through NTDeliver is positively associated with performance improvements at key stages in NTD supply chain, especially when information is made publicly accessible, focused on access for country program managers. The study findings support investment in supply chain systems and commitment to data transparency, in the context of a growing focus on supply chain investment in NTD programs.
