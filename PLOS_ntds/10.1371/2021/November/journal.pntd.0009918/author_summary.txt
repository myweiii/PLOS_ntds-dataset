Bacteria from the genus Leptospira is an important agent for causing a disease called leptospirosis in humans and a range of animal species. Leptospirosis is often under-recognized as it presents varied symptoms that mimic malaria, typhoid, brucellosis and other diseases. More than 250 pathogenic Leptospira serovars are known to cause leptospirosis in humans and animals. The diversity of Leptospira serovars and their distribution in humans and animals is little defined in Tanzania. We conducted a systematic review to gather information on the diversity of Leptospira serovars with their reservoir distribution and the most common diagnostics methods used. We included studies (n = 34) in the review and found 17 serogroups described in 28 studies that utilized microscopic agglutination test (MAT). So far human and other animal hosts including cattle, dogs, pigs, bats, buffalo, fish, rodents, goats, lion, zebra, sheep and shrews have been investigated for leptospirosis in Tanzania. Our results show that cattle and rodents are likely to be important reservoirs of pathogenic Leptospira spp. and can be a source of human leptospirosis principally in the farming system. Further studies are needed to explore predominant serovars in livestock for the development of prevention strategies to reduce transmission and risks in humans.
