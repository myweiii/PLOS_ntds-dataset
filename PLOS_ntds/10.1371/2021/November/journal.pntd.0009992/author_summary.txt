Sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease present in parts of Central and West Africa that is fatal if left untreated. Current case management requires unpleasant procedures such as a lumbar puncture and intravenous drug administration, but has high compliance rates as the treatment is given by hospital staff to patients. In this study, we explore the impact of a new oral treatment on compliance rates for treatment using a mathematical model fitted to data on sleeping sickness cases and screening activities. We also look at the possibility of patients being more likely to seek and access treatment since the new treatment can be used without a lumbar puncture if the patient does not display clinically severe symptoms. We find that reduced compliance, especially from patients suffering from the first less severe stage of the disease, will lead to more sleeping sickness cases and delay elimination, but increases in the number of patients seeking treatment will likely counter effects of reduced compliance.
