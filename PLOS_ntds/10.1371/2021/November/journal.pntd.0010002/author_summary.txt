Yellow fever is a viral hemorragic fever with high mortality rate and the vaccine is a remarkably successful way of preventing it. As a live attenuated virus vaccine, it is not recommended for rheumatic and other immunossupressed patients in general. However, in an outbreak scenario, the risk of dying of the disease can be higher than the risk of a vaccine serious adverse event. In 2018, the fractional-dose yellow fever vaccine was offered to the hospital employees and to the rheumatic patients without or with low immunossupression therapy in Hospital das Clinicas of University of São Paulo, during the yellow fever outbreak in São Paulo, Brazil. In order to optimize the yellow fever vaccine (YFV) supply, the fractional-dose (corresponding to one fifth) was adopted in the public vaccine campaign.
This is the first study evaluating the primary vaccination with fractional-dose YFV in autoimmune rheumatic diseases(ARD) patients (n = 159) under low immunosuppression. Most vaccinated participants were able to produce enough neutralizing antibodies to be protected against yellow fever (seroconversion rate of 84% versus 96% in healthy controls). Neither activity of the rheumatic disease or serious adverse event was identified during the 30 days of followup after the vaccination.
