    "Background": "The assessment of chemotherapeutic responses in Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL), especially its macular form is challenging, emphasizing the necessity for ‘test of cure’ tools. This study explored the diagnostic and prognostic potential of IgG subclasses and associated cytokines for monitoring the effectiveness of chemotherapy in PKDL.",
    "Methods": "Participants included PKDL cases at (a) disease presentation, (b) immediately at the end of treatment (12 weeks for Miltefosine or 3 weeks for Liposomal Amphotericin B, LAmB and (c) at any time point 6 months later, for estimating anti-leishmanial immunoglobulin (Ig, IgG, IgM, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3) and cytokines (IL-10, IL-6).",
    "Results": "In PKDL, Ig levels were elevated, with IgG3 and IL-10 being the major contributors. Miltefosine decreased both markers substantially and this decrease was sustained for at least six months. In contrast, LAmB failed to decrease IgG3 and IL-10, as even after six months, their levels remained unchanged or even increased.",
    "Conclusions": "In PKDL, IgG3 and IL-10 proved to be effective predictors of responsiveness to chemotherapy and may be considered as a non invasive alternative for longitudinal monitoring."
