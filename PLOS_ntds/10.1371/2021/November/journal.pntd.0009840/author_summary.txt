Melioidosis is an infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. There are currently no commercially available and reliable point-of-care diagnostic tests for melioidosis. We previously demonstrated that a prototype lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) developed to detect B. pseudomallei capsular polysaccharide (CPS) had limited sensitivity (31.3%) but high specificity (98.8%) for diagnosing melioidosis among patients presenting with community-acquired infection or sepsis in northeast Thailand. Here, we evaluated combinations of the CPS-LFI and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that detect antibodies against hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp1) or O-polysaccharide (OPS). When used in combination, results were considered positive if either test was positive. We selected ELISA cut-offs corresponding to a specificity of 95%. Our results demonstrated that a combination of antigen-detection (CPS-LFI) and antibody-detection (Hcp1-ELISA or OPS-ELISA) tests increased the sensitivity for diagnosis of melioidosis (68% or 63%, respectively) over any single test, while maintaining high specificity (95%). In case patients, positivity of the CPS-LFI was associated with a short duration of symptoms, severe infections (as measured by an organ failure assessment score), bacteraemia and mortality outcome, while positivity of Hcp1-ELISA was associated with a long duration of symptoms, non-bacteraemia and survival outcome. Based on our findings, we propose that point-of-care melioidosis diagnostic tests using combinations of antigen- and antibody-detection should be further developed and evaluated.
