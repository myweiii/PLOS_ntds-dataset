India achieved leprosy elimination (<1 case/10000 population) in 2005. However, it remains a country with a high burden of leprosy (120,334 cases in 2017â€“18), with an annual detection of more than 10000 new cases, including children, indicating widespread active transmission. In addition to the untreated leprosy cases, even patients who relapse after release from leprosy treatment play a significant role in disease transmission. Early detection and management of leprosy relapse cases will minimize the disease transmission and might prevent leprosy-associated deformity. Leprosy management services are primarily provided by the government healthcare system in India and supported by several major non-governmental charitable organizations. The burden of leprosy relapse in India cannot be measured since there is no provision to follow-up the patients who complete multi-drug treatment (MDT) in the national leprosy program. We report the incidence of leprosy relapse among the patients who completed leprosy treatment from the national leprosy control program in four districts in South India. The report also highlights the effectiveness of MDT in program settings, the lower risk of developing deformity after treatment completion, and the need to incorporate an appropriately designed follow-up strategy.
