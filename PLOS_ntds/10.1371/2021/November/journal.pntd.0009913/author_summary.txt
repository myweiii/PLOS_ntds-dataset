Early diagnosis is key in leprosy control; however, the diagnosis of leprosy is still challenging. In this study, we reviewed the common and rare symptoms of leprosy. Numbness, erythema, painless nor pruritic skin lesions, eyebrow hair loss, and tubercles were common symptoms of leprosy. Despite low proportions, formic sensation, pain, pruritus, finger contracture, muscle atrophy, and motor dysfunction were also reported by leprosy patients. As initial symptoms at symptom onset and only symptoms at diagnosis, nerve symptoms were associated with a greater degree of physical disability and a longer diagnosis interval than skin and skin and nerve symptoms. Understanding the presenting symptoms in detail would improve the level of leprosy awareness in the community. Increasing awareness of nerve symptoms, focusing on individuals with nerve symptoms at neurology outpatient visits, and holding focused training for medical staff specializing in neurology would enhance the capacity of the health system to recognize leprosy early.
