Behavior is at the core of neglected tropical disease (NTD) prevention and control, certainly within low-, and middle- income countries (LMIC) where resources are often limited. Therefore, strategies to promote behavior change should be included and investigated in future efforts. Nudging, a low-cost strategy that subtly directs people towards positive behavioral choices, has recently gained attention in global health promotion. Nudge strategies have been applied to a wide range of health-promoting behaviors such as handwashing. To understand which strategies were used, where and how these were applied, and whether these were ethically informed and implemented, we undertook a comprehensive review of the available sources. This resulted in 33 included studies, with a total of 67 nudge strategies for behavior-based prevention and control of NTDs in LMIC. Only two studies targeted NTDs in particular, the other 31 included studies were focused on more general health promoting behaviors, with the majority targeting handwashing with soap. The most common nudge strategies were those targeting decision assistance, such as fostering commitment and reminder actions. In general, the ethical assessment presented favorable results. We identified the need for robust study designs to better understand how nudges can be implemented in the future.
