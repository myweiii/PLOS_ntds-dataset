Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare but life-threatening syndrome characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, hyperinflammatory and multiple organ damages. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a well-known cause of infection associated HLH and result in fatal consequence. However, it is not well characterized for the clinical and laboratory features of the visceral leishmaniasis associated HLH. In this study, we presented that, compared to the VL alone, patients with VL associated HLH had higher chances of bleeding, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated secretion of soluble IL-2 receptor or lower NK cell activity. Moreover, patients with VL associated HLH also had higher levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines in the sera and had higher parasite load in the bone marrow specimen. More cases with VL associated HLH had hepatosplenomegaly with iron overload in the magnetic resonance imaging. In the therapeutic strategy, besides the anti-Leishmania treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce cytokine storm and excessive immune responses facilitated the remission in the VL associated HLH cases.
