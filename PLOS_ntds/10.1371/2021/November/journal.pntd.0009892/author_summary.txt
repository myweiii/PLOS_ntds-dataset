Human African Trypanosomiasis, (sleeping sickness), transmitted by the endemic tsetse fly, remains a public health and economic blight for around 70 million inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa. After a variable period in the haemo-lymphatic system (Stage 1), the trypanosomes cross the blood brain barrier and enter the CNS initiating the encephalitic (Stage 2) of the disease defined by the host’s strong immune response with attendant neuropsychiatric debilitating symptoms including sleeping sickness, the hallmark symptom. If not treated, death invariably follows. Our understanding of the contribution of the host’s genetics to these two neuropathogenic events is poorly understood. Using a mouse trypanosomiasis model spanning 28 days, we compared the gene expression profiles of trypanosome infected and control mice brains over several time points. By day 7, the activity of over 4,000 genes were altered and genetic programmes, responsible for the development of the Stage 2 encephalitic symptoms were activated prior to any significant breakdown of the blood brain barrier. These findings challenge this traditional Stage1/Stage 2 phenotypic demarcation and accords with reports of Stage 1 patients presenting with Stage 2 encephalitic symptoms and the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients reflects the complex interaction between host and parasite genetics that impact on disease progression.
