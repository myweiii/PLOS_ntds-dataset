Zoonotic diseases in man are more likely to occur where there is a close association between man and animals. The control of zoonotic diseases requires a “One Health” approach to reduce the risk of such transmission. This represents a challenge in low and middle-income countries, due to inequalities and limited resources, especially in healthcare. For that reason, we need to quantify the impact of zoonoses in those countries such as Paraguay, a major exporter of beef and agricultural products, so that disease control priorities can be set. Through a systematic review, we estimate the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and the Zoonosis Disability Adjusted Life Years (zDALYs) based on incidence and prevalence of zoonoses to find gaps between the real and the desired health status of both animals and humans in Paraguay. The zDALY ensures the total societal burden of disease, rather than just the direct human disease burden. We have through zDALYs a more equitable method for disease burden analysis that has a dual impact on human and animal health. Accordingly, we have found that those diseases with the highest zDALY are brucellosis, colibacillosis and Chagas disease.
