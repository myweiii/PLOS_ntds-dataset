Surface-exposed outer membrane proteins (SE-OMPs) are important components of pathogenic Leptospira mediating virulence and interacting with host cells and host environment. This study aimed to identify SE-OMPs of pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Pomona using surface biotinylation and proteinase K (proK) shaving methods comprehensively. Surface-protein enriched fractions obtained from intact leptospires were subsequently subjected to liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and their label-free quantitative profiles were analyzed by MaxQuant software. The surface biotinylation and proK shaving yielded a total of 1,001 and 238 proteins, respectively, and shared 220 proteins. Of these, 28 known SE-OMPs were identified by either method and 11 known SE-OMPs were overlapped. Moreover, 50 predicted SE-OMPs were detected in individual sample group and 18 were common in both groups. In the 20 most abundant proteins, there were six known SE-OMPs derived from both methods, including EF- Tu, LipL21, LipL41, LipL46, Loa22, and OmpL36, and one predicted SE-OMP, LipL71. McpA, OmpL1, OmpL32, OmpL36, SdhA, SppA, LIC10314, and LIC12615 were ranked in the 50 most abundant proteins. Furthermore, LIC10411 (LIP3228 ortholog in serovar Pomona) was predicted as a novel surface Î²b-OMP. The high-abundance SE-OMPs should be further investigated as novel vaccine candidates or diagnostic biomarkers for leptospirosis.
