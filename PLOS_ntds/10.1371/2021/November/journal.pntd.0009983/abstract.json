    "Abstract": "Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonosis with a global distribution. Surface-exposed outer membrane proteins (SE-OMPs) are crucial for bacterial\u2013host interactions. SE-OMPs locate and expose their epitope on cell surface where is easily accessed by host molecules. This study aimed to screen for surface-exposed proteins and their abundance profile of pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. Two complementary approaches, surface biotinylation and surface proteolytic shaving, followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to identify SE-OMPs of intact leptospires. For quantitative comparison, in-depth label-free analysis of SE-OMPs obtained from each method was performed using MaxQuant. The total number of proteins identified was 1,001 and 238 for surface biotinylation and proteinase K shaving, respectively. Among these, 39 were previously known SE-OMPs and 68 were predicted to be localized on the leptospiral surface. Based on MaxQuant analysis for relative quantification, six known SE-OMPs including EF- Tu, LipL21, LipL41, LipL46, Loa22, and OmpL36, and one predicted SE-OMPs, LipL71 were found in the 20 most abundant proteins, in which LipL41 was the highest abundant SE-OMP. Moreover, uncharacterized LIC14011 protein (LIP3228 ortholog in serovar Pomona) was identified as a novel predicted surface \u03b2b-OMP. High-abundance leptospiral SE-OMPs identified in this study may play roles in virulence and infection and are potential targets for development of vaccine or diagnostic tests for leptospirosis."
