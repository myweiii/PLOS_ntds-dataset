When mosquitoes are reared in a laboratory they are typically provided with ample nutrients as larvae so adults can grow to an optimal size; this ensures adults are robust for reproducible experiments. However, in the field not all larvae may have access to equal amounts of food. Studies including ours have shown that by restricting food as larvae, smaller adults can be produced, which can have an altered ability to be infected with and transmit arthropod-borne viruses. Zika virus is ingested into a female mosquito midgut when a blood-meal is acquired from an infected vertebrate host; the virus must infect midgut cells and escape this tissue to secondary tissues via the basal lamina, which surrounds the midgut. Viruses can then infect other organs including the salivary glands, for further transmission. In this study we focus on the impact limited nutrition as a larva has on the adultâ€™s transmission potential for Zika virus.
