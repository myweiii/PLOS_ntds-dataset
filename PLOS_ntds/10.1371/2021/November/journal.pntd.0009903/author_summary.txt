The advanced stage of the neglected tropical disease human African trypanosomiasis was, until relatively recently, treated with an old toxic arsenical drug and there was little investment in an improved treatment option. Eflornithine alone was efficacious, but difficult to administer as it required four two-hour infusions a day for 14 days. Nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) was developed as a simplified and easier to use treatment and was shown to be effective and sufficiently well tolerated in a randomized clinical trial. The present study was conducted to assess the overall effectiveness, including the feasibility of implementation of NECT under field conditions in a wider population than in the randomized clinical trial. We found that NECT can be implemented under field conditions and in remote areas, with the necessary logistical support and staff training for treatment administration. Adverse events, although very frequent, were considered acceptable given the severity of the disease. Less than 10% of patients showed severe adverse events. Over 24 months, the case fatality rate was 4.5% and relapses were rare (1.3%). The effectiveness of NECT was confirmed in a broad spectrum of second stage gambiense HAT patients, including children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and patients who had been previously treated for HAT.
