From the moment they start to penetrate the human skin, juvenile schistosomes secrete bioactive molecules to facilitate invasion, evade the host immune response, and establish a long-lived infection. One component of these secretions are pre-packaged, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) capable of modulating the host immune response. Whilst EVs contain a subset of known biologically relevant molecules, many EV proteins remain uncharacterised. Here we investigate the most abundant protein found within EVs released by early skin-stage schistosomesâ€”SmLEV1. We show that the lev1 gene is only found in the schistosomes and closely related species and is most abundantly expressed during the early stages of human infection. Localising the SmLEV1 protein to the pre-acetabular glands of the cercarial head, highlights this gland as a source of larval EVs. Vaccination with SmLEV1 had minimal effects on parasite burden, but significantly reduced the liver granuloma volume, implicating SmLEV1 as a potential anti-pathology target for schistosomiasis. Our collective findings are the first characterisation of SmLEV1 and provide essential data and resources for the ongoing study of schistosome EVs.
