Chagas disease is a deadly parasitic heart disease of humans, dogs, and other mammals that is spread by kissing bug vectors. In order to understand the risk of Chagas parasite infection to dogs over time, we followed infected and uninfected dogs (n = 64) to monitor changes in their status. This work took place across ten different large dog kennels in Texas, where there was a history of vector presence and canine deaths due to Chagas disease. In the absence of a gold standard diagnostic test, multiple parasite and antibody detection methods were used. Direct re-sampling of dogs over a 12-month period showed that all but one positive dog maintained the infection, and nearly one-third of the dogs that started the study as negative had converted to positive. Otherwise stated, a dog at these kennels has a risk of 30.7% of acquiring T. cruzi infection within one year. Novel vector control methods, antiparasitic treatment approaches, and diagnostic tests for Chagas disease are urgently needed to protect both animal and human health.
