    "Abstract": "B cells played an important role in Schistosoma infection-induced diseases. TLR7 is an intracellular member of the innate immune receptor. The role of TLR7 on B cells mediated immune response is still unclear. Here, C57BL/6 mice were percutaneously infected by S. japonicum for 5\u20136 weeks. The percentages and numbers of B cells increased in the infected mice (p < 0.05), and many activation and function associated molecules were also changed on B cells. More splenic cells of the infected mice expressed TLR7, and B cells were served as the main cell population. Moreover, a lower level of soluble egg antigen (SEA) specific antibody and less activation associated molecules were found on the surface of splenic B cells from S. japonicum infected TLR7 gene knockout (TLR7 KO) mice compared to infected wild type (WT) mice (p < 0.05). Additionally, SEA showed a little higher ability in inducing the activation of B cells from naive WT mice than TLR7 KO mice (p < 0.05). Finally, the effects of TLR7 on B cells are dependent on the activation of NF-\u03baB p65. Altogether, TLR7 was found modulating the splenic B cell responses in S. japonicum infected C57BL/6 mice."
