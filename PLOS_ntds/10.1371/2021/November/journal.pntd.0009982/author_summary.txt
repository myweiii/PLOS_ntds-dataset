L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis, newly identified human pathogens, cause visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis in HIV-negative patients, respectively. However, both parasite species cause disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis accompanying visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-positive patients. Species typing in leishmaniasis is important in diagnostics, epidemiology, and clinical studies. We show here that the 3′-UTR of HSP70-I region is a suitable target for PCR-based identification and discrimination between L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis. The technique is simple to perform and can be implemented in all settings where PCR is available. In species with similar PCR product size, the BsuRI-PCR-RFLP patterns of the 3′-UTR of HSP70-I fragments can be used for differentiating some species within other subgenera. However, where identification of species is essential or there is a travel history outside Thailand, sequencing of the HSP70-I-3′-UTR product or a similar discriminating target sequence is recommended. The PCR-based methods used in this study can also be applicable to the identification of Leishmania species obtained from vectors and reservoirs.
