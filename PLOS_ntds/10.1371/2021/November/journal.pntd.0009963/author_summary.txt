Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and causes a potentially debilitating febrile and arthralgic disease. The virus is a threat to public health in regions where the primary vectors are established, as evidenced by past epidemics in the Indian Ocean Islands, South America and the Caribbean. In Australia, there are established populations of Ae. aegypti both on the mainland and in the Torres Strait, and of Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait. This provides a theoretical potential for CHIKV transmission, as seen historically with dengue virus (DENV). It is therefore important to understand the epidemic potential of CHIKV in Australia. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) of CHIKV during the years 1995–2019 for 11 Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) in Australia, and found that Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, and Townsville were all susceptible to CHIKV epidemics. We then forecasted epidemic potential from 2020–2029 and found an increase in R0 across the six main UCLs. By highlighting factors that significantly influence the epidemic potential of CHIKV in Australia, our study supports evidence-based decision making for vector control and public health programs.
