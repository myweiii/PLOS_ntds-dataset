Aedes aegypti is an important vector of human viral diseases and is commonly controlled using pyrethroid insecticides. This has led to the evolution of insecticide resistance in this mosquito via two main mechanisms: increased detoxification of pyrethroids mediated by cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs) and mutations in the voltage sensitive sodium channel (Vssc, gene for the target site of pyrethroids). While much is known about the Vssc mutations, the mutation(s) causing the CYP-mediated resistance has been elusive. We used a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach to try to identify the molecular basis of CYP-mediated resistance in the highly resistant CKR strain. We identified CYPs that were overexpressed in the CKR strain, and for most of these the increased expression was due to a trans-acting factor. We identified 65 transcription factors or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may play a role in the increased expression of these CYPs. We also found evidence that stabilization of CYP proteins could be a mechanism of resistance.
