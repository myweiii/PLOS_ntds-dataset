Trachoma, a chronic conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, presents with follicles (trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular, TF) in children which leads to trachomatous conjunctival scarring (TS) in young adults. TS can progress to the in-turning of eyelashes, trachomatous trichiasis (TT) which places individuals at high risk of irreversible vision loss. Few studies to date have evaluated the progression of TS in communities that have recently transitioned to a low trachoma prevalence.
We studied the progression of TS in women in Kongwa, Tanzania a district that recently transitioned to a low prevalence of trachoma. We found that the overall cumulative progression of scarring was 35.3% over 3.5 years. The scarring progression rate observed is very similar to what we observed a decade prior in Kongwa when the trachoma prevalence was very high.
Our findings suggest that once scarring has developed it continues to progress irrespective of the current trachoma environment. This has potential ramifications for trachoma elimination efforts. An area could achieve the elimination of TF and still have to deal with scarring progression, which may lead to the development of TT. If this occurs: 1) elimination of TT will be delayed which will delay the overall elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, and 2) the limited resources available to elimination programs may need to be re-allocated.
