Females of the mosquito Aedes aegypti transmit arboviruses of human diseases including Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, and Culex quinquefasciatus transmits West Nile virus (WNV). Upon WNV detection in Harris County, TX, Harris County Public Health Mosquito and Vector Control Division applies pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticides to control Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Pyrethroids target the sodium channel and knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in this channel confer resistance to pyrethroids and increase mosquito survival. While Ae. aegypti is not a current target for public mosquito control in Harris County, we investigated frequency and spatial distribution of two kdr mutations in Ae. aegypti females, and their impact on pyrethroid survival after field tests were conducted with Permanone 31â€“66. The survival probability of mosquitoes varied depending on distance from application, and on their genotype and area of origin. Survivorship was lowest at 7.62 m, but most females survived at and beyond 15.24 m. Most (98.3%) females genotyped carried at least one kdr allele, and 77% were double homozygous resistant (II/CC). This is the first report of these resistant genotypes in Harris County. The resistant genotype II/CC had the highest survival probability. These results should be useful when modeling the risk of mosquito-borne diseases.
