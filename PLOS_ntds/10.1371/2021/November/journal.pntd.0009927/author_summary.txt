Echinococcosis is a chronic zoonotic parasitic disease, which is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus) and Echinococcus multiocularis (E. multiocularis). This disease is still widely prevalent in the world and seriously endangers human health and life, causing heavy burdens and economic losses to agriculture and animal husbandry. China is also one of the high incidence areas of the disease. At present, the preferred treatment is surgical excision of the parasitic mass, but patients with multiple cysts appear in multiple organs have to receive drug therapy. The approved chemotherapeutic drugs in clinic, such as albendazole (ABZ) and mebendazole, often do not work expectedly with a high rate of recurrence. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the new anti-echinococcal drug. IL-28B is an important member of type-III IFNs, which is equipped with the capacity of anti-viral activity and anti-tumor. In our previous study, we found that IL-28B could inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer cells via down-regulating Treg cells in mice. This study mainly studied the therapeutic effect of rAd-mIL-28B on E. granulosus-infected mice, and the results showed that rAd-mIL-28B could relieve the parasitic burden and inhibit Treg cells meanwhile improve the Th1 and Th17 immune responses. It may contribute to another choice for the anti-echinococcal treatment.
