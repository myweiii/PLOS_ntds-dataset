The two tsetse species transmitting nagana in South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique represent the southernmost distribution of this genus on the African continent. Distribution models were developed to support tsetse control. These models indicated that the main factors contributing to tsetse distribution in the area are the presence of host animals, variation in climate and vegetation mostly observed in protected areas, agricultural practises and land-use also had a significant and rapid impact on tsetse abundance in the area. Application of the model to areas north of the southern distribution predict a low presence of suitable habitats in the Gaza and Inhambane Provinces of Mozambique, thereby indicating that this southern population is geographically isolated from the main tsetse belt starting in the north of Mozambique.
