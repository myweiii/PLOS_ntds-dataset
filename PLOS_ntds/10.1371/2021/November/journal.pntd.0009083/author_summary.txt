Schistosomiasis is a parasitic waterborne disease affecting more than 240 million people worldwide every year, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The difference in schistosoma infection prevalence, infection intensity and risk between males and females has rarely been quantified. In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively synthesise published studies that present sex-disaggregated epidemiological data and investigate gender differences (e.g. those driven by social and cultural norms) that predispose males or females to higher risk of infection. Based on the 123 studies included in our meta-analysis, we found a higher prevalence of Schistosoma (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) in males.
