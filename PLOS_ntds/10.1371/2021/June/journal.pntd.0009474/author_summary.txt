In our previous studies with tsetse fly-refractory waterbuck body odor, we found that certain subtle structural changes are associated with shifts in activities of some constituents from repellency to attraction. This led us to discovery of three potent tsetse attractants (ε-nonalactone, nonanoic acid and 2-nonanone). In the present study, we explored possible synergistic effects of blending of these compounds in different proportions to Glossina pallidipes and Glossina m. morsitans in the laboratory, followed by field studies with G. pallidipes. A three-component blend comprised of ε -nonalactone, nonanoic acid and 2-nonanone in 1:3:2 proportion gave 235% higher tsetse fly catches in the field compared with that of POCA and FCU. Thus, dispensing this odor blend in tsetse fly traps or insecticide treated targets is expected to suppress the tsetse flies more efficiently. It will also be interesting to see if the blend is similarly attractive to other savannah tsetse fly species.
