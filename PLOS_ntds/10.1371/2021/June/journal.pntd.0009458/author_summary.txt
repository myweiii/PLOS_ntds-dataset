Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects most warm-blooded animals and can be transmitted from animals to humans. Three dominant genetic types have been described from a larger pool of around 16, and it has been suggested that the severity of disease may be influenced by genetic type. Little is known of T. gondii in Africa. The burden of disease is unclear, while lack of knowledge around genetic diversity and population structure undermines effective risk assessment and control. We sought to determine if T. gondii was prevalent in pigs and poultry produced for human consumption in Nigeria, comparing with genetic types detected in the overlapping human population. Using meat samples from free-range chickens and pigs, and blood samples from seropositive pregnant women in Benue state, Nigeria, we found that T. gondii with a type II genetic background were most common with limited genetic diversity. Detection of comparable genetic types in the free-range chicken, pig and human populations indicate an overlapping parasite population and can be used to inform assessments of risk to human health, most notably pregnant women. The information reported here informs on the occurrence and population structure of T. gondii in Nigeria, contributing to improved understanding in Africa.
