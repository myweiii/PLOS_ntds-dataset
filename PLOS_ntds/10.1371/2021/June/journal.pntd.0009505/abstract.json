    "Background": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease and associated with high mortality and disability rate among symptomatic cases. In the absence of local data, this study estimated the economic burden and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to JE in Zhejiang Province, China during 2013\u20132018, to increase disease awareness and provide evidence for effective health policy.",
    "Methodology/Principle findings": "We merged multiple data sources, including National Notifiable Disease Registry System (NNDRS), patient interviews and medical records from corresponding hospitals for JE cases which occurred during 2013\u20132018 in Zhejiang Province. Direct costs were extracted from hospitals\u2019 billing systems and patient interviews. Indirect costs and disease burden were calculated based on questionnaire survey from patient interviews and follow-up assessment by general practitioners. Given under-reporting, an expansion factor (EF) was applied to extrapolate the JE burden to the provincial level. The total economic burden of JE during 2013\u20132018 was estimated at US $12.01 million with an EF = 3. Of this, $8.32 million was due to direct economic cost and $3.69 million to indirect cost. The disease burden of JE was 42.75 DALYs per million population (28.44 YLD, 14.28 YLL) according to the 1990 Global Burden of Disease (GBD 1990) methodology and 80.01 DALYs (53.67YLD, 26.34YLL) according to the GBD 2010 methodology. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the overall economic burden varied from US$ 1.73\u201336.42 million. The greatest variation was due to the prognosis of illness (-85.57%-203.17%), followed by occupation (-34.07%-134.12%) and age (-72.97%-47.69%).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "JE imposes a heavy burden for families and society in Zhejiang Province. This study provides comprehensive empirical estimates of JE burden to increase awareness and strengthen knowledge of the public. These data may support provincial level public health decision making for prevention and control of JE. Ongoing surveillance for acute meningitis and encephalitis syndrome (AEMS) in sentinel hospitals, is needed to further refine estimates of JE burden."
