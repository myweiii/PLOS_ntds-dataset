Chagas is a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and is one of the most important public health concerns affecting the population of Latin America. This disease presents an acute phase that generally goes undiagnosed and a chronic phase with cardiac manifests principally, is diagnosed through serological tests that are not available in the majority of regions endemic for Chagas disease (CD), the results may take weeks to be returned due to logistical and operational reasons that comprise the main obstacles in initiating treatment of the disease. In the present article, quality indices of two RDT’s were evaluated during a field study in the department of Boyacá Colombia, these tests are easy to administer, require only minimal quantities of sample, provide rapid results and do not require electrical equipment or refrigeration. The sensitivity of the two RDT’s was 100% and the specificity of CDP was 99.1% and for CSP was 100% according to reference tests. The results obtained support the recommendation of using RDT’s in order to help diagnose chronic Chagas disease and thus to improve access to treatment for the populations studied as soon as possible.
