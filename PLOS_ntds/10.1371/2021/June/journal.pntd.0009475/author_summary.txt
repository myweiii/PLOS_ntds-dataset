The House Index and Breteau index are the most widely used indices for vector surveillance. However, the appropriateness of these larval indices has been questioned as they have not been satisfactorily linked to disease transmission. Indices based on actual counts of adult Aedes are likely to be more useful in assessing transmission risk, but the adult Aedes population is rarely sampled as such sampling is perceived as time-consuming and difficult. In this study, which used national data from Singapore, we investigated the effect of adult Aedes abundance on the risk of dengue transmission. We found that areas with high Ae. aegypti abundance had a higher odds of dengue cluster formation. Our study findings suggest that the adult Ae. aegypti abundance can allow early identification of geographical localities at high risk of dengue transmission and thus, a useful indicator to anticipate and prioritize areas for dengue control.
