    "Background": "Preventive chemotherapy is the cornerstone of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) control. Long-term outcomes and adequate treatment frequency of the recently recommended albendazole-ivermectin have not been studied to date.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "Double-blind randomized controlled trials were conducted in Lao PDR, Pemba Island, Tanzania and Côte d’Ivoire between 2018 and 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole versus albendazole-placebo in Trichuris trichiura-infected individuals aged 6 to 60. In the framework of this study, in Lao PDR 466 and 413 participants and on Pemba Island, 558 and 515 participants were followed-up six and 12 months post-treatment, respectively. From each participant at least one stool sample was processed for Kato-Katz diagnosis and cure rates (CRs), egg reduction rates (ERRs) and apparent reinfection rates were calculated. If found helminth-positive at six months, participants were re-treated according to their allocated treatment.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "The long-term outcomes against T. trichiura of ivermectin-albendazole are superior to albendazole in terms of CRs and ERRs and in reducing infection intensities. Our results will help to guide decisions on how to best use ivermectin-albendazole in the context of large-scale PC programs tailored to the local context to sustainably control STH infections.",
    "Trial registration": "ClinicalTrials.gov registered with clinicaltrials.gov, reference: NCT03527732, date assigned: 17 May 2018."
