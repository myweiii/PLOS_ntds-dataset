Around 1.5 billion people are infected with the gastrointestinal dwelling nematodes, the so-called soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Especially chronic high-intensity infections with these parasites can cause substantial morbidity in endemic regions. Preventive chemotherapy, which is the regular administration of a single dose of an anthelmintic drug to at-risk populations, aims to reduce morbidity by lowering the prevalence and intensity of STH infections. Due to the suboptimal efficacy of these recommended single dose monotherapies, particularly against Trichuris trichiura, the use of drug combinations with dissimilar modes of action may enhance treatment efficacy. In double-blind randomized controlled trials in Lao PDR and on Pemba Island, Tanzania, we examined the long-term outcomes of ivermectin-albendazole versus albendazole alone, against T. trichiura. We assessed the infection status, apparent reinfections, new infections and the change of infection intensity for the three major STH species six and 12 months post-treatment. The long-term outcomes (in terms of cure and egg-reduction rates) of the ivermectin-albendazole combination therapy against T. trichiura were significantly higher than that of albendazole alone at all-time points and in both countries. Bi-annual treatment intervals using the ivermectin-albendazole combination might be necessary to sustainably decrease transmission of STH infections.
