Cholera is caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, which induces massive fluid accumulation in the hostâ€™s gut and secretory diarrhea. Cholera deaths can be prevented by timely diagnosis and early treatment of the patients using rehydration therapy. Outbreaks of cholera are often reported in several countries due to poor quality of drinking water and lack of sanitation. Early diagnosis of cholera outbreaks is highly useful for the enforcement of control measures. In many cholera endemic countries, laboratory resources in detecting the cholera cases are limited. Even though the conventional culture methods of the isolation and identification V. cholerae are useful for cholera diagnosis, its sensitivity is not superior compared to antibody and DNA-based techniques. Several antibody-based cholera rapid diagnostic kits (RTDs) are designed for use as a point-of-care (POC) device or field conditions. Using the diarrheal stool samples, we compared the performance of three cholera RDTs with bacterial culture and PCR assays. Applying culture and PCR results as the gold standards and also in the absence of a gold standard, appropriate statistical analysis has been made for diagnostic test evaluations. We have also considered the presence of other pathogens in the stools and clinical characteristics of the patients in the analysis. Though the cholera RDT kits highly useful for the detection of V. cholerae O1, even in the presence of other pathogens in the stools, they cannot be considered as a POC tool due to lack of required specificity.
