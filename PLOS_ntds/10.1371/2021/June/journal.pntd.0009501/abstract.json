    "Abstract": "Shigellosis is a heavy disease burden in China especially in children aged under 5 years. However, the age-related factors involved in transmission of shigellosis are unclear. An age-specific Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infectious/Asymptomatic\u2013Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to shigellosis surveillance data maintained by Hubei Province Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2005 to 2017. The individuals were divided into four age groups (\u2264 5 years, 6\u201324 years, 25\u201359 years, and \u2265 60 years). The effective reproduction number (Reff), including infectivity (RI) and susceptibility (RS) was calculated to assess the transmissibility of different age groups. From 2005 to 2017, 130,768 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model fitted well with the reported data (P < 0.001). The highest transmissibility (Reff) was from \u2264 5 years to the 25\u201359 years (mean: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34\u20131.17), followed by from the 6\u201324 years to the 25\u201359 years (mean: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.35\u20131.02), from the \u2265 60 years to the 25\u201359 years (mean: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.29\u20130.86), and from the 25\u201359 years to 25\u201359 years (mean: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.21\u20130.78). The highest infectivity was in \u2264 5 years (RI = 1.71), and was most commonly transmitted to the 25\u201359 years (45.11%). The highest susceptibility was in the 25\u201359 years (RS = 2.51), and their most common source was the \u2264 5 years (30.15%). Furthermore, \u201cknock out\u201d simulation predicted the greatest reduction in the number of cases occurred by when cutting off transmission routes among \u2264 5 years and from 25\u201359 years to \u2264 5 years. Transmission in \u2264 5 years occurred mainly within the group, but infections were most commonly introduced by individuals in the 25\u201359 years. Infectivity was highest in the \u2264 5 years and susceptibility was highest in the 25\u201359 years. Interventions to stop transmission should be directed at these age groups."
