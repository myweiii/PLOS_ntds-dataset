    "Abstract": "Most of the Helicobacter pylori infections occur in developing countries. The risk factors for H. pylori infections are poverty, overcrowding, and unhygienic conditions, which are common problems in under-privileged countries such as Nepal. Despite having a high risk of H. pylori infections, no national level study has been conducted to assess prevalence and correlates of H. pylori infection in Nepal. Therefore, we hypothesized that micronutrients such as iron, vitamin B12 deficiency, socio-economic status, and nutritional status correlate with the prevalence of H. pylori infection in Nepal."
