Helicobacter pylori is associated with a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases and is a common problem in tropical region where inter-human contact is the primary mode of disease transmission. Poor socio-economic status is a crucial fueling factor of H. pylori infection. In this study, the authors present data from Nepal national micronutrient status survey 2016 (NNMSS-2016) and investigated the risk factors associated with H. pylori infections among under-five years old children, 10–19 years old adolescent boys and girls, and 20–49 years non-pregnant women nationwide. Study findings corroborate that poverty-associated markers are the key driving factor of H. pylori infections in Nepal, which can have a manifold effect on nutrition and subsequent child growth retardation. Management of safe drinking water and implementation of sanitation and hygiene practices to decrease acquisition of H. pylori infection is a pressing need in rural parts of Nepal and among marginalized communities. The findings of this study highlight the varied prevalence of H. pylori by age group, gender, place of residence, ethnic group, and ecological regions of the country. Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between nutritional and micronutrients status with H. pylori infection.
