Riverine tsetse flies transmit parasites that cause sleeping sickness, so Tiny Targets have been developed to control them. Tiny Targets comprise adjacent panels of insecticide-coated blue polyester fabric and black net, and they work because tsetse are attracted by the blue fabric, and are killed by the insecticide if they make contact. In order to improve Tiny Targets, new coloured polyester fabrics have been developed with the aim of attracting more tsetse. These include a blue fabric produced by Vestergaard S.A. and currently used to make Tiny Targets, and a violet fabric developed by modelling fly colour vision and effective against savannah tsetse. We recorded the numbers of tsetse attracted to Tiny Targets made from these fabrics, and a typical blue polyester. Based on our data, we predicted the performance of such Tiny Targets in future deployments. It is highly probable that both Vestergaard blue and violet fabrics will attract more tsetse than typical blue. The average catch at a violet Tiny Target is quite likely to exceed that at a Vestergaard blue one, but because the difference is small and catches variable, there is unlikely to be a meaningful performance difference between these fabrics when deployed this way.
