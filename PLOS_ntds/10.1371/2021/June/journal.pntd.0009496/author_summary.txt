The rate of disease emergence is increasing globally, and many long-existing diseases are extending their distribution ranges. This is the case for dengue, a global pandemic whose mosquito vectors are currently occupying ever-increasing numbers of regions worldwide. We updated the most complete global dataset of dengue cases available, and addressed the fine-scale analysis of the geographic changes experienced in dengue-transmission risk since the late 20th century. Our approach is the first to take into account the potential role of primates and sylvatic vectors in increasing the disease transmission risk in tropical forests. We built models that describe the favorable areas for vector presence and for disease occurrence, and combined them in order to obtain a novel model for predicting transmission risk. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Oceania, and to regions with presently no or very few cases, including cities in Europe and Japan. The global contribution of sylvatic dengue cycles is small but meaningful. Our methodological approach can differentiate the factors favoring risk in different world regions, thus allowing for management strategies to be prepared specifically for each of these regions.
