Schistosomiasis or Bilharzia is among the top debilitating parasitic diseases in endemic developing countries. It presents either in urinary or intestinal form. The diseases’ mode of transmission is waterborne through contact with infested water. The main groups affected in developing countries are women and children due to their frequent contact with water. WHO introduced a mass drug administration program whereby drugs are distributed in endemic communities to cut off the transmission of NTDs including schistosomiasis.Praziquantel is the sole drug for the treatment of all forms of Schistosomiasis currently and it has been proven to be highly efficacious. The WHO’s Preventative chemotherapy program uses the same drug as a prophylactic tool to control the disease.This drug presents a challenge in administering it to younger school children due to its size and the unpleasant taste of the available 600mg tablet. This makes it difficult to administer the correct dosage of the drug to school children and it excludes preschoolers from administration program.This study was done as a swillandspit exercise (the drug was not ingested) to assess the new orally disintegrating isomers of Praziquantel, L-PZQ and Rac-PZQ which have been prepared as 150mg tablets and sweetened through the addition of a sweetener (Sucralose), in comparision to the existing Praziquantel formulation. Findings from 48 African children showed that both new formulations are more palatable to younger children as compared to the existing Praziquantel formulation.These results provided confidence for further evaluation of the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the paediatric friendly formulations of Praziquantel tablets for schistosomiasis treatment.
