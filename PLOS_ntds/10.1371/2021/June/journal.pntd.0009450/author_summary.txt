In Malaysia, malaria caused by the human-only malaria parasites has been all but eliminated, and the major obstacles to a malaria-free status are now emerging malaria caused by zoonotic transmission of Plasmodium knowlesi parasites and outbreaks caused by imported parasites. One such outbreak occurred in 2019 in a village in northern Sabah. This outbreak was unusual, as it was found to be caused by P. malariae, an often-benign human malaria parasite rarely seen in Malaysia. We investigated this outbreak and found that the index case could be traced to an Indonesian migrant worker employed in the logging industry. An additional 13 people in the village developed malaria symptoms and were subsequently found to be positive for P. malariae. A further 94 inhabitants of the village without symptoms were then tested by a sensitive PCR technique, and 31 of them were also found to be positive for the parasite. These results illustrate the threat posed by asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites, and the importance of PCR testing for outbreaks of residual malaria in elimination settings.
