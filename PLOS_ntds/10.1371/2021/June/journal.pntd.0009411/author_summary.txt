Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is considered the second most important disease caused by a protozoan worldwide. Currently, 97% of the cases in Latin America are in Brazil. In São Paulo state, since 1997, the disease has been found in an increasing number of municipalities, mainly in the western region. The reasons why VL is spreading in a crescent shape in this region is not well understood, however, socioeconomic and environmental risk factors that increase vulnerability to the disease may be involved. From 2000 to 2018, vectors of Lutzomyia longipalpis were found in 77.8%, canine VL in 69%, and human VL in 44.4% of the 45 municipalities of the western region. Dispersion occurred from the epicenter in the north and followed central and radial highways, reaching Teodoro Sampaio in the south. Among the 45 municipalities, 11 were identified as priority areas for implementing surveillance and control actions. Considered the last frontier and one of the poorest regions of São Paulo, our findings are relevant for planning interventions aimed at reducing the cases of VL in the region.
