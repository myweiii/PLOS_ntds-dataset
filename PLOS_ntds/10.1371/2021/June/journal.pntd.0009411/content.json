    "Introduction": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases worldwide. In 2017, 94% of new cases occurred in seven countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan [1]. In 2019, 97% of the total numbers of cases in Latin America were reported by Brazil [2]. Currently, 25 of 27 Brazilian states notified autochthonous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and 23 notified cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) [3].\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, the richest and most populous state, Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies were found in 1997, infected dogs in 1998, and infected humans in 1999. In 2020, 106 of 645 (16.4%) municipalities registered cases of HVL [4].\nIn recent years, from where and how VL reached the western region of S\u00e3o Paulo has been raised. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that the disease crossed the Bolivian border with Brazil and was found in the cities of Corumb\u00e1 and Lad\u00e1rio, on the western side of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), expanded to its capital, Campo Grande, crossed the entire state and reached Tr\u00eas Lagoas, located on the western border of S\u00e3o Paulo. From MS to SP, the first diffusion occurred through the cities along with the construction of the Novoeste railway (1909\u20131952), the (BR-300) highway, completed in 1980, and the construction of a pipeline (1998) [5]. In S\u00e3o Paulo, CVL and HVL were first found in Ara\u00e7atuba, a city harboring the railway, the highway, and the pipeline [6]. However, following the Candido Rondon highway (BR300), the disease crossed the state from the western region to the east toward the capital [6]. In the 45 municipalities of RNHA11 mesoregion, in the western region of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the border of MS, the first phlebotomine systematic collection was found in Dracena, a city located in the north and considered the epicenter [7]. In 2020, the western region harbored 537 of 3042 (17.6%) individuals infected with VL in S\u00e3o Paulo [4].\nIt has been hypothesized that in the western region, the presence of socioeconomic and environmental risk factors may favor the biological cycle of the disease, increasing the presence of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi parasites, Lu. longipalpis vectors, and infected Canis familiaris, which in turn infect humans. Also, no study has been conducted on the dispersion of VL in the western region of S\u00e3o Paulo using an integrative approach so far. Our study is innovative because it allows the construction of a framework on two geographical scales: the regional scale combines public databases of the 45 municipalities of RNHA11 mesoregion; the local scale combines databases of Teodoro Sampaio, a representative city of RNHA11. To study the spread of this neglected disease in the 45 municipalities of RNHA11 on the regional scale, public databases on vectors, dogs, humans, environment, and socioeconomic risk factors were accessed. On a local scale, an entomological, canine, and human VL survey was conducted in Teodoro Sampaio, considered the capital of Pontal of Paranapanema.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe project was approved by the ethics committee of Unoeste (number 4030). Canine samples were collected with the written informed consent of owners. Ethical approval was obtained from the Adolfo Lutz/Pasteur Institute Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals (number 02/2016). The study is for scientific research purposes and is in compliance with Federal Law no. 11794 of October 8, 2008, Decree no. 6899 of July 15, 2009, and in accordance with regulations outlined by The National Council for Animal Experimentation Control (Conselho Nacional para Controle da Experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o Animal, CONCEA).\n\n\nStudy design and setting\nRegional characteristics.In 2020, S\u00e3o Paulo, the richest and most populous state of Brazil, with an estimated population of 44,639,899, accounts for 21.0% of the entire population of Brazil, estimated to be 213,930,425 inhabitants according to Brazilian Census (IBGE) [8] (Fig 1). The state comprises 645 municipalities, bordering Minas Gerais (north and northeast), Rio de Janeiro (northeast), Paran\u00e1 (south), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) (west), and the Atlantic Ocean (east) (Fig 1A). It is divided geographically into 15 mesoregions and 18 Regional Networks for Health Assistance (RNHAs). The western region comprises 45 municipalities and an estimated population of 753,344 inhabitants (2018) and it is administered by RNHA11, located in Presidente Prudente, mesoregion 8. The region is characterized by municipalities with a population <20,000 [8]. Among the 45 municipalities that are part of RNHA11, a group of 23 municipalities is called Pontal of Paranapema region, because of its relationship with the Paranapanema river. The Pontal of Paranapanema covers an area of 18,392.16 km2 and has an estimated population of 620,953 [8] (Fig 1A). In contrast to the dynamic economic situation in the rest of the state, it is considered one of the poorest regions of S\u00e3o Paulo state [9].\n(A) The highway network between the municipalities of RNHA11 and Teodoro Sampaio. Artificial lakes and bridges on the Paran\u00e1 River linking RNHA11 municipalities to well-known endemic regions in Mato Grosso do Sul state, and bridges over artificial lakes in the Paranapanema river linking regions with VL to VL-free areas in Paran\u00e1 state.

OpenMapTiles map website. https://www.maptiler.com/maps/#hybrid//vector/11.88/-52.1721/-22.53428.\n\nLocal characteristics.Teodoro Sampaio (latitude 22\u00b031\u203257\u2033 S and longitude 52\u00b010\u203203\u2033 W) at an altitude of 321 meters above sea level has an estimated population of 23,019. It is a small-sized urban town located 651 km from the state capital, and in the middle of a State Park and a high concentration of rural settlements. The municipality covers an area of 1,556 km2, currently the 8th largest municipality in S\u00e3o Paulo [8] (Fig 1A and 1Ba). The municipality has sandy soil and a typical tropical climate with dry winters and wet summers, with an average annual temperature of 26\u00b0C varying from 16\u00b0C to 33\u00b0C.\nThe canine population of Teodoro Sampaio was estimated to be 5,754 animals, with a ratio of 1 dog per 4 inhabitants as previously determined for the region [10,11]. Devil\u2019s Hill State Park (Parque Estadual Morro do Diabo) is located 6.3 km from the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio. Covering an area of 338.5 km2, it is one of the largest stretches of Tropical Forest in S\u00e3o Paulo state (Fig 1Bb). In the 1,950s, the whole region of RNHA11 was covered by a Tropical Forest that was almost completely destroyed. The Tropical Forest in Pontal of Paranapanema was extensively destroyed, especially in the middle of the 20th century, replaced by agricultural activities and urbanization. More than 3,000 km2 of dense vegetation was reduced to 370 km2 in less than 20 years (12.3%), including the Devil\u2019s Hill State Park and other small fragments. Flowing along the border of the city, the Paranapanema River is one of the biggest and most important rivers in the southeastern region of Brazil, and is a natural border between S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states (Fig 1Bc). It is 930 km long and since the 1,980s, it includes 11 large artificial lakes and an extensive flooded area, supporting hydroelectric plants and bridges. These bridges link dozens of small towns and villages connected by a large number of highways (Fig 1A).\n\n\n\nPotential dispersion routes of VL infection in RNHA11 mesoregion\nRNHA11 is connected by two important radial highways: (1) the Marechal Candido Rondon (SP 300) linking two VL endemic regions: Tr\u00eas Lagoas, on the border of MS and Ara\u00e7atuba-Bauru in the center-northeastern region of S\u00e3o Paulo; (2) the Euclides Figueiredo highway (SP 563) linking the VL endemic regions of Pereira Barreto, Ilha Solteira, and Andradina to Dracena, one of the most important cities of RNHA11, also with the highest prevalences in VL. Secondary highways also link the RNHA11 from north to south in direction to Paran\u00e1 state, a region free of VL so far. Teodoro Sampaio is connected by a network of radial and secondary highways. One of the most important is the secondary vicinal highway (VSP-031; VSP-035) connecting the endemic regions of Presidente Epit\u00e1cio and Panorama, bordering the Paran\u00e1 River to Teodoro Sampaio (Fig 1A)\nData on Lu. longipalpis, canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and HVL in the 45 municipalities of RHN11were obtained from archival databases from Brazilian public health agencies. Lu longipalpis: Supervision in Control of Epidemic (SUCEN), http://www.saude.sp.gov.br/sucen-superintendencia-de-controle-de-endemias/homepage/downloads/arquivos-leishmaniose-visceral; Canine visceral leishmaniasis: Center of Regional Laboratory of the Adolfo Lutz Institute of Presidente Prudente V (CRL-ALI-PPV), http://www.ial.sp.gov.br/ial/lab.-regionais/clr-v-presidente-prudente/contato; Human visceral leishmaniasis: Epidemiological Surveillance Center (CVE-SP), http://www.saude.sp.gov.br/cve-centro-de-vigilancia-epidemiologica-prof.-alexandre-vranjac/areas-de-vigilancia/doencas-de-transmissao-por-vetores-e-zoonoses/.\n\n\nData on the presence of Lu. longipalpis in the municipalities of RNHA11\nIn RNHA11, data on phlebotomine sand flies identified in entomological collections were obtained from SUCEN in the period from 2000 to 2019. Entomologic surveys are proposed by the Manual of Surveillance and Control of Visceral Leishmaniasis of S\u00e3o Paulo (VLCPSP) [12], aiming to monitor the distribution of Lu. longipalpis in silent non-receptive, non-vulnerable municipalities, and silent non-receptive vulnerable municipalities as defined by the absence of confirmed autochthonous cases of HVL and CVL, without the presence of the chosen vector or not by estimated values of the distance to characterize the vulnerability. In these municipalities, an entomologic survey is recommended for the detection of the presence of Lu. longipalpis and to provide information on its distribution, allowing identification of the risk areas where control measures should be intensified [12].\n\n\nCanine and human visceral leishmaniasis and Center of Zoonosis Control in the municipalities of RNHA11mesoregion\nAccording to VLCPSP guidelines [12], in S\u00e3o Paulo state, the municipalities are divided into two groups: silenced for VL, that is, without confirmation of autochthonous human and/or canine cases; and with transmission, that is, with confirmation of autochthonous human and/or canine cases. The investigation of a case of CVL may occur by a passive or house-to-house survey, conducted by the Center of Zoonosis Control (CZC) or by the Municipal Zoonosis Service (MZS) of each municipality. An active house-to-house search is conducted when Lu. Longipalpis is found in a particular area of the city or every time a dog is diagnosed with CVL; sequentially, all households within a radius of 200 m are visited and the dogs are tested for CVL. A passive survey is conducted when a dog\u2019s owner finds the symptoms described by the CZC or MZS as suspicious for CVL, as previously published [10]. Data on CVL, presence, and characteristics in each municipality under the CZC in the RNHA11 mesoregion were obtained from Adolfo Lutz Institute of Presidente Prudente [13]. A suspected case of HVL is confirmed if it meets one of the following criteria: laboratory criteria, that is, identification of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi, from a culture and/or inoculation in hamsters and/or by molecular techniques; presence of Leishmania spp. in the direct parasitological examination; presence of anti- Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi antibodies in serological tests and clinical-epidemiological criteria, that is, a patient from the area of transmission of VL, with suggestive clinical signs and without laboratory confirmation, provided that other diagnostic hypotheses are ruled out, that presents a favorable response to therapeutic treatment. Data on patients infected with HVL in RNHA11 were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance Center of S\u00e3o Paulo, which organizes and publishes data on recorded infectious diseases in S\u00e3o Paulo state annually [4].\n\n\nMapping the cluster of identification of canine visceral leishmaniasis in RNHA11 mesoregion\nIn RNHA11 mesoregion, a Moran map was utilized to assess the formation of clusters of municipalities associated with the presence of CVL. Global spatial autocorrelation indicators, such as the Moran Index, present a single value as a measure of the spatial association for the data, which are presented by area, providing an index for the entire study region. However, it is often desirable to examine patterns on a more detailed scale to see if the process stationary hypothesis is verified locally, that is, if there is spatial dependence. Therefore, it is necessary to use spatial association indicators that can be associated with the different locations of a spatially distributed variable. This methodology uses the Local Moran Index (LISA) to find the spatial correlation of these areas. As it is a local indicator, there is a specific correlation value for each area, thus allowing the identification of clusters of areas and outliers [14,15]. Values vary from \u22121 to 1; values approaching zero indicate the absence of significant spatial autocorrelation of the values with their neighbors; values below 0.50 indicate a weak autocorrelation; values between 0.50 and 0.75 indicate medium autocorrelation; and values above 0.75 indicate strong autocorrelation. Positive values indicate a positive autocorrelation, where the value of what is being evaluated is similar to the values of its neighbors, and negative values indicate a negative autocorrelation [14\u201316].\n\n\nMapping the Human Development Index in the RNHA11 mesoregion\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) was used as an indicator for understanding the socioeconomic profile of the municipalities of S\u00e3o Paulo state. The HDI is a well-known and comparable indicator worldwide, reproducing studies in other states and regions countrywide [17]. The HDI value of the 45 municipalities in the RHN11 was obtained in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Sistema Estadual de An\u00e1lises de Dados (SEADE), from 1999 to 2016, coded and classified by the denominated quintile as a reference parameter. Thematic maps were created for the HDI using ArcGis 10.7.1 software. The HDI was analyzed with support in a predictive method of interpolation surface generation: local polynomial interpolation (LPI). The Gaussian kernel method was used to generate the surface, classified according to the quintile. The gain in the LPI analysis in relation to the global polynomial interpolation presupposes it overlaps in several concentrations that a spatial representation may have, in our study, through a point in the centroid city of S\u00e3o Paulo state.\n\n\nEntomological survey in Teodoro Sampaio\nIn the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio, the phlebotomine sand fly entomological survey began in 2000, monthly, from February to October during the most favourable periods for detecting the presence of the vector. The survey ended in October 2010 when Lu. longipalpis was found in all areas. To standardize collections, the number (ranging from 1 to 40) and frequency (ranging from 1 to 39) of CDC light traps (Horst Ltd, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) installed varied according to the density and infestation of sand flies. The traps were placed approximately 1 m from the ground in places susceptible to the presence of phlebotomies and/or in the shelters of domestic animals, with an average temperature above 20\u00b0C and relative humidity >70%. In each sector of the different areas, four areas with risk factors for the presence of phlebotomies were selected, including a large peri-domicile, and areas with abundant vegetation, accumulation of organic matter in the soil, and the presence of domestic animals from which the female sand fly can potentially obtain an infected blood meal. The traps were operated between 17:00 and 07:00 h. Monthly, four traps were installed for three nights in each sector. After capture, nylon-mesh cages were placed in plastic bags, tagged, and refrigerated (1\u00b0C\u20137\u00b0C) until identification was performed by the Regional Entomology Laboratories of SUCEN, Coordination of Disease Control, Secretary of State of Health, located in Presidente Prudente, S\u00e3o Paulo state. The sand flies were processed and identified using the taxonomic key of Galati [18].\n\n\nCanine visceral leishmaniasis survey in Teodoro Sampaio\nThe canine survey took place in four sectors of the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio, from January 2010 to December 2018, by a passive or house-to-house survey conducted by the Center of Zoonosis Control (CZC). We used recorded data of 3749 domiciled dogs of different ages, submitted to serum survey, using antibody tests to detect Leishmania, according to VLCPSP guidelines [12]. In Teodoro Sampaio, the Center of Regional Laboratory of the Adolfo Lutz Institute of Presidente Prudente (CRL-ALI-PPV) is responsible for the diagnostic tests for CVL. The VLCSP supervises the main actions to reduce morbidity and mortality, aimed at early diagnosis and treatment of human cases, vector control, identification, and euthanasia of seropositive domestic dogs. In 2009, the Ministry of Health began using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), produced by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for screening and confirmatory tests in CVL serological surveys. For ELISA-positive samples, a confirmatory test using IFAT, produced by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, was performed. From April 2012 to the present, the Brazilian Ministry of Health replaced the ELISA/IFAT tests with a new protocol using a dual-path platform CVL rapid test, produced by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, with ELISA-CVL as a confirmatory test. Animals with positive samples in the screening test (ELISA from January 2009 to March 2012 and the dual-path platform CVL rapid test from April 2012 until the present and a negative result in the confirmatory test (IFAT and ELISA, respectively) were re-sampled. Only concordant samples that were positive in the screening test and positive in the confirmatory test were considered seropositive [10]. Data on the presence and characteristics in each municipality under the CZC in the RNHA11 mesoregion were obtained from Adolfo Lutz Institute of Presidente Prudente [13].\n\n\nHuman visceral leishmaniasis in Teodoro Sampaio\nData on human leishmaniasis was obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance Municipality of Teodoro Sampaio. The sole case of HVL in Teodoro Sampaio was referred to the Regional Hospital of Presidente Prudente, a tertiary, university, public, and reference center for treatment of HVL in RNHA11 mesoregion. Confidentiality was assured. The case was confirmed in 2018 by clinical/epidemiologic criteria and laboratory diagnostics according to the VLCPSP guidelines [12].\n\n\nHuman visceral leishmaniasis serological survey and laboratory diagnosis in Teodoro Sampaio\nIn July 2018, a serological survey was conducted on 159 individuals aged from 18 to 65 years from four different locations: a health care center, a Family Health Strategy Unit; the Social Assistance Reference Center; a State Technical School; and in individuals attending a private clinical laboratory. Blood was collected blood collections tubes under vacuum with and without EDTA as an anticoagulant. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at \u2212200\u00b0C until use. The analysis was performed at the CRL-ALI-PPV using a qualitative test for the detection of antibodies against HVL by ELISA, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (LEISHMANIA ELISA IgG+IgM; VIRCELL, Santa Fe, Granada, Spain). The test uses recombinant antigens capable of fixing specific antibodies to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%. Positive tests were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Hemograms and hepatic enzymes were determined because hepatic function may be affected and pancytopenia may be present in patients infected with VL. Hemograms were performed using a flow cytometer flux counter (Pentra 80, HoribaDiagnostics, Montpellier, France) and the differential leukocyte count was compared with direct microscopic observation of blood smears. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and albumin were assessed using automated systems according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; the normal ranges were 7\u201355 U/L, 8\u201343 U/L, and 3.5\u20135 g/dL, respectively. A total of 16,636 individuals were considered to determine the sample size. These samples were processed by Laborat\u00f3rio Biocl\u00ednico, Teodoro Sampaio, SP, Brazil.\n\n\nKernel maps construction\nDogs that underwent the serological survey and those with positive serology were registered according to the location used by the municipal health surveillance service. The city was divided into four sectors, starting from the northeast of the urban area in a clockwise direction. These sectors, in turn, were divided into 432 blocks, arranged in a polygon shape, used to generate the Geographic Information System and served as a basis for indexing the attributes of the surveyed blocks. With the geometric points generated per block, it was possible to visualize the number of dogs with CVL in each block, the number of dogs in the census for each block, and the number of euthanized dogs per block. The number of positive dogs per block is not consistent with the number of euthanized dogs, because there were some cases in which euthanasia of dogs that tested positive was not performed. For the procedure that identified hot areas of CVL infection, we used the Kernel density maps, using the euthanized dogs as a population field to generate a continuous surface to the urban area of the Teodoro Sampaio. A raster surface was generated using the Gaussian equation, with a search ratio equivalent to a block (100 m) and a pixel size equivalent to a household (10 m). The coordinate system used as reference was WGS1984. Regarding the parameters for reading the data for analysis, the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio measures 4 \u00d7 3 km2.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe results are shown as means standard error of the mean (SEM) (for normally distributed variables). Dichotomous and nominal variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was used to describe the functional relationship between the number of cases of HVL per 10,000 inhabitants and the HDI of each municipality. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA, USA) and the Sigma-Stat program (Systat Software, Richmond, CA, USA). ArcGIS 10.7 and ArcGis Pro were used for data analysis and layout design.",
    "Results": "The presence of Lu. longipalpis in the municipalities of RNHA11 mesoregion\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Lu. longipalpis sand flies were found for the first time in Ara\u00e7atuba, an area surrounding the western region in January 1997. From 1997 to July 2019, the vector was found in 203 of 645 (31.5%) of the municipalities. In RNHA11 mesoregion, Lu. longipalpis was detected for the first time in Dracena in 2003 in the north; the sand flies dispersed toward the south in the direction of the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema and Paran\u00e1 state.

The Global Moran Index was applied and presented a weak spatial autocorrelation, but statistically significant (I = 0.2572). Applying the Local Moran Index Cluster Map (LISA) revealed that most municipalities (32 of 45; 71.1%) were non-significant, however, 13 of 45 (28.9%) showed significant spatial autocorrelation, distributed in the following quadrants: high-high with 5 municipalities Q (+/+), Presidente Venceslau, Ouro Verde, Dracena, Tupi Paulista, and Junqueir\u00f3polis; low-low with 5 municipalities Q (\u2212/\u2212), Sandovalina, Tarabai, Martin\u00f3polis, Taciba, and Presidente Bernardes; low-high with 2 municipalities Q (\u2212/+), Piquerobi and Ribeir\u00e3o dos \u00cdndios; and in the high-low quadrant, only one municipality Q (+/\u2212), Presidente Prudente. In the LISA map, we can see the p value of significant municipalities (Fig 3).\nAmong the 45 municipalities of RNHA11, 11 are classified as high-risk clusters. They are concentrated mainly in the north region, considered the epicenter of the disease. (A) Univariate LISA and (B) LISA significance.

Map with Spatial Statistics Application GEODA: https://spatial.uchicago.edu/software.\n\n\nHuman visceral leishmaniasis in RNHA11 mesoregion\nFig 4A shows that over 14 years of follow-up (2005\u20132018), 19 of 45 (42.2%) municipalities in RNHA11 mesoregion referred patients infected with VL. In the northern area, all the municipalities\u2019 notified cases, most of them at increased rates (17\u201357 cases), and Dracena (dark red), considered to be the epicenter, showed the highest rates (58\u2013176 cases). On Pontal of Paranapanema, 8 of 32 (25.0%) municipalities registered HVL, and dispersion on the regional scale occurred in three different ways: irradiation, contiguity, and jumps (when municipalities far from the endemic region register cases of CVL or HVL). In municipalities located along the Paran\u00e1 River, only one did not register cases (Fig 4A). Fig 4B shows that cases were found first in Dracena in 2005, in subsequent years HVL spread to the neighboring municipalities and in 2010 reached the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema. Teodoro Sampaio, 133 km from the epicenter, was one of the last municipalities to register cases and HVL was detected in 2018.\nThe colors represent the cumulative number of cases (A).

On the south side, the region is divided from Paran\u00e1 state by the Paranapanema River, which flows along the border of ten municipalities. Together, the rivers support seven large lakes and a flooded area of 6175 km2 and seven dams and bridges (Fig 1A). These bridges link the VL endemic regions of Tr\u00eas Lagoas in MS and Andradina in S\u00e3o Paulo state to the areas of the western region as well as the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema to the VL-free areas of Paran\u00e1 state. The urban area of Teodoro Sampaio (Fig 1Ba) is surrounded by the Devil\u2019s Hill State Park (Fig 1Bb), 6.3 km away, and linked by a highway with the administrative offices, museums, laboratories, and environmental educational areas of the park. The municipality of Teodoro Sampaio is served by both the Paran\u00e1 and Paranapanema Rivers, which surround the urban area of the city at a distance of 1 km (Fig 1Bc). In the region, the average annual precipitation varies between 1200 and 1500 mm, and the average annual temperature remains slightly above 22\u00b0C.\n\n\nThe Human Development Index in the RNHA11mesoregion\nIn the municipalities in this study, the HDI varied from very low in 4 municipalities and low in 15 municipalities to high only in Presidente Prudente, the most important city in RNHA11 mesoregion. Of the areas with very low and low HDIs, 18 (40%) of the municipalities are located in the Pontal of Paranapanema region. Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, connecting the Para\u00edba Valley to the Metropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo city, and from Campinas to Piracicaba presents an axis of great development, with the HDI varying from 0.790 to 0.826. The regions with the lowest HDI values are the Ribeira Valley, located in the south of the state, and Pontal of Paranapanema (our study area). In Teodoro Sampaio, rates vary from 0.678 to 0.715. In S\u00e3o Paulo state, the HDI is distributed by regions, and maps are available in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Sistema Estadual de An\u00e1lise de dados (SEADE), Teodoro Sampaio is surrounded by very poor municipalities, Euclides da Cunha Paulista, Marab\u00e1 Paulista, and Caiu\u00e1, with rates between 0.6770 and 0.704 (Fig 2).\nWhen the functional relationship between the number of cases of HVL per 10,000 inhabitants and the HDI of each municipality was calculated, the correlation (adjusted R value) had a value less than 10% and the P value was not significant, however, when municipalities that did not have cases of VL were removed and the simple linear regression technique was applied, the regression line showed a trend for lower values of VL cases per 10,000 inhabitants as the HDI increased (Fig 5).\n\n\nEntomological survey in the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio\nTeodoro Sampaio covers two areas with regard to operational disease control programs (e.g. dengue fever surveillance and control, CVL and HVL surveillance and control). The two areas are divided into four sectors and the sectors are divided into blocks (Fig 6A and 6B). Lu. longipalpis were initially found in July 2010 in area 1, sectors 2 and 4 in blocks 146 and 298, and in October 2010 in area 1, sector 1, and block 75 (Table 1).\nKernel of the spatiotemporal distribution of CVL diagnosed and euthanized dogs (A). The hotspots represent areas where a higher density of seropositive dogs was observed, from 2010 to 2018 (B). In the map legend, the lighter colors represent the low density of CVL cases and the darker colors represent the presence of hotspots. Data on seropositive euthanized dogs are available as S1 Data file.\n\n\nCanine serological survey and spatial distribution of euthanized dogs in Teodoro Sampaio\nIn 2010, CVL was identified for the first time in the urban area of Teodoro Sampaio. From January 2010 to December 2018, 3749 dogs were selected for serology by the CZC and 298 animals (7.9%) were positive for CVL. Fig 6A shows the kernel spatiotemporal distribution of euthanized dogs. Of the 298 dogs that were positive, 110 (36.9%) were euthanized according to the criteria of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. In 2010 and 2011, infected dogs were identified and euthanized in sectors 1, 2, and 3 (three hotspots; dark red color). In 2012\u20132013, infected dogs were found in the areas surrounding the sectors where dogs positive for CVL were found in 2010\u20132011 (ochre color). From 2014 to 2017, positive cases reached the entire urban area, including sector 4 (apple green and green colors), and in 2018 no euthanized dogs were registered. Fig 6B shows the hotspots of infected dogs euthanized. The periphery of sector 1 showed a higher number, demonstrated by critical points hotspots, whereas sector 4 showed the lowest number. These data allow us to consider that a stronger force of infection occurs in sector 1, the main hotspot. The first case of HVL in the city was located in this sector. Several dogs were not euthanized for different reasons.\n\n\nCases of human visceral leishmaniasis in Teodoro Sampaio\nTeodoro Sampaio, 133 km from the epicenter, was one of the last municipalities to register cases and HVL was detected in 2018. The first autochthonous case of HVL was identified in 2018 in the eastern area, area 1, on the outskirts of Teodoro Sampaio (Fig 6B), where a high number of cases of CVL were found throughout the period. The patient was a 48-year-old man who did not respond to treatment with meglumine antimoniate and was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day) for 5 days with improvement in the symptoms and 50% reduction of splenomegaly.\n\n\nHuman visceral leishmaniasis serological survey, laboratory findings and epidemiologic characteristics of the study population in Teodoro Sampaio\nBetween January and December 2018, 159 individuals living in Teodoro Sampaio were enrolled in the human visceral serological survey, and 2 of 159 (1.3%) resulted positive; 4 of 159 (2.5%) resulted indeterminate and 153/159 (96.2%) resulted negative. Hematologic abnormalities are among the most common manifestations in patients infected with VL in whom pancytopenia may occur (Table 2). From 159 individuals analyzed, mild anemia occurred in 5 of 159 (3.1%) individuals, leukopenia occurred in 3 of 159 (1.9%), and thrombocytopenia occurred in 4 of 159 (2.5%). The mean values\u00b1SEM, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were as follows: red blood cells, 4.81\u00b10.03 million/ cells/mcL (95% CI, 4.50\u20134.62); hemoglobin (g/dL), 13.80\u00b10.10 (95% CI, 13.59\u201314.00); hematocrit (%), 40.33\u00b10.27 (95% CI, 39.78\u201340.88); mean corpuscular volume (fL), 88.49\u00b10.33 (95% CI, 87.83\u201389.15); mean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg), 31.50\u00b11.25 (95% CI, 29.02\u201333.99); mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (g/dL), 34.20\u00b10.06 (95% CI, 34.07\u201334.34); platelets (\u00d7103/mcL), 266.359\u00b14.740 (95% CI, 256.997\u2013275.720). When the main changes in white blood cells were analyzed in the whole population, 17 of 159 (10.7%) showed mild leucopenia, 13 of 159 (8.1%) had mild leukocytosis, 25 of 159 (15.7.2%) had neutropenia, 41 of 159 (25.8%) had eosinophilia, 18 of 159 (11.3%) had lymphocytosis, and 11 of 159 (6.9%) had monocytosis. Mild thrombocytopenia was present in 9 of 159 (5.6%) individuals.\nIn relation to the epidemiological characteristics of the study population, the mean age was 43.50\u00b116.83 years (95% CI, 40.87\u201346.14; range, 18\u201389 years). The mean residence time in the city was 23.86\u00b115.27 years (95% CI, 21.46\u201326.25; range, 1\u201368 years). There were a greater number of women 115 of 158 (72.3%) than men because there are more women in the area where the research was carried. The age-related distribution was as follows: >18\u201320 years, 21(13.2%); 21\u201340 years, 52 (32.7%); 41\u201360 years, 55 (34.6%); and 61\u201380 years, 31 (19.5%).",
    "Discussion": "In 2005, HVL reached the municipalities in RNHA11 mesoregion, western S\u00e3o Paulo, and in 2010 the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema, a poor and asymmetric region. In Teodoro Sampaio, considered the capital of Pontal of Paranapanema, Lu. longipalpis and CVL were found in 2010 and HVL in 2018. In 2018, 19 of 45 (42.2%) municipalities in RNHA11 recorded cases. A complex array of socioeconomic and environmental factors may be fueling the epidemic and sustaining endemic transmission of VL in this region (Fig 7).\nCredit for the image\u2019s creation: Fernanda Lussari.\nThe first Lu. longipalpis outbreak was found in the microregion of Dracena in 2003 [19]. One year later, vectors were found in Tupi Paulista and other adjacent municipalities, which suggested the existence of a possible route of dispersion by irradiation or by contiguity. However, Lu. longipalpis was registered in the region far from the epicenter, suggesting dispersion by jumps and toward the municipalities of the south, and HVL cases reached the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema in 2010 (Fig 4A and 4B). An extensive highway network (2382 km), linking endemic regions to small- and middle-sized cities that may function as potential routes of dispersion of vectors and infected dogs was demonstrated in RNHA11 mesoregion. We suggest that the main axis adding to VL dispersion is the Euclides Figueiredo highway (SP562). Starting in Ilha Solteira outside RNHA11, the highway goes down toward the cities of Andradina and Dracena and toward the municipalities of Pontal of Paranapanema, crossing Teodoro Sampaio at the border of Paran\u00e1 state. Nevertheless, dissemination may also occur in lower rates by a secondary axis, SPV031 and SPV035, starting near Brasil\u00e2ndia, an endemic region in MS, and following the Paran\u00e1 River through small-sized cities and ending in Teodoro Sampaio must also be considered. All the municipalities crossed by these highways became endemic areas of VL (Fig 4A). The potential role of highways in the spread of VL in the southeastern and southern states of Brazil has been pinpointed in recent years [5,6]. However, a new route has been described and has gained great importance. Connecting Foz do Igua\u00e7u in the west, on the Brazilian side of the triple border and considered endemic for VL, to the port of Paranagu\u00e1 in the extreme east, a large number of trucks carrying grain, fertilizers, fuel, and goods, circulate daily on BR 277, the most important highway in Paran\u00e1 state. It was suggested that following BR-277 and transects, coming from Argentina and Paraguay, seropositive dogs and Lu. longipalpis vector spread to the neighboring cities, becoming a region endemic to VL. Furthermore, potentially it is likely an important route of dispersion of infected dogs, vectors, and parasites to other regions of Paran\u00e1 state [20,21].\nIn the western region, the proliferation of vectors could be aggravated by the extensive watershed flowing into the Paran\u00e1 and Paranapanema Rivers, supporting hydroelectric dams, bridges and artificial lakes [22\u201326]. Porto Primavera dam in Paran\u00e1 River has an artificial lake with a flooded area of 2.250 km2 and divides the municipalities of RNHA11mesoregion and MS. Dividing S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 state, the Paranapanema River flows on the border of ten municipalities with increasing rates of VL to the VL-free areas of Paran\u00e1 state. Artificial lakes modify the climate of their surrounding areas as well as the environment within which the lake interacts [22\u201326]. In Presidente Epitacio, a city bordering the lake of Primavera dam, higher yearly temperatures rates of 23.93\u00b13.06\u00b0C (95% CI 22.54\u201325.32) were found compared with 22\u00b0C in municipalities far from the lakes [23]. The influence of artificial lakes of hydroelectric dams in Paranapanema River on the ecological aspects of the sand fly fauna in 3 different settings of an endemic area of CL in Paran\u00e1 state was investigated. A wide dispersion of sand flies involved in the transmission of leishmaniasis was found in all the settings [22]. In Panorama, a city located on the border of the lake of the Paran\u00e1 River, also an endemic area for VL, the high abundance of Lu. longipalpis had a significant correlation with temperature and humidity [27]. A relationship with climate and environmental factors with increased incidence rates of VL and annual precipitation, humidity, enhanced vegetation index, and night temperature values were found in the State of Tocantins, located in the northern region of Brazil [28].\nIn Teodoro Sampaio, although an entomological survey started in 2000, Lu. longipalpis sand flies were found only in 2010. It is well known that other phlebotomines, such as Lu. migonei, may be permissive vectors of VL in areas where Lu. longipalpis has not been recorded, but human or canine cases do occur [29\u201331]. According to the SUCEN database, in the period from 2000 to 2010, Lu. cruzi a VL vector found in Central-West of Brazil [32], and Lu. migonei were not identified in Teodoro Sampaio urban area. Lu. migonei was found in the wild forest of the Devil\u2019s Hill in research carried out for an LT investigation in 1994, 1995, and 1996.\nAlthough a direct association between HDI and the presence of VL in municipalities of RNHA11 mesoregion was not found, linear regression showed a tendency of a lower number of infected individuals in municipalities with higher HDI. It is well known that poverty induces health care inequalities, poor housing conditions, lower income, less education, or lower occupational skill levels, and the population tend to be less healthy than those who experience higher levels of social conditions in other areas [16,32,33]. Supporting the data, demographic, environmental, and behavioral characteristics of inhabitants of rural settlements, a vulnerable population, have been determined. In Teodoro Sampaio, only 7.1% had a high school education, 11.9% lacked elementary instruction, and 77.3% had completed primary school. The income varied from less than 100 US$ (91.6%) to about 170 US$ (8.4%) per month. Similar rates were found in a neighboring rural settlement in Mirante of Paranapanema [34,35]. Globally and countrywide, VL is considered a neglected disease that affects the poorest of the poor [17,33,34].\nIn Teodoro Sampaio, on a local scale, the periphery of sector 1 had the higher number of infected dogs, demonstrated by critical point hotspots. The first human case of VL in the city was diagnosed in this sector. From 2010 to 2018, 298 (7.9%) dogs were found to be positive for CVL and 110 (36.9%) were euthanized. They were first found in sectors 1, 2, and 3 on the periphery, and in subsequent years, the hot spots spread to all urban areas. In the city, low levels of infected dogs were euthanized (36.9%). Similar to other cities of Pontal of Paranapanema, Teodoro Sampaio is surrounded by a high number of rural settlements [35,36]. Throughout the region, it is anecdotal that owners of dogs infected with VL hide their animals in these settings and may be disseminating the disease to rural areas. Although controversial, euthanasia is one of the most important actions supported by Brazilian Visceral Leishmaniasis Surveillance and Control Program in reducing the prevalence of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infection countrywide [37]. It has been shown that human epidemics of VL are usually preceded by or concomitant with CVL [10]. However, in Teodoro Sampaio, a diagnosis lag of 8 years between finding vectors, CVL, and HVL was found. Up to December 2020, only one individual had been registered. One possible explanation is that the city is located in the neighborhood of the Devil\u2019s Hill State Park, an endemic region for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) vectors [38,39], and the municipality is considered endemic for CL. There is some evidence that vectors have been present in the urban area for many years and a superposition CL/VL is occurring and a cross-reaction may be on course, protecting people from VL infection [40]. Supporting these findings, a VL serological survey of 159 individuals living in the urban area was carried out and only 2 (1.26%) individuals were positive by ELISA, with a probable false positive and/or cross-reaction. In addition, the mean residence times in the city was 23.86\u00b115.27 years, increasing the possibility of these individuals being immunized against CL. Although VL-infected individuals do not have hallmark signs and symptoms, severe pancytopenia (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia) and increased levels of hepatic enzymes may be considered in the differential diagnosis in VL endemic areas [41]. In the population analyzed in this study, no laboratory findings symptomatic of chronic VL were found.\nShedding new light on the complex interactions occurring within the spread of VL in the western region and identifying the existence of spatial clusters of municipalities with increased vulnerability, Moran\u2019s I and LISA significance maps were created. Moran\u2019s I map identified a cluster of 13 municipalities with significant autocorrelation with CVL, and 5 municipalities were classified as high/high: Dracena, Ouro Verde, Tupi Paulista, Junqueir\u00f3polis, and Presidente Venceslau. Overall, 4 of these municipalities are considered the epicenter of the disease in which HVL was found in Dracena and Ouro Verde in 2005; Tupi Paulista in 2006, and Junqueir\u00f3polis in 2007 (Fig 4B). Furthermore, Dracena has a higher number of cases of HVL, varying from 58 to 176 infected individuals, followed by Ouro Verde, Tupi Paulista, and Junqueir\u00f3polis, varying from 17 to 57 infected individuals (Fig 4A). After all these years, despite the efforts made by the public authorities, Dracena remains the main focus of VL in western S\u00e3o Paulo. Taken together, these areas should be considered the target of local public policies and receive priority in surveillance actions within the scope of VL. As far as we know, this is the first effort to identify priority areas for VL in S\u00e3o Paulo State using Moran\u2019s I and LISA spatial analysis. In Brazil and worldwide, these tools have been used to identify vulnerable areas of parasitic, vector-borne neglected tropical diseases [14\u201316,42]. Moran\u2019s I and LISA techniques identified 27 priority areas for surveillance and control of VL in Belo Horizonte, an endemic area of Minas Geraes state [13]. In northeast municipalities, a VL Brazilian endemic region, spatial and space-time clusters of VL were identified in sert\u00e3o and middle-north sub-regions, overlapping with high social vulnerability areas [14]. In Morocco, significant LISA clustering maps of human leishmaniasis have been identified in different provinces [42].\nDifferent shortcomings should be considered in this study. The mean age of the population screened for VL was 43.50 years, and 72.33% were women. It is well known that VL affects mainly children and old people [40]. Thus, the population analyzed is not well representative of the disease. Municipal surveillance control programs of CVL were discontinued and there were difficulties in obtaining current records with a more accurate surveillance and response system to apply geospatial methods.",
    "Conclusion": "In RNHA11 mesoregion, in a regional scale VL is spreading with a progressive extension, from the north, the epicenter, to the south, from endemic to non-endemic areas. A cluster of municipalities in the epicenter showed a significant autocorrelation for CVL and should receive priority in surveillance actions within the scope of VL. Socioeconomic and environmental factors may be fueling the epidemic and sustaining the endemic transmission of the disease (Fig 7). These findings further highlight the asymmetry of the western region compared with other regions of S\u00e3o Paulo state and add new knowledge on the spread of VL, contributing to the study of a neglected disease in a region of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."
