Dengue is common worldwide and more effective counter-measures are needed. The only DENV vaccine to have achieved licensure is more effective in DENV-immune individuals and is contra-indicated in DENV-na√Øve individuals due to safety concerns. Self-reports of prior dengue illness have been proposed to serve as a proxy for DENV exposure, due to limited resources for serological testing in many DENV-endemic locales. Here, we compare the concordance of self-reported DENV infection histories relative to serological confirmation of prior DENV exposure and report very low sensitivity and limited specificity, perhaps placing as many as one in seven individuals reporting a history of prior dengue illness at risk for an adverse outcome with receipt of Dengvaxia. We propose that reported histories of dengue illness are not sufficiently accurate to replace serological testing prior to vaccination.
