Our study was to estimate the spatial distribution of Culex mosquitoes in Hanoi, which is one of the most densely populated cities in Vietnam. Our findings may provide better insight into understanding the spatial distribution of Culex mosquitoes and its associated environmental risk factors. Such information can assist local clinicians and public health policymakers to identify the potential areas of risk for JE virus.
