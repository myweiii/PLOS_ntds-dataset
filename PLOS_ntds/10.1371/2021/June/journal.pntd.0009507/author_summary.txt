Since the beginning of Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, five years ago, we still donâ€™t understand the genetic factors associated with the small number of babies born with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Here, we focused on the host genetic susceptibility by studying the whole-exome of the CZS affected (n = 29) and healthy (n = 11) neonates, both born to ZIKV infected women from Brazil. We applied two strategies: 1) Determine whether cases individuals have pathogenic or harmful variants that explain the CZS outcomes (i.e. microcephaly) independently of ZIKV infection or not, 2) Exploring the common and rare variants association with CZS. We found that common and rare variants in genes like DISP3 and IL12RB2 could explain some level of the susceptibility to CZS. Moreover, by considering these and other candidate genes, we observed an over-representation of Gene Ontology terms related to neurological system, metabolism and microtubule-cytoskeleton organization.
