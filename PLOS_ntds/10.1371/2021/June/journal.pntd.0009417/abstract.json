    "Abstract": "Yellow fever (YF), an arboviral disease, affects an estimated 200,000 people and causes 30,000 deaths per year and recently has caused major epidemics in Africa and South America. Timely and accurate diagnosis of YF is critical for managing outbreaks and implementing vaccination campaigns. A YF immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture (MAC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, the YF MAC-HD, was successfully introduced starting in 2018 to laboratories in Africa and South America. The YF MAC-HD kit can be performed in 3.5 hours, test up to 24 samples, and includes all reagents necessary to perform the test, except for water used to dilute wash buffer. In 2018 and 2019, a total of 56 laboratory personnel from 39 countries in Africa and South America were trained to use the kit during workshops, followed by take-home YF IgM proficiency testing (PT) exercises. Participants received either a 10- or 20-sample YF PT panel and performed testing using the YF MAC-HD kit. All countries obtained 90% or higher correct results. These results verified the technical viability and transferability of YF MAC-HD kit use for laboratories in YF-endemic countries."
