There is no approved vaccine for Zika virus (ZIKV) disease. Many research efforts are ongoing, e.g., inactivated, DNA, or viral vector vaccines. However, due to the complexity of the pathogenesis and immunology of ZIKV, new ideas about vaccine development still need to be considered. Rabies virus (RABV) vectored vaccines have been developed for many viruses, such as against Lassa virus, canine distemper virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filovirus, based on the advantages of the vector. In this study, three recombinant RABVs expressing ZIKV prM-E, named ZI-D, ZI-E and ZI-F, are described. Since ZI-D and ZI-E could express foreign proteins successfully, the author evaluated the immunogenicity of ZI-D and ZI-E mixed with a complex adjuvant of ISA 201 VG and poly(I:C) in BALB/c mice. The study demonstrates that ZI-E induced mice to produce NAbs against both RABV and ZIKV and elicited specific cellular immune responses. The authors believe that the ZI-E vaccine based on the RABV vector has the potential to prevent ZIKV and RABV infections. It has the potential to be used in ZIKV-RABV binary vaccines in areas where both ZIKV and RABV are threats.
