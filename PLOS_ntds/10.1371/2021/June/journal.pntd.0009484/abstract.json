    "Abstract": "The global spread of Zika virus (ZIKV), which caused a pandemic associated with Congenital Zika Syndrome and neuropathology in newborns and adults, prompted the pursuit of a safe and effective vaccine. Here, three kinds of recombinant rabies virus (RABV) encoding the prM-E protein of ZIKV were constructed: ZI-D (prM-E), ZI-E (transmembrane domain (TM) of prM-E replaced with RABV G) and ZI-F (signal peptide and TM domain of prM-E replaced with the region of RABV G). When the TM of prM-E was replaced with the region of RABV G (termed ZI-E), it promoted ZIKV E protein localization on the cell membrane and assembly on recombinant viruses. In addition, the change in the signal peptide with RABV G (termed ZI-F) was not conducive to foreign protein expression. The immunogenicity of recombinant viruses mixed with a complex adjuvant of ISA 201 VG and poly(I:C) was tested in BALB/c mice. After immunization with ZI-E, the anti-ZIKV IgG antibody lasted for at least 10 weeks. The titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against ZIKV and RABV at week 6 were all greater than the protective titers. Moreover, ZI-E stimulated the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes and promoted the secretion of cytokines. It also promoted the production of central memory T cells (TCMs) among CD4+/CD8+ T cells and stimulated B cell activation and maturation. These results indicate that ZI-E could induce ZIKV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, which have the potential to be developed into a promising vaccine for protection against both ZIKV and RABV infections."
