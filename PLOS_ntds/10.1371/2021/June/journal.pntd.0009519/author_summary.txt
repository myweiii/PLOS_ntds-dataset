Fasciola infection is endemic in the highlands of Peru. Children in the highlands are particularly affected. The effect of chronic fascioliasis on childrenâ€™s long-term health and development, particularly the impact on nutrition, is not well defined. In this large epidemiologic study, we evaluated the association of chronic Fasciola infection with chronic malnutrition. Children with chronic Fasciola, defined as finding Fasciola eggs in stool, had a lower height for age Z score than those without Fasciola. A lower poverty score, fewer years of education of parents, and higher house elevation were also associated with stunted growth.
