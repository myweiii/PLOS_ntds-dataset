Each year, diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes cause substantial deaths and disability across the world. We performed a systematic literature review of Mayaro virus (MAYV) and estimated key epidemiological parameters that can be used to improve future outbreak response. We estimated the generation time and basic reproduction number for a historical outbreak. Our results suggest that the force-of-infection of MAYV in endemic settings is low. We did not find evidence of substantial urban transmission of MAYV. Nevertheless, similarities between MAYV and yellow fever virus epidemiology suggest that MAYV could emerge in urban areas. Local transmission of MAYV has never been reported outside of Central and South America. Our results highlight the need to continue monitoring emerging arboviruses in the Americas.
