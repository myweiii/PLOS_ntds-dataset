We have developed an automated platform for recording the motility of mosquito larvae and applied it to larvae of a mosquito vector of malaria and a mosquito vector of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and other human diseases. The platform facilitates high-throughput, chemical screening for new compounds to control mosquito larvae and also detects differences in response in larval progeny from pryethroid-resistant adult mosquitoes. Pyrethroid-impregnated bednets have helped to halve the deaths from malaria in recent years but pyrethroid resistance is an important threat to this progress. Our approach assays insecticide actions faster than the current WHO standard test and we show that it can be adapted for use with a smartphone, which offers the prospect of a future field assay to monitor developing resistance associated with behavioural response with the added benefit of precise satellite-based location.
