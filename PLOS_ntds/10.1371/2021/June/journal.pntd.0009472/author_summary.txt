Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are one of the main cell types involved in liver fibrosis induced by schistosomes. Our previous studies have shown that recombinant P40 protein from Schistosoma japonicum (rSjP40) can inhibit HSC activation in vitro. In this study, we found that rSjP40 up-regulates expression of let-7b in HSCs. Let-7b is a member of the let-7 microRNA family and plays an inhibitory role in a variety of diseases and inflammatory conditions. Let-7b inhibits collagen I expression by directly targeting the 3â€™UTR region of the collagen I gene. Furthermore, we discovered that let-7b inhibitor partially restores the loss of collagen I expression caused by rSjP40. Our research clarifies the role of let-7b in the inhibition of HSC activation by rSjP40 and will provide new insights and ideas for the inhibition of HSC activation and treatment of liver fibrosis.
