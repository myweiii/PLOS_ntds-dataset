In North America, EEEV causes the most severe mosquito-borne disease in humans highlighted by fatal encephalitis and permeant debilitating neurological sequelae in survivors. The first confirmed human cases were reported more than 80 years ago and since then multiple sporadic outbreaks have occurred including one of the largest in 2019. Unfortunately, most human infections are diagnosed at the on-set of severe neurological symptoms and consequently a detailed disease course in humans is lacking. This gap in knowledge is a significant obstacle in the development of appropriate animal models to evaluate countermeasures. Here, we performed a cutting-edge study by utilizing a new telemetry technology to understand the course of EEEV infection in a susceptible macaque model by measuring multiple physiological parameters relevant to human disease. Our study demonstrates that the infection rapidly produces considerable alterations in many critical parameters including the electrical activity of the heart and the brain leading to severe disease. The study also highlights the extraordinary potential of new telemetry technology to develop the next generation of animal models to comprehensively investigate pathogenesis as well as evaluate countermeasures to treat and/or prevent EEEV disease.
