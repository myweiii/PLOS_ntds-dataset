Gambian sleeping sickness (Gambian human African trypanosomiasis, gHAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by tsetse flies. Currently, Bonon is the focus which provides most cases of gHAT in Côte d’Ivoire. Screening and treatment of human cases has reduced the incidence of gHAT from 262 cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 to 24 cases during 2010–2015. We carried out a trial to assess whether Tiny Targets, insecticide-treated targets that attract and kill tsetse, could control Glossina palpalis palpalis, the most important vector of gHAT in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2015, we mapped human settlements, livestock, tracks, rivers and relict forest in Bonon and identified sites where humans may be bitten by tsetse. Monoconical (“Vavoua”) traps were deployed at these sites to provide an estimate of the abundance of tsetse. Between 2016 and 2018, ~2,000 Tiny Targets were deployed annually across Bonon and the impact of Tiny Targets was evaluated by changes in the numbers of tsetse caught by a network of 30 monitoring traps operated quarterly. In 2015, before deployment of Tiny Targets, the mean daily catch from the 30 monitoring traps was 6.4 tsetse/trap/day. Following deployment of targets, catches declined to <0.3 tsetse/trap/day representing a >95% reduction in tsetse abundance. Between February 2016 and December 2018, no recent (Stage 1) cases of gHAT have been reported in Bonon. Our results demonstrate that Tiny Targets can contribute to the elimination of gHAT through tsetse control. Tiny Targets have been adopted as an important tool in Côte d’Ivoire’s national strategy to eliminate gHAT.
