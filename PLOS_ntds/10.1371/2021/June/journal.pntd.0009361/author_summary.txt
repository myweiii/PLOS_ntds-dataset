Helminths, mainly because of their immune regulatory effects, are able to impact the response induced by vaccines. In the context of clinical trial designs that measure accrual of natural infections during follow up or outcome of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), their effect on vaccine efficacy can be measured. Indeed, most of such clinical trials on malaria vaccine candidates conducted in Africa, especially where the prevalence of helminths is high, have shown a certain limit in their efficacy and immunogenicity, as compared to results observed in European and U.S volunteers. The present analysis assessed the effect of helminths on GMZ2, a malaria vaccine candidate. We found a high level of anti-GMZ2 antibodies among volunteers not infected with helminths and protected against CHMI, indicating efficacy of the candidate vaccine in this population. We found a species-dependent effect of helminths on the level of post-immunization GMZ2-specific IgG concentration, and an association of helminths with an early onset of malaria in CHMI. Our findings reveal that helminths are associated with immunogenicity and may decrease the protective effect of antibodies induced by vaccination. Helminth infection status shall be determined when measuring the immunogenicity and efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates in helminth endemic countries.
