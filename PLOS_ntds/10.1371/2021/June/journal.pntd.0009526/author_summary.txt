Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense are protozoan parasites that cause deadly diseases in humans. The parasites are transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse flies and can penetrate the brain, causing severe inflammation, accompanied by motor disability, neurological disorders and death. It is important to understand how and which parasite factors contribute to infection in order to improve treatment alternatives. In their genome, these parasites have genes called ISPs similar to genes of bacteria, which encode proteins that inhibit serine peptidases of the trypsin family. Here, we studied the role of ISP2 in T. b. rhodesiense by analyzing parasite knock-out mutants for isp2 in experimental infections in mice. We found that ISP2 contributes to blood parasitemia, to the clinical signs of motor disability, and to reduce the levels of the inflammatory response of the host, therefore, contributing to infection.
