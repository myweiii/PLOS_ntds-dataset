Every year about 100 million symptomatic dengue cases occur with the highest-burden reported in Southeast Asia followed by Latin America. The burden is increasing and considered driven by population densities, human mobility, vector proliferation, and climate variability. Evaluation of the impact of human mobility on dengue transmission is methodologically challenging, but an important aspect in public health research.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic reductions in human mobility due to social distancing measures. These population-level interventions in most countries have changed the exposure patterns to Aedes vectors and the spread of the dengue virus. The mobility restrictions due to the COVID-19 response in Sri Lanka provided a natural experiment to understand the importance of human mobility on dengue in an endemic setting.
Using interrupted time series design, we evaluated the impact of mobility restriction on dengue transmission in all 25 administrative districts, climate zones, and age groups in Sri Lanka. The results of this empirical study provided evidence of an overall statistically significant reduction of dengue during the period of mobility restriction in the country, which appears not to be related to changes in health seeking behaviour. Our study provides a methodological framework to quantify the impact of lockdown interventions on dengue transmission and its heterogeneous nature at different geographical, climatic, and socio-demographic levels within and between countries.
