The ups and downs of dengue cases require the Outdoor Residual Spraying (ORS) technique as an alternative method to control dengue in Malaysia. However, the introduction of ORS depends on stakeholders’ acceptance. Here, the purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict attitude to ORS and the role of religiosity as a moderator. The results indicate positive responses for implementing the ORS as a suitable technique to control dengue in Malaysia. Perceived benefit emerged as the most significant direct predictor of attitude towards the ORS (β = 0.618, p<0.001), which they viewed this technique as less risky. Trust in key players had a significant positive relationship with attitudes towards the ORS that makes this factor the second most important direct predictor (β = 0.151, p<0.001). Interestingly, the religiosity factor significantly moderated the relationship between perceived benefit and risk with attitudes towards the ORS. This study also showed the role played by both perceived benefit and risk as mediating factors.
