Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, causing abortion, retained placenta, infertility and reduced milk production in livestock and wildlife. In humans it leads to a febrile-like illness with headaches, joint pains, weight loss and arthritis. Approximately 500,000 people are diagnosed with brucellosis each year, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Risk factors for transmission are handling aborted material, residing with livestock and consuming raw milk and blood. Due to the cultural attachment that agro-pastoralists have with their livestock, they are most affected and it is a challenging disease to control. We conducted a study with agro-pastoralists in three villages, neighboring wildlife conservation areas, in south-central Tanzania. The majority of those interviewed did not know about brucellosis, its symptoms and risk factors for people and livestock. Symptoms associated with brucellosis infection in animals are recognized but are attributed to the disease trypanosomiasis and to supernatural reasons instead. Age, education and gender, as well as religious orientation and ethnicity were factors associated with knowledge and following risky practices. Behavior like consuming raw milk and blood, handling aborted material and co-habiting with livestock are considered an important part of life. We therefore suggest to policy makers, researchers and public health workers to engage with local communities and respond to their questions and concerns so that culturally and contextually relevant solutions are developed to control this disease.
