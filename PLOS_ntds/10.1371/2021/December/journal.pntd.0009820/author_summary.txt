Tsetse flies are the major vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis. To support control efforts, there is need to understand the location of these vectors in terms of distribution and abundance. Due to limited resources and unsatisfactory technology, delimiting the extent and magnitude of tsetse coverage remains a challenge. In a bid to overcome these limitations, this study attempted to explore modelling skills that can be applied to inform decision makers about the status of tsetse abundance using limited historical tsetse data and a set of remote-sensed environmental variables. Two regression models; standard Poisson and Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) were fitted and evaluated for superiority. The results indicated the level of responsiveness of each covariate in influencing the vector across the study area. Tsetse abundance was found to be largest at low elevations in areas of high vegetative activity, in game parks, forests and permanently flooded shrubs during the dry season. This approach can be adopted to enable mapping of any tsetse species to provide better decision support towards designing and implementing targeted tsetse and tsetse-transmitted African trypanosomiasis control strategies amidst entomological data shortages due to limited resources and absence of expertise.
