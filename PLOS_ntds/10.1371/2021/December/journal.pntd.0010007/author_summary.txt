Glanders is a highly contagious and life-threatening disease caused by Burkholderia mallei, a Tier 1 select agent, with no available vaccine. The disease is endemic in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America with sporadic outbreaks and mainly occurs in horses, donkeys and mules, although it has also been reported in camels, tigers, lions, and even humans. As the bacterium is not easily isolated from clinical specimens and correct identification based on clinical signs is difficult, it is thus important to develop serological tests which can quickly diagnose B. mallei infection. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody against B. mallei lipopolysaccharide and used it to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for the serodiagnosis of B. mallei infection. The developed cELISA was optimized and evaluated using glanders-free and glanders-positive horses, donkeys and mice from Hong Kong and the Middle East, and was shown to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of glanders in different animals. A simple and inexpensive test to allow for the early detection and diagnosis of suspected clinical cases as well as the screening of apparently asymptomatic animals will be helpful in controlling the spread and elimination of the disease.
