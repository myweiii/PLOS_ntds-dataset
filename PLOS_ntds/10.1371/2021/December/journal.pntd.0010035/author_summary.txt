Leprosy and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that usually affect poor populations in the same geographical areas. Both affect the skin and can cause physical disability and disfigurement resulting in discrimination. Both diseases occur at hyperendemic levels in several regions of Brazil. The integration of skin NTDs control programs may be a way to improve timely detection and treatment. However, little is known about the occurrence of leprosy and CL in the same individuals, and what are the characteristics of these patients. For the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, we identified 414 patients diagnosed with leprosy and CL between 2008 and 2017, spatially concentrated mainly in the North and Northeast mesoregions. The individual probability of developing both diseases increased from 0.2% to 1.0% within seven years. Male sex, being in the 40â€“55 years age group, and low levels of schooling were the risk factors positively associated with the time interval between the diagnosis of both diseases. These findings may inform the implementation of integrated leprosy and CL control policies focused on timely diagnosis. A sustainable integration requires continuous measures, such as the follow-up of patients, active case detection, training of health professionals, besides financial and political support.
