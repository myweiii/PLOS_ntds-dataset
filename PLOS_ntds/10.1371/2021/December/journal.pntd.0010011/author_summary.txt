Snakebite is a major public health problem associated with considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute kidney injury is one of the major systemic complications of snakebites. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood and the diagnosis is often delayed due to lack of sensitive biomarkers. We aimed to investigate the value of selected biomarkers in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury following hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale spp.) envenoming. In a group of 52 patients with confirmed hump-nosed pit viper envenoming acute kidney injury was found to be common and was associated with severe disease in some. Levels of five novel biomarkers, the functional marker serum Cystatin C and the damage markers urinary NGAL, cystatin C, Î²2-microglobulin and clusterin, were elevated in patients who developed moderate/ severe acute kidney injury. Serum Cystatin C performed better than serum creatinine in early prediction of moderate/severe acute kidney injury. Serum Cystatin C appears to be a promising novel biomarker in diagnosing acute kidney injury in the setting of hump-nosed pit viper envenoming.
