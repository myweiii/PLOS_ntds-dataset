Black faver, also known as visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is caused by pathogens of Leishmania species, spread by the bites of infected sand flies. This disease has been successfully controlled in China, except for some areas in the western region, such as Xinjiang. However, the knowledge on Leishmania in these areas remains a few important gaps. Particularly, what is the animal reservoir for desert type zoonotic VL (DT-ZVL), as sand flies get infected in areas free of patients or infected dogs? To address this question, an eleven-year survey (2004â€“2014) in Xinjiang for Leishmania species was carried out. We found that VLs in Xinjiang are contributed to Leishmania donovani complex, and Tarim hares is likely the reservoir animal for DT-ZVL.
