Mexico is considered an endemic country for DENV as the number of cases each year is high. With the arrival of the CHIKV and ZIKV, this number decreased considerably. This led us to suspect that this decrease was not coincidental and could be attributed to two factors: the lack of expertise on the part of health teams to identify the clinical etiological agent and/or other complex ecological factors. Therefore, we decided to reanalyze 1038 suspected cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika samples using a test that could identify any of the three viruses in a single reaction. We discovered that there was indeed an underestimation of cases, mostly of chikungunya and Zika but, contrary to what we imagined, a lower degree of dengue. We were also able to detect cases of coinfection, which had never been reported in Mexico. Thus, the present study lays the foundations for a better preparation for the arrival of other arboviruses, showing the need for the development and implementation of multiplex diagnostic techniques, in addition to providing more precise epidemiological information on this historical moment of co-circulation of these three arboviruses in our country.
