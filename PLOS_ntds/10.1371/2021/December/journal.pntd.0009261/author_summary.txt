While the Early Warning and Response System (EWARS) for dengue and other vector-borne diseases has significantly advanced in methodologies and applications in more recent time, evidence from the field on the implications of EWARS in the context of vector control and response is still rare. Assessing the effectiveness (and cost) of EWARS in reducing or mitigating disease outbreaks entails complex study designs, including randomized controlled trials. This study employs a pragmatic validation design; comparing groups of outbreak and non-outbreak districts from the Mexican national vector control and response program for dengue, all districts with implemented EWARS and generated alerts. The study authors have illustrated and discussed important operational implications when failing or succeeding timely and adequate response to EWARS alerts, revealing that responding to EWARS alerts in time and space, during or beyond the routine vector control and response process can significantly reduce unnecessary outbreaks and hospitalizations.
