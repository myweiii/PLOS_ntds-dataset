Typhoid fever is a serious bloodstream infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. Estimating the burden of typhoid fever is complex due to the limitations, cost, and scalability of current diagnostic surveillance methods. The detection of specific antibody responses against the organism may be a more sustainable manner of measuring exposure and disease burden in endemic location. We measured antibody (IgG) in 937 serum samples (317 children and 620 adults) from across the Lao People`s Democratic Republic against a polysaccharide (Vi) and two experimental protein antigens, CdtB and HlyE, that may more appropriate markers of disease exposure. We measured the significance of the differences between antibody titers in adults and children and fitted models to assess the relationship between age and antibody titers. The median IgG titres against HylE and CdtB were significantly higher in children than adults. Conversely, the median IgG titres against Vi was significantly higher in adults than children. We identified a significant association between a peak in IgG titres against CdtB and HlyE in children aged under 5 years. These data are indicative of high level of typhoid fever exposure in children under 5 years of age in Lao PDR and we surmise that IgG titres against HylE and CdtB may be a superior measure of typhoid disease burden than IgG titres against Vi. Our approach is scalable and can be further validated to assess the burden of typhoid fever in countries where the disease may be endemic, and evidence is required for the introduction of typhoid vaccines.
