We gratefully acknowledge the populations of Bouaké’s health district neighborhoods (Dar-es-Salaam, Kennedy, N’Gattakro, and Petessou), especially householders and guardians of children, for their kind support and collaboration. We would also like to especially thank Isabella Athanassiou (Bonn, Germany) for language editing and Arsene K. Adou for generating the map.
