African Trypanosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease associated with rural areas in low resource settings. The socio-economic and health impact of the disease on humans and livestock is often found at the edge of tsetse-infested protected wildlife areas. Trypanosomiasis is reported around Akagera region of Rwanda at the border with Tanzania, where it is not well documented. This work was the first large-scale study to map Trypanosoma occurrence in cattle around the tsetseâ€“infested Akagera National Park. The study determined the genetic diversity and distribution of trypanosomes circulating in cattle blood by using microscopy, immunological rapid tests and molecular techniques. We found animal pathogenic trypanosomes (i.e. T. brucei brucei, T. congolense savannah, T. evansi and T. vivax) and the non-pathogenic T. theileri. We did not find human-infective T. b. rhodesiense causing sleeping sickness. This new knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of animal Trypanosomiasis and it will inform the setting of adequate and more focused control of the disease in the area. The findings are expected to promote the progressive reduction or the elimination of the Animal African Trypanosomiasis burden in the area and inform the process for validation of rhodesiense Human African Trypanosomiasis (rHAT) elimination.
