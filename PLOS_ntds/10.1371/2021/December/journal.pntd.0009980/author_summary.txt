Rabies is a deadly viral zoonotic disease responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. The disease is highly prevalent in developing countries including Thailand. The main reservoir hosts in these settings are dogs. Currently, there is a global effort to stop human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. To achieve this goal, scientifically driven policies must be rigorously implemented. In this study, we used data on rabies outbreaks in the high-prevalent years in Thailand together with other related factors to describe important characteristics of the outbreaks and to identify the main factors that contribute to the higher risk of the outbreaks across space and time. Surprisingly, we found that owned dogs were more affected than the stray ones and the peak of the outbreaks was identified in winter rather than summer. There are many spatial factors involved in the spread of animal rabies, for example, history of rabies epidemics in the areas. The current policy planning and implementation should be revised based on scientific evidence to prevent such repeated outbreaks.
