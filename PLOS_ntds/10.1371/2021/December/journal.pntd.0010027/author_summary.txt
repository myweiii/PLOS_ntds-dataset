The metacestode larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis grows infiltrative, like a malignant tumour, within the liver of the host thus causing the lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis. Previous work established that the metacestode senses signals of host hormones and cytokines by expressing surface receptors that share high homology with respective host receptors. However, little is known how these signals are transmitted from the parasite cell surface to the nucleus to alter gene expression. In this work, the authors present a module of several protein kinases that typically transmit cytokine signals from surface receptors to central regulators called mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The authors demonstrate that this module is active in parasite stem cells, which drive the development of metacestode larva. They also show that inhibitors directed against one component of the module, EmMPK3, affect maintenance and/or survival of stem cells in the metacestode and prevent the formation of metacestode larva from parasite cell cultures. This information facilitates molecular and cellular studies to unravel the complex signalling network that regulate Echinococcus stem cell proliferation in response to host signals. Furthermore, these data could open new ways of anti-parasitic chemotherapy by introducing EmMPK3 as a possible drug target.
