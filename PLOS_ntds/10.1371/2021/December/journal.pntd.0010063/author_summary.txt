Each year, millions of new cases of venereal and congenital syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) subsp. pallidum, are diagnosed worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Alongside endemic circulation of syphilis in low-income countries, disease resurgence in high-income nations has underscored the need for a vaccine. Due to prior technological limitations in culturing and sequencing the organism, the extent of the genetic diversity within modern strains of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum remains poorly understood, hampering development of a broadly protective vaccine. In this study, we obtained 196 near-complete T. pallidum genomes directly from clinical swabs from eight countries across six continents. Of these, 191 were identified as T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, including 90 Nichols clade genomes. Bayesian analysis revealed a high degree of variance in mutation rate among subclades. Interestingly, a Nichols subclade with a particularly high mutation rate harbors a non-synonymous mutation in a putative DNA repair helicase. Coupling sequencing data with protein structure prediction, we identified multiple novel amino acid variants in several proteins previously identified as potential vaccine candidates. Our data help inform current efforts to develop a broadly protective syphilis vaccine.
