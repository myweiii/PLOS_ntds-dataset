Significant efforts to control human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) since the 1990’s have drastically reduced the prevalence of the disease. Its elimination as a public health problem is being achieved. World Health Organization now targets the interruption of transmission for 2030. However, potential animal reservoirs of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T. b. gambiense), the main agent of HAT, may compromise this ambitious objective. It is the case in the Vavoua historical focus in Côte d’Ivoire where HAT cases were still diagnosed in the early 2010’s. During a study conducted in this area, we scrutinized the trypanosomes circulating in pigs and people sharing the same environment using serological, immunological, parasitological and molecular tools. No HAT cases were detected. We showed that T. brucei s.l. and T. congolense actively circulated in free-ranging pigs. Even if no tools were sensitive and specific enough to unambiguously identify T. b. gambiense directly from biological samples, six isolated strains from pigs positive for trypanosomes were amplified for TgsGP, the only currently accepted T. b. gambiense specific molecular marker. The apparent discrepancies between the presence of T. b. gambiense in pigs despite the absence of human cases is discussed. These results stress the need for an efficient “molecular toolbox” to easily detect and identify T. b. gambiense in any animal it may infect.
