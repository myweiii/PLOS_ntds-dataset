Culicoides are known to be vectors of several pathogens, including arboviruses and parasites. However, other investigations have demonstrated that Culicoides could be involved in the transmission of Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites. Our studies demonstrated the first detection of L. martiniquensis in Culicoides mahasarakhamense and Trypanosoma sp., which is closely related to avian Trypanosome in C. huffi from an endemic area of leishmaniasis in northern Thailand. The finding of this work suggested that Culicoides biting midges are suspected to be the potential vector of L. martiniquensis and Trypanosoma parasites in Thailand.
