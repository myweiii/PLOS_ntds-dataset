Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis in the world, and infections are underappreciated in regions of the world where it may be mistaken for malaria and other tropical illnesses. We performed a seroprevalence study of leptospirosis in healthy asymptomatic adults in Rwanda. Among 377 subjects, we found evidence of infection in 40.1% (151 / 377), which is higher than in neighboring countries such as Kenya (7 to 16%), Tanzania (10 to 15.8%) and Uganda (15%). Our data suggest that leptospirosis may be a common cause of febrile illness in Rwanda, but further studies are needed to differentiate active from asymptomatic.
