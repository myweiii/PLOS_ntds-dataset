In countries where dengue is prevalent, hospitals are often overwhelmed due to the high numbers of patient admissions during dengue epidemics. We studied 1064 children and adults hospitalized with acute dengue in Sri Lanka to determine the prevalence of severe disease outcomes to support the development of a system which can limit hospitalizations in the future. We found that only half of patients developed severe disease outcomes during hospitalization and only a small minority of patients developed life-threatening disease. For dengue-prevalent countries, developing systems to identify patients with acute dengue who can be managed without hospital admission should be a priority.
