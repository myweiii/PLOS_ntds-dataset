Chagas disease (ChD) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and continues to be a health problem despite the control of its transmission. ChD is a heterogeneous condition with a wide variation in its clinical course and prognosis. The majority (60%â€“70%) of infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life. Although some develop only conduction defects and mild segmental wall motion abnormalities, others develop severe symptoms of heart failure (HF), thromboembolic phenomena, and life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. HF is one of major causes of the death of patients with ChD. There is some evidence on effective drugs against the parasite in the chronic form of the disease capable of preventing long-term adverse outcomes, but it is still limited. However low-cost medications are able to reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of patients with HF. Because of the lack of tertiary care facilities outside urban centers, an automatic diagnostic tool based on the ECG, which is a relatively simple exam without requiring human interpretation, would improve the capacity to recognize HF. Recently, digital signals of the electrocardiogram were recognized by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and associated with an excellent accuracy for HF in the general population. Our results demonstrate that AI-ECG could ensure a rapid recognition of HF in patients who require a referral to a cardiologist and the use of disease-modifying drugs. AI can be used as a powerful public heath tool, it can transform the lives of 6 million patients with ChD worldwide, and it may well have a formidable impact on patient management and prognosis.
