Our T cell receptor repertoires are unique to each individual and encode the history of our antigenic exposures. Because of this property, they can act as markers of infection. Due to the diversity of T cell receptors, analyzing an individualâ€™s repertoire requires advanced sequencing and machine learning methods. However, there are also subsets of T cells that express conserved T cell receptors shared among genetically unrelated individuals. One such subset, germline-encoded, mycolyl lipid-reactive (GEM) T cells, recognizes mycobacterial cell wall lipids. To determine if we could measure expression of these T cells with a simple assay, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay that was validated on plasmids and T cell lines. We then determined whether we could detect the GEM T cell receptor sequence in individuals with or without exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium leprae. We found that we could detect the GEM T cell receptor in the blood or skin of most individuals, though expression levels did not distinguish between uninfected or infected states. These data show that simple assays to measure mycobacteria-specific T cell receptor sequences are feasible and further advancements focusing on more disease-specific T cell receptors may allow for development of field-friendly diagnostics.
