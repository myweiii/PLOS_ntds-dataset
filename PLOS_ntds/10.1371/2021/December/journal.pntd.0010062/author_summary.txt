In 2013, schistosomiasis reached Southern Europe. Since then, endemic infections were recurrently identified clearly indicating that the parasite has settled and established locally. Using two molecular markers, we had previously demonstrated that the parasite was a hybrid between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, two species known to infect humans and livestock, respectively. Nevertheless, this method has very low resolution and is not informative for determining the origins and the mechanisms of hybridization events, e.g. if the hybrid had been recently generated in Corsica or long before itâ€™s introduction. The genome-wide sequencing approach, used in this study, allowed us to reveal genomic admixture suggesting that these hybrids are the result of ancient crossing events between S. haematobium and S. bovis, with subsequent backcrossing with S. haematobium. This introgression has prevented compatibility with P. metidjensis snail vectors, which are specific to S. bovis. Additionally, whether in Africa or in Europe, a clear discrepancy exists between the egg shape usually used for species identification and the genomic composition of schistosomes. Therefore, egg shape cannot be used as a good indicator for hybrid detection. Knowing the phenotypic traits and the genetic features of such hybrids may have important implications in terms of diagnostics and disease management either through vector control strategies or treatment of patients.
