Noma is a devastating and often fatal condition that mainly affects children in severely disenfranchised communities. Noma is preventable and requires urgent basic medical care in the early stages of disease. Once the disease reaches the last stage, sequelae, survivors require expert surgical care, usually difficult to access as most cases of noma occur in resource-limited settings. We conducted a scoping review of the literature published on noma to understand the size and scope of available research on the disease and to identify research priorities that will evolve our understanding of how to eradicate this disease. Our review showed that noma has been reported in the literature for hundreds of years; however several major gaps in knowledge still exist. There is appreciation among the small community of clinicians and researchers involved in noma care and research that these gaps in knowledge impact on the ability to develop and implement sound evidence-based policies and activities aimed at eradicating noma from communities that continue to be afflicted by this ancient disease. The main focus of future research should be to study the burden and distribution of disease; the true mortality rate, and the pathogenic cause(s) and the factors that influence prognosis and outcomes after treatment.
