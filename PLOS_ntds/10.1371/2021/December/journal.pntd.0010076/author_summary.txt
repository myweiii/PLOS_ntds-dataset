Pathogenic Leptospira are the causative agents for leptospirosis, a neglected and emerging zoonosis occurring worldwide. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of Leptospira strains isolated from patients over a 12-year period in Lao PDR. Our genome analysis revealed a high diversity of Leptospira genotypes in this endemic country for leptospirosis, including a group of clonal strains which was responsible for a large outbreak in neighboring Thailand. Further progress in our understanding of the epidemiology of Leptospira circulating genotypes should contribute to the implementation of prevention and intervention measures to reduce the risk of leptospirosis transmission.
