Mass treatment with anti-parasitic medications is a key control and elimination strategy for several helminth infections, namely intestinal worm infections, schistosomiasis, and lymphatic filariasis, which are common in the Philippines and other endemic countries. To gain insight into the impact of such a strategy that has been in place for more than 14 years, we used systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the prevalence of each of these helminth infections in the Philippines before and after the initiation of mass treatment. The review included 109 reports, composed of peer-reviewed studies and grey literature. The pooled overall prevalence of heavy intensity and the prevalence in children of intestinal worm infection and schistosomiasis were significantly lower in studies conducted after initiation of mass treatment. The studies included are highly heterogenous reflecting variability in sampling procedures, diagnostic tests, study sites, and years of data collection. Eliminating morbidity and interrupting transmission may require expanded control initiatives including community-wide treatment, and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene. The same significantly lower prevalence after initiation of mass treatment was observed for lymphatic filariasis where only two out of the initial 12 endemic provinces still require mass treatment due to prevalence above 1%.
