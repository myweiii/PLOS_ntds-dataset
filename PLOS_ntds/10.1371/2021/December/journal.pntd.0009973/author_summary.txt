Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) is the most lethal human pathogen of medical importance after the dengue virus among arboviruses. The increasing geographic spread of Hyalomma ticks, which are responsible for viral transmission widespread, threatens billions of people. WHO currently declares the field of research on CCHFV as the second most urgently needed areas of investigations on emerging pathogens. About 10 to 40% of those infected with the virus lose their life due to the rapidly developing severe clinical manifestations. Pandemic potential and the lack of any approved treatment or vaccine make raise the studies on CCHFV as critical. The studies on CCHFV are challenging due to the necessities of BSL-4 facilities and the immunological characterization of individual structural proteins will lay the groundwork for the steps to be taken to treat and prevent this emerging disease. As is known from other RNA viruses, nucleoprotein (NP) has crucial roles in the viral life cycle, both in viral replication and transcription and in the formation of the virion structure. So far, detailed and comprehensive immunological characterizations on NP in multiple are not undertaken. Our study was set out to embark such detailed investigation. The strong humoral and cellular immune response to NP demonstrated by this study indicates that NP might be an excellent candidate for future scrutinies on vaccines and diagnostic reagents.
