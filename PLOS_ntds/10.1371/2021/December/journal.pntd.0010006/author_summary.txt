Infections with Orthohantaviruses are an emerging worldwide public health concern. Infections with the Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) may cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), termed nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is associated with acute renal failure in severe cases. The knowledge about potentially protective immune responses against PUUV in the human host is still limited. The present study contributes to the understanding of NK cell based human immune responses against PUUV. Based on in vitro NK cell proliferation and activation experiments as well as on analysis of genetic risk factors in NE patients, we provide evidence that the NKG2C+ NK cell mediated immune responses are an important factor in the prevention of severe PUUV-infections. These findings do not only contribute to the deeper understanding of the PUUV-specific NK cell responses, but also identify a potential protective immune mechanism, which may also contribute to strategies for PUUV vaccine development.
