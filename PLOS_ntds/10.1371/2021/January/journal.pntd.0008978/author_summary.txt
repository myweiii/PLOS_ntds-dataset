S. haematobium deposit its eggs in the urogenital organs which may cause genital ulcers and other lesions. When untreated the infection causes infertility, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, prematurity, vulva nodules, genital and cervical lesions, increased risk of HIV and Human Papilloma Virus in women. These may lead to social consequences such as low self-esteem, depression and stigma. The disease burden has been neglected in males, with more emphasis on female genital schistosomiasis. Control programs have focused on school age children, often overlooking reproductive aged individuals who are potential reservoirs. A total of 509 reproductive aged individuals living in Tiko, a semi urban setting in the mount Cameroon area were screened. The overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 22.8%, with significantly higher rates in males (35.2%) than females (16.2%). Similarly, intensity of infection was significantly higher in males (p = 0.009), singles (p = 0.004) and younger age individuals (0.012). Younger age, gender type (male) and awareness of UGS were identified as key factors that increase the odd of infection. In this setting, younger adults and males represent important public health risk groups and potential reservoir sources of disease transmission in the area.
