    "Background": "Urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) caused by S. haematobium has enormous reproductive health consequences including infertility. Reproductive aged individuals are a neglected group and not included in control programs in Cameroon. This study investigated the prevalence and severity of S. haematobium infection in the context of gender and socio-economic structures that shape behaviour among reproductive aged individuals living in Tiko, a semi-urban setting, Cameroon.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Tiko Health District (THD) between May to September 2019. Consenting individuals were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique and administered a semi-structured questionnaire to document data on socio-demographic and stream contact behaviour. A urine sample was collected and screened for the presence of S. haematobium ova using reagent strips, filtration and microscopy. The overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 22.8% (95% CL: 19.27–26.73) with geometric mean egg load of 18.74 (range: 1–1600) per 10ml of urine. Younger age group (15 – 20years) (OR: 5.13; 95% CL: 1.35–19.42), male (OR: 2.60 3.07; 95% CL: 1.54–4.40) and awareness of UGS (OR: 1.73; 95% CL: 1.02–2.95) were associated with higher odds of exposure to infection. Significantly higher intensity of infection was seen in males, singles and in the age group 15–30 years. It is worth noting that males carried out more activities which entailed longer duration in streams.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The prevalence obtained shows that Tiko is a moderate-risk area for UGS with underlying morbidity-inducing infection intensity. The severity of the infection is more in males. Awareness of the disease is not enough to protect these communities from infection, but provision of public infrastructures and health education will limit contact with infested water and thus curtail the infection. There is an urgent need to involve all age groups in control programs."
