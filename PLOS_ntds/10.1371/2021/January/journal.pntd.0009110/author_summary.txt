Malaria is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in the world. In Southeast Asia, the incidence of human malaria infections caused by simian malaria parasites that originate from macaques has been increasing in the last decade, possibly due to closer proximity between the macaque and human population as a result of deforestation. In Singapore, urbanization and change in land use have resulted in closer proximity and interactions between macaques and the general human population. In order to assess the risk of potential simian malaria zoonosis, 1039 macaquesâ€™ blood samples were screened in this study for simian malaria parasites. Our results showed that simian malaria parasites were only detected in macaques living deep in the forest within the military protected zone, while macaques living close to human habitations are malaria-free. This study illustrated a low risk of zoonotic transmission of simian malaria parasites to the general population in Singapore.
