Currently 13 snail species are reported as first intermediate hosts of Clonorchis sinensis, including two species of the Thiaridae, Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera. Both snail species have wide distributions in tropical and subtropical waters across the World, while the distribution of C. sinensis is much narrower and only occurs in endemic areas of East Asia. The role that these two thiarid snail species plays as successful hosts of C. sinensis, however, has been refuted in other studies. The present study was conducted to clarify this issue. Based on the results from field surveys in a newly discovered and highly endemic area for C. sinensis, as well as, data obtained under experimental conditions, we confirm that in Northern Vietnam, the two thiarid snail species are not successful first intermediate host of C. sinensis. C. sinensis was only detected in a single snail species, Parafossarulus manchouricus, through observation, molecular analyses and experimental infections.
