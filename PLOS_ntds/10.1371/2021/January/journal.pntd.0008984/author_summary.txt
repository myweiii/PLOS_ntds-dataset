Despite the large volume of Zika virus (ZIKV)-related research, the difference in the frequency of ZIKV-related severe congenital abnormalities between Northeastern Brazil in the rest of Brazil and other locations has not been adequately explained. This systematic review summarizes the existing evidence for the role of prior Dengue virus (DENV) infections as co-factor to explain the variability in the frequency of ZIKV-related severe congenital abnormalities. Results differed significantly according to study type (e.g. in vitro versus in vivo studies), and no clear picture emerged with regard to prior DENV infections causing ZIKV-related severe congenital abnormalities. However, evidence from additional studies not included in this systematic review that focus on immunological interactions between DENV and ZIKV infections imply the potential that severe ZIKV disease is more frequent in those with prior DENV infections. Therefore, an assessment of background immunity against closely related viruses (e.g. the flavivirus family) needs to be included in future and ongoing longitudinal studies on ZIKV-related congenital abnormalities.
