Streptoccocus suis (S.suis) infection is a potentially lethal zoonotic disease in humans. In the present study, we sought to estimate the impact of the disease in Thailand in terms of years of life lost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to simulate the impact of S.suis infection and its major complications among Thai people. In 2019, it was estimated that the infection incurred 769 years of life lost (14% of predicted years of life lived if infection had not occurred), 826 QALYs lost (21%) and 793 PALYs (15%) lost. These equated to an average of 2.5 years of life, 2.6 QALYs and 2.5 PALYs lost per person. The loss in PALYs was associated with a loss of 346 million Thai baht (US$11.3 million) in GDP, which equated to 1.1 million Thai baht (US$ 36,033) lost per person. The findings call for increased public health awareness and comprehensive efforts to control and prevent the disease.
