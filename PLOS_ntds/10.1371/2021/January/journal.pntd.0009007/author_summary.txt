Schistosoma mansoni is one of the main agents of schistosomiasis, which is the most important human helminthic infection in terms of global morbidity and mortality. Although schistosomiasis represents a major public health problem in endemic countries, evidences show that S. mansoni downregulates inflammatory responses in many diseases. Fortunately, the control of the host inflammatory response appears not to be strictly dependent on parasite infection, but can be extended to pathogen-derived antigen, suggesting that some S. mansoni molecules are useful weapons to control inflammation. In this study we analyzed the Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 protein and designed two different point mutations on its Kunitz Domain (KD). These mutated domains were analyzed in silico and expressed in Escherichia coli in order to evaluate their function in blocking neutrophil elastase (NE) activity and their role in inflammation using the experimental model of MSU-induced acute arthritis. Our in vivo data using MSU-induced acute arthritis suggest that the RL-KD mutant has a noteworthy anti-inflammatory effect compared to EA-KD mutant. Our results reinforce the growing evidence that specific molecules from parasitic helminths have immunomodulatory effects and could be an important source for developing novel therapies to control inflammatory diseases.
