Cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases characterized by the involvement of skin and mucous membranes, respectively. The first-line drug for the treatment is meglumine antimoniate, but its use presents several limitations, such as an aggressive administration schedule, a wide range of local and systemic side effects, great variability in therapeutic response, and an important number of failed treatments. In this study, we explored epidemiological, clinical, and treatment-related factors that could be involved in treatment failure (TF). We included in the study 71 adult subjects who underwent the first cycle of specific treatment with meglumine antimoniate, and we found that the geographical area where the disease was acquired (Yungas ecoregion), and lesion age â‰¥ 6 months accounted as risk factors for TF. Knowledge of the high percentage of TF recorded, as well as a description of distinct characteristics associated with these failures, could help to improve the clinical management of patients.
