Leishmaniasis is an important protozoan parasitic disease and the currently active pharmaceutical compounds used for its treatment are limited with various drawbacks. Therefore, the need for new drug alternatives is evident and the development of novel anti-leishmanial agents based on natural products (NPs) is challenging. Olive oil (OO) is an integral part of the exquisite “Mediterranean diet”, constituting a high-value nutritional element associated with the lower incidence of coronary heart diseases and neurological disorders. Various studies conducted thus far, including human, animal, and in vitro models, attribute these intriguing biological properties to its adequate fatty acid profile and phenolic composition. Compositional studies have identified a plethora of phenolic compounds, including phenolic alcohols, secoiridoid derivatives, phenolic acids, lignans and flavonoids. Some of the most important biophenols found in OO are hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and oleuropein and its derivatives, oleocanthal and oleacein. Our recent studies concern the evaluation of the anti-leishmanial properties of NPs derived from Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) in in vitro and in vivo models of experimental leishmaniasis. We have previously revealed Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF), as a promising product with anti-leishmanial properties in in vitro and in vivo systems. This study validates TPF as a potent inhibitory factor against Leishmania spp., driving parasites into an apoptotic-like cell death. Its leishmanicidal activity is further established in the in vivo murine experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, evaluating also its ability to promote the host’s protective Th1-type immune response. This study suggests the potential use of TPF against leishmaniasis because of its dual action as chemotherapeutic compound that eliminates parasite alone and also as immunostimulator of host’s immune system.
