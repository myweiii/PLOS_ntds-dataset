Leprosy, a neglected tropical disease, is a public health problem in northern Argentina, causing permanent damage, stigmatization and discrimination. The Program for the Control of Leishmaniasis and Leprosy in Formosa province (PCLyLF) is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and the active search for household contacts. The present study aimed to determine the spatial distribution of new cases of leprosy and the status of the disease using new case detection rate (NCDR) as the main epidemiological indicator. We determined the NCDR trends (2002–2016 time series) of the general population, age groups, sexes and Departments, and the NCDR forecast for the province by 2022. Our results indicated that leprosy was spread throughout Formosa, with higher rates in men and in patients over 65 years old. The NCDR showed a downward trend in the whole province and in each Department. The Departments of Bermejo and Matacos had the highest decreasing trend and the Department of Patiño the lowest one. Future projections show that leprosy will not be eliminated by 2022.
