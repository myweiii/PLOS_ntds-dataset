Until now, no antiviral treatment has been proven to be effective for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The timing of oxygen therapy, which has rarely been mentioned in the current literature, has a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with limited medical resources. It is worthwhile to find clues from the exploratory use of oxygen and antiviral drugs in Wuhan at the beginning of the COVID-29 pandemic. Therefore, in this study, a retrospective review was carried out to identify the risk factors associated with a severe and fatal illness, including the use of antivirus and timing of oxygen therapy. The main differences in the clinical features of patients with different severities of COVID-19 were described and the risk factors were explored to expand the current recommendations for high-risk groups. Initiation of oxygen treatment less than 2 days after onset after onset of hypoxia symptoms and the use of IFN-a among critically ill patients were significantly associated with lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Our study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy and lend support to the potentially beneficial effects of IFNÎ± on critical illness.
