Aedes aegypti is a vector of several human diseases such as Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. Only the adult females can feed on blood, important for the production of their offspring, and therefore transmitting these pathogens for the human host. Interestingly, right after their emergence as adults, females show a preference of feeding on nectar, and only after three days, they are fully capacitated to perform a blood meal. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate this physiological and biochemical switch is the main topic of the present study. The transcriptome analysis of males and females during the first hours post-emergence reveals that the gene expression in females is tightly regulated, showing three time-dependent profiles of expression. There is an increase in genes related to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the female head. Assessment of mitochondrial function revealed a gradual increase in respiration linked to ATP synthesis and mitochondrial content. Also, there is an increase in genes related to the muscular function, suggesting a putative role in muscle development and contraction, required, for example, for pumping of blood. The female body showed an increase in salivary gland related genes and serine proteases, probably related to the ingestion and digestion of the blood. Also, the increase in DNA replication, ribosome biogenesis, and juvenile hormone signaling pathways together with changes in cell cycle control suggest the gonotrophic capacitation for the massive synthesis of yolk proteins precursors during vitellogenesis. All these genes were enhanced even before the first blood meal, which reveals insightful information about the biology of anautogenous mosquitoes. Our data showed the molecular machinery that stands the females hematophagy and gonotrophy, leading to potential new targets for vector control.
