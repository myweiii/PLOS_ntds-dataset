Schistosomiasis japonica is one of the most serious parasitic diseases in China. The Chinese government has launched three different rounds of national schistosomiasis control programs since 1950s. The latest two are the World Bank Loan Project (WBLP) that ushered in chemotherapy as the main control approach, active from 1992 to 2001, and the integrated control strategy that took its place in 2005. In this study, we investigated changes in the dynamics of schistosomiasis transmission over space and time under these different control strategies. Based on spatio-temporal analyses of the schistosomiasis prevalence data at the village level during 1991–2014 in Guichi, Anhui Province, we built a dynamic model to evaluate the evolving pattern of prevalence. We found that the schistosomiasis prevalence generally showed a north-western shift over the study area during 1991–2005, while there was no such trend during 2006–2014. This global shifting trend disappeared after the effect of proximity to river was taken into account, but local change still existed which was possibly due to the transition between the two latest national control strategies. We conclude that proximity to River is still an important determinant for schistosomiasis prevalence and that although the integrated control strategy is more effective than the WBPL in reducing schistosomiasis prevalence, the disease would remain endemic for the long term without further improvements of the control program.
