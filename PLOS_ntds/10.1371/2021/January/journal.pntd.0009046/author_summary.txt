In Nigeria, cholera occurs annually since 1970 and Kano State located in the North West zone of the country reports cholera outbreaks almost every year. Although both national and Kano State governments provide water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions to stop the outbreaks, the disease still occurs in many Local Government Areas. With this continuous threat from cholera in Kano State annually, we used Local Government Area level suspected and confirmed cholera data from 2010 to 2019 to identify and classify ‘hotspot’ Local Government Areas. Our goal was to better guide National Cholera Plans for control and elimination of cholera from Kano State. In this ten-year period, there were 16,461 cholera cases with annual incidence rate of 13.4 cases per 100 000 people. A population of 4,894,144 people live in the 18 cholera hotspots Local Government Areas in which cholera risks were 1.02 to 3.30 times higher than elsewhere in Kano State. As recommended by Global Task Force for Cholera Control, interventions should focus on these identified hotspots Local Government Areas to facilitate control and elimination of cholera from Kano State.
