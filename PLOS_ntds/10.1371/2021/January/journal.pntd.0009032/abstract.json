    "Background": "Soil-transmitted helminths infect about one fifth of the world’s population and have a negative impact on health. The Kato-Katz technique is the recommended method to detect soil-transmitted helminth eggs in stool samples, particularly in programmatic settings. However, some questions in its procedure remain. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of storage time, storage temperature and stirring of stool samples on fecal egg counts (FECs).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In the framework of a clinical trial on Pemba Island, United Republic of Tanzania, 488 stool samples were collected from schoolchildren. These samples were evaluated in three experiments. In the first experiment (n = 92), two Kato-Katz slides were prepared from the same stool sample, one was stored at room temperature, the other in a refrigerator for 50 hours, and each slide was analyzed at nine time points (20, 50, 80, 110, 140 minutes, 18, 26, 42 and 50 hours). In the second experiment (n = 340), whole stool samples were split into two, one part was stored at room temperature, and the other part was put in a refrigerator for 48 hours. From each part one Kato-Katz slide was prepared and analyzed at three time points over two days (0, 24 and 48 hours). In the third experiment (n = 56), whole stool samples where stirred for 15 seconds six times and at each time point a Kato-Katz slide was prepared and analyzed.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our findings suggest that stool samples (i) should be analyzed on the day of collection and (ii) should be analyzed between 20–30 minutes after slide preparation; if that is not possible, Kato-Katz slides can be stored in a refrigerator for a maximum of 110 minutes."
