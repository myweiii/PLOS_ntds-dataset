We would like to thank GPHF for providing us with the latest edition of the relevant chapters of the Minilab manual. Additionally, we thank the staff of the Hospital Pharmacy of BMC Mwanza (particularly Francisco Chibunda) as well as TMDA Mwanza (particularly Aggrey Muhabuki, Salum Kindoli) for assisting in the acquisition of chemicals / reagents and in arranging and re-testing Minilab results. We are grateful to CUHAS Mwanza and St. Martin de Porres Eikwe for their kind support and collaboration and for providing Cesol (PZQ, in Tanzania) and Vermox (MBZ, in Ghana). Finally, we would like to thank the ‘Analytikertreff’ for many helpful tips and suggestions, as well as Lorenz Meinel and Sascha Zügner for the provision of the dissolution tester.
