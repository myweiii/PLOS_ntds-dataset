Among Neglected Tropical Diseases, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases are still highly prevalent and affect more than 1.5 billion people on our planet. Key players in the combat against these entities are the anthelminthic medicines Albendazole, Mebendazole and Praziquantel, which are applied in therapy and preventive chemotherapy likewise. Despite widely available in tropical regions and, particularly for both benzimidazoles, relatively cheap, their quality has been poorly monitored. By this study, we illuminated products from East (Tanzania) and West Africa (Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana) and thus extended the African map of reproducibly assessed deworming drugs. Although containing sufficient active pharmaceutical ingredient, a failure of more than 50% in galenic features significantly mars a thorough elimination of parasites from patients. Our findings emphasize the need for quality-assured products. Regular local screening, efficient and expressive confirmation of irregularities and a swift appropriate reaction by governmental authorities contribute to a successful fight against these infectious diseases. Otherwise, their sequelae pose a tremendous burden to the development and prosperity of afflicted regions–not only in heavily affected Africa but around the globe.
