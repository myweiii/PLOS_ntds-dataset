Our study highlighted the presence of infectious zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis, Q-fever and Rift Valley fever that affected pastoralist communities and their livestock. The seroprevalence of the above-mentioned diseases were different in different kebeles as well as species. Better reporting of such zoonotic diseases could not be possible if it were not done in humans and livestock simultaneously. Such approach is known as One Health approach and has many benefits by adding value in terms of human health, animal health and financial savings. The unique characteristic of the current study was establishing the public health and economic importance of brucellosis, Q-fever and Rift Valley fever in humans and livestock using One Health approach for the first time in Somali region of Ethiopia.
