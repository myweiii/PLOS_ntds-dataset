    "Introduction": "A number of neglected tropical diseases are targeted for elimination or eradication. An effective surveillance system is critical to determine if these goals have been achieved and maintained. Trachoma has two related but morphologically different presentations that are monitored for elimination, the active infectious form of trachoma and trachomatous trichiasis (TT), the progression of the disease. There are a number of lessons learnt from the Guinea worm surveillance system that are particularly compatible for TT surveillance and the onchocerciasis surveillance system which can provide insights for surveillance of the infectious form of trachoma.",
    "Methods/Principal findings": "A literature search of peer-reviewed published papers and grey literature was conducted using PUBMED and Google Scholar for articles relating to dracunculiasis or Guinea worm, onchocerciasis and trachoma, along with surveillance or elimination or eradication. The abstracts of relevant papers were read and inclusion was determined based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The credibility and bias of relevant papers were also critically assessed using published criteria. A total of 41 papers were identified that were eligible for inclusion into the review.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The experiences of both the Guinea worm and onchocerciasis surveillance strategies have very useful lessons for trachoma surveillance, pre- and post-validation. The use of a monetary reward for identification of TT cases and further exploration into the use of infection and serological indicators particularly in a post-validation setting to assist in identifying recrudescence would be of particular relevance. The next step would be a real-world evaluation of their relative applicability for trachoma surveillance."
