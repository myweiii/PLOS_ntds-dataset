The design of a surveillance system needs to be carefully thought out to ensure it provides sufficient evidence to determine if a disease or infection is eliminated or eradicated. If inappropriate it can lead to on-going transmission and resurgence of infection or disease or the unnecessary continuation of interventions, wasting valuable resources. Guinea worm is a disease that is painful and debilitating, for which there is no drug or vaccine. The aim is to eradicate the disease and as such the Guinea worm programme is designed around a strategy of identification of cases and their containment to prevent onward transmission. Onchocerciasis if left untreated can lead to blindness. The aim is to eliminate the disease through the interruption of transmission. A literature review was conducted to determine available evidence and identify lessons that can be learnt from the surveillance of both diseases for the design of trachoma surveillance strategies in the endgame. The potential utility of rumour reporting and a monetary incentive for the identification of a confirmed case of Guinea worm could be explored for trichiasis case finding. Trichiasis is the progression of trachoma and leads to significant ocular morbidity. The introduction of tests for infection and antibodies and the utility of sentinel surveillance as utilised for onchocerciasis are interesting considerations for active trachoma surveillance post-validation and has potential to identify recrudescence cost-effectively. The experiences of both the Guinea worm and onchocerciasis surveillance strategies have very useful lessons that can be trialled for trachoma surveillance. However, their real-world applicability and implications for trachoma need to be evaluated before any changes in guidelines are proposed.
