Usutu virus (USUV) infection impairs eIF2Î± phosphorylation and SGs assembly, in an oxidative stress related manner, as a mechanism to evade cellular stress response. Our results provide new insights into the complex connections between the stress response and USUV infection to maintain a better cellular environment for viral replication.
