World Health Organization estimates that every year between 81,000 and 138,000 die due to snake bites across the world. Mismanagement of snakebites can result in increased disabilities and death if not handled by knowledgeable health workers. This study assessed if various categories of health workers made up of professionals from the medical, pharmaceutical, and nursing categories in the three neighbouring Tongu districts in Ghana have the appropriate level of knowledge on snakebite management. Using a newly developed questionnaire, data were collected from the respondents using google forms sent to their WhatsApp platforms. Data were then analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25. Results were presented in the form of tables and association between the variables also determined. The level of knowledge of sampled health workers on snakebite was below average, especially among nursing professionals. However, those who had some previous post-qualification training on snakebite management exhibited a significant superior knowledge and least overestimated their knowledge hence policymakers should through workshops equip health workers especially the nurses on snakebites so that rural dwellers whose health care needs are mainly attended to by nurses can be better managed when they suffer snakebites.
