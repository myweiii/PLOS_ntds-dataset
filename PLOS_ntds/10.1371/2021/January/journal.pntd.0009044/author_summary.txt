It is estimated that snakebite envenoming affects around 2.7 million people every year worldwide. In Brazil, snakebite is part of the Ministry of Health surveillance system and cases receive antivenom free of charge. With a vast territory and limited production of antivenom, there is need to identify higher risk areas for its distribution and to develop preventative actions. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the epidemiological situation of snakebite envenoming in Brazil and explore possible environmental and socioeconomic factors related to snakebites. On the basis of this information, a flowchart tool to support decision-makers identify higher risk areas was created and applied in one state as an example. An average of 27,120 snakebite cases per year were reported in Brazil, with the highest number of cases and rates in the Legal Amazon Region. The multivariable statistics analysis showed association of snakebite with environmental factors (type of major habitat, tropical or non-tropical; temperature; precipitation; elevation) and socioeconomic (lower percentage of urbanization; lower GDP per capita); also, a weaker relation with forest loss, and with venomous snake richness. The tool created to support decision-makers was applied in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with 4,227 reported snakebites during the period. According to this tool, the majority of municipalities in this state were considered as medium risk and 56/496 as high risk. Snakebite cases are distributed across the entire country; however, the highest concentration is in the Legal Amazon Region. This creates a complex situation both for better understanding of the association of environmental and socioeconomic factors with snakebites and for the distribution and maintenance of antivenom to remote areas.
