Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms which lay eggs within the veins of their human host. Upon sensing the parasite egg, macrophages, the first line defense cells, aggregate tightly around the egg to encapsulate it within an immune structure known as a granuloma. These granulomas are the key pathological structures which determine both host disease outcome and parasite transmission. Studies in mice have implicated omega-1, a secreted parasite protein. Omega-1 is an RNase, an enzyme that degrades host RNA. Mouse studies have also suggested that a host defense protein, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), is required to form granulomas around the egg. We used the small and transparent zebrafish larva to examine the requirement of omega-1 and TNF for granuloma formation. We find that omega-1 induces rapid macrophage migration and that its RNase activity is required for this. In contrast, TNF is not involved in the initial recruitment of macrophages. Rather, it enlarges granulomas after they are initiated. These findings improve our understanding of the role of omega-1 and TNF, and show that they impact distinct facets of granuloma formation around Schistosoma eggs.
