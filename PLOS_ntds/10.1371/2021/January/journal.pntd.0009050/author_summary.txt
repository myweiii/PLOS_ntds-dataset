This retrospective multicentric study aimed to describe the frequency and manifestations of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in French Guiana, and to compare patients with disseminated histoplasmosis with or without gastrointestinal involvement. Between January 1, 1981 and October 1, 2014 co-infections with HIV and histoplasmosis were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: age >18 years, confirmed HIV infection; first proven episode of histoplasmosis. Among 349 cases of disseminated histoplasmosis, 245 (70%) had a gastrointestinal presentation. Half of patients with gastrointestinal signs had abdominal pain or diarrhea, mostly watery. Half of patients with abdominal pain had diarrhea (63/124) and half of those with diarrhea (63/123) had abdominal pain. A significant proportion of patients also had hepatomegaly and, to a lesser degree, splenomegaly. After adjusting for potential confounding, the presence of lymphadenopathies >2cm, Haitian origin were associated with a lower prevalence of gastrointestinal signs and presence of H. capsulatum. Persons with a gastrointestinal presentation were more likely to have a decreased prothrombin time, lower liver enzyme concentration, ferritin, and lower concentrations of LDH than those without gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. The delay between symptomâ€™s onset and diagnosis was also shorter and the proportion of deaths at 1 month was significantly lower among those with gastrointestinal presence of H. capsulatum. Subacute or chronic gastrointestinal presentations are very frequent during disseminated histoplasmosis, they seem less severe, and should lead to suspect the diagnosis in endemic areas.
