Every year up to 90,000 new cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occurs globally. One of the most neglected diseases, VL is endemic in 60 countries in four continents. Brazil is one of seven countries in which 90% of all cases in the world occur. When co-occurring with HIV, VL tends to be more severe than in HIV-negative persons, leading to worse prognosis and frequent relapses. In this study HIV-positive outpatients, aged 18 years or older, under antiretroviral therapy, who were asymptomatic for VL, were tested for Leishmania. We observed a prevalence of 9.11% (44/483) of HIV-Leishmania coinfection. For those HIV-positive/Leishmania-negative individuals who live in VL-endemic areas, early initiation of antiretroviral therapy can be a protective factor against Leishmania infection. On the other hand, for HIV-Leishmania coinfected individuals who regularly use antiretrovirals might prevent VL relapses. Studies centering on asymptomatic Leishmania carriers can be useful for guiding public health measures in VL-endemic areas seeking to control and eliminate the disease.
