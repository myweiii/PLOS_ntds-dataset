Despite major progress in malaria control or elimination in South America in the last years, this disease is still an important public health concern in all the Amazon basin countries, particularly during 2017 and 2018, when a substantial malaria incidence (~ one million) was reported. Most of the rise in cases has been due to increases in malaria transmission in Venezuela. Within this country, populations in the southeastern (Guiana Shield) region have been at the highest risk of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum infection. In this study, reported malaria cases between 2007â€“2017 in this region were analyzed to stratify the spatial risk of disease and identify the malaria surge's main driver over the last years. Malaria risk was highly focal and prevalent in 2 consistent disease hotspots that accounted for most Plasmodium transmission in the whole region. Illegal gold-mining activities seem to drive malaria in these disease pockets and seem critical in malaria's surge throughout the country. Analyses of the Venezuelan surveillance data showed that from 2014 onwards, local malaria transmission has reemerged in new areas of the country, leading to a shift in this disease's epidemiology. Successful control of Venezuela's ongoing malaria epidemic requires hotspot-targeted control at the national level and regional coordination to avoid cross-border malaria spillover.
