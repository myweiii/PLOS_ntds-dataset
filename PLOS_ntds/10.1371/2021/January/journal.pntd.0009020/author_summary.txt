Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by helminths within the genus Schistosoma, which affects over 200 million people globally. Here, we demonstrate the ability to obtain whole genome sequences from single S. japonicum miracidia that have been archived for years, and the promise of how these data may be used to answer major questions to understand and eventually help control schistosomiasis. To demonstrate the approach, we generated a moderate-sized dataset of 22 individual S. japonicum genomes and use these data to infer fine-scale patterns of relatedness among parasites from human hosts from two villages in Sichuan, China. We highlight how this type of genomic information may be useful for understanding the genetic variation among individual parasites with high precision, which could ultimately provide high resolution for understanding transmission pathways and inform control efforts with larger sample sizes. We also show that it is possible to use less data per individual than we obtained here, and still maintain high levels of accuracy; this would enable greater sample sizes by lowering individual sample cost. Collectively our results demonstrate that sampling genomes of individual schistosome parasites is now feasible on a population-level scale, opening new avenues for studying relatedness, tracing parasite spread, and studying parasite biology.
