Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) exacerbates the already serious tuberculosis epidemic, poses a notable threat to global tuberculosis control, and places a considerable burden on developing countries, as treatments for MDR-TB tend to be expensive, of limited efficacy, and toxic. Genotypic determinants of resistance to specific drugs or drug classes offer a rapid and highly specific alternative to phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Although the relationship between gene mutations and drug resistance has been described previously, the strength of the association of mutations with the treatment outcomes of MDR tuberculosis have not been fully elucidated. The results of our study, which was conducted in a Chinese population, suggest that gene mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be related to phenotypic drug susceptibility. Mutation of the pncA gene contributes to a poor prognosis and can be applied to predict the treatment outcomes of MDR-TB.
