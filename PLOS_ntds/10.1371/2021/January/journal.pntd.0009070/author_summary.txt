In context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Chile has been one of the hardest-hit countries in Latin America, struggling to contain the spread of the virus. In this manuscript, we employ renewal equation to estimate the reproduction number (R) for the early ascending phase of the COVID-19 epidemic and by July 7th, 2020 to guide the magnitude and intensity of interventions required to combat the COVID-19 epidemic. We also estimate the instantaneous reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile. Moreover, we generate short-term forecasts based on the epidemic trajectory using phenomenological models, and assess counterfactual scenarios to understand any additional resources required to contain the virusâ€™ spread. Our results indicate early sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, the initial control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. The easing of COVID-19 restrictions in April led to a new wave of infections, followed by the re-imposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and several municipalities. Most recent estimates of reproduction number indicate a decline in the virus transmission. While broad-scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing efforts.
