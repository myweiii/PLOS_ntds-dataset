Insecticides are still one of the most important tools, and often only tool, used to control disease vectors such as mosquitoes. The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits several important pathogens impacting human health, including dengue and Zika viruses. Pyrethroid insecticides are commonly used to control A. aegypti in endemic areas, however, heavy use of insecticides has resulted in insecticide resistant mosquitoes. In A. aegypti, pyrethroid resistance evolved primarily through mutations in the pyrethroid target site (here referred to as kdr) and by increased detoxification by CYP enzymes. In this study, we sought to understand how these resistance modifications impact the mosquito fitness, since mutations often come with a biological cost. We found that both mechanisms have a cost and that they affect different aspects of mosquito physiology. CYP-mediated detoxification has a greater negative impact in the mosquito longevity and its ability to compete for mates. Kdr has a clear cost, but the specific function that is affected was neither reproduction nor longevity and therefore remains elusive. This study helps us understand how resistance influences mosquito life history traits and may help in the design of more targeted insecticide resistance management strategies.
