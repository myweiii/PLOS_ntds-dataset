Neglected tropical diseases, such as echinococcosis and cysticercosis, which are caused by taeniid cestodes (tapeworms), represent serious public health problems in many countries around the world. Given that there is only a small number of approved anthelmintics for the treatment of cestodiases, and that most of them are not highly effective against larval stages, identifying novel drug targets and their associated compounds is critical. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that produce epigenetic modifications of chromatin, thus modifying cellular gene expression. In this study, we evaluate and characterize a number of HDAC inhibitors on the model cestode Mesocestoides vogae and report the anthelmintic profile of these compounds. Some of the HDAC inhibitors tested showed potent anthelmintic effects, particularly entinostat, TH65 and TH92. These compounds were selected as the most promising candidates due to their high potencies, which were superior to the commercially-available anthelmintic drug albendazole. We also evaluated pairwise drug combinations of HDAC inhibitors and albendazole. The findings of this study provide a starting point for the development of new HDAC-based cestocidal compounds.
