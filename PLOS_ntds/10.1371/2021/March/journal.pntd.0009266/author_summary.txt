More than a million adults and older children die each year from diarrhea, with the vast majority living in low- and middle-income countries. Accurately assessing hydration status remains the most critical step in caring for these patients. While most patients with diarrhea can be managed safely at home, a small proportion will have severe dehydration and require intravenous fluid in a hospital setting to prevent organ damage and death. Despite dramatic improvements in diarrhea care around the world over the past several decades, there are still no evidence-based tools that doctors and nurses in low resource settings can use to determine an adult patientâ€™s hydration status. Our study collected data on more than two thousand patients with acute diarrhea over the age of five years at Dhaka Hospital in Bangladesh. Using artificial intelligence techniques, we developed two new clinical diagnostic tools that can accurately and reliably predict the severity of dehydration in patients with diarrhea, which we will incorporate into a simple mobile phone application for use by doctors and nurses in low resource settings. Once validated, these new tools could improve care for patients with acute diarrhea worldwide.
