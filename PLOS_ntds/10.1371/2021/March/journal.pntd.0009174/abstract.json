    "Abstract": "This study aimed at determining the impact of intestinal helminths on malaria parasitaemia, anaemia and pyrexia considering the levels of IL-1β among outpatients in Bamenda. A cohort of 358 consented participants aged three (3) years and above, both males and females on malaria consultation were recruited in the study. At enrolment, patients’ axillary body temperatures were measured and recorded. Venous blood was collected for haemoglobin concentration and malaria parasitaemia determination. Blood plasma was used to measure human IL-1β levels using Human ELISA Kit. The Kato-Katz technique was used to process stool samples. Five species of intestinal helminths Ascaris lumbricoides (6.4%), Enterobius vermicularis (5.0%), Taenia species (4.2%), Trichuris trichiura (1.1%) and hookworms (0.8%) were identified. The overall prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and intestinal helminths was 30.4% (109/358) and 17.6% (63/358) respectively. The prevalence of intestinal helminths in malaria patients was 17.4% (19/109). Higher Geometric mean parasite density (GMPD ±SD) (malaria parasitaemia) was significantly observed in patients co-infected with Enterobius vermicularis (5548 ± 2829/μL, p = 0.041) and with Taenia species (6799 ± 4584/μL, p = 0.020) than in Plasmodium falciparum infected patients alone (651 ± 6076/ μL). Higher parasitaemia of (1393 ± 3031/μL) and (3464 ± 2828/μL) were recorded in patients co-infected with Ascaris lumbricoides and with hookworms respectively but the differences were not significant (p > 0.05). Anaemia and pyrexia prevalence was 27.1% (97/358) and 33.5% (120/358) respectively. Malaria patients co-infected with Enterobius vermicularis and Ascaris lumbricoides had increased risk of anaemia (OR = 13.712, p = 0.002 and OR = 16.969, p = 0.014) respectively and pyrexia (OR = 18.07, p = 0.001 and OR = 22.560, p = 0.007) respectively than their counterparts. Increased levels of IL-1β were significantly observed in anaemic (148.884 ± 36.073 pg/mL, t = 7.411, p = 0.000) and pyretic (127.737 ± 50.322 pg/mL, t = 5.028, p = 0.000) patients than in non-anaemic (64.335 ± 38.995pg/mL) and apyretic patients (58.479 ± 36.194pg/mL). Malaria patients co-infected with each species of intestinal helminths recorded higher IL-1β levels (IL-1β > 121.68 ± 58.86 pg/mL) and the overall mean (139.63 ± 38.33pg/mL) was higher compared with levels in malaria (121.68 ± 58.86 pg/mL) and helminth (61.78 ± 31.69pg/mL) infected patients alone. Intestinal helminths exacerbated the clinical outcomes of malaria in the patients and increased levels of IL-1β were observed in co-infected patients with anaemia, pyrexia and higher parasitaemia."
