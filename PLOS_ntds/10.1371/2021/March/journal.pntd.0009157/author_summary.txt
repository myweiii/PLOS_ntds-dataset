Like many neglected tropical diseases primarily affecting the rural poor, Buruli ulcer (BU) is under-detected and under-reported within routine health information systems. As such, the burden and distribution are not fully known, impeding appropriate targeting of health resources, control, and care for people affected. Having previously evaluated and mapped the existing evidence for BU and its causative agent M. ulcerans, we concluded that the disease was likely to occur beyond the range of known endemic areas. However, we were left with the question of where exactly these undetected cases might be occurring. Answering this question required a more fine-scale approach: BU is highly focal, presumably due to local variation in the environmental factors which determine suitability for M. ulcerans survival and transmission to humans. We used the compiled evidence and geographical datasets to build statistical models representing the relationship between environmental factors and previously reported cases. This allowed us to define the ecological niche of BU, and subsequently to identify areas across Africa where this niche was met, providing suitable conditions for the disease. We constructed separate models of suitability for M. ulcerans, using locations where its DNA had been detected in environmental sources. Unsurprisingly, suitability for M. ulcerans was predicted to be wider than, but geographically overlapping with that for BU. This implies that beyond the conditions necessary for survival of the bacterium, additional factors are required for transmission to humans. The high-resolution suitability maps we present are intended to guide case search activities which may identify endemic areas beyond the known endemic range. Data on the true prevalence of BU from targeted case searches within predicted-suitable areas will also allow us to validate and refine the models, and potentially to predict the probability of cases occurring within predicted suitable areas.
