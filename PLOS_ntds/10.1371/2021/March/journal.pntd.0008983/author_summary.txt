In spite of the remarkable reduction in Cryptococcal meningitis (CCM) related morbidity and mortality with increased use of antiretroviral therapy, incidence remains unacceptably high especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where more than 90% of the cases and deaths occur.
Due to factors such as the severity of CCM pathology, the quality of life (QOL) of patients post-treatment is also likely to be poor. Few studies have reported on QOL of CCM patients post treatment completion. We used data collected among patients in the CryptoDex trial (ISRCTN59144167) to determine self-perceived QOL and associated factors among 238 survivors at week 10 and 203 survivors at six months from treatment initiation. We determined QOL using the descriptive and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) of the EuroQol Five-Dimension-Three-Level (EQ-5D-3L) tool. We found that while self-perceived QOL was only relatively good among this cohort of patients who had survived through treatment for CCM, it continued to improve over the 6 months following diagnosis. Low weight at diagnosis, prolonged hospital admission, positive yeast culture at day 14/treatment completion, and being Asian were associated with lower QOL. QOL is an important outcome that should be considered among HIV infected patients treated for serious infections such as CCM.
