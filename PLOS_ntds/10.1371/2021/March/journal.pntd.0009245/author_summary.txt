In the Amazon Region, when individuals are bitten by a venomous snake, they are obliged to seek care in hospitals located in the urban area in order to receive adequate treatment, i.e., the use of antivenom. Despite the fact that snakebites occur mostly in rural areas and riverine and indigenous communities, antivenom is not available in the health units located in these areas. Thus, this individual may take a long time to arrive at the hospital, because in addition to the great distance he/she must travel, there may be difficulties in obtaining transportation. In addition, individuals often use home treatments, believing that they will be effective in reversing the effects of the envenomation. This study was carried out through the application of questionnaires and interviews conducted with patients victims of snakebites treated at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, which is a reference center for the treatment of tropical diseases, including snakebites, and is located in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The patients came from 11 municipalities, and many came from very distant municipalities. The routes, in addition to being long ones, are very fragmented, and require different forms of transport in order to reach the reference hospital. In the places where they perform their daily activities, patients feel safe and do not use protective clothing. Many home treatment practices are used, including some that can be harmful, such as tourniquets. It is common for patients to seek help only when the clinical signs worsen, i.e., when severe pain, extensive edema and bleeding occurs. It is believed that if antivenoms were made available in health units closer to the patients’ place of residence, there would be a decrease in cases of delay in treatment, and thus reduce the possibility of complications.
