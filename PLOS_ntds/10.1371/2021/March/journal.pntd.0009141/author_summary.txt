We evaluated naturally occurring infections of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human Chagas disease, in an indoor/outdoor primate colony at a breeding facility in Texas, USA. Using serial quantitative PCR and hemoculture, we confirmed infection in 92% of the 64 seropositive animals, but neither of these two methods confirmed more than 80% of the cases. Parasites by hemoculture fell into two genetic groups (discrete typing units I and IV), and displayed large variation in growth characteristics, elicited cellular and humoral immune responses as well as virulence and drug susceptibility when tested in mice. EKG abnormalities were found in 13 out of 51 qPCR-positive macaques. Our results demonstrate the complexity of these infection parameters in this colony in spite of the uniform and geographically constrained housing conditions of the macaques.
