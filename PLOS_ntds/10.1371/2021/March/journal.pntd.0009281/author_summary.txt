Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America. In absence of the triatomine vector in Spain, congenital (mother-to-infant) transmission is the main infection route. The Valencian Community has recommended universal screening for CD in pregnant Latin American women since 2007. In our study we analyzed adherence to that recommendation in Alicante province from 2014 to 2018, finding that it is quite low (38.9% overall, 48.3% in Bolivians) and heterogeneous between health departments. Among unscreened pregnant women during the study period, we estimate that there could be 43 undiagnosed cases of CD and 1 to 2 undetected infections in infants. We also observed very low adherence to treatment after delivery in CD-diagnosed, untreated women (8.3%), and a low rate of completed follow-up in newborns at risk of vertical infection (47.8%). We need to improve the program in order to achieve universal CD screening in Latin American (and especially Bolivian) pregnant women, to enhance CD treatment in postpartum women, and to improve monitoring in exposed newborns through a well-established notification and follow-up circuit.
