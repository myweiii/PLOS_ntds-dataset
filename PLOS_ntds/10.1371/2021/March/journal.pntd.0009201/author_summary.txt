Compared to other provinces in China, Yunnan bears a significant burden of leprosy disease. Multidrug therapy (MDT) was launched for leprosy in 1990, and a special fund for leprosy was established in Yunnan Province by the central government in 2004. During the past 30 years, the number of newly detected leprosy patients has steadily declined, accompanied by an enormous decrease in the number of leprosy-endemic regions. Compared to the 1990–2003 period, the period after the establishment of the special fund from the central government (2004–2019) saw a decrease in the proportion of child cases and patients with grade 2 disability (G2D) and in the duration of delay in diagnosis among newly detected patients, while the proportion of patients with paucibacillary (PB) leprosy, the proportion belonging to minority groups, and the proportion of cases detected early increased significantly. The main challenges are the remaining leprosy-endemic counties, the high rate of cases with a contact history, insufficient early detection, and cases resulting in G2D. To eliminate leprosy in Yunnan Province, a multifaceted strategy should be implemented.
