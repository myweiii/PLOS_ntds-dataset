Leishmania parasite. It was defined as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2010. The eradication of VL had almost been achieved in the country since 1960s`last century but the parts of western China. Although the numbers of annual reported cases of VL declined, the mountain-type zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (MT-ZVL) continued to increase in recent years. In this study, the epidemiological characters and spatio⁃temporal distribution of MT-ZVL were investigated in China between the years 2015 and 2019. A total of 529 cases of MT-ZVL were reported in six provinces and predominantly in Gansu (55.0%), Shanxi (21.7%), Shaanxi (12.5%) and Sichuan (8.9%) provinces. Significant differences in the Moran’s I statistic were observed, indicating spatial autocorrelation in the spatial distribution of MT-ZVL. Spatio⁃temporal hotspot analysis revealed clustering of infection cases in the Shaanxi-Shanxi border areas and eastern of Shanxi province, as well as in the south of Gansu province and the north of the Sichuan province. Therefore, the reinforcement of VL control in conventionally high-risk areas, attention to areas where VL re-emergence is likely, timely survey of vectors, assessment of transmission risk, and targeted interventions are strongly recommended to reduce risk of MT-ZVL infection.
