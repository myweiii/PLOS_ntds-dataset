Vector-borne diseases (VBD) comprise a pathogen-vector-reservoir relation, and control programs should take into account different factors involving this relationship. This study is focused on a leishmaniasis outbreak that has occurred in the southwestern Madrid region since 2010. An intensive molecular surveillance of the sand fly vector Phlebotomus perniciosus was carried out from 2012 to 2018 in 4 municipalities from the affected region: Fuenlabrada, Legan√©s, Getafe and Humanes de Madrid. The aim of this investigation was to discern how much the vector was infected and find out its blood-feeding habits in the different surveyed points. The results showed an important rate of infected sand flies and also that P. perniciosus presents an opportunistic blood-feeding behaviour, taking blood from many different hosts, depending on their availability and density. The results obtained in this surveillance helped the authorities to plan and implement more accurate and effective control measures in the area, reflecting the importance of applying molecular surveillance in VBD outbreaks.
