The design of interventions tackling diseases transmitted between animals and humans requires an understanding of healthcare patterns related to both human and animal hosts. The control of dog-mediated rabies is a good example of this need. Rabies is still a major problem in Tanzania, where children are most at risk, and more than 40% of deaths are in children under 15 years old. While the vaccination of dogs against rabies is an effective method for controlling the disease, dog vaccination coverage is too low and depends on the willingness of dog owners to vaccinate. If a person is bitten by a rabid dog, the only way to prevent death is to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in time. Hence, understanding factors related to dog ownership and responsibility for dog vaccination and child health is critical to the design of vaccination strategies. This study found that it is important to understand the role of these processes critical to the control of zoonoses, so that disease prevention campaigns can focus on a range of decision-makers, particularly those in households.
