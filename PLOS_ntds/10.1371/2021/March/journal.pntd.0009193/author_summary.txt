Neurocysticercosis is an infection of the brain with the tapeworm Taenia solium. On the Indian sub-continent, the majority of people suffering from neurocysticercosis only show one cyst (larval form of the parasite) in their brain and often present at clinics with epileptic seizures. There is still some debate on the best way to treat these cases to reduce the risk for seizure recurrence. The goal of this study was to review the literature on how well different durations of treatment with anti-seizure medication (ASM), combined or not with corticosteroids, work in order to reduce the seizure recurrence and eliminate the cyst from the brain. The results show that ASM for 24 months compared to 6 months favors reduced seizure recurrence in patients whose cysts calcified post treatment. Concerning anti-inflammatory treatment, corticosteroids were also found to have beneficial effects on seizure reduction. However, further high-quality randomized controlled trials with adequately long follow-up time are required for better evidence on best drug(s), dose and duration of ASM and corticosteroids for individuals with SEL NCC.
