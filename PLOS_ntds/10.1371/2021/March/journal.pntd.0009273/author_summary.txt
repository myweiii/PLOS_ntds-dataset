Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) represents a significant threat in terms of its ability to emerge into na√Øve geographic areas. Furthermore, RVFV represents a global public health risk due to the ability of many mosquito species to transmit the virus and the ease with which the virus can be transported due to increased globalization. The vertical transmission of RVFV by mosquitoes has long been accepted by the research community due to limited field evidence. However, laboratory confirmation of vertical transmission has remained elusive for thirty-five years. We present the first laboratory evidence of vertical transmission of RVFV in the susceptible North American vector, Culex tarsalis. We present two studies that clearly show 1) the accumulation of RVFV antigen in the ovaries of infected mosquitoes and 2) the transmission of RVFV from parent to offspring immediately following an infectious blood meal.
