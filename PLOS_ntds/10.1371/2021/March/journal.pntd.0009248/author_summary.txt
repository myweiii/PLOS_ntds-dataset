We reported the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of case series of 209 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Changsha, Hunan province. In addition, we compared the characteristics of patients among asymptomatic, mild upper respiratory tract infection and viral pneumonia of SARS-CoV-2 infection in detail. The symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were relatively mild outside Wuhan, and family cluster was a remarkable epidemic characteristic. Special attention should be paid to asymptomatic patients.
