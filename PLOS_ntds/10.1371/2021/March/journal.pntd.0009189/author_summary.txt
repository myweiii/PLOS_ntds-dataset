Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease caused by a group of flatworm parasites known as schistosomes. The drug praziquantel has been used since the 1970s to treat schistosomiasis with some variable measures of efficacy reported. Reasons for the variation can be related to host attributes or parasite attributes. We conducted this study to determine factors affecting drug efficacy and if the efficacy has altered in the past four decades.
We identified 146 scientific articles that reported efficacy levels of praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis as determined by cure rate (CR) and/or egg reduction rate (ERR). We conclude that praziquantel treatment is still effective for schistosomiasis even after four decades of usage. Praziquantel efficacy levels increased with drug dose. Our study showed the majority of studies reported high ERR (>80%) even among studies that reported low CR (<50%). Even in the studies reporting low CR, ERR were high indicating that treatment did reduce infection intensity even though it did not completely remove the infection in some people. Since schistosome morbidity is related to infection intensity, our results support the use of ERR as an indicator that helps avoid underestimation of praziquantel treatment efficacy and health impact.
