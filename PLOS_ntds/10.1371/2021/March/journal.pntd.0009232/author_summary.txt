Infections with enteric parasites, including helminths and protozoa, are among the most common infections in poor countries. These infections continue to have enormous impact on both mortality and morbidity worldwide. Enteric parasites inhabit the gut of the infected host, but how infections with these parasites may change the composition of bacteria within the gut remains more or less unclear. Here, we explore how the bacterial composition in stool from children from Guinea-Bissau (Western Africa) is altered by infection with different enteric parasite species. We find that infections with multiple parasite species induces more pronounced changes in the bacterial composition, and that certain parasite species significantly changes the diversity of bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fecal samples stored at room temperature on filter papers for months can be used in field studies of gut bacteria composition. Our study provides new insights into the complex relationship between enteric parasites and fecal bacteria composition, and may pave the way for new treatment options and help explain why some people are more susceptible to infection compared to others.
