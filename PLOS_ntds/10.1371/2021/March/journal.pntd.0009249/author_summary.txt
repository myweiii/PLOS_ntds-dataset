This manuscript presents a strategy construction tool to generate viable strategies to expand the Chagas platforms for healthcare pilot through the primary healthcare system in Bolivia. Relevance of this work resides in the need for performing a rational planification to address Neglected Diseases in low- and middle-income countries, by prioritizing Interventions and Actions. After gathering and loading the data from each specific context and problem, policy makers can use the tool for construction or evaluation of strategies using the WHO Building Block model. The main comparative advantage is that the model does not only include the identification and evaluation of Interventions for the comprehensive care of Chagas, but also includes the necessary activities in the health system to support the large-scale implementation of them. The tool has the potential to be used at different stages of decision making to coordinate activities to address a health problem. The tool could be adapted for its use in other neglected and/ or prevalent diseases or in other locations.
