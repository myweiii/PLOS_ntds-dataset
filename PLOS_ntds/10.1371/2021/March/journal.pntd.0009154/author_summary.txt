Leptospirosis is a rodent-borne zoonosis associated to impoverished areas, where inadequate infrastructure and urban services expose the population to infection through contaminated water and soil. Given the difficulty of early diagnosis and of implementation of large-scale sanitary and rodent control interventions, predictive score that can assess the risk of infection could be useful to define priority areas for local interventions that mitigate the risks. The authors combined data from hospital surveillance for severe leptospirosis cases, domiciliary follow-up visits and environmental surveys to identify environmental and structural characteristics associated to severe leptospirosis incidence (using nearby households without severe cases as matched controls). Signs of rodent infestation in the peridomicile (burrows, fecal pellets, rodent run marks), bordering abandoned houses and non-plastered walls were associated to severe leptospirosis cases and were used to develop the predictive score. The score was able to identify the households with severe leptospirosis cases, and could be applied to define targeted control measures to reduce risk of infection.
