Rabies is an acute zoonosis with a mortality rate of almost 100% following the onset of symptoms. In China, the increased access to post-exposure prophylaxis has substantially reduced the number of human rabies deaths. However, rabies continues to circulate in many rural parts of the country, resulting in hundreds of rabid dog-related exposures and deaths each year. In 2015, member states of the United Nations adopted the goal of eliminating dog-mediated rabies by 2030. We conducted a Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination (SARE) assessment to outline progress and identify steps needed to achieve the elimination goal in China. The assessment involved representatives from the national and 12 selected provincial-level human and animal health sectors. The 12 provinces were purposefully selected based on the current dog-mediated rabies burden, an interest in participating, and the ability to complete the SARE assessment tool. This cross-sector–or One Health—approach was useful for improving coordination and planning. In particular, the assessment identified opportunities to improve collaboration between sectors on laboratory diagnostic capacity, implementing mass dog vaccination campaigns and conducting epidemiologic investigations on dog-mediated rabies exposures. An integrated One Health strategy should be strengthened in China as well as in other countries aiming to eliminate dog-mediated rabies.
