Who came first the worm or its egg? In the case of whipworm, we know it is the egg. The infective life cycle stage of the human whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is the primary stimulus for the immune system of the definitive host. Each infective whipworm egg carries the information needed to face the immune system of the host with a wide variety of proteins present in the shell, larvaeâ€™s surface, and the accompanying fluid that contains their excretions/secretions. We investigated the soluble proteins of the non-embryonated egg using an immunoproteomic approach and then selected the top five proteins using a series of bioinformatic analysis. We used these top five proteins to recognize potential targets for immunodiagnostics and immunomodulation while comparing them to known female worm proteins. We found that the proteins we selected were involved in lipid transport, energy and metabolism, and muscle and motility. One protein has unknown function.
