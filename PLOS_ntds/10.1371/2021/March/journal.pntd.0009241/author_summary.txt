Leishmaniasis is endemic in 98 countries, mainly the Middle Eastern countries including Iran. More than 20 causative species of leishmania are known resulting in diverse disease manifestations, ranging from cutaneous localized ulcers to visceral leishmaniasis that can be fatal. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually a localized and self-limited disease, however, chronic non-healing lesions are one of challenging issues. Cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iran is mainly cause by two species: L. major-which causes anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL)- and L.tropica-which causes zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL)-. Conventionally, meglumine antimoniate (MA) is administered as standard treatment for ACL. However, resistant forms of ACL to MA are increasingly recognized in endemic areas. Antileishmanial drug miltefosine is capable of immunomodulation and evokes host immune responses. Therapeutic effects of oral miltefosine has been previously confirmed for treatment of visceral and muco-cutaneous leishmanisis. In the current study, oral miltefosine (âˆ¼2.5 mg/kg daily) was administered by 27 patients (42 lesions) with MA resistant ACL lesions. After 6-month follow-up, 68% of patients were definitely cured. Therefore, oral miltefosine could be an effective treatment choice for MA resistant ACL.
