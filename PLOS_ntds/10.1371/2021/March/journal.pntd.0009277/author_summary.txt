Giardia duodenalis is a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Humans are mainly infected by the two different genetic subtypes, assemblage A and B. Molecular typing tools for epidemiological applications such as tracking transmission, attribution to a source and outbreak investigations have been developed and are highly desirable. However, to what degree the tetraploid genome with allelic sequence heterogeneity (ASH), and the frequent occurrence of mixed, assemblage A and B infections hamper performance is unclear. Here, we assessed the suitability of current genotyping protocols for deciphering the molecular epidemiology of G. duodenalis. Against a common reporting bias, we incorporated ASH in the analysis and we show that typing with resolution for epidemiological applications is possible for both, assemblage A and B isolates, but requires separate protocols. We also demonstrate how the high frequency of multiple infections overall impacts on typing results, which has immediate consequences for result interpretation in this field.
