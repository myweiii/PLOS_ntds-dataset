Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide and praziquantel is the only drug available for treatment. Although this drug is effective on all Schistosoma species on the adult stage of development, its activity is only partial against early infection stages. In addition, this has been the only drug in use for over 40 years, a situation that poses selective pressure towards resistant worms and highlights the urgent need of new drugs. The discovery and development of new drugs is often based on drug screenings, performed on worms collected from infected mammals. In line with animal welfare recommendations and aiming to increase throughput and reduce the assay costs, we validated a recently established in vitro method to grow juvenile S. mansoni as a drug screening tool. The in vitro established worms have similar gender distribution, size and drug sensitivity as worms collected from mice.
