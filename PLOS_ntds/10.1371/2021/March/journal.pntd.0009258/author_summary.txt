The licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine Dengvaxia is indicated for individuals with previous exposure to dengue. In subjects with no past dengue infection, vaccine trials showed low efficacy against some serotypes and increased risk of severe disease upon post-vaccination infection. The development of tetravalent dengue vaccines has been guided by neutralizing antibodies to each serotype as a measure of safe and effective immunity. However, the absolute level of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype has proven to be an unreliable correlate of protection. Recent studies suggest that a better correlate may be levels of antibodies to epitopes that are unique to each serotype and are independently stimulated by each vaccine component, rather than total quantity of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we mapped the antibody specificity induced by the Takeda tetravalent dengue vaccine TAK-003 in monkeys and humans with no prior immunity to dengue. The vaccine induces high levels of dengue serotype 2 specific neutralizing antibodies that map to known protective epitopes. In contrast, the dengue serotype 1, 3 and 4 specific responses are lower and predominantly consist of cross-reactive antibodies binding to antigenic regions conserved between serotypes. It remains to be determined whether these cross-reactive antibodies, most likely induced by the serotype 2 component, contribute to long-term protection after vaccination.
