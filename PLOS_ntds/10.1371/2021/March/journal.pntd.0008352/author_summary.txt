Leishmania parasites cause a broad spectrum of diseases with different pathological symptoms. During their life cycle the parasites shuffle between sand-fly vectors and mammalian hosts adapting to the changing environments via a stage specific program of gene expression that promotes their survival. Translation initiation plays a key role in control of gene expression and in Leishmania this is exemplified by the presence of multiple cap-binding complexes that interact with mRNAs. The parasites encode multiple paralogs of the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E and of its corresponding binding partner eIF4G forming complexes with different potential functions. The role of LeishIF4E2 remains elusive: it does not bind any of the LeishIF4G candidate subunits and associates with polysomes, a feature less common for canonical translation factors. Here we generated a hemizygous Leishmania mutant of the least studied cap-binding paralog, LeishIF4E2, by eliminating one of the two alleles using the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology. The mutant showed morphological defects with short and rounded cells, and a significant reduction in their flagellar length. Moreover, the LeishIF4E2(+/-) cells were impaired in their ability to infect cultured macrophages. The mutants showed differences in their proteome: upregulated proteins were related mainly to general metabolic processes including enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair and replication, signaling, and cellular motor activity. Downregulated proteins included flagellar rod and cytoskeletal proteins, as well as surface antigens involved in virulence. Overall, LeishIF4E2 does not behave like a general translation factor and its function remains elusive. It could affect translation of a particular set of transcripts, causing direct or downstream effects that do not affect global translation. Our results suggest that individual LeishIF4Es perform specific functions.
