Disease surveillance systems are an essential component of public health practice and are often considered the first line in averting epidemics for (re-)emerging diseases. Regular evaluation of surveillance systems ensures that they remain operating at maximum efficiency; systems that survey diseases of low incidence, such as those within elimination settings, should be simplified to reduce the reporting burden. A lack of guidance on how to optimise disease surveillance in an elimination setting may result in added expense, and/or the underreporting of disease. Here, we propose a framework methodology to determine systematically the optimal number and placement of surveillance sites for the surveillance of infectious diseases approaching elimination. By utilising estimates of geographic accessibility, through the construction of a resistance surface and a simulation approach, we identify that the number of operational diagnostic facilities for Gambian human African trypanosomiasis in north-western Uganda can be reduced by 70% with a minimal reduction in existing coverage, and identify the minimum number of facilities required to meet coverage targets. Our analysis can be used to inform the number and positioning of surveillance sites for diseases within an elimination setting. Passive surveillance becomes increasingly important as cases decline and active surveillance becomes less cost-effective; methods to evaluate how best to engage this passive surveillance capacity given facility capacity and geographic distribution are pertinent for several NTDs where diagnosis is complex. Not only is this a complicated research area for diseases approaching elimination, a well-designed surveillance system is essential for the detection of emerging diseases, with this work being topical in a climate where emerging pathogens are becoming more commonplace.
