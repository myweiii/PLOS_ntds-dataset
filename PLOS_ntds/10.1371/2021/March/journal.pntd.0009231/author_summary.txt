Salmonella and Shigella are responsible for gastrointestinal diseases and continue to remain a serious health hazard in South and South-East Asia and African countries, even more with the new emergence of multi drug resistances. Developed vaccines are either not commercialized (for Shigella) or cover only a limited number of serotypes (for Salmonella). There is thus a crucial need to develop cross-protective therapies. By targeting proteins SipD and IpaD belonging respectively to the injectisome of Salmonella and Shigella and necessary to their virulence, we have shown that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against a conserved common region of their apical part provides good cross-protection prophylactic efficacy. We have determined the region targeted by this mAb which could explain why it is conserved among Salmonella and Shigella bacteria.
