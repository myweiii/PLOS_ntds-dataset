Hunting and animal handling by children are considered important aspects of zoonosis occurrence. Children are implicated as the high-risk group for Lassa spillover. In a context where public health interventions pay little attention to the role of children in the occurrence of zoonotic infections, we conducted a qualitative study to explore factors that motivate children to hunt and eat rodents and to understand the practices that may constitute pathways of Lassa virus primary transmission in the endemic area of Faranah, Upper-Guinea. Moreover, we sought to extend the anthropological analysis of humanâ€“animal interactions to children who hunt, as researchers are gaining interest in exploring their hunting practices for the origins of zoonotic diseases. Our findings highlight the sociocultural, economic, and environmental dimensions of childhood and generate policies and interventions on the roles children can play in the primary transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans. These insights may aid in planning prevention programs for zoonotic infections in Lassa fever-endemic areas.
