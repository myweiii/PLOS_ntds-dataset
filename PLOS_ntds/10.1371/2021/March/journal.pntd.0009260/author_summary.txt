Soil-transmitted helminth infections impact 1.5 billion individuals, primarily in low- and middle- income countries, each year and contribute to malnutrition, anemia, and impaired neurocognitive development in children. However, these infections in pregnancy and their impact on offspring have been less studied. One previous study found associations between soil-transmitted helminth infection during pregnancy and impaired cognitive functioning in offspring one year after birth. The current study aimed to follow these children prospectively until six years in order to confirm whether these associations persisted or not. Infections during pregnancy were no longer associated with cognitive or motor functioning in children; however, infections were associated with impaired behavioral development. Animal-based models have hypothesized maternal inflammation and poor birth outcomes to be the mechanisms behind this relationship; however, our findings did not support these mechanisms. This is one of very few prospective cohort studies in Sub-Saharan Africa to investigate these associations, and more research is needed to corroborate results. Limitations include limited power and the possibility that results are due to chance from multiple statistical tests. Adequate and accessible prevention and treatment efforts in pregnancy and childhood should be provided to populations in low- and middle- income countries at high risk of infection.
