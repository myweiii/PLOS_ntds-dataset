Scrub typhus is caused by O. tsutsugamushi and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by hantavirus. Both diseases have similar manifestations and have their peak epidemic season in the fall, which makes their clinical differentiation difficult to be differentiated from each other clinically. In this study, we found that scrub typhus was indeed misdiagnosed as HFRS and co-infection of O. tsutsugamushi and hantaviruses might exist in China. Owing to different treatments of HFRS and scrub typhus, physicians need pay attention to differentiate them; identify co-infection of HFRS and scrub typhus; and consider administering antibiotics if antiviral treatment alone does not work.
