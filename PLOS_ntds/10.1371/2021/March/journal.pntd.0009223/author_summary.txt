Tegumentary leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by different Leishmania species and transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. The disease is distributed worldwide and it can present a cutaneous or mucocutaneous clinical form. The clinical outcomes of the disease depend on factors inherent to the parasite, the vector and the host. Bolivia has one of the highest incidences of the disease in South America, where the diagnosis is mainly done by parasitological techniques. The present study was conducted from September 2014 to November 2015 with 135 patients attending the leishmaniasis reference centre in Cochabamba (Bolivia). We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological and immunological characteristics of leishmaniasis patients to gain knowledge on tegumentary leishmaniasis and evaluate the suitability of the diagnostic methods used. In South America, Giemsa-stained smears and the culture of lesion aspirates remain the reference standards in diagnosis because of their high specificity, however the sensitivity varies over a wide range resulting in some loss of case detection. Until more accurate tools are implemented, all patients should be screened by both tests to minimize the risk of false negatives. Additionally, for better disease management, identification of biomarkers of susceptibility and disease progression would be desirable.
