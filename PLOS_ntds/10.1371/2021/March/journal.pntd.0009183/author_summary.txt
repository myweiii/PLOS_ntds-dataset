ZIKV has been reported to affect the innate immune responses in neural stem cells. We found that inhibiting the overactivated innate immune responses ameliorated Zika virus-induced neurogenesis reduction in human neural stem cells, which are the origin of the brain. This study suggests that coordinating the host innate immune responses in neural stem cells after ZIKV infection could be promising therapeutic approach to attenuate ZIKV-associated neuropathology.
