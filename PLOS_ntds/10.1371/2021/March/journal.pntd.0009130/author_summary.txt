Rabies is a virus that affects wild and domestic animals that can affect humans. Rabies infection is almost certainly fatal once clinical symptoms appear but can be prevented with timely post-exposure prophylaxis administration. Dogs are the primary source of rabies transmission; eliminating dog rabies reduces the risk of exposure in humans significantly. In Mexico, the national program of dog rabies vaccination has accomplished a progressive reduction of rabies episodes since 1990. The impact of these campaigns has not been systematically assessed, and that evaluation is critical to inform public health decisions. Using a mathematical model of rabies transmission, we estimated the costs and effectiveness of the dog rabies vaccination program in Mexico, compared to a scenario with no vaccination. Our results suggest that from 1990 through 2015, the national dog rabies vaccination program in Mexico prevented about 13,000 human rabies deaths, at an additional cost (MXN 2015) of $4,700 million (USD 300 million). We estimated an average cost of $360,000 (USD 23,000) per human rabies death averted, $6,500 (USD 410) per additional year-of-life, and $3,000 (USD 190) per dog rabies death averted. According to World Health Organization standards, the annual dog vaccination campaign in Mexico is highly cost-effective.
