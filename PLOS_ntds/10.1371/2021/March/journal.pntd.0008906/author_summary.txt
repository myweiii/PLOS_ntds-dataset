Chagasâ€™ disease (CD), caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in most of Latin America. Cardiac involvement is the most frequent in chronic CD. Heart failure (HF) is often a late manifestation of chronic CD and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early identification of patients with CD would be desirable as early intervention may help improve prognosis. Inflammatory biomarkers can play a vital role in early diagnosis, as inflammation mediated by cytokines plays an important role in pathogenesis and progression of CD.
This study investigated the possible role of 21 different inflammatory cytokines as biomarkers for discrimination and risk stratification of CD and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Plasma concentrations of various cytokines were significantly increased in CD and DCM patients with advanced HF, however, they were unable to show predictive or prognostic potency in CD. Using various cytokines together, analyses prognosticated fatal outcome in a large proportion of CD and DCM patients, but could still not discriminate CD from idiopathic DCM.
Our promising data encourages research on identifying further inflammatory biomarkers that could, in combination with the 21 measured in this study, be used as tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of CD.
