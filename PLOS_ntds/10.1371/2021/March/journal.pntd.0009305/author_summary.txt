Worldwide, rabies, a neglected tropical disease from ancient times is responsible for an estimated 59 000 human deaths a year. Between January 2017 and July 2018, an outbreak of human rabies in Murewa district Ward 30 prompted us to assess risk factors for contracting human rabies in the affected area. We reviewed cases of human rabies and dog bites through interviews and mapping of dog bite cases, vaccination status of dogs and jackal presence in the affected neighbourhood. We found a total of 263 dog bite cases including 4 suspected human rabies deaths within one year in a retrospective review of records in Ward 30 of Murewa district. Dog bites were responsible for all the rabies cases. Dog ownership, non-vaccination of dogs, residence in the high density cluster and poor knowledge about rabies were significantly associated with contracting rabies. We concluded that there was high proportion (74.86%) of low knowledge levels regarding rabies which could be a risk factor for rabies, dog ownership and non-vaccination of dogs are practices that may expose individuals to rabies, residence in the high density cluster is a risk factor for contracting rabies, unvaccinated dogs in Ward 30 are a potential risk factor for contracting rabies vis-à-vis the distribution of dog bites and spatial overlap of jackal presence, unvaccinated dogs and dog bite cases is a risk factor for rabies. We recommended intensified health education efforts on rabies by health workers in Ward 30, use of the One Health approach by various stakeholders in the district, intensified, regular mass dog vaccination campaigns by the Veterinary Department in light of jackals’ presence in the area and further studies to assess dog bite and rabies management.
