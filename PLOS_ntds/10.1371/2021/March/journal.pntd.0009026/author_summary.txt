Published analysis of genetic material from field-sampled tsetse (Glossina spp) has been used to suggest that, as tsetse population densities decrease, rates of dispersal increaseâ€“displaying negative density-dependent dispersal (NDDD), perhaps in all tsetse species. It is further suggested that tsetse control operations might, as a consequence of NDDD, unleash enhanced invasion of areas cleared of tsetse, prejudicing the long-term success of control campaigns. We demonstrate that NDDD in tsetse is an artefact consequent on multiple errors of analysis and interpretation. The most serious of these errors stems from a misunderstanding of the way in which traps sample tsetse, resulting in large errors in estimates of the areas covered by the traps, and occupied by the subpopulations being sampled. Our modelling studies show that these errors can produce the false signal of NDDD, even in situations where DID is assumed. Errors in census population estimates are made worse through failure to adjust for variations in trapping intensity, trap performance, and in capture probabilities between geographical situations, and between tsetse species. We reject the NDDD hypothesis and caution that the idea should not be allowed to influence policy on tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.
