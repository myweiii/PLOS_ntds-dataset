Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as Kala-Azar, is a neglected infectious disease of poverty affecting countries in the Indian Subcontinent and Eastern Africa. Existing treatments have concerning safety profiles and are far from ideal, with documented reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) following therapy. We did a systematic review of all published clinical trials in VL (1980â€“2019) to document SAEs following treatment administration reported in clinical literature and carried out a meta-analysis to quantify the incidence rate of mortality within 30 days of treatment initiation. We found that safety outcomes are poorly reported in published literature with substantial missing information regarding timing and frequency of the events. We also observed that mortality following treatment with antileishmanial drugs, as reported in the literature, is a rare event. There was substantial variability in mortality rates across geographical regions and patient sub-groups. Results from this review can provide benchmark estimates for comparing data from prospective trials and pharmacovigilance studies and support the need to assemble individual patient data (IPD) to conduct a robust IPD meta-analyses to overcome some of the underlying limitations.
