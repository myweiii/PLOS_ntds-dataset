Talaromycosis (Penicilliosis marneffei) is a neglected disease that causes an opportunistic systemic mycoses in AIDS and other immune-deficient patients living in Southeast Asia, China and the Indian subcontinent. Although laboratory culture remains a gold standard diagnostic method, it lacks sensitivity and is time-consuming, which results in delayed patientâ€™s treatment and needed care. In this study, we develop an immunochromatographic strip test (ICT) by utilizing a yeast phase specific monoclonal antibody 4D1 and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin for detection of T. marneffei antigens in clinical urine specimens. Our data showed that the assay exhibited high sensitivity (89.47%) and specificity (100%), with its result available within 30 minutes. In addition, this diagnostic assay is inexpensive, reproducible, and simple to perform. Therefore, the T. marneffei ICT should be considered for clinical application in the context of rapid and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test to reduce the burden of talaromycosis mortality in patients in low resource countries.
