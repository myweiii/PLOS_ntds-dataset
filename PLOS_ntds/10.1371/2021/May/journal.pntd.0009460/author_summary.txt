Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia is caused by Leishmania aethiopica, resulting in relatively severe lesions, which are hard to treat. Currently, most patients are treated with pentavalent antimonials, although effectiveness seems poor, with many patients requiring repeated treatment cycles before good response is seen. Miltefosine is the only oral drug available for leishmaniasis treatment and has a good safety profile compared to other treatment options. Although evidence on the use of miltefosine for CL in other regions looks promising, reports from Ethiopia are lacking.
We systematically recorded outcomes and side-effects for patients with CL lesions that required systemic treatment and who were treated with 28 days of miltefosine in a prospective study in two hospitals in Ethiopia. Side-effects were common but generally mild. Although all patients showed improvement after 28 days, overall, around half of patients were cured after six months, with relapse being common. Therefore, we propose to include miltefosine in future clinical trials, but to adapt the treatment regimen using combination therapy or treatment extension to improve overall outcomes and reduce relapse.
