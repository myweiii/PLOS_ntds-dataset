Genotyping of Francisella tularensis has become a routine practice in epidemiology. Despite rapidly accumulating knowledge, the phylogeography of the pathogen is still poorly understood and discussions about geographic and temporal origins continue. One important reason is the poor characterization of the pathogen in many tularemia-endemic countries. This article describes the genetic diversity of Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica in Kazakhstan using tandem repeat polymorphisms as well as whole genome sequencing. Thirty-nine strains were analyzed and two lineages were identified, namely B.4 and B.12. The study demonstrates a wider distribution of genotype B.4 in Asia, and identified a more basal branching point in this subclade. The obtained data support the Asian origin hypothesis for F. tularensis. The finding of identical genotypes in strains separated in time by decades and a thousand-kilometers geographic distance, confirms the ability of the bacteria for long-term preservation and fast long distances spread. The isolation of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from the bird species Isabellina wheatear allows speculating about a major contribution of birds to the phylogeography of the pathogen. A genotyping protocol was developed utilizing seven polymorphic tandem repeats, two of which were identified within the framework of this work. The in vitro and in silico results are identical when using sequencing reads of 300 base-pairs or more.
