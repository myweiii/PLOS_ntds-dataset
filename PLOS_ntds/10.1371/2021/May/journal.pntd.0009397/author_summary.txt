The preeminent vector of arboviruses, Aedes aegypti, is distributed globally and capable of transmitting deadly pathogens to over half the world’s population. While most studies focus on areas where Ae. aegypti and human-amplified urban arboviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses are locally established, our study explores the margins of endemicity where Aedes aegypti can be found, but arboviral illness is rare. These areas where we find environmental suitability for the vector but an absence of established arboviral transmission we term ‘aegyptism without arbovirus’. This builds on the long-held observation of ‘anophelism without malaria’ in which some regions having Plasmodium-competent Anopheles spp. mosquitoes but not the associated human malaria. This study uses previously published maps to reveal locations with higher suitability of Ae. aegypti and low suitability of dengue. Additionally, we analyzed the resulting map of deviations between Ae. aegypti and dengue and found significant associations with human population density, infant mortality rate, temperature, and precipitation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize places around the world that exhibit ‘aegyptism without arbovirus’ which is an important first step in our ongoing battle with human-amplified urban arboviruses.
