Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an infection caused by a tick-borne virus endemic to a large geographic area, that is asymptomatic in animals but presents a significant health risk to humans with no effective vaccine. Serological surveys were carried out in rural populations and animals shortly after the first reported case in South Africa in 1981, but little is known about the current seroprevalence of CCHFV in humans and animals, and tick infection rates. We conducted a survey in 2017â€“18 to obtain recent estimates and examined exposure factors in an area of South Africa where cases are known to occur. We observed a high seroprevalence in cattle of 74.2%. Farm and wildlife workers at risk of occupational exposure to CCHFV had a seroprevalence of 3.9%, which was higher than previously reported. No evidence of CCHFV infection was found in abattoir workers or veterinary professionals in that area. CCHFV RNA was detected in both species of Hyalomma ticks but with a higher prevalence (1.6%) in H. truncatum. This study suggests that CCHFV is widespread in South Africa, that exposure to CCHFV is more common than generally believed in animal-related occupations and that increased public health awareness of risk factors associated with CCHFV infection are required to reduce morbidity and mortality from CCHF.
