Dengue virus spreads through mosquitoes in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, including Brazil. Each year, dengue virus causes seasonal outbreaks that vary in magnitude and timing across the country. This variation makes tailoring preparation efforts for fine spatio-temporal scales challenging. In this study, we described four properties of historical dengue time series at the mesoregion level, the Brazilian subdivision below state, and examined how they varied across the country. We found that the duration and timing of seasonal outbreaks are largely driven by climate factors, while relational properties, i.e., the similarity in outbreak timing and magnitude between two mesoregions, are explained by a mix of mobility patterns and climate similarities. Surprisingly, we found that remote sensing derived products and movement inferred through Twitter were adequate proxies for climate and mobility patterns respectively. Knowledge of how dengue outbreaks differ across the country and the factors that may influence specific outbreak properties may be important for improving efforts to build forecasting and prediction models.
