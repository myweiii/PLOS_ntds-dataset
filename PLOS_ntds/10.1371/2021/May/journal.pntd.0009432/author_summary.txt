Schistosomiasis continues to be a major public health problem, mainly in developing countries. Although there have been some advances in finding new drugs, praziquantel is still the drug of choice. Certainly, one of the most important advances in the search for new treatments was the ability to in vitro transform cercariae and to grow schistosomula in culture. To reduce animal use in future drug discovery efforts (3Rs), we optimized a previously established reliable and robust in vitro cell-free culture system for the generation of liver-stage worms that we applied to the screening of a compound library stemming from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection.
