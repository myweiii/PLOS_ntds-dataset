    "Background": "The municipality of Caratinga is an important endemic area for American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) and no epidemiological studies were performed during the past two decades. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological situation and the geographical distribution of ATL cases in the municipality of Caratinga from 2007 to 2018 using geographic information systems (GIS). Also, we evaluated the impact of several demographic parameters in ATL distribution and the sand flies incriminated in its transmission.",
    "Methods": "All demographic information (gender, age, educational level, clinical form, diagnostic criteria and case evolution) used in this study was retrieved from the public health archives and confirmed in the State Health Services databases. All cases were analyzed using GIS software based on ATL distribution. Also, non-systematic sand fly collections and molecular detection of Leishmania were performed in the hotspots.",
    "Results and conclusions": "During the period, ATL cases continued and increased especially in the past years (2016–2018). Hotspots included urban Caratinga areas and the districts of Patrocínio de Caratinga and Sapucaia. The species Nyssomyia whitmani, Nyssomyia intermedia, Migonemyia migonei and Evandromyia cortelezzii complex were captured. However, ITS1-PCR did not detect Leishmania DNA in those insects. Based on our analyses, urbanization of ATL in Caratinga has occurred in the past years. Due to the increase in the number of cases and vectors presence, it is recommended that health authorities focus on control measures in the most affected areas (Patrocínio of Caratinga and Sapucaia districts and urban Caratinga)."
