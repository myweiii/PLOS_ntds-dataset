Understanding how species maintain their genetic integrity is a central question in evolutionary biology. While isolation mechanisms are well documented in free-living organisms, it is currently not the case for parasite species. Yet, occurrence of parasite hybrids is a critical global health concern since these hybrids are expected to be more harmful than parental species. We addressed the question of reproductive isolation mechanisms in parasitic species by conducting an integrative experimental study (from mate choice to gene expression) on two schistosome species (Schistosoma haematobium and S. bovis) that parasitize human and cattle, respectively. Importantly, their hybrid progeny has been involved in recent outbreaks, including outbreaks outside of endemic areas. We showed that rather than having a homo-specific mate choice, S. haematobium and S. bovis mate randomly. Also, male and female worms only express a few genes differentially when involved in a hetero-specific pair compared to a homo-specific pair. We consequently suggest that these two schistosome species lack strong reproduction isolation mechanisms, except those imposed by specificity to the final host species. Our results raise the concern that in the absence of post-zygotic barriers in sympatric zones hybridization might be more common than previously thought if these two species are able to encounter each other.
