SARS-CoV-2 continues to threaten global health, and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is an urgent priority to halt COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we developed DNA vaccines containing the spike gene from SARS-CoV-2 and delivered via electroporation. We observed that the DNA vaccine induced a long-lasting humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, and the elicited serum antibodies efficiently blocked the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to its entry receptor (ACE2). Importantly, the DNA vaccine induced strong Th1-biased immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which could provide protective effect with low side effects. Finally, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine conferred protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. Our findings suggested that DNA vaccination could be a useful approach for controlling COVID-19 pandemic in near future.
