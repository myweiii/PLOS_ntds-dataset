Interruption of vector-borne T. cruzi transmission is still an unmet goal through the Americas. We launched a long-term intervention program with this goal in rural Pampa del Indio, a resource-limited hyperendemic municipality inhabited by Creole and indigenous (Qom) families in the Argentine Chaco region. The program included blanket insecticide spraying at the outset, sustained vector surveillance including focal insecticide spraying, and community mobilization. Ten years after program onset, we assessed the impacts of interventions on domestic transmission to humans and dogs, taken as sentinel animals. We found that the frequency of human or canine cases decreased dramatically relative to baseline values. No human incident case was recorded. The only infected child born after program onset was attributed to congenital (i.e., vertical) transmission. The few canine cases detected were most likely related to transient domestic infestations and other transmission routes. These results, combined with the quasi-elimination of T. infestans, support that vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans had been stopped and this status sustained after interventions.
