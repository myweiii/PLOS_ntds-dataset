STH infections predominately affect resource-poor communities and negatively impact on child and maternal health. Diagnostics play a critical role in guiding and informing existing STH control programs and the implementation and evaluation of intervention strategies. The KK technique is most commonly used as per WHO guidelines and is the basis for determining quantitative thresholds for low, moderate and heavy infections. More recently, FF and laboratory-based quantitative PCR techniques have provided alternative options of diagnosing STH infections. A number of studies correlating the relative sensitivity, diagnostic agreement, and egg enumeration of these techniques by comparing field-generated diagnostic data have attempted to correlate quantitative outputs to those defined by the WHO, with little resolution. Moreover, as large-scale deworming programs levels scale up, the necessity to apply techniques that can precisely detect light infections is of outmost importance to establish preventive chemotherapy end-points using more accurate means. In this study we compared the LOD and ERR of seeded non-infected human faecal samples with Ascaris, Trichuris and Necator spp. eggs using KK, FF and qPCR. When compared to copro-microscopy methods, qPCR showed the highest sensitivity for the detection of light-intensity infections and was more accurate in enumerating the original number of eggs per gram of seeded faeces. In addition to this, the results indicated that the diagnostic performance of both KK and FF (using solution at a SpGr of 1.30) were equally efficient and should be considered with their diagnostic limitations in mind, when aiming to monitor STH infections in low-transmission settings.
