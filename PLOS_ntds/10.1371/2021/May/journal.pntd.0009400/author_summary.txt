According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, about 18 HFRS cases have been reported over the past decade on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea (ROK). Currently, no report for the etiological agent associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) on Jeju Island is available. We report the nearly whole-genome sequences and have characterized a novel HTNV genotype carried by the Jeju striped field mice (Apodemus chejuensis) collected from Jeju Island. The phylogenetic analysis of HTNV revealed well-supported phylogeographic clusters, showing a high genetic divergence by the distribution of rodent reservoir hosts. To our knowledge, this study is the first provisional report that suggests molecular evidence of orthohantavirus outbreaks associated with hantaviral disease on Jeju Island. Although our observations are provisional, the novel genotype of HTNV harbored by A. chejuensis may be a potential etiological agent of HFRS in southern ROK. This study provides important insights into the male-predominance prevalence, genetic diversity, and molecular evolutionary dynamics of orthohantaviruses circulating in the ROK.
