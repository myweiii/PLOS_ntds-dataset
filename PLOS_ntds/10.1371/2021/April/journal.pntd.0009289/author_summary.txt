Chikungunya is a disease caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. It stands out because it can produce chronic cases and disabling forms. This survey was conducted in a large city in Brazil, involving 1,981 people living in different living conditions/LC, distributed in 30 urban areas. Interviews and blood collection were performed to know the seroprevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The global seroprevalence was 22.1%, ranged from 2.0 to 70.5%. The areas where the highest and lowest seroprevalence were of low LC, but population density was different among them, which was related to seroprevalence. The mosquito index was not associated with the seroprevalence. Our results showed that lower seroprevalence than another survey conducted in the epicentre of the epidemic of this same city. So, a considerable proportion of the population of Feira de Santana is susceptible to the CHIKV. Possibly the virus will continue to circulate and manifest itself as endemic or epidemic, as long as LC remain favourable to the reproduction of the transmitting vector of CHIKV.
