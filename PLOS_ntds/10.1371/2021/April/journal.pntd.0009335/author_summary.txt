Mutations frequently occur in SARS-CoV-2 and the mutant variants, ORF1ab/RdRp 4715L and S protein 614G have been strongly linked to increased infectivity and fatality in other countries. Although increased number of cases in Africa correlated positively with increased deaths, such deaths did not correlate positively with the duo variants, ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G in the early part of the outbreak. This could possibly be due to the younger aged population, lower comorbidity and divergent genetic factors.
