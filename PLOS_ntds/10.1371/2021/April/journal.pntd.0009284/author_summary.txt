African trypanosome parasites responsible for human and animal trypanosomiasis, live extracellularly in their mammalian host and exploit environmental information to regulate their virulence and transmissibility. Morphological slender forms that proliferate in the mammalian host transform into the non-proliferative stumpy forms by receiving an extracellular signal generated by the accumulating parasites. Parasites secrete peptidases into the host that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we evaluated the capacity to generate stumpy forms in vitro by including a basement membrane extract into the culture medium. We show that cells exposed to ECM proteins are able to differentiate efficiently into cell-cycle arrested stumpy forms and that the generated differentiation signal depends on the stumpy induction signalling pathway. This method can be used to generate stumpy forms in vitro, these being suitable for experimental analysis, thereby reducing the use of mice.
