An estimated eight million individuals worldwide are chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (CD). Of these infected individuals, 30% will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CD endemic regions for which there is currently no effective drug or vaccine. The molecular mechanisms underlying CCC pathogenesis, progression and severity are complex, multi-factorial and not completely understood. Earlier, it was demonstrated that T. cruzi persists in adipose tissue, alters adipocyte physiology, and causes loss of body fat mass in T. cruzi infected mice with CCC. In this study, the authors examined the role of visceral fat pad (adipose tissue) in regulating the pathogenic signalling in the development and progression of CCC using a fat mass modulatable transgenic mouse CD model. Loss of fat cells increased cardiac lipid load and deregulated cardiac lipid metabolism leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and severe CCC. In addition, loss of fat cells increased cardiac parasite load during acute infection and altered immune signalling in the hearts of infected mice during chronic infection. These discoveries underscore the importance of adipose tissue in the development of CCC.
