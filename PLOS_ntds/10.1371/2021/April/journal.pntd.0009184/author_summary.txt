Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), remains an overlooked and neglected disease in the management of febrile patients in Senegal. The results of this study showed a high prevalence of rodent burrows infested with O. sonrai ticks (the vectors of the disease) inside human dwellings, with a common Borrelia infection affecting populations within the community in the Niakhar district of the Fatick region of Senegal. Borrelia infection was detected in several rodents belonging to two species of small mammals. In febrile patients studied in the area, all age groups were infected. TBRF cases were observed in all seasons. In the similar context to that of malaria pre-elimination observed in Dielmo and Ndiop villages, TBRF appears to be the predominant cause of morbidity among febrile patients. By extension, we believe this may be the same in many other endemic regions of the country which have not yet been clinically investigated. TBRF cases are probably undiagnosed in those endemic areas and are likely to be poorly managed in health posts and health centres.
