Sleeping sickness or human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a disease caused by a parasite, which is transferred to humans by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. There are two disease stages: the first stage is the blood-based stage of the disease and the second stage affects the brain. It is fatal if left untreated. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes the brain stage difficult to treat because it prevents 99% of all drugs from entering the brain from the blood. Those anti-HAT drugs that do enter the brain are toxic and have serious side effects. Pentamidine is a less toxic blood stage drug, which our research has shown has a limited ability to cross the BBB due to its removal by proteins called transporters. The objective of this study was to use Pluronic to improve pentamidine delivery to target sites, whilst reducing its side effects. Pluronic is a polymer, which can assemble into micelles and encapsulate the drug. Thus, prolonging its circulation time and protecting it. Our study indicated that the selected Pluronics did not increase the brain delivery of pentamidine. However. Pluronic-pentamidine formulations were identified that harboured trypanocidal activity and did not increase safety concerns compared to unformulated pentamidine.
