    "Background": "In 2014, a first outbreak of chikungunya hit the Caribbean area where chikungunya virus (CHIKV) had never circulated before.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure the seroprevalence of CHIKV immediately after the end of the 2014 outbreak in HIV-infected people followed up in two clinical cohorts at the University hospitals of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Study patients were identified during the first months of 2015 and randomly selected to match the age and sex distribution of the general population in the two islands. They were invited to complete a survey that explored the symptoms consistent with chikungunya they could have developed during 2014 and to have a blood sample drawn for CHIKV serology.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study showed that the seroprevalence of CHIKV infection was 61% after the 2014 outbreak, with one third of asymptomatic infections.",
    "Trial registration": "ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 02553369."
