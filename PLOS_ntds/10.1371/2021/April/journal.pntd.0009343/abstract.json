    "Background": "To eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, countries must achieve a district-level prevalence of trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF) <5% in children ages 1–9 years. Re-emergence of TF could trigger additional rounds of mass drug/antibiotic administration (MDA), so accurate tools for use in surveys assessing trachoma prevalence are essential.",
    "Methodology & principal findings": "We surveyed 2401 children ages 1–9 years from 50 villages in Kongwa, Tanzania, 2 years post-MDA and 1.5 years after an impact survey found TF <5% in the same villages. Our survey included multiple tools: clinical determination of TF, Cepheid testing for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, and testing for anti-pgp3 antibodies via multiplex bead array. Photographs of the upper tarsal conjunctiva were taken in a subset of children to corroborate the field grades.",
    "Conclusions & significance": "Field TF prevalence, supported by photographic review and infection data, suggested re-emergence of trachoma in Kongwa. Moreover, seropositivity in the children born after cessation of MDA indicated exposure to C. trachomatis despite a previous survey finding of TF <5%. Examining seropositivity in specific age groups expected to have limited exposure to C. trachomatis can be used to detect re-emergence."
