The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the Kato-Katz diagnostic method, i.e., counting eggs in a thick-smear of stool using light microscopy, for estimation of Schistosoma mansoni infection prevalence. While the diagnostic specificity of Kato-Katz is very high, the sensitivity varies strongly with infection intensity and the number of samples collected and thick smears per sample tested. Therefore, the performance of Kato-Katz in a population depends on the distribution of infections in the population and individual-level data are needed to determine the ‘true’ prevalence of infection. However, modeling capacity to determine ‘true’ prevalence from individual-level data is often not available to program managers. In this study, we therefore provide simple equations to estimate the ‘true’ prevalence and associated uncertainty from observed prevalence and arithmetic or geometric mean infection intensity for a variety of common sampling schemes. We find that by including information about the mean infection intensity in a population the estimation of ‘true’ prevalence can be improved compared to assuming a constant value for the diagnostic sensitivity and supply parameters and functions to calculate the ‘true’ prevalence of infection.
