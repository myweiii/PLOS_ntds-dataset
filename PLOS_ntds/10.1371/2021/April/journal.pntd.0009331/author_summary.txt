Naja atra bites induce extensive wound necrotizing soft tissue infections in a substantial proportion of patients. Empiric antibiotic administration in snakebite patients is a common practice, but clinical reports indicate that this treatment was ineffective in preventing secondary infection given that the microbiota of the infected wound and oropharynx of the culprit snake were not properly established. In this study, only 9 species were detected in cobra bites using a conventional microbial culture method and the VITEK 2 system, whereas 18 species were detected in the cobra oropharynx using microbial culture-based 16S Sanger sequencing. Among these, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were identified as common bacteria. Compared to microbial culture-based 16S Sanger sequencing, NGS-based 16S metagenomic sequencing detected more than 286 bacterial species. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Proteus penneri only appeared with 16S metagenomic sequencing. These results suggest that NGS-based 16S metagenomic sequencing is a better tool for uncovering the bacterial microbiota of the N. atra oropharynx, which may help in developing a proper therapeutic strategy for patients with N. atra bites.
