Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are species of mosquitoes responsible for the transmission of several arboviruses that cause infections worldwide. However, there are still no effective and safe vaccines or medications to prevent or treat arboviruses transmitted by these vectors, except for yellow fever. Moreover, current methodologies for monitoring and controlling A. aegypti and A. albopictus are not fully effective, as evidenced by the increasing cases of the arbovirus transmitted by these mosquitoes or have incompatible costs with the socioeconomic conditions of a large number of people. Thus, the traps tested in this study can be used as more effective and economical tools for monitoring A. aegypti and A. albopictus, since they are made with low cost material and they showed high efficiency in the capture of eggs, evidenced by the high values of ovitraps positive index and eggs density index, besides that one of the models captured Aedes spp. adults in both regions where they were tested. Therefore, the traps have potential for reducing Aedes spp. eggs and adults in the environment and sensibility for determining the local infestation index, which can be reconciled with official government strategies for more accurate vector monitoring actions.
