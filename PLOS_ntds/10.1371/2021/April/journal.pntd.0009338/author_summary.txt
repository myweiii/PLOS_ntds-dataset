Approximately 1 in 5 people in India are infected with soil transmitted helminths (STH), leading to anaemia and malnutrition. To tackle this large burden of infection, the government of India launched one of the worldâ€™s largest school-based deworming programs in 2015 aiming to deworm all pre-school and school-aged children between 1 to 19 years of age twice yearly on the National Deworming Days. Deworming programs, including those in India, are focused on pre-school aged children, school aged children and women of reproductive age group. However, prevailing environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including poor sanitation, can contribute to high rates of reinfection from untreated adults and children. The DeWorm3 Project is a cluster-randomised trial evaluating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission with community wide deworming of all individuals aged one to 99 years of age or older. As part of the study, we conducted a parasitological survey in the Deworm3 trial site in rural Tamil Nadu. Here we present the factors associated with STH infection and burden in these communities.
