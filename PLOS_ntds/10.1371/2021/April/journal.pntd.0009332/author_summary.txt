Neglected tropical diseases resulting in lower limb lymphoedema (localized swelling by an accumulation of lymph) such as podoconiosis, lymphatic filariasis (LF) and leprosy are common in Ethiopia. Knowledge of the care management of lymphoedema of these neglected diseases within health care systems is often inadequate. Similarly, the mental distress and illness that commonly accompanies lymphoedema often go untreated. This study developed an integrated holistic care package for people with lymphoedema. The care package involves physical, mental and psychosocial interventions for patients with podoconiosis, LF and leprosy for use at the health care administration, health facility and community level in Ethiopia. The findings of this study inform plans for implementation of integrated foot care and psychosocial support interventions across Ethiopia and beyond.
