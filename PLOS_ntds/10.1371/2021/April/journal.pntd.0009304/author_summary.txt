G. duodenalis, one of the most common cause of diarrheal diseases, is widely existed in the contaminated water and threatening the public health especially in developing countries. Along with the increasing resistance to anti-G. duodenalis drugs occurs, new targets against giardiasis are of urgently needed. The innate immune system is the first defense line of organism to resist multiple pathogens invasion through recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), termed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of cell membrane and nucleotide oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLRs) inside immune cells. Recently, extracellular vesicles have emerged as a ubiquitous mechanism participating in cells communications. In this study, EVs secreted by extracellular protozoan G. duodenalis were obtained and displayed typical cup-shaped structure with 150 nm in diameter. Moreover, GEVs could enter into primary mouse peritoneal macrophages and regulate host cell innate immunity by up-regulation of various inflammatory cytokines expression. Furthermore, TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways involved in this process. This study demonstrated that GEVs could be internalized into primary mouse peritoneal macrophages, regulate host cell innate immunity via TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways, and may provide new targets against giardiasis.
