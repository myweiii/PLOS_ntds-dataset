Scrub typhus, a systemic infection caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi is manifested by fever and multiple organ involvement with significant mortality if untreated. O. tsutsugamushi infects endothelial cells triggering inflammatory responses in endothelial and monocyte-derived macrophages. The wingless (Wnt) pathways are important regulators of the interaction between microbes and the immune system promoting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Wnt signaling is regulated by multiple extracellular secreted proteins that are readily measurable and may reflect activity in the Wnt pathways. We measured plasma levels of the secreted Wnt modulators in patients with scrub typhus and infectious controls and correlated them with markers of inflammation and immune activation. We also evaluated the regulation of Wnt pathways by O. tsutsugamushi in vitro in monocytes and ex vivo in mononuclear cells isolated from patients in microarray experiments available in public repositories. Our study suggests a pathogenic role for dysregulated Wnt signaling during acute O. tsutsugamushi infection.
