This study is first to explore the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SFTS human-to-human transmission. We found SFTS human-to-human transmission had obvious characteristic temporal and spatial distinction, which mainly occurred among elder people in May, June and October in the central and eastern China. The secondary cases developed milder clinical manifestation and better outcome than the index cases. The incubation period was 10.0 days (IQR:8.0–12.0). The risk of SFTS human-to-human transmission continues to be low, with the secondary attack rate (SAR) among humans was 1.72%-55.00% and basic reproductive number (R0) to be 0.13 (95%CI:0.11–0.16). Being blood relatives of the index case, direct blood/bloody secretion contact and bloody droplet contact had more risk of acquiring infection.
