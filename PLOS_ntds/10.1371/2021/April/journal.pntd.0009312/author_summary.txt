The dengue virus (DENV) has rapidly spread out in tropical and sub-tropical regions. To measure the level of past DENV infections in the older population, we conducted a post-outbreak serosurvey in 2016 among a total of 4,101 older and elderly adults in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities in southern Taiwan. Our results showed district- and city-level differences in the overall seroprevalence of anti-DENV IgG antibody, increased seroprevalence with age, heterogeneous distributions of DENV serotypes, and similar percentages of secondary DENV infection in both metropolises, closely matching past histories of dengue outbreaks. This study demonstrates the importance of monitoring individualâ€™s antibody status among the older and elderly population and highlights the need to investigate the safety and efficacy of dengue vaccination in these populations in the future.
