Zoonotic tuberculosis (zTB) is a form of tuberculosis derived mainly from cattle (bovine tuberculosis, bTB) via direct or indirect contact (inhalation), and/or consumption of contaminated animal products or water (ingestion). We evaluated the zTB knowledge and practices among cattle handlers in selected districts of Bangladesh via a questionnaire. It was observed that handlers are moderately aware of tuberculosis as an important public health burden in Bangladesh. However, they have inadequate knowledge on the transmission of zTB from humans and animals. Most of the cattle handlers do not use personal protective equipment. Cattle handlers often smoke, drink or eat whilst working with cattle and some even share the same premise with animals. Education, duration of cattle rearing and cattle handlers’ monthly income significantly influenced cattle handlers’ zTB knowledge and practices. Based on results of this study we recommend implementation of a One Health platform in order to enable health education programs targeting at risk farmers.
