Because dogs are the main transmitter of rabies to humans, controlling rabies in dogs is essential for preventing rabies in humans. Canine vaccination is well-known as the most effective measure for controlling rabies in dogs. Understanding the demographics and dynamics of dog populations is important when designing efficient canine vaccination strategies. Furthermore, protective herd immunity in the total dog population should be attained through the vaccination of owned dogs since ownerless dogs are not usually covered in such campaigns. This study investigated domestic dog demographics and estimated the number of ownerless dogs to finally estimate the vaccination coverage among the overall dog population achievable through a mass vaccination campaign in a rural setting in Mazabuka District, Zambia. The target domestic dog population was young, and population growth was estimated at 15% annually based on the cross-sectional survey. The vaccination coverage attained by providing free canine mass vaccination campaigns was eventually estimated as 54.8â€“76.2% in the overall dog population, coupled with the estimate that the ownerless dog population was quite small. Our findings emphasize the necessity of conducting annual canine mass vaccinations, including puppies, that target 70% coverage in the dog population to maintain protective herd immunity.
