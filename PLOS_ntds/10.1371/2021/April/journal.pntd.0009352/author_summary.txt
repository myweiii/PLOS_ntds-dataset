Phlebotomine sand flies are tiny insects of the family Psychodidae in the order Diptera, and female sand flies suck blood for egg production. Approximately 1,020 sand fly species have been recorded in the world, of which about 550 species are in the New World. Only a part of them are associated with medically important infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis, and importantly, each vector species transmits specific species of Leishmania. Since the infecting Leishmania species is the major determinant of the clinical outcome and its endemicity is largely dependent on the prevalence of the vector species, the identification of circulating sand flies and vector species, which determine transmissible parasite species, is important to predict the risk and expansion of the disease in endemic and surrounding areas. However, the vector species involved in disease transmission remains unidentified in most endemic areas because the infection rate in sand fly populations is very low. In the present study, sand flies were investigated in the Department of Amazonas in the Eastern Andes of northern Peru, in which cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana is endemic, to clarify the transmission mechanism of leishmaniasis in these areas. In addition, genetic analyses of circulating sand flies were performed to elucidate the characteristics of sand flies in these areas.
