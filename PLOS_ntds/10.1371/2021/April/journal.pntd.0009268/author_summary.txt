Echinococcosis is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by the larval form of Echinococcus spp. tapeworms. It is prevalent in parts of China although unevenly distributed. The dog is one of the terminal hosts of Echinococcus spp., which is key in controlling the epidemic of canine echinococcosis. We constructed the first meta-analysis to assess the epidemic of Echinococcus in dogs in China over the past 10 years, and analyzed potential risk factors. We analyzed 108 studies of Echinococcus in dogs in China and evaluated the infection status and potential risk factors. The influential factors included province, geographical and climatic factors, publication year, sampling district category, detection methods, dog classification, medication, and the quality level of included studies. These important findings explain the differences in prevalence of canine echinococcosis in parts of China, and help to prevent the disease and reduce the risk to the public.
