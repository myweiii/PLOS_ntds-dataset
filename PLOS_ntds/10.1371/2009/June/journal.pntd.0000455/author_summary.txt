Cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases are important regulators of cyclic nucleotide signalling in eukaryotes. In many organisms, including humans and trypanosomes, some of these enzymes contain specific domains (GAF domains) that bind cyclic nucleotides, and that are involved in the regulation of the catalytic domain. In the parasitic protozoon that causes human sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei, two closely related phosphodiesterases each contain two such GAF domains, GAF-A and GAF-B. Their genes are tandemly located on chromosome 9, spaced by only a few thousand nucleotides. We here show that a gene conversion event has exchanged the region that codes for the GAF-A domain of the downstream gene by the closely similar corresponding sequence of the upstream gene. This domain exchange has no effect on intracellular localization of the two enzymes. The gene conversion event has occurred in one particular strain of trypanosomes (Lister427) and is found in all its derivatives, but not in any other strain or isolate. The presence or absence of this gene conversion represents a useful analytical marker for the stringent discrimination of Lister427 derivatives from other trypanosome strains.
