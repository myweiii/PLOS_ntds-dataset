    "Background": "Approximately 200 million people worldwide harbour parasitic flatworm infections that cause schistosomiasis. A single drug\u2014praziquantel (PZQ)\u2014has served as the mainstay pharmacotherapy for schistosome infections since the 1980s. However, the relevant in vivo target(s) of praziquantel remain undefined.",
    "Methods and Findings": "Here, we provide fresh perspective on the molecular basis of praziquantel efficacy in vivo consequent to the discovery of a remarkable action of PZQ on regeneration in a species of free-living flatworm (Dugesia japonica). Specifically, PZQ caused a robust (100% penetrance) and complete duplication of the entire anterior-posterior axis during flatworm regeneration to yield two-headed organisms with duplicated, integrated central nervous and organ systems. Exploiting this phenotype as a readout for proteins impacting praziquantel efficacy, we demonstrate that PZQ-evoked bipolarity was selectively ablated by in vivo RNAi of voltage-operated calcium channel (VOCC) \u03b2 subunits, but not by knockdown of a VOCC \u03b1 subunit. At higher doses of PZQ, knockdown of VOCC \u03b2 subunits also conferred resistance to PZQ in lethality assays.",
    "Conclusions": "This study identifies a new biological activity of the antischistosomal drug praziquantel on regenerative polarity in a species of free-living flatworm. Ablation of the bipolar regenerative phenotype evoked by PZQ via in vivo RNAi of VOCC \u03b2 subunits provides the first genetic evidence implicating a molecular target crucial for in vivo PZQ activity and supports the \u2018VOCC hypothesis\u2019 of PZQ efficacy. Further, in terms of regenerative biology and Ca2+ signaling, these data highlight a novel role for voltage-operated Ca2+ entry in regulating in vivo stem cell differentiation and regenerative patterning."
