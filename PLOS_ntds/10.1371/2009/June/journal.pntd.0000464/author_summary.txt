Praziquantel is the major drug used to treat people infected with parasitic worms that cause the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Despite being in widespread clinical use, it is surprising that scientists have not identified how praziquantel works to kill pathogenic schistosomes. This lack of pathobiological insight is a major roadblock to the directed design of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis, as the relevant in vivo target molecule/pathway of praziquantel remains undefined. In this report, we have discovered a new biological activity of praziquantel that enables us to bring a unique chemical genetic perspective to the problem of identifying molecules needed for in vivo praziquantel efficacy. Specifically, we show that praziquantel miscues regenerative patterning in a species of free-living flatworm to yield bipolar (two-headed) organisms. By using this phenotype to screen for molecules underpinning this activity, we provide in vivo support for the ‘Ca2+ channel hypothesis’ of PZQ efficacy, and show that manipulation of specific subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels prevent this effect, and lessen praziquantel-mediated toxicity. These data provide further impetus to studying the role of these proteins in schistosome pharmacotherapy.
