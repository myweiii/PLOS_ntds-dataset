Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a human disease. Like other enteric infections, the lack of animal models enhances the difficulty of studying the development of amoebiasis. To date, no experimental model has been developed that reproduces the invasive intestinal amoebic lesions seen in human colon. We present the first study that examines, using human colon explants, the early steps of the human colonic barrier invasion by E. histolytica. With this ex vivo integrative model we have investigated both parasite behaviour and the human tissue response. Remarkably, in this model E. histolytica was able to cross and destroy the intestinal barrier evoking a tissue inflammatory response, while E. dispar, a non-pathogenic species, was unable to penetrate nor induce tissue responses. Furthermore, we have explored the role of three virulence factors during the invasive process, using gene-silenced E. histolytica trophozoites, particularly the kinetics of invasion, tissue destruction and induction of an early inflammatory responses. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that their role is highlighted in a complex human system. Our study provides new insights in the molecular mechanisms involved in the early steps of human colon invasion by E. histolytica.
