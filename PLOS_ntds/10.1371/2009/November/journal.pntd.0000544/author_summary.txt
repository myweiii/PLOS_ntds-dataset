River blindness, or onchocerciasis, is caused by a parasitic worm (Onchocerca volvulus) that is transmitted by blood-feeding blackflies, which breed in fast-flowing rivers. More than 37 million people are infected and may experience visual impairment and/or severe dermatitis. Control of onchocerciasis is largely dependent on a single drug, ivermectin. Whilst this is extremely effective at killing the worms' offspring (microfilariae) and preventing symptoms, ivermectin does not eliminate the long-lived adult parasites or always stop transmission. Consequently, treatments must be repeated for many years, and drug resistance may be emerging. Against this background, a vaccine against onchocerciasis would provide an important additional tool to sustain effective control. In this study, we evaluated eight worm antigens as vaccine components in cattle, which are often parasitized by O. ochengi (the closest relative of O. volvulus) in West Africa. Twelve uninfected animals received all eight antigens and were exposed to natural transmission of O. ochengi alongside 13 unvaccinated cattle. After almost two years, 92% of vaccinated animals had acquired adult worms, but only 58% were positive for microfilariae; whereas 100% of unvaccinated animals harboured both parasite stages. This suggests that a vaccine against microfilariae to prevent development of disease in humans may be achievable.
