We would like to thank Dr. Adèle Kam from IRSS for her substantial help in the analyses of the blood samples. We are also thankful to Henri Somé for all his help in the database structuring and data entry. The field team including Mmes Alida Da and Chantal Millogo as well as Drs. Adama Sow, Pascal Nitiéma and Christian Compaoré were instrumental to the success of this work. We are also thankful to the two resource persons (Dr Raphael L. Nebié and Mr Elie Sawadogo) who helped us organize everything from the study setting to the results dissemination. Finally, we are grateful to all the inhabitants from the three villages for their wonderful welcome and participation.
