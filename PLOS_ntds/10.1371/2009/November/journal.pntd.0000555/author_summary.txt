Taenia solium cysticercosis is a neglected tropical zoonosis transmitted between humans and pigs. This infection is particularly prevalent in areas where sanitation, hygiene and pig management practices are poor. There is very little information about the importance of this infection in West Africa, even though pork meat is widely consumed in many areas. This pilot study, conducted in three villages of Burkina Faso, demonstrated that people living in areas where pigs are raised were more likely to be infected with cysticercosis than people living in a Muslim village in which there were very few pigs. It also demonstrated variation in the level of infection between the two villages where pigs were raised. Finally, the results suggest that the source of infection in these three villages may differ. These results are significant because they show that there is clustering of infection within villages, even if they are geographically very close to one another. This should encourage future researchers not to combine data from several villages into one summary value. In addition, more work is needed to better describe different potential sources of infection among villages.
