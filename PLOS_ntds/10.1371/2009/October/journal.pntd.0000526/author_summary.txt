Urinary schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease caused by a parasitic worm that dwells in the blood vessels, particularly those surrounding the human bladder wall. Although not directly associated with high patient mortality, this disease is linked to both short-term morbidity, e.g. visible blood in urine (acute), as well as long-term sequelae, e.g. urinary tract pathologies (chronic). Numerous control programmes based upon chemotherapy have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa in an attempt to reduce the burden of disease inflicted, particularly in children. Although there are rapid tests to assess the prevalence of acute manifestations of disease (i.e. blood in urine), namely urine-reagent strips, monitoring of chronic manifestations (i.e. urinary tract pathologies) is still rather laborious, time-consuming and requires specialised equipment, e.g. portable ultrasonography, as well as highly trained staff. This study has attempted to evaluate associations between albuminuria (albumin in urine, a new application for the HemoCue photometer) and urinary tract pathologies, and consequently assess this new biochemical marker as a potential rapid proxy of chronic disease sequelae typical in children in areas where urinary schistosomiasis is of public health importance.
