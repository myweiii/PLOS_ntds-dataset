Pyrethroid is the general term for a group of synthetic chemicals that are structurally related to natural pyrethrins derived from Chrysanthemum flowers. In Vietnam, photostable pyrethroids have been extensively used as insecticides for malaria and dengue vector control. Recently, Kawada et al. found that Aedes aegypti collected from used tires were susceptible to pyrethroids in the North but were resistant in the South and Central Highlands of Vietnam. By analyzing the presence of mutations in the para locus, which cause insensitivity to voltage-gated sodium channel in the insect nervous system, a recently found amino acid replacement in the area of segment 6 of domain III (F1269C) was found to be widely distributed with high frequency in southern Vietnam. We suggest that this point mutation plays an important role in pyrethroid resistance in Vietnam. Extensive and uncontrolled frequent use of photostable pyrethroids might be a strong selection pressure for this mutation to increase homozygous populations, which cause serious problems in controlling dengue fever in Vietnam.
