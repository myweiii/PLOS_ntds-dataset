Filarial worms that cause human lymphatic filariasis (LF) are transmitted by many species of mosquitoes. Within susceptible mosquitoes, Brugia malayi develop from microfilariae (mf) to infective-stage larvae (L3s), in approximately eight days. These nematodes develop as intracellular parasites within mosquito flight muscle cells, in which they ingest cellular material and eventually cause cell death when L3s migrate to the mosquito's proboscis. We examined the effects of B. malayi parasitism on Aedes aegypti by analyzing changes in mosquito gene expression at different stages of parasite development. We found that a few genes were differentially expressed at the RNA level relative to non-infected controls. The majority of changes occurred at two time periods, when the filarial worms began feeding and when the L3s were in the head and proboscis. Many transcriptional changes in the later group concur with documented descriptions of tissue damage, clean-up and repair that occurs in mosquitoes infected with filarial worms. In addition, we activated two innate immunity signaling pathways and observed the effects on filarial worm development. B. malayi seems to be capable of evading these immune responses, because its development was not impeded by the activation of either the Toll or Imd signal pathways in Ae. aegypti.
