We would like to thank the staff of the State Ministry of Health for Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal State for their support in implementing the surveys and Dieudonne Sankara and Els Mathieu for technical input into the survey protocol. Narcis Kabatereine assisted greatly by providing practical advice on the implementation of the surveys and by organizing Ugandan technicians from the Vector Control Division of the Ugandan Ministry of Health to assist with refresher training of Southern Sudanese counterparts and to help with implementation of the field work. We would also like to thank all of the surveyors for their hard work under extremely strenuous field conditions and Rachel Pullan for statistical advice.
