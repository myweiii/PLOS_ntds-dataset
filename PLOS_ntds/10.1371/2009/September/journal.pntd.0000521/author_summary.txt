Paragonimiasis is a neglected pulmonary disease provoked by a food-borne trematode parasite. The infection may develop into severe pulmonary disease, often diagnosed with delay and confused with tuberculosis. Globally an estimated 21 millions people are infected. Human infection is acquired through consumption of raw crab, crayfish or wild boar. Typically infections occur clustered in foci of few to several villages where nutritional habits allow transmission. A major challenge for control is to identify the transmission foci. We evaluated a questionnaire approach using lay-informants at the village level to identify paragonimiasis foci and suspected cases. We sent a 4-item questionnaire to 49 village-leaders of a district in rural Lao PDR asking them to report patients with key symptoms of paragonimiasis, i.e. “chronic cough” and “blood in sputum”. The evaluation showed that lay-informants' report had a high sensitivity to identify suspected cases of paragonimiasis using “blood in sputum” as indicator. The approach allowed identifying 3 new, previously unknown foci of transmission in the district. We conclude that lay-informant questionnaires using easily identifiable key symptoms are simple to carry out and are promising low-cost tools for paragonimiasis control.
