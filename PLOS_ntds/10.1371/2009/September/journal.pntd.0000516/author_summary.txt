The primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti, has recently been artificially infected with a symbiotic bacterium called Wolbachia pipientis. This bacterium occurs naturally inside the cells of âˆ¼66% of insect species. The Wolbachia used to infect A. aegypti shortens the insect's lifespan. Because only old mosquitoes are capable of transmitting dengue virus, the Wolbachia infection could theoretically reduce dengue virus transmission if infected mosquitoes were released into the wild. Here we have examined the effects of this Wolbachia infection on the mosquito's ability to obtain blood meals from human hosts. Blood is required for females to produce eggs, and so successful completion of this behaviour is necessary if Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are to be competitive in the wild. Blood feeding on humans is also the time when viruses like dengue are transmitted, so changes in this behaviour can have consequences for the transmission rate of viruses. We show that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are less able to obtain blood meals, but only in old age. The reduced feeding success may be explained by a defect in the insect's proboscis. The finding is exciting as it may allow young mosquitoes to breed as normal but help reduce the lifespan and success of old mosquitoes, which are the primary transmitters of virus.
