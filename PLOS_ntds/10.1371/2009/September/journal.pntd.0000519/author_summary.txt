Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiologic agent of melioidosis, an emerging tropical disease. Because of low infectious dose, broad-host-range infectivity, intrinsic antibiotic resistance and historic precedent as a bioweapon, B. pseudomallei was listed in the United States as a Select Agent and Priority Pathogen of biodefense concern by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The mechanisms governing antibiotic resistance and/or susceptibility and virulence in this bacterium are not well understood. Most clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates are highly resistant to aminoglycosides, but susceptible variants do exist. The results of our studies with three such variants from Thailand reveal that lack of expression or deletion of an efflux pump is responsible for this susceptibility. The large deletion present in one strain not only removes an efflux pump but also several putative virulence genes, including an entire siderophore gene cluster. Despite this deletion, the strain is fully virulent in an acute mouse melioidosis model. In summary, our findings shed light on mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis. They also validate the previously advocated use of laboratory-constructed, aminoglycoside susceptible efflux pump mutants in genetic manipulation experiments.
