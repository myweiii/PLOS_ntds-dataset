Research on Borrelia recurrentis, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF), has been hampered by the lack of a feasible non-primate animal model. By using immunocompromised SCID mice deficient in B- and T-cells, we were able to establish a stable, persistent B. recurrentis infection with low spirochetemia. Furthermore, systemic depletion of phagocytes by use of clodronate liposomes increased the numbers of bacteria in blood, which demonstrates the importance of both the humoral response and phagocytosis in controlling relapsing fever infection. Lice are favored by the conditions related to the unfortunate turmoil and refugee camps prevailing in the Horn of Africa, and hence LBRF is more important now than it has been for several decades. The newly published genome sequence of B. recurrentis and techniques to genetically manipulate RF borreliae will be instrumental in understanding its complex biology. We therefore believe that our novel animal model will be a great asset that can facilitate future studies of the infection biology of B. recurrentis.
