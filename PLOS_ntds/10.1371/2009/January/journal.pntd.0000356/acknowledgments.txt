We thank A. Widmer (Novartis Pharma, Basel) for providing a program for multiple linear regression, and the molecular modelling program Wit!P which was used for preparing the structures. We also thank OpenEye Scientific Software Inc. for providing Filter v2.0.1 which was used for preparing the library for docking. The calculations were performed on the Matterhorn, a Beowulf Linux cluster of the University of ZÃ¼rich, and we acknowledge the support of C. Bolliger and A. Godknecht for installing and maintaining the Linux cluster.
