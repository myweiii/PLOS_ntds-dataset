    "Background": "Neurocysticercosis accounts for 30%\u201350% of all late-onset epilepsy in endemic countries. We assessed the clustering patterns of Taenia solium human cysticercosis seropositivity and seizures around tapeworm carriers in seven rural communities in Peru.",
    "Methodology": "The presence of T. solium\u2013specific antibodies was defined as one or more positive bands in the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB). Neurocysticercosis-related seizures cases were diagnosed clinically and had positive neuroimaging or EITB.",
    "Principal Findings": "Eleven tapeworm carriers were identified by stool microscopy. The seroprevalence of human cysticercosis was 24% (196/803). Seroprevalence was 21% >50 m from a carrier and increased to 32% at 1\u201350 m (p\u200a=\u200a0.047), and from that distance seroprevalence had another significant increase to 64% at the homes of carriers (p\u200a=\u200a0.004). Seizure prevalence was 3.0% (25/837) but there were no differences between any pair of distance ranges (p\u200a=\u200a0.629, Wald test 2 degrees of freedom).",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "We observed a significant human cysticercosis seroprevalence gradient surrounding current tapeworm carriers, although cysticercosis-related seizures did not cluster around carriers. Due to differences in the timing of the two outcomes, seroprevalence may reflect recent T. solium exposure more accurately than seizure frequency."
