Fasciola hepatica is a helminth parasite that causes liver fluke disease (fasciolosis) in domestic animals (sheep and cattle) and humans worldwide. Cathepsin L cysteine proteases (FheCL) are secreted by the parasite to invade its host, migrate through tissues and to degrade host haemoglobin (Hb), a major source of nutrient to the parasite. FheCL1 is a very stable protease and active over a broad pH range (3.0–9.0), making it very suitable for functions both inside and outside the parasite. The slightly acidic pH of the parasite gut not only regulates the autocatalytic activation of the proFheCL1 zymogen to an active FheCL1 protease but also induces relaxation of the Hb structure, making it more susceptible to proteolysis. The action of FheCL1, which is enhanced by glutathione (GSH), the major reducing agent found in red blood cells, degrades Hb to small peptides (predominantly 4–14 residues) that can be absorbed by the gut epithelial cells. Further processing within these cells by exopeptidases provides the necessary amino acids required for protein anabolism by the parasite.
