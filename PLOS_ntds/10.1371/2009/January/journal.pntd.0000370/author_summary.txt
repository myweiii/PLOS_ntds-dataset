In rural western Kenya, both malaria and intestinal infections with worms are common. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection with malaria, but the effect on pregnancy of intestinal infections with worms is not clear and may depend both on how heavy the worm infection is and on the type of worm. Additionally, it is not clear whether infections with worms may affect malaria infections. In this article, we begin to disentangle some of these issues. Intestinal infections with worms were diagnosed in three-quarters of 390 pregnant women in western Kenya who provided a stool sample. In these women, intestinal worm infections caused a modest decrease both in haemoglobin levels and indicators of nutritional status. Women in their second and third pregnancies who were diagnosed with one particular type of worm infection (Ascaris lumbricoides) were less likely to have malaria than other women in their second or third pregnancies who did not have this type of worm infection. Although our results suggest that it would be good advice to treat women with drugs for intestinal worm infections during their pregnancy in this area, the effect on maternal and infant health and malaria infection needs further study.
