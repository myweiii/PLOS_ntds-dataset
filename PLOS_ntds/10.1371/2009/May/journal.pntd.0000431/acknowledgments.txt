We thank the many field technicians, local administrators and teachers involved in the surveys, and the children who provided urine and stool samples in the 2004â€“2006 surveys. We also thank the Malian Ministry of Education, in particular Mrs Fatoumata Keita, for facilitating the surveys. Dr Adrian Barnett, Queensland Institute of Technology, assisted with mathematical notation of the models.
