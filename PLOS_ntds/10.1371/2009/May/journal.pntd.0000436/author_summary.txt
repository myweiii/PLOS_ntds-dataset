With the number of cholera cases up to 73,000 during the last eight years and successive wars that have persisted for fifteen years, the North and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo are currently heavily hit by both cholera outbreaks and war-related population displacements. Prior to this study, no research had been done to identify the sources of epidemics and the pathways used by cholera to spread throughout the Kivu provinces. Here we show that a few cities located on the lakeshore of Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika act as the main sources of cholera epidemics and that the number of cholera cases tends to increase during the rainy season. We also found that only a minority of population displacements were followed by cholera outbreaks. Finally, we think that the low number of cholera cases recorded after the Nyiragongo eruption is one more argument to implement programs aiming at restoring, and if possible improving, drinking water access following natural disasters
