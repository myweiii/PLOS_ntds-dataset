We conducted a population genetic study with 1,040 Aedes aegypti sensu latu (s.l.) collected from 19 sites distributed across the five phytogeographic regions of Senegal. Adult mosquitoes without pale scales on their first abdominal tergite were classified as Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) and those having pale scales as Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa). We found the two forms distributed along a northwest–southeast cline. Northern Sahelian collections contained only Aaa while the southern Forest gallery collections consisted of only Aaf. The two subspecies were sympatric in four collections north of The Gambia. Aaa was a minor component of two collections from the Forest gallery area. Eleven of these collections were fed a dengue-2 virus–infected bloodmeal. Consistent with the early literature, Aaf had lower vector competence than Aaa. In agreement with a recently published isozyme gene flow study in Senegal, analyzes of allele frequencies indicated only a small, nonsignificant percentage of the variance associated with subspecies. These results improve our understanding of the global phylogeny of Aedes aegypti s.l., suggesting that West African Aaa and Aaf are monophyletic and that Aaf, the black “sylvan” species, is the ancestor of Aaa, the lighter “domestic” species in West Africa.
