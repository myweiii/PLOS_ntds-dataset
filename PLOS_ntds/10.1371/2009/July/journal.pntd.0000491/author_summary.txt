Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of tropical infections including trypanosomiasis, filariasis, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis and other such diseases of poverty. Of the classic neglected diseases, leishmaniasis has among the highest level of morbidity and mortality. Infection with Leishmania parasites causes severe disease in humans, including fatal visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis resulting in severe scarring, often in the face. This is a difficult infection to treat because the current therapies are generally poorly effective. The present study carried out a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to investigated whether a combined therapy with imiquimod plus pentavalent antimony was superior to the standard therapy of pentavalent antimony alone as a first-line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Peru. A higher cure rate with the combination therapy was observed, but could not be conclusively proven.
