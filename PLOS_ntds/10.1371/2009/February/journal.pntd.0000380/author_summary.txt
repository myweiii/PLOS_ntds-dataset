Buruli ulcer is an infection of the subcutaneous tissue leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The causative pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans, grows best at 30°C–33°C and not above 37°C, and this property makes the application of heat a treatment option. We achieved a breakthrough in heat treatment of Buruli ulcer by employing the phase change material sodium acetate trihydrate as a heat application system for thermotherapy, which is widely used in commercial pocket heat pads. It is easy to apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. Six laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative Buruli lesions were included in the proof-of-principle study and treated for four to six weeks. In patients with small ulcers, wounds healed completely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local inflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a half years after completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. The reusable phase change material–based heat application device appears perfectly suited for use in remote Buruli ulcer–endemic areas of countries with limited resources and infrastructure.
