Giardia duodenalis is a parasite causing a gastrointestinal disease in humans, pets, livestock, and wildlife. The role of animals in human disease is unclear, because Giardia from humans and animals is morphologically indistinguishable. An international consortium of both veterinary and public health institutions built a web-based database, where molecular and epidemiological data are combined. After extensive genetic characterization, the zoonotic potential of Giardia became evident, but data on frequency and role in epidemiology is (still) lacking. Surprisingly, mixtures of Giardia genotypes in individual hosts were frequently observed, and have important implications for the etiology of Giardiasis. Possible explanations are the uptake of mixtures of Giardia genotypes by one host, or subsequent infection of an already infected host, likely without overt symptoms, with a different Giardia species, which may cause disease. We demonstrated that collaborative, human and veterinary health integrated databases have the potential to tackle intricate epidemiological questions concerning parasitic diseases, as was demonstrated for G. duodenalis in the present study.
