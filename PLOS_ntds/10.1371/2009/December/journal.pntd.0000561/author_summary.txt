Dengue and West Nile virus infections put an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk. Neither drugs nor vaccines are currently available against these diseases. The non-structural protein NS3 is a protease that, together with the cofactor NS2B, is essential for viral maturation. The NS2B-NS3 proteases of dengue and West Nile viruses are highly homologous and present promising drug targets. Crystal structures of the West Nile virus protease with and without bound inhibitor revealed large structural differences in NS2B, while no crystal structure of the dengue virus protease could be determined with a bound inhibitor. We investigated the structural change in solution and found that the C-terminal segment (CTS) of the NS2B cofactor is prone to dissociation from NS3. In the case of the West Nile virus protease, the CTS of NS2B is mostly associated with NS3, especially in the presence of inhibitors. In the case of the dengue virus protease and in the absence of inhibitors, the CTS of NS2B is mostly dissociated from NS3. Finding drug candidates to inhibit the association of the NS2B cofactor may thus be easier for the dengue virus protease.
