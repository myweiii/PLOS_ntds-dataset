Trypanosomes are single-celled organisms that are transmitted between animal hosts by the tsetse fly. These parasites infect a wide range of mammals and in sub-Saharan Africa are extensively debilitating to livestock, and some species are also able to infect humans causing a disease, sleeping sickness, that is usually fatal unless treated. Some trypanosome strains cause more severe disease than others, and studying these differences may allow the identification of how serious disease is caused. We approached this problem by looking at how differences in disease symptoms (enlarged spleen and liver, and reduced blood cell numbers) that are caused in infections in mice with two strains of Trypanosoma brucei, TREU927 and STIB247. These disease manifestations are clinically relevant in human and livestock trypanosome infections. Examining how the symptoms are inherited in infections with offspring of a cross between the two strains allowed the identification of a region of the T. brucei genome that contains a gene (or several genes) that contributes significantly towards the enlarged spleen and liver observed in infected mice. This is a first step towards identifying the parasite genes that cause disease in the host (virulence factors), which may provide routes for developing novel therapies against the disease.
