We appreciate the donations of insects from Drs. Francisca Marin (Nicaragua), Carlos Ponce (Honduras), Azael Zaldaña (Panama), Rodrigo Zeledón and Jesús Ugalde (Costa Rica), and for the cooperation of the Ministries of Health of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. We are grateful for the research facilities and supplies generously provided to Dr. Dorn following Hurricane Katrina by Dr. Bart Sefton and Roberta Schulte of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, California, equipment and materials provided by Dr. Michael Havey, University of Wisconsin, Mercedes Ames for her insights in the phylogenetic analysis, and Mauricio Garcia for field assistance. We appreciate the cooperation of the villagers who allowed us to collect in their homes.
