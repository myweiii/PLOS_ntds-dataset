The Chagas disease parasite, transmitted to humans by triatomine bugs, remains a leading cause of heart and digestive disease in Latin America. Pesticide spraying has effectively halted transmission in most of southern South America, especially where the bugs live exclusively inside houses. In Mesoamerica, bugs living in the forest readily reinfest treated houses. In addition, one of the main species of insect that transmits Chagas in Mesoamerica, Triatoma dimidiata, although it looks similar in different localities, may consist of genetically distinct populations, even different species, which differ in how efficiently they transmit the parasite: characteristics which confound control efforts. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA were analyzed to characterize different populations of T. dimidiata from Mexico and Central America. Both the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA show that there is a very distinct population of T. dimidiata, perhaps even a different species, that lives in very close proximity with other T. dimidiata in Mexico and Guatemala. The nuclear DNA divides the remaining T. dimidiata into three additional genetically distinct groups. However, the mitochondrial DNA does not distinguish these additional groups. This study helps inform control efforts by showing where genetically distinct populations of T. dimidiata occur.
