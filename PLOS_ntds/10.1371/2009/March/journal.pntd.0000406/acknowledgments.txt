We would like to express our gratitude to Mario Rodriguez Perez and Cristian Lizarazo Ortega of the Centro de Biotecnologia Genómica in the Instituto Politécnico Nacional in Reynosa, Mexico, for ELISA testing of the false positive sample. Our thanks to Mynor Lopez, Jorge Sincal, Marvin Chiquitá, Auri Paniagua, Alicia Castillo and Enio Morales for their excellent field work. We are grateful to Estuardo Barrios for the programming of PDAs and map production. None of these studies would have been possible without substantial support from the administrative offices of the Centro de Estudios en Salud of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, especially Rosmery Garcia.
