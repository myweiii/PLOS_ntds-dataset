Opisthorchiasis, oriental liver fluke infection, is a food-borne parasitic disease that afflicts millions of residents in northern Thailand and Laos. Related infections occur in North Asia, including China and Korea. This kind of liver fluke infection is the consequence of eating certain uncooked or undercooked freshwater fish contaminated with the larvae of the parasite Opisthorchis viverrini. Whereas the infection can cause disease in the bile ducts and liver, infection with the oriental fluke can lead to the development of a liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Our recent studies have begun to focus on products and metabolites from the parasite that are carcinogenic. Many proteolytic enzymes are known to be secreted by parasites. This report centers on a specific category of protease, termed cathepsin F. We determined here that O. viverrini expresses a cathepsin F in its gut and in other organs. In the liver fluke, cathepsin F likely plays a role in digesting ingested human cells. The gene encoding the parasite enzyme shows evolutionary relatedness to a similar gene in humans. The fluke cathepsin F also is released from the parasite into livers of infected mammals, where it appears to contribute to inflammation surrounding the parasite. In this regard, it may be involved in early events that lead to bile duct cancer.
