Symbiotic microorganisms influence many aspects of the physiology of their hosts. In insects, symbiotic bacteria are able among other things to modulate the immune response and the development of the insect from larval stages to adult. Many bacteria first gain access to insect tissues, such as the gut, during larval development, and are acquired from the environment. Thus, depending on the insect ecology, aquatic vs. terrestrial, the bacterial gut flora found in insects can vary widely. Little is known about the events that follow bacterial infection in larval guts and the driving forces for colonization of the gut by such bacteria. We investigated the distribution of two bacteria, a Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and a Gram-negative (Pantoea agglomerans) fed to sand fly larvae. Our results indicate that bacteria distribution in the larval gut is driven by their ability to multiply at a given pH, as pH in the gut also varies. Gut distribution by these bacteria lead to an immune response that the sand fly larva is able to modulate according to the bacterial species. Our findings can influence development of paratransgenic approaches that utilize bacterial symbionts to control vector population.
