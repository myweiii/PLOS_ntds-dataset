Historically, rickettsial pathogens are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during military operations. Rickettsial diseases, lately, are reemerging in areas of known abundance or emerging in areas of unknown existence, posing a significant medical concern for local residents and travelers. The diseases are difficult to diagnose as they often share similar symptoms with many other diseases in the same geographical areas. Therefore, it is particularly challenging for clinicians to provide a timely and accurate diagnosis. A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-based nucleic acid detection platform has been used to develop accurate, sensitive, specific, and easy-to-perform assays to detect O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi, indicative of scrub typhus or murine typhus, respectively. These RPA assays provide similar limits of detection and specificity to that of qPCR. Unlike qPCR, they require no thermocycler and provide multiple end-point monitoring options amendable to different laboratory capabilities. This work presents an alternative assay platform for early detection of O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi infection so that timely treatment can be prescribed in well-equipped laboratories as well as resource limited areas.
