U-insertion/deletion RNA editing is a unique post-transcriptional mRNA modification process that occurs in trypanosomatid parasites and is required for viability. The participation of guide RNAs which are transcribed from the thousands of catenated minicircles in determining the precise sites and number of Uâ€™s inserted and deleted to create translatable mRNAs is novel and significant in terms of the recently realized importance of small RNAs in biology. This study contributes the necessary bioinformatics foundation for a deeper understanding of this important genetic system in molecular detail using a model trypanosomatid, Leishmania tarentolae. We used Next Generation Sequencing methods to determine the complete maxicircle and minicircle genomes and to map maxicircle pre-edited and edited transcripts and minicircle transcripts. The transcription of minicircle-encoded guide RNAs was confirmed and novel information about minicircle gene expression was obtained. The biological context involved a comparison of two strains of the parasites, one recently isolated and having an intact mitochondrial genetic system and the other an old lab strain that has developed a partially defective mitochondrial genome. The data are important for an understanding of the mitochondrial genomic complexity and expression of this dynamic genetic system.
