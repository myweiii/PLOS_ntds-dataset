    "Introduction": "Kinetoplastid protists have an unusual mitochondrial genetic architecture: the mitochondrial genes + cryptogenes encoded in the 20\u201340 catenated maxicircles, and multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) encoded mainly in the ~10,000 catenated minicircles [1]. The gRNAs contain information for correction of DNA-encoded mRNA frameshifts at the RNA level [2]. This unusual genetic organization reflects the evolution in these early protists of a post-transcriptional RNA modification phenomenon known as U-insertion/deletion RNA editing. The mechanism of this type of RNA editing involves hybridization of the 5\u2019 end of the gRNA to the \u201cpre-edited\u201d mRNA sequence just downstream of the first editing site, endonuclease cleavage at the first upstream mismatch, followed either by the 3\u2019 addition of U residues to the 5\u2019 mRNA fragment which base pair with A or G \u201cguiding nucleotides\u201d in the gRNA and ligation of the two RNA fragments, or removal of unpaired 3\u2019 U residues before RNA ligation [2]. The proteins responsible for this process are components of a 1 MDa core complex (RNA editing core complex or RECC) [3] containing three endoribonucleases, two 3\u2019-5\u2019 U-specific exonucleases, a 3\u2019 uridylyltransferase or TUTase and two RNA ligases, in addition to more than 10 proteins of uncertain function [4]. In addition there are a number of accessory complexes which interact dynamically with the RECC forming a yet poorly defined \u201ceditosome\u201d complex sedimenting around 40S [5]. The accessory complexes exhibit gRNA binding [6, 7], RNA binding [8], RNA helicase [9, 10], 3\u2019 TUTase [11\u201314] and poly A polymerase activities [15, 16]. Medium resolution cryoEM structures of the RECC particles from Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei have been published [17, 18] and several crystallographic structures of editing proteins are also known [19\u201326].\nIn L. tarentolae, there are approximately 10,000\u201320,000 minicircles and 20\u201350 maxicircles all catenated into a single giant network of DNA (kinetoplast or kDNA) [27\u201329] that is situated in the mitochondrial matrix linked to the flagellum basal body by fibers extending from the kDNA region to the mitochondrial membrane and from the mitochondrial membrane to the organelle (TAC complex) [30, 31]. The extent of editing varies from a few uridines at a few sites to hundreds of uridines at hundreds of sites (pan-editing). Pan-editing proceeds 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 with the overall polarity being determined by multiple overlapping gRNAs, one of which initiates editing of a short \u201cblock\u201d of nucleotides, creating a sequence to which the second overlapping gRNA hybridizes, and so on, forming an editing \"cascade\" [32]. The mitochondrial genome of trypanosomatid protists consists of the maxicircle genome, which encodes 6 genes, transcripts of which are never edited, and 12 cryptogenes, transcripts of which are edited, and the minicircle genome, which encodes small guide RNAs (gRNAs) that contain the information for the precise insertion/deletion of uridine residues in the cryptogene transcripts to create translatable mRNAs [2, 33, 34]. Seven of the gRNAs are encoded in the maxicircle genome and the remainder are encoded in the thousands of catenated minicircles. In L. tarentolae, the minicircles are approximately 850 bp and there is a single gRNA gene per molecule. A minicircle \u201csequence class\u201d is defined as a group of minicircles with homologous sequences encoding a specific gRNA. Guide RNAs which differ in sequence due to the existence of G/C and G/U base pairs but contain the same editing information are termed \u201credundant gRNAs\u201d. Replication of the kDNA and the nuclear DNA is fairly synchronous in the trypanosomatid cell cycle [35, 36], giving rise to G2 networks with double the number of minicircles. Division of the kinetoplast network involves non-mitotic scission yielding two daughter networks.\nThe frequencies of different minicircle classes in the network of L. tarentolae were previously shown to change significantly during continuous culture from year to year [37]. The complete loss of a single minicircle class encoding a non-redundant gRNA for an essential protein would be lethal. Since division of the single kDNA network involves a non-mitotic scission of the catenated structure, it would be essential for the cell to have the minicircle classes distributed randomly throughout the network so that each daughter network contains a complete complement of gRNAs. A novel mode of DNA replication which involves decatenation of closed minicircles from the network followed by replication and then recatenation at two peripheral antipodal nodes while the network is rotating or oscillating may have evolved to help accomplish this [27]. A computer model of minicircle replication and network segregation assuming random distribution of minicircles to daughter networks and several other reasonable assumptions indicated that the frequencies of different minicircle classes spontaneously fluctuate over one thousand generations and that minicircles encoding gRNAs for non-functional editing cascades become the majority of the 10,000 molecules in the network [38]. In fact, this appears to be the case in the UC strain, in which the kDNA network was found to contain several high copy number minicircle classes that encode such \u201corphan\u201d gRNAs [37]. We showed previously that the old laboratory UC strain (Tar II) of L. tarentolae isolated by Parrot in 1939 [39] was defective in editing of several of the normally pan-edited genes and therefore in the protein products which were apparently not required in culture [40]. The recently isolated LEM125 strain was found to contain minicircle-encoded gRNAs which would allow editing of a number of mRNAs not edited in the UC strain. This model however was brought into question by the finding that a strain of L. mexicana isolated in 1972 and kept in culture contained an apparently complete set of pan-edited RNAs [41], suggesting that some yet unknown property of Leishmania may play a role in maintaining the intactness of the editing system.\nIn order to understand the detailed role and plasticity of minicircle-encoded gRNAs and the details of the editing process, a complete inventory of the mitochondrial genome and the minicircle transcriptome is essential and that is presented in this paper. There is one study in the literature on the gRNA transcriptome of insect phase T. brucei [42] but no mapping was done and the minicircle genome was not investigated. In our study, minicircles from both L. tarentolae strains were sequenced and the number of classes determined. In addition, mitochondrial RNA libraries were sequenced and the reads mapped to minicircles, encoded gRNAs and pre-edited and mature maxicircle edited sequences. We confirmed and quantitated the differences between the defective kDNA genome of the UC cells and the more robust kDNA genome of the LEM125 cells.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Cell culture\nThe UC strain was originally obtained from Dr. W. Trager. It has been maintained from 1968 to the present in the L.S. lab at UCLA in Brain Heart Infusion Medium with 10 \u03bcg/ml hemin at 27\u00b0C. This is the original Parrot TarII strain (ATCC 30267, 30143) which was isolated from Tarentola mauritanica in Algeria in 1939. The LEM125 strain was obtained from Dr. J.A. Rioux who isolated it from a gecko in southern France in 1981 [43]. It was kept frozen in liquid nitrogen and samples were thawed to start cultures. For culture of LEM125, 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 \u03bcg/ml hemin were added to BHI.\n\n\nLibrary preparation\nPurified kinetoplast-mitochondria [44] from the UC and LEM125 [45, 46] strains of L. tarentolae were frozen and kept in Trizole. RNA was isolated using the Qiagen miRNeasy Micro Kit in which the sample homogenization in QiaZol was substituted by Trizole. RNA was fractionated into large (>200 nt) and small (<200 nt) fractions using the Ilumina RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (cat. no. 74204). Small RNA libraries were generated using the SeqMatic TailorMiX miRNA sample prep kit with some modifications: The gRNA 5' triphosphate was removed by treating the RNA with Antarctic phosphatase from NEB (using NEB protocols). A 5' monophosphate was added back to the RNA for subsequent adapter ligation using T4 polynucleotide kinase from NEB (again using NEB protocols). Adapter ligation, reverse transcription, and PCR steps followed standard protocols for small RNA library generation.\nLarge RNA libraries were generated using the SeqMatic Directional RNA kit. The RNAs were fragmented in MgCl2 and the fragment ends were treated with T4 PNK. Then adapters were ligated followed by RT-PCR just as in the small RNA procedure. For sequencing using the MiSeq v2 platform [47], small RNA was run on a 150 bp single end read and large RNA on a 2x150 bp paired end read.\nIn one preparation, total cell RNA was used to generate libraries using SeqMatic\u2019s TailorMix Directional RNA sample prep kit using the company\u2019s protocols. The total RNA was sheared to an average length of 200 bp. The sheared fragments were then ligated with adapters and converted into cDNA. PCR was then performed with primers containing barcoded Illumina adapter sequences. The cDNA was then subjected to paired-end 2 X 150 bp sequencing. All libraries were validated using the Agilent Bioanalzyer.\n\n\nContamination of libraries\nThe percentage of minicircle specific reads in the libraries was low, with the majority of reads specific for genomic RNAs and maxicircle rRNAs, indicating that the isolated kinetoplast fractions were contaminated with genomic RNAs. The mapping of reads to minicircles however was very specific and not affected by this contamination. In fact we were able to use libraries of reads prepared from total cell RNA and obtain quite similar results. In all mapping experiments using small RNA reads, the Bam files from reads from purified mitochondria were merged with the Bam files from reads from total cell RNA. The unmapped values for LEM small and LEM large are quite high, perhaps for technical reasons, but this does not affect our results due to the high specificity of mapping we observe. To determine contamination of libraries, RNA sequence reads were mapped to genomic, maxicircle, and all minicircle sequences in a single step. Reads were characterized by which sequence they aligned to or if they failed to align to any of these sequences. See Table 1.\n\n\nMinicircle DNA sequencing\nIn order to obtain the complete complement of minicircle sequence classes, kinetoplast DNA was isolated by the CsCl sedimentation method [48] from stationary phase UC and LEM125 cells. The kinetoplast DNA in a microtube was cleaved with the Covaris S2 Focused-Ultrasonicator using conditions (Duty cycle 2%, Intensity 4, 200 cycles per 20 sec burst) that yielded approximately a single random cleavage per molecule. DNA libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit. All libraries were validated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay. The average UC library size was 871 bp and the LEM library size 963 bp.\nThe DNA libraries were subjected to PacBio sequencing [47] to obtain full length minicircle sequences [49] and avoid the problem of the presence of the conserved region affecting assembly of shorter sequences. CCS reads, which are circular consensus sequences generated by multiple passes around each circular SMRTbell construct, were used for minicircle sequence assembly. The CCS sequences (Fig 1A) were filtered for size (800\u2013100 nt) and for minicircle sequences using the highly conserved CSB3 motif and subsequently rearranged in the same polarity to terminate with the 5\u2019 end of this motif so as to have the encoded gRNAs in a 5'-3' orientation. The rearranged reads were mapped to all known minicircle sequences and unmapped reads were separated as a subgroup. A multiple alignment of the unmapped reads was performed with the MAFFT method [50] and a tree was constructed. Consensus sequences were generated based on the alignments of reads in each branch segmented from the tree. All consensus sequences were then mapped to all known minicircles and any unmapped sequences were selected as novel minicircle candidates. The novel minicircles were verified by identification of novel gRNAs as described previously and added to the database. Then the whole process was cycled with mapping all rearranged reads against this combined minicircle database until no consensus sequences could be generated.\nA. Length distribution of 22,680 randomly single cleaved minicircle DNA molecules sequenced on PacBio platform. B. Length distribution of the final dataset of 114 minicircles.\n\n\nMinicircle copy numbers\nThe filtered CCS sequences of once cleaved minicircles for both strains were assembled against the 114 identified minicircles, using the Geneious program. Table 2 shows the number of CCS sequences which assembled to each minicircle sequence. These numbers were used to generate approximate minicircle copy numbers per network as described in the text.\nEncoded gRNAs, number of CCS sequences assembled for each minicircle and the calculated number of minicircles/network, assuming 10,000 minicircles/network. UC contigs were assembled from 4370 of 5720 CCS reads. LEM125 contigs were assembled from 19,069 of 19,469 CCS reads.\n\n\nInformatics analysis\nInformatics analysis was mainly performed using the Broad Institute Galaxy system [51] installed on the Hoffman2 cluster at UCLA. The short RNA FastQ files and the long RNA paired FastQ files were filtered to remove adapters and for quality. In addition, posttranscriptionally added 3' oligoU sequences in both the short and long RNA FastQ files were removed to avoid mapping problems. PolyA or Poly AU 3' sequences were not filtered since we are only interested in the mitochondrial RNA sequences. The processed RNA reads were mapped to the 114 L. tarentolae minicircle reference sequences using Bowtie [49]. Quantification and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) analysis [52] were performed using in-house command line scripts created by S.D. and visualized using Excel. The average depth of coverage for the mapped gRNA peaks is ~150 fold for UC and ~50 fold for LEM125.\n\n\nAccession numbers\nNew minicircle sequences:\nBankIt1789720 mc3 KP456020\nBankIt1789720 mc4 KP456021\nBankIt1789720 mc7 KP456022\nBankIt1789720 mc12 KP456023\nBankIt1789720 mc13 KP456024\nBankIt1789720 mc14 KP456025\nBankIt1789720 mc19 KP456026\nBankIt1789720 mc22 KP456027\nBankIt1789720 mc24 KP456028\nBankIt1789720 mc28 KP456029\nBankIt1789720 mc32 KP456030\nBankIt1789720 mc33 KP456031\nBankIt1789720 mc38 KP456032\nBankIt1789720 mc41 KP456033\nBankIt1789720 mc48 KP456034\nBankIt1789720 mc52 KP456035\nBankIt1789720 mc55 KP456036\nBankIt1789720 mc59 KP456037\nBankIt1789720 mc60 KP456038\nBankIt1789720 mc61 KP456039\nBankIt1789720 mc62 KP456040\nBankIt1789720 mc71 KP456041\nBankIt1789720 mc76 KP456042\nBankIt1789720 mc82 KP456043\nBankIt1789720 mc83 KP456044\nBankIt1789720 mc86 KP456045\nBankIt1789720 mc89 KP456046\nBankIt1789720 mc91 KP456047\nBankIt1789720 mc92 KP456048\nBankIt1789720 mc98 KP456049\nBankIt1789720 mc101 KP456050\nBankIt1789720 mc102 KP456051\nBankIt1789720 mc103 KP456052\nBankIt1789720 mc105 KP456053\nBankIt1789720 mc108 KP456054\nBankIt1789720 mc109 KP456055\nBankIt1789720 mc110 KP456056\nBankIt1789720 mc111 KP456057\nBankIt1789720 mc112 KP456058\nBankIt1789720 mc113 KP456059",
    "Results": "Minicircle sequence classes in the UC and LEM125 strains of L. tarentolae\nSequences of once cleaved minicircles from both the UC and LEM125 strains were obtained using the PacBio platform [53] and assembled into contigs against the known minicircle database using the Geneious software package [51]. Minicircles were identified using several criteria as diagrammed in Fig 2. These criteria are size (800\u20131000 bp), the presence and relative location of the three short conserved sequences, CSB1 (5'-GAACGCCCCT-3'), CSB2 (5'-GAACGGGG-3') and CSB3 (5'-ATGTGGTTGGGG-3') [54] which are involved in DNA replication, and also the presence and relative location of the \u201cbend\u201d region [55\u201358]. The \"Variable or Divergent Region\", which represents the minicircle sequence outside the conserved region, is indicated by brackets. The intrinsically bent DNA region is located a characteristic distance from the gRNA gene (see S1 Fig for length distribution) and contains 4\u20135 T tracts together with variable length A and G tracts that together repeat each turn of the helix (S2 Fig).\nThe mc8 minicircle is linearized at the 5\u2019 end of the CSB3 sequence. The \u201cbend\u201d region is a sequence-dependent distortion of the double helix. The encoded gRNA is annotated and is located at a characteristic distance from the CSB3. The 5'-3' polarities of the three CSB sequences, the bend and the gRNA are indicated by arrows. VR indicates Variable Region, CR indicates Conserved Region.\nSee Fig 1A for length distributions of 22, 680 PacBio CCS sequences of once cleaved kDNA and Fig 1B for the final minicircle data set of 114 sequence classes from the LEM125 strain, of which 41 were novel, showing a peak of around 850\u2013870 bp. Putative gRNA genes were identified by computer analysis, as discussed in Materials and Methods (see S3 Fig). The conserved location of the known gRNA genes (240\u2013340 nt from the 5\u2019 ends of the CSB3 sequences) assisted in this identification (S1 Fig). Table 2 has a list of the final set of 114 minicircle classes together with the\u201dmc numbers\u201d and the putative encoded gRNAs if known.\nWe define a minicircle sequence class by sequence homology and by the specific encoded gRNA. Since the kDNA network contains approximately 10,000 catenated minicircles, there must be multiple copies of most if not all of the 114 sequence classes. In order to determine the approximate frequency of the minicircle sequence classes, we assumed that the number of CCS sequences that assemble to specific minicircles is proportional to the relative frequency of these minicircles in the network. Table 2 shows the number of CCS sequences which assembled to each minicircle and the calculated copy numbers of each minicircle class for both strains. This data is shown graphically in Fig 3. The LEM125 strain has one class with ~2,000 mc\u2019s per network of 10,000 mc's with the remainder of the 114 classes each containing less than 200 copies per network. The UC strain, however, has only 20\u201324 total sequence classes with two of these containing around 3,000 and 5,000 copies per network and two containing around 600 copies each.\nThe average number of minicircle sequence classes per network was calculated from the number of PacBio CCS reads that assembled to specific minicircles (see Table 2). These values are plotted for both strains as number of minicircles of a specific sequence class/network (assuming 10,000 minicircles per network) versus the mc number (see Table 2).\nThe multiply aligned CCS sequences for each sequence class showed a background of random changes, due to sequencing errors or mutations. There were also however in 61% of the sequence classes conserved patterns of single nucleotide substitutions, as shown in Fig 4 for the mc54 minicircle by the vertical boxed columns. Another example is in Fig 5 which shows 9 extracted regions from a multiple alignment of CCS sequences that form another specific minicircle sequence class. These extracted regions contain 14 columns with similar patterns of nucleotide substitutions (highlighted). Most of the conserved single nucleotide changes occur within the minicircle variable region (Fig 6).\nMultiple alignment of 58 CCS sequences which assembled to the minicircle, mc54, which encodes gND8-XII. The minicircle consensus sequence from nt 550\u2013664 is at the top. Dots indicate matches and squiggles indicate deletions. Dashes indicate gaps. Columns with conserved single nucleotide mutations (T to C, A to T, A to G, G to C, C to T, A to G) in 6 of the CCS sequences at identical relative positions are boxed.\nNine regions were extracted from an alignment of CCS reads that assembled to a specific minicircle sequence class. Conserved patterns of single nucleotide changes in 14 columns in these regions are highlighted. See Fig 4 legend for details.\nDiagram of linearized mc1 minicircle showing the relative locations of similar conserved patterns of single nucleotide changes (arrows) as in Fig 5. CR indicates Conserved Region, VR indicates Variable Region.\nThe mutations indicated in color in Figs 4 and 5 represent highly correlated patterns. In the example in Fig 5, 14 mutations are identical in 13 CCS sequences. The probability of a nucleotide changing to another is 1/3, and the probability of identical changes in the 13 CCS sequences is (1/3)12. The probability of similar changes at all 14 different sites is: ((1/3)12)13 which is less than 10\u221275. In light of the extremely small probability of this happening by chance, we propose a model in which a single minicircle in a sequence class encoding a specific gRNA had multiple single nucleotide changes which were selected for perhaps by affecting transcription or processing or through some indirect affect such as growth in culture. Multiple rounds of replication of this minicircle would give rise to progeny minicircles that have the specific patterns we have observed. Further research is required to fully explain this intriguing phenomenon.\n\n\nGuide RNA genes\nPutative minicircle-encoded gRNAs are identified by computer analysis, which involves searching for regions of complementarity, allowing both G-C and G-U base pairs, between the 12 mature pan-edited sequences and the minicircle sequences reversed. The duplex length criterion is >19 continuous base pairs with one or two allowed mismatches in longer duplexes due to sequence errors or to flexibility in the editing mechanism. The entire set of edited RNA/gRNA duplexes can be seen in S3\u2013S7 Figs and the identified gRNAs are listed in Table 2.\nInterestingly, there are 14 minicircles (mc101-114) which do not encode identifiable gRNAs for the L. tarentolae edited sequences. However, use of the related L. mexicana mature edited sequences led to the identification of 5 additional putative gRNAs for ND3 and G4 encoded by mc102, 103, 110, 113 and 114. The remaining 10 minicircles do not contain identifiable gRNAs.\n\n\nLocations of specific gRNAs in editing cascades for both strains and relationship to RNA editing\nThe absence of a single overlapping gRNA could break the 3'-5' editing cascade and prevent the generation of a mature mRNA and thereby translation of that product. The computer-identified gRNAs for both strains and also the maxicircle-encoded gRNAs were mapped onto the mature edited maxicircle transcripts. The extracted annotated editing domains from both strains are compared side by side in Figs 7\u20139. The edited sequences are in green and the editing domains in orange. The mapped minicircle-encoded gRNAs are indicated as red arrows. The 7 maxicircle-encoded gRNAs which are identical in both strains and are shown as blue arrows mediate editing of the Cyb, Murf2 and ND7 transcripts (Figs 7\u20139). The difference in the overall number of minicircle-encoded gRNAs between these strains is striking. LEM125 has fairly complete sets of overlapping gRNAs with multiple \u201credundant\u201d gRNAs for the A6, G4, ND3 and ND8 genes (Figs 7\u20139). In the case of RPS12, a maxicircle-encoded gRNA covers a single gap in the cascade (Fig 8). LEM125 ND9 editing however apparently lacks at least two overlapping gRNAs (Fig 9), but we show below that the RNA library contains mature edited ND9 mRNA sequences, suggesting that our minicircle dataset lacks at least two sequence classes. LEM125 G4 editing apparently lacks two overlapping gRNAs (Fig 9) and LEM125 G3 editing lacks one gRNA required for complete editing, but we discuss below the possibility that the published 5' edited sequences for G3 may contain errors.\nThe minicircle-encoded and maxicircle-encoded gRNAs were mapped to the 12 mature edited maxicircle transcript sequences. The edited sequences (CO3, Cyb, Murf2 and A6) are in green, the editing domains are in orange and the minicircle-encoded gRNAs are in red. Maxicircle-encoded gRNAs are shown as blue arrows labeled \u201cMC gRNA\u201d above the sequences. The gRNAs are labeled with the gene name and Roman numerals which refer to the location in the functional editing cascade; the low numbers indicate roles early in the cascade and the higher numbers roles later in the cascade. Redundant gRNAs are indicated with a, b, etc. To easily compare the extent of gRNA coverage in the two strains, the editing domains for each gene in both strains are extracted together with the gRNA location information and shown side by side. Apparently missing overlapping gRNAs are indicated by blue circles.\nSee Fig 7 legend for details.\nSee Fig 7 legend for details.\nThe UC strain on the other hand only has complete sets of overlapping minicircle-encoded gRNAs and therefore minicircle sequence classes for editing of the CO3 and A6 genes (Fig 7), and there is a striking paucity of gRNAs for editing of the ND3, ND8, ND9, G3 and G4 genes (Figs 8 and 9). UC RPS12 editing apparently lacks several overlapping gRNAs (Fig 8), but we show evidence below for the presence of mature edited UC RPS12 mRNAs, suggesting that the UC minicircle dataset lacks several minicircle RPS12 gRNA sequence classes.\n\n\nMapping of mitochondrial RNA reads to the LEM125 and UC minicircles\nIn order to verify transcription of the putative gRNA genes, libraries for NGS sequencing were constructed for small and large mitochondrial RNA fractions (<200 nt and >200 nt) as described in Materials and Methods. These reads were used to map onto all known minicircle sequences. All minicircle sequences are in the same polarity with the gRNAs in the 5' to 3' orientation. The encoded gRNAs are annotated below each respective minicircle as small boxes. The linearized minicircles are concatenated in tandem in an order determined by the positions of the various gRNAs in the editing cascades starting with the 3' most gRNAs. A 40 nt filler nucleotide sequence separates each minicircle. Several representative minicircle mapping images are shown in Fig 10 and the entire dataset can be seen in S8\u2013S11 Figs. Also, see S17\u2013S19 Figs for the complete dataset of mapping of short RNA reads from both strains to the 100 gRNA sequences directly.\nReads from the small mitochondrial RNA libraries were mapped against minicircle sequences using Bowtie. The linearized minicircles from both strains are concatenated head to tail with 20 nt spaces inserted for the mapping and indicated under the maps by dark blue tracts with the mc numbers. The locations of the putative encoded gRNA genes within the minicircles are also annotated by small blue boxes below each minicircle tract. VR refers to the \u201cvariable region\u201d of the minicircle. The minicircles are organized in groups of cascades according to the specific gene, the editing of which is mediated by the gRNA, and each minicircle is denoted by the \u201cmc number\u201d. The plus strand is light red and the minus strand blue. Lines were inserted to show that the putative gRNA genes line up with the corresponding peaks of gRNA reads. One gRNA peak (indicated by open arrow) was enlarged for better visualization of the flush 5\u2019 ends and the heterogeneous 3\u2019 ends.\nIn Fig 10, minicircles mc1-mc4 encode gRNAs involved in the CO3 cascade of editing and minicircles mc5\u2014mc7 encode gRNAs involved in the A6 cascade of editing. The reads are mapped using Bowtie to the concatenated linearized minicircle sequences. Lines are drawn from each encoded gRNA to indicate the putative mapped gRNA peak. The sizes of the mapped peaks indicate the number of reads that map to each region. It should be noted that in IGV the scales are automatically sized to fill the field. The variable region of each minicircle which contains the gRNA gene is annotated.\nInterestingly, there are additional peaks, both sense and antisense, not coincident with the gRNA genes and not conserved between minicircles. There are no striking differences in abundance of the steady state transcripts from either strand in the minicircle variable (VR) or conserved regions.\nThe mc4 mapped gRNA peak is shown expanded in Fig 10 to illustrate the fairly homogeneous 5\u2019 ends and the 3\u2019 end heterogeneity. The gND9X gRNA mapped peak is shown expanded to the nucleotide level in Fig 11 to illustrate that the mapped gRNA reads initiate 3\u20134 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the gRNA/mRNA complementarity. In some cases however the mapped gRNAs initiate a few nucleotides downstream of the gRNA/edited mRNA duplex start, but there is an overall preference for transcription initiation at the -3 and -4 positions, which are mainly A and C. In most cases due to the 3\u2019 heterogeneity, the reads only map to a portion of the 3\u2019 end of the gRNA gene. See S12\u2013S16 Figs for multiple examples.\nA mapped gRNA peak from mc71 encoding the gND9X gRNA is expanded to the nucleotide level to illustrate the characteristic 5\u2019 flush edge and 3\u2019 heterogeneity. Note that the major 5' start site is located 3 nt upstream of the 5' end of the identified gRNA/edited mRNA duplex. See Fig 10 legend for details.\nThe large RNA reads in many cases cover large portions if not the entire minicircles on both strands, as shown for three representative minicircles in Fig 12. The boxes in Fig 12 show the extensive expression of both strands covering almost the entire minicircle. This data suggests that transcription is bidirectional and complete, and, since the 5' end of the mature gRNAs is an unprocessed triphosphate [2], that 3' end processing is required for maturation of the gRNAs.\nThe light red is + strand and the blue is\u2014strand. The extensive mappings of steady state transcripts from both strands over almost the entire minicircle are shown boxed. See Fig 10 legend for details.\nSince any 3' oligo U tails were filtered from the Fastq sequences prior to mapping, the percent of bona fide gRNAs mapping cannot be determined, and it is possible that some of the mapped reads are derived from small RNAs that lack the 3' oligo U tail. This requires further investigation.\n\n\nSome minicircles do not encode gRNAs\ngRNA/mRNA duplex motifs for the L. tarentolae edited sequences could not be detected by computer analysis of mc101-mc114. However, putative gRNAs were identified in several of these minicircles for L. mexicana ND3 and G4 genes (mc102, 103, 110, 113, 114). As shown in Fig 13, in several minicircles without identifiable gRNAs (mc101, 104, 106, 107), peaks of mapped reads showing characteristics of gRNA peaks are present in the 240\u2013350 bp regions (circled in Fig 13 for mc106 and mc107), but analysis of the consensus read sequences of these peaks against mature edited mRNA sequences does not yield any gRNA/edited mRNA duplexes. The function of these peaks of reads is unknown. One possibility is that they encode gRNAs for misedited [59], partially edited [59] or alternatively edited [60] RNAs, but this was not investigated. The apparent absence of gRNA genes in some minicircles is a novel and puzzling finding which should be investigated further.\nMaps of 8 of the 14 minicircles (mc105-mc112) lacking identified L. tarentolae gRNAs are shown. The enigmatic gRNA-like mapped peaks in two of the minicircles are circled in red. See Fig 10 legend for details.\n\n\nMinicircle copy number and minicircle RNA\nThe FPKM method was used to quantitate the mapped steady state expression products. Fig 14 shows the expression of specific total minicircle steady state transcripts as a percentage of total minicircle expression for both strains. Fig 15 shows the expression of specific gRNA steady state transcripts as percentage of total gRNA transcripts. There is as much as a 10 fold variation in the abundance of steady state transcripts between different classes in both strains, but there is no correlation between relative abundance of transcripts and minicircle function such as location of the gRNA in the editing cascades. In general the UC strain shows a higher relative abundance of transcripts than the LEM125. The gRNA distribution in Fig 15 differs significantly from the minicircle transcript distribution in Fig 14, which could be a function of rates of transcription and turnover.\nLEM125 (light red) and UC (blue) minicircle steady state transcripts as percentage of total minicircle steady state transcripts. The minicircle numbers are shown below and the minicircles are grouped according to the gene the editing of which is mediated by the encoded gRNAs.\nLEM125 and UC steady state gRNA transcripts as percentage of total steady state gRNA transcripts. The names of the gRNAs are shown below and the gRNAs are grouped as in Fig 14.\nOne possibility for these observations might be the minicircle copy number differences. The data in Figs 16 and 17 compare the percent expression of total minicircle and gRNA steady state transcripts to the percent of the different minicircle sequence classes in the network for both strains. The most abundant LEM125 minicircle class (mc67) shows the largest extent of expression, but the second most abundant minicircle class (mc49) shows relatively little expression. In general, LEM125 minicircle copy number and LEM125 (Fig 16) minicircle expression of steady state transcripts show a moderate positive Pearson correlation [61] (r = 0.6233) while the correlation in the case of the UC strain (Fig 17) is somewhat weaker (r = 0.4971). Scatter plots of this data are shown in Fig 18.\nPercent expression of steady state total minicircle transcripts compared to percent of LEM125 minicircle DNA per network. Minicircle percent data from are Fig 3. See Fig 14 legend for details.\nPercent expression of steady state gRNA transcripts compared to percent of UC minicircle DNA per network. Minicircle percent data are from Fig 3. See Fig 14 legend for details.\nEach minicircle shown in blue with fit line in pink. R = 0.62 for LEM, R = 0.50 for UC.\nAnother possibility is that individual minicircles in different sequence classes may differ innately in expression. Fig 19 shows the normalized total minicircle steady state transcript abundance divided by the LEM125 minicircle copy number and Fig 20 shows the same data for the UC minicircles. In both there is a large variation in transcript abundance for different minicircles and there is no apparent gRNA functional correlation. A similar analysis of expression of the normalized steady state minicircle gRNA is shown in Fig 21 for LEM125 and Fig 22 for the UC strain.\nSee Fig 14 legend for details.\nSee Fig 14 legend for details.\nSee Fig 14 legend for details.\nSee Fig 14 legend for details.\n\n\nExpression of the maxicircle genome\nMaxicircle genes are encoded on both strands and some genes overlap (Fig 23). Seven gRNAs are also encoded in the maxicircle (blue arrows) (eight including the CO2 in cis gRNA sequence). There is also a large variable or divergent region with AT-rich repetitive sequences that vary in size and sequence between trypanosomatid species and the function of which is unknown.\nRibosomal RNAs are in yellow, structural genes and cryptogenes are in green, divergent (variable) region is in pink. Maxicircle-encoded gRNAs are in blue. Polarity is indicated by the arrow (right = plus strand, left = minus strand). \u201cPER\u201d indicates the pre-edited regions.\nTwelve of the 18 pre-edited structural genes are edited post transcriptionally and termed \u201ccryptogenes\u201d, and the remainder are termed \u201cnever edited\u201d. Both are shown in green in Fig 23 and the never edited genes are in orange in the right panels in Figs 24 and 25.\nThe plus strands are in the upper panel and the minus strands in the lower panel. The location and polarity of each gene are indicated in the table on the right. The different classes of genes are color coded: rRNAs are in yellow, never-edited genes are in orange, pan edited genes are in dark green, 5' edited genes are in light green, Divergent Region is in red. Note that the never edited genes are in orange rather than green as in Fig 23.\nSee Fig 24 legend for details.\nLittle is known about transcription of maxicircle genes, other that there are some polycistronic transcripts which must be processed [62, 63]. Transcription of the gRNAs has the additional complication in that the gRNAs encoded in the maxicircle have 5\u2019 triphosphates, as in the case of minicircle-encoded gRNAs [2] and may represent primary transcripts, but promoters have not been identified 5' of the gRNA genes.\nLarge RNA libraries from both strains were mapped to the maxicircle genomic sequence. As shown in the example in Fig 24 and Fig 25, there are no significant differences between the mapping of steady state RNAs between the strains. The polarity and identity of each gene are shown on the right.\n\n\nMapping of RNA reads to pre-edited and mature pan-edited genes\nTo study strain variations in the extent of editing of the maxicircle gene transcripts, we performed mapping of RNA reads from both strains onto the pre-edited (i.e., genomic) and mature edited maxicircle gene sequences. In most cases the large RNA reads were used, but the small RNA reads gave better visualization for the ND8 and G4 genes. See S20 and S21 Figs for the complete dataset of IGV mapping images. Fig 26 shows a representative mapping experiment using the ND9 pre-edited and edited sequences and large RNA reads from both strains. The absence of ND9 editing in the lower right panel is clear. An FPKM analysis of the mapping data of all pre-edited and mature edited maxicircle genes for both strains is shown in Fig 27. The LEM125 strain shows barely detectable levels of editing for A6, G3, G4 and ND8, which is puzzling since there are complete cascades of minicircle-encoded overlapping gRNAs for A6, and ND8 (Figs 7 and 8). However, since edited sequences were previously obtained by RT PCR for the LEM125 A6, ND8 and G4 genes in our 1994 project [40], lack of detection in the current experiments may be due to a low level of expression and/or an insufficient number of reads in the database for detection. The LEM125 G4 editing cascade, however, apparently lacks two overlapping gRNAs (Fig 9), the loss of which would break the editing cascade. It is of course possible that the database of reads is also insufficient to detect G4 gRNAs, but it is also possible that the specific minicircle classes encoding these two G4 gRNAs were lost in the last 20 years of sporadic culture of LEM125 cells. In the case of the UC strain, however, the absence of editing of ND3, ND8, ND9, G3 and G4 is consistent with the lack of cascades of overlapping minicircle-encoded gRNAs for these genes (Figs 8 and 9).\nNote the apparent absence of a UC peak for ND9 edited.\nA.

    "Discussion": "Due to the presence of only a single gRNA gene per minicircle, the ease of culture and the availability of strains which differ in editing capabilities, the non-pathogenic lizard parasite, L. tarentolae, provides a model system to investigate this type of RNA editing. The number of catenated minicircles in the kDNA network doubles during S phase and halves in M phase. The network is attached to the mitochondrial membrane and flagellar basal body by a fibrillar apparatus [30, 31]. Minicircles are removed from the network and replicated and recatenated to the periphery at two antipodal sites [64]. The copy numbers of the different minicircle sequence classes in the network fluctuate in nature even during life in culture [37], which has been utilized in \"schizodeme analysis\" [65] in which gel profiles of restriction enzyme digested kDNA can be used to distinguish strains of trypanosomatid parasites.\nThe number of 800\u20131000 nt PacBio CCS sequences derived from single cleaved kinetoplast DNA minicircles of the LEM125 and UC strains which assembled into different minicircle sequences provided a method to quantitate the copy number of different minicircle sequence classes in the network. We confirmed that the number of classes varies dramatically between the UC strain and the LEM125 strain, from around 20\u201324 for the former to well over 100 for the latter. Multiple alignments of the sequences that assembled into different minicircle sequence classes showed a background of single nucleotide insertions, deletions and substitutions produced in part by sequencing errors, but 61% of the assemblies contained conserved patterns of single nucleotide substitutions. The model is that an original minicircle for a specific gRNA had multiple single nucleotide mutations and that these were preserved after multiple rounds of replication of the molecules. We have calculated that it is very unlikely that these have arisen by chance, suggesting that these changes conferred some type of selective advantage on these cells in culture, the nature of which is unknown.\nThe gRNA genes which were putatively identified by complementarity with mature edited mRNA sequences, allowing both G/C and G/U base pairs, were shown to be present as steady state transcription products by showing that mitochondrial RNA reads mapped to these genes. The fact that the 5\u2019 ends of the mapped gRNA peaks are frequently flush suggests these are primary transcripts and is consistent with the previously described presence of 5\u2019 triphosphates [2]. However, no bacterial or mitochondrial promoter motifs could be recognized 5\u2019 of the gRNA genes, but the bent DNA region [56, 58, 66\u201379] which is located approximately 100 bp upstream of the gRNA genes in all minicircles is a possible candidate for transcription initiation since there is a fairly large literature [68, 80\u201382] on a role for DNA bending in binding transcription or replication factors and in transcription initiation, but this requires further research.\nThe fact that large RNAs map in some cases to almost the entire minicircle suggests complete transcription of the minicircle. The presence of substantial numbers of non-gRNA reads mapping to both the minus and plus strands suggests bidirectional transcription. Since these peaks contain no identifiable motifs and there is no conservation of the relative localization of these peaks between different minicircles, we suggest that they represent cleavage products of gRNA processing which are relatively more stable to degradation. It is possible however that they have a functional significance, but this remains to be investigated.\nThe heterogeneity of the 3\u2019 ends of the mapped gRNAs is consistent with 3\u2019 end processing yielding the mature gRNAs. A large proportion of the gRNA transcripts lack varying extents of the 3\u2019 end but these partial gRNAs are probably functional since the 5' anchor sequence is present and the edited region could then be extended by the complete gRNAs.\nAs mentioned above, there is a moderate level of correlation of transcription with minicircle copy number for the LEM125 strain and somewhat less for the UC strain. For example the LEM125 strain has a single minicircle class encoding a redundant gRNA, gND9VIIb, which represents approximately 20% of the minicircle population and shows a relatively high abundance of steady state transcripts. However, another minicircle representing 6% of the population does not show any enhanced transcript abundance. The remainder of the LEM minicircles vary in abundance from ~1%\u20132% and show relatively low variable amounts of steady state transcripts. The UC strain has two redundant minicircle classes encoding \u201corphan\u201d redundant gRNAs for gND3IX representing around 80% of the network which both show high levels of stable gRNA transcripts. This is also the case for a minicircle that represents 6% of the network, but on the other hand two minicircles which represent 6% and 3% of the network show no enhanced level of transcripts. The remainder of the ~24 UC minicircles vary in abundance from 1\u20135% without any correlation of expression with copy number.\nThe observed lack of a high correlation of gRNA expression with total minicircle expression suggests that processing and/or turnover may determine the relative abundance of mature gRNAs. And if the minicircle transcript counts for both strains are normalized on a per molecule basis there are fluctuations between steady state expression levels of different minicircles which have no correlation with network copy number. The nature of the regulation of minicircle expression is unknown.\nThe 114 identified LEM125 gRNAs and the 7 maxicircle-encoded gRNAs form multiple overlapping editing cascades on the pan-edited genes in LEM125. Most of these cascades are functional in editing in this strain and yield mature pan-edited RNAs for RPS12, ND3 and ND9, as determined by mapping RNA reads to mature edited sequences. However, the very low levels of editing of A6, ND8 and G4 in LEM125 in spite of the presence of apparently complete gRNA cascades (Figs 7\u20139) possibly suggest either an incomplete database of reads or the absence of specific gRNAs which breaks the editing cascade, possibly by loss of the minicircle sequence classes in the 20 years when LEM125 was sporadically cultured. Another possibility is the existence of another level of regulation of expression. In the case of the UC strain the ~24 minicircle-encoded gRNAs only form overlapping cascades with A6 and RPS12, which is consistent with the observed absence of editing for ND3, ND8, ND9, G3 and G4. The lack of editing for G3 in both strains is tentative since there are indications of possible errors in the edited sequence [41].\nThe lack of editing of several respiratory complex I NADH dehydrogenase subunit genes of the UC strain is reminiscent of the situation in T. brucei in which insect phase procyclic trypanosomes possibly show developmental down regulation of editing of the NADH dehydrogenase genes. These cells were in fact shown to lack complete gRNA cascades for these genes [42], possibly indicating a loss of minicircle sequence classes. In Leishmania, cultured cells exhibit the promastigote form which is characteristic of the midgut stages in the sandfly vector, and, in view of the T. brucei data, NADH dehydrogenase may not be required for life in culture. This suggests a possible explanation for the observed loss of some minicircle-encoded gRNAs for editing of these genes in culture [37]. It should be noted that both the African trypanosome and Leishmania species show several additional developmental changes during the life cycles in the insect and vertebrate hosts and these different stages of the life cycle may exhibit different expression of mitochondrial proteins and in some cases different extents of RNA editing of maxicircle transcripts [83].\nWe have analyzed the unusual mitochondrial genome of L. tarentolae in which 12 of the 18 maxicircle-encoded genes contain multiple frameshifts that are normally corrected at the RNA level by U-insertion/deletion RNA editing regulated by base pairing with small guide RNAs which are mainly encoded in the thousands of catenated minicircles. We presented mapping evidence that the minicircles are apparently completely transcribed from both strands with 3' end processing yielding mature gRNAs. The size, location and polarity of the gRNA genes relative to the CSB and \"bend\" sequences are fairly well conserved. The minicircles form multiple homologous \"sequence classes\" which each encode a specific gRNA (or redundant gRNA). The number of different sequence classes varies from over 100 in the recently isolated LEM125 strain to only around 20 in the old laboratory UC strain. The frequency of minicircles in different sequence classes is dynamic and can in some cases vary dramatically. A few minicircles apparently do not encode gRNAs. We showed by mapping pre-edited and edited maxicircle sequences that the UC strain lacks editing of five genes, which can be explained as due to the loss of multiple minicircle classes normally encoding gRNAs involved in these editing cascades.\nThis data suggests that kinetoplastid U-insertion/deletion RNA editing is a dynamic genetic feature. This is probably due to the presence of maxicircle cryptogenes with multiple frameshifts and gRNA genes mainly encoded by minicircles that specify in trans by base pairing the information for the precise insertion/deletion of U-residues to overcome the encoded frameshifts."
