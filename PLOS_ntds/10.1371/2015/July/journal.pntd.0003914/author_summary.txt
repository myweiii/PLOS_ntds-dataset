More than 1 million new cases of leishmaniasis occur throughout the world every year. Leishmaniasis typically presents as one of two clinical forms, either cutaneous or visceral. Dogs harboring Leishmania act as reservoirs, and are closely associated with human infections in South America and southern Europe. Therefore, immunization of dogs with effective vaccines against Leishmania will also effectively prevent Leishmania infection in humans. In this study, we have evaluated the utility of recombinant canine distemper viruses (CDVs) that express Leishmania antigen as effective polyvalent candidate vaccines against CDV and cutaneous Leishmania infections. The results indicated that recombinant CDV completely protected against challenge with a virulent strain of CDV. Furthermore, mixed immunization with three recombinant CDVs that express different antigens that mediate distinct immune responses, significantly reduced the nodule size after Leishmania major challenge. These results strongly suggest that a cocktail of multiple antigens confers more effective immunity throughout the life cycle of Leishmania. We propose that a combination of recombinant CDV-based vaccines expressing different antigens has utility as a polyvalent vaccine for the prevention of leishmaniasis epidemics by inhibiting the transmission of the parasites through dogs.
