Leprosy is an endemic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that predominantly attacks both skin and peripheral nerves, resulting in persistent distal hand atrophy and the loss of sensory and autonomic functions. In this study, we employ a noninvasive tool named transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to map the handgrip muscle representation in the primary motor cortex of patients affected by leprosy. The findings of this study support that the decrease or loss of sensory afferent neurons and/or impairment in the strength of peripheral muscles in the ulnar/median territory verified in leprosy patients alters the handgrip function leading to cortical motor reorganization in the corresponding affected hand muscles.
