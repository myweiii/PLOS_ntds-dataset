Snake envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that affects hundreds of thousands of people in the rural tropics. Antivenom is the main treatment for snake bites but there is limited information on the pharmacokinetics and appropriate dosing regimen. Most studies have been done in animals and dosing guidelines are based on arbitrary and often irreversible clinical signs. In this study we measured serial antivenom concentrations in patients with Russellâ€™s viper envenoming given antivenom. Using this data we modelled the pharmacokinetics of antivenom in the population and showed that antivenom concentrations had a bi-exponential decay with an initial decrease over 12 hours and then a slow decrease over days. There was significant variability in the dose given which was not affected by the particular antivenom batch given. The presence of venom did not appear to modify the pharmacokinetics of antivenom. Understanding the time course of antivenom in patients with snake envenoming will provide a better basis for antivenom dosing.
