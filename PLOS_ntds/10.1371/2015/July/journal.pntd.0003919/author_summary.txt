Human cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the parasite Taenia solium. This disease is responsible for severe health disorders such as seizures, and in some cases even death. T. solium cysticercosis is endemic in countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia where conditions such as inadequate hygiene, poor sanitary conditions, open defecation, free roaming pigs and poverty permit the transmission of the disease. Diagnostic tools are capable of detecting exposure to eggs and infection levels in a population through antibody and antigen detection, respectively. This review focused on gathering epidemiological data from endemic communities in Africa, Latin America and Asia in order to understand the causes of the observed variations in exposure/infection patterns in endemic regions. Similar antibody seroprevalences were observed worldwide while infection prevalences varied significantly within each region. Intrinsic factors such as age and immunity were determining factors for the occurrence of infections, while exposure was related to environmental factors which varied from region to region. Understanding the epidemiology of cysticercosis in endemic regions will help expose information on the transmission, which could in turn be used to design appropriate control programs.
