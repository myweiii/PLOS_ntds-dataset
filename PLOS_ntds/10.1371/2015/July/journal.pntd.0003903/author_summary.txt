Dengue virus (DENV) infects 390 million humans annually, and is the cause of one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in the world. Currently, there are no available licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs for dengue, so development of safe vaccine and effective therapy is urgently needed. Here, we identified two monoclonal antibodies, DB21-6 and DB39-2, which can enhance DENV1-4 infection and increase virus-induced mortality in AG129 mice. We found that serum samples from patients with severe dengue disease contain higher levels of antibodies against enhancing epitope. We proceeeded to identify enhancing epitope on E protein, and developed DNA vaccines by substitution. The substituted DNA vaccine with mutation at the enhancing epitope demonstrated augmented neutralizing activity against DENV2, and reduced enhancement of mortality as compared to wild type-immunized sera. Our results show that substitution of enhancing epitope can increase the immune response against viral infection, while reducing the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). These novel findings may be useful for developing safe and efficacious vaccines against dengue.
