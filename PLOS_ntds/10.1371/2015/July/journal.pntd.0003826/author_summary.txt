Trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity (CO) are chronic stages of trachoma, which remains an important cause of blindness. This study used multilevel spatial models to investigate risk factors for TT/CO in Nigeria, including data for more than 13,500 adults aged 40 years and above collected in the 2007 National Blindness and Visual Impairment survey. Individual-level risk factors were consistent with those identified in other studies, including a higher risk in females, older individuals and those with lower socioeconomic status. After controlling for these factors, there was evidence that a number of environmental and climatic factors are associated with the distribution of TT/CO in Nigeria. These findings establish for the Nigerian context the importance of risk factors at different scales for the later stages of trachoma, supporting anecdotal evidence that hotter, drier environmental conditions are associated with increased risk.
