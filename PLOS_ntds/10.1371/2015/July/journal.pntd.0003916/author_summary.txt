Chagas disease is a parasitic infection with high morbidity and mortality that is endemic in much of Latin America where it remains a serious public health problem. With increased migration, Chagas disease represents an emerging worldwide challenge and there is an urgent, unmet need for safe and effective medication. The available drugs to treat Chagas disease may be effective in the acute phase of the disease, but efficacy in the chronic phase remains controversial. They can cause serious side effects that lead sufferers to abandon treatment. Using a hypothesis-driven approach to molecular design and drawing on cysteine protease cruzain structural information, we have mapped structure-activity relationships for a dipeptidyl nitrile scaffold and demonstrated that compounds are competitive inhibitors, bind reversibly and bear trypanocidal activity. The binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the protein-ligand complex for one of the inhibitors shows that binding involves the formation of a covalent bond between the catalytic cysteine and the nitrile carbon. As such, we believe that our study represents a valuable step in the search for new drugs for the treatment of a neglected disease that continues to affect the lives of millions of people.
