Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is one of the neglected tropical diseases targeted by the international community for elimination. In Mexico, onchocerciasis was historically endemic in three foci, which included Northern Chiapias, Southern Chiapas and Oaxaca. Both the criteria for verification of elimination and for post-treatment surveillance developed by the international community rely heavily on the use of entomological metrics. The absence of evidence of ongoing transmission of the parasite three years after mass drug distribution has been halted is considered to be evidence that elimination efforts have been successful. In the present study, we report entomological assessments carried out in the three endemic foci in Mexico that were performed three years following the end of mass drug distribution in each focus. None of the over 100,000 Simulium ochraceum s.l. vector black flies collected from sentinel and extra-sentinel communities in these foci were found to contain parasite DNA, suggesting vector parasite contact was non-existent. This data suggest that elimination of onchocerciasis from Mexico has been achieved.
