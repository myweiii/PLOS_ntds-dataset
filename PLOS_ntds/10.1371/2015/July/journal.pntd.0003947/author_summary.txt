Dengue disease is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by Dengue virus (DENV), one of the most important human pathogens worldwide. DENV infection produces a systemic disease with a broad symptomatic spectrum ranging from mild febrile illness (Dengue Fever, DF) to severe haemorrhagic manifestations (Dengue Haemorrhagic fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome, DHF and DSS respectively). To date there is no vaccine available to prevent dengue disease. We show here a strategy of immunisation, tested in mice, that elicits a strong immune response against the four different DENV serotypes. The novelties presented in our work open the way to the development of an efficient vaccine accessible to developing countries.
