African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a major constraint to sustainable development of cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa. The habitat of the tsetse fly vector is increasingly fragmented owing to demographic pressure and shifts in climate, which leads to heterogeneous risk of transmission both in space and time. In Burkina Faso and Ghana, the most important vectors are riverine species that are more resilient to human-induced changes than savannah and forest tsetse species. Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of AAT risk remains an important task in order to design effective disease management approaches. The model developed in this research provides a fine-scale picture of the dynamics of AAT risk in sub-humid areas of West Africa. The output of the model is a risk index, the entomological inoculation rate, and it was validated against bovine trypanosomosis data using regression analysis. Parasitological status of cattle was accurately predicted, serological status was positively correlated but less accurately, whereas clinical case was not related to EIR. Our results show that the risk was high in the proximity of rivers during the dry season and more widespread during the rainy season.
