Dengue is a leading cause of morbidity in the tropics. As a commercial vaccine is not available, control or modification of the mosquito vectors is employed to prevent transmission. Strains of the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia affect the survival and ability of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti to transmit dengue. The Wolbachia strain wMelPop over-replicates within Ae. aegypti, inducing strong dengue virus blocking and early mortality of both egg and adult mosquitoes. We investigated whether this life-shortening Wolbachia strain can be used to eliminate local populations of Ae. aegypti in a semi-field cage. Our results indicate that Ae. aegypti eggs infected with wMelPop died at a significantly higher rate than uninfected eggs, and were nearly eliminated during a simulated dry season of 2â€“3 months. This suggests that that releases of wMelPop could facilitate control and elimination of Ae. aegypti if used in concert with vector control.
