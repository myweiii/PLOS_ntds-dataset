Malaria, schistosomiasis and intestinal helminths are parasitic diseases responsible for high morbidity and mortality in most tropical areas of the world. These parasitic diseases are common in Nigeria where people are co-infected with more than one parasite. This study investigate the prevalence and impact of these parasite co-infections in school age children in rural communities of Kwara State Nigeria. The result shows that over 61.0% of the school children had at least an infection of either P. falciparum, S. haematobium, or intestinal helminths with S. haematobium and P. falciparum accounting for the largest proportion of a single infection with 44.4% and 20.6% respectively. Children who were infected with S. haematobium (RR = 1.3) and hookworm (RR = 1.4) have equal chances of being infected with P. falciparum as children when compared with children with no infection. On the other hand children infected with Hymenolepis spp. (p<0.0001) have a higher chance of being infected with P. falciparum when compared to uninfected children (RR = 2.0). These findings suggest that Hymenolepis spp. may be associated with increase susceptibility to P. falciparum in this population of Nigeria children.
