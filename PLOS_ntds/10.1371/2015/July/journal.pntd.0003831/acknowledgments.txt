First we would like to acknowledge all children, teachers and school staff that participated and helped this study. Also, we would like to acknowledge the effort of all those who participated in the field studies: all 16 Biomedical Science students of the Polytechnic of Namibia, the 2 volunteers and the 22 MoHSS staff. We would like to thank the faculty and staff of Department of Biomedical Science at Polytechnic of Namibia for assistance with training location and supplies. Within the Namibian government, we would like to acknowledge first and foremost his excellency Dr. Richard Nchabi Kamwi MP, Minister of Health and Social Services, for formally inviting The END Fund as a partner in this large scale study, as well as the offices of the Permanent Secretary for Education, Mr. Alfred Ilukena, and Permanent Secretary for Health and Social Services, Mr. A. Ndishishi, for engaging and facilitating the development and implementation of the mapping. Within the MoHSS, we would like to acknowledge the effort and support from Ms. Sophie Nicodemus. The logistical and procurement support from the Liverpool Associates in Tropical Health team was invaluable: Susan Jones, Deborah Edwards, Clare Littlewood, Karin Delday, Justine Oâ€™Sullivan and Lindsay Troughton; this work could not have been done without you.
