Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic debilitating mycobacterial disease of the skin and soft tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is mainly found in tropical regions and often linked to poverty. BU can be cured in most cases with the standard treatment, a combination of rifampicin and the injectable antibiotic streptomycin. However, new optimized treatment regimens are needed, especially to prepare for an eventual development of resistance to rifampicin, the most efficacious drug for BU therapy. Since traditional antibacterial drug discovery is not a practical option for BU, using approved drugs for alternative clinical indications would be a more economical and faster way to implement new anti-BU therapies. We reported previously that anti-parasitic avermectins are active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we show that some are also active in vitro against other mycobacterial species, including M. marinum and M. ulcerans. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive approach to evaluate additional macrocyclic lactones including compounds used in veterinary medicine. Based on our in vitro measurements of their activities and a literature review of their pharmacokinetic properties, we present strong arguments that selamectin is the avermectin with the highest potential for being repurposed for BU treatment.
