Neurocysticercosis (NC) is caused by the implantation of the larval stage of Taenia solium in the human central nervous system. Although NC diagnosis, treatment, and prevention have clearly improved in the last 40 years, the disease still causes significant morbidity and mortality in endemic regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In industrialized countries, the number of diagnosed cases has increased in recent years due to immigration. In this paper, we introduce a new experimental model of T. solium neurocysticercosis in pigs. Activated oncospheres were surgically implanted in the subarachnoid space of the cerebral convexity in piglets. Then, the animals were observed during 4 months. An increase in anti-cysticercal antibodies was detected, along with an inflammatory reaction surrounding the established parasites. This experimental model of T. solium NC will improve our knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease; additionally, it will let us evaluate new promising treatments for inflammation and improve the effectiveness of cysticidal drugs.
