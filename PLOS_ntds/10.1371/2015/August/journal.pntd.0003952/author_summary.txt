The spirochete Leptospira causes leptospirosis, a potentially deadly disease of humans and animals. Candidate factors that promote infection include hemolysins encoded by several leptospiral genes. Hemolysins rupture red blood cells in vitro. Some hemolysins are sphingomyelinases, which target sphingomyelin in the host cell membrane. Hemolysins have the potential to disrupt organ function during infection. It is not known which hemolysins and sphingomyelinases are responsible for the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans. We found that the production of hemolytic activity is regulated and is tied to expression of sph2, which encodes a hemolysin with sphingomyelinase, cytotoxic, and fibronectin-binding activities. Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities and sph2 expression were higher when the osmolarity of the culture medium was raised to the level found in the mammalian host. Similarly, sph2 expression was substantially higher in an L. interrogans strain that secreted large amounts of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities than in a strain that generated negligible amounts. Most importantly, disruption of the sph2 gene eliminated hemolysin production and yielded substantially less sphingomyelinase than the wild-type strain. Our findings indicate that sph2 is a major contributor to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and that the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities measured in standard L. interrogans cultures may underestimate the levels produced during infection.
