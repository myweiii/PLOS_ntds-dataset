Anthrax, caused by the soil-borne bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a disease with important public health and national security implications globally. Understanding the global genetic diversity of the pathogen is important for epidemiological and forensic investigations of anthrax events. Toward this, we describe B. anthracis genetic diversity in Nigeria and confirm it belongs to a unique West African genetic group not yet reported beyond neighboring Cameroon and Chad and Mali. This refines the global phylogeny of B. anthracis, allowing the development of more accurate diagnostics. We coupled these efforts with ecological niche modeling to map the geographic distribution of this strain group across the region. Suitable habitat for the pathogen is predicted across central Nigeria from west to east into Cameroon and Chad. Understanding the geography of B. anthracis plays an important role in informing public health by targeting disease control to high risk regions. This is particularly important in resource limited areas where intervention strategies are constrained and zoonotic disease risk is high.
