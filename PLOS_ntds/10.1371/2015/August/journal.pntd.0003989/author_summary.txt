Snakebite is an important health problem in many rural communities in tropical countries. However, little is known about the lasting physical and mental health effects following a bite. We recently reported that mental problems, with harmful social outcomes, can occur in many people after they are bitten by a snake. As the affected are often poor farmers or manual workers, this may affect their livelihoods. We, therefore, performed a trial which looked at the effectiveness of short psychological interventions, lasting about 15 and 20 minutes, which can be provided by even non-specialist doctors, in reducing these mental and social problems in people bitten by snakes. Our results show that such interventions may indeed be helpful to reduce some of these problems, but more research is needed to improve these interventions, especially so that they that can reduce post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after snakebite.
