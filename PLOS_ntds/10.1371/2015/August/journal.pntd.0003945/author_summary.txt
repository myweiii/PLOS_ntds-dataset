Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by kissing bugs in endemic areas located in Central and South America. In its acute phase, the disease has unspecific and mild symptoms, whereas in the chronic phase infected individuals might develop severe cardiomyopathy. For many years, different cell types have been under investigation as alternatives for the treatment of several diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are one of these cell types. As our understanding of MSC biology increases, their properties might be explored in different disease contexts. Since Chagas disease is characterized by intense inflammation and one of the key properties of MSC is the modulation of the immune system, our work investigated the effect of injecting MSC in a mouse model of Chagas disease. Our results show that MSC improved the control of parasite burden and cardiac inflammation, leading to the prevention of cardiac dilation.
