Successful population control of mosquitoes is key to preventing transmission and epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases. This strategy relies heavily on insecticides, particularly pyrethroids. However, widespread pyrethroid resistance has hindered vector control implementation and sustainability. Generally, pyrethroid resistance in insects is mainly caused by target-site insensitivity and metabolic resistance. Although studies on the two resistance mechanisms have provided insights, how the target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms jointly confer the resistance phenotype has remained unclear. Understanding the mechanism of resistance to insecticides is essential for vector control measures. Our study investigated the development of resistance to a pyrethroid in three mosquito lines by varying the intensity of selection between lines (intense selection, mild selection and no selection) and then tracking changes in kdr frequency and the activities of three families of metabolic detoxification enzymes over time. These findings may lead to the development of more appropriate use of insecticides and more accurate resistance monitoring systems in the field.
