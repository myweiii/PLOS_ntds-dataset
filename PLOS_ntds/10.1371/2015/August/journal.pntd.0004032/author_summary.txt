Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), one of the most prevalent mycoses in Latin America, is caused by the thermodimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is thought to infect the host through the respiratory tract. Cell wall components of P. brasiliensis interact with host cells producing granulomas, thus influencing the pathogenesis of PCM. PbPga1 is an O-glycosylated, GPI-anchored protein that is localized on the yeast cell surface and is up-regulated in the pathogenic yeast form. GPI anchored proteins are involved in cell-cell and cell-tissue adhesion and have a key role in the interaction between fungal and host cells. In the present study, the authors show that both macrophages and mast cells are associated with the P.brasiliensis granulomas. Furthermore, recombinant PbPga1 was able to activate both alveolar macrophages and mast cells via the transcription factor NFkB to release inflammatory mediators. The results of this study indicate that the surface antigen, PbPga1, may play an important role in PCM pathogenesis by activating macrophages and mast cells. Additionally, PbPga1 may be a target for new strategies for detecting and treating PCM.
