The majority of human pathogens are of animal origin, i.e. zoonoses; both domestic and wild animals act as host reservoirs. Epidemiological surveys of wildlife may help to predict, prevent and control putative episodes of emerging zoonoses. Microbial diversity and their interactions at both the individual and population level may influence epidemiological infections. Developing generic approaches able to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens without any a priori information becomes essential. Here, we assess the relative efficacy of distinct next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to survey neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations: RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S-metagenomics, with the latter resolved via two sequencing techniques, 454-pyrosequencing and MiSeq. The resulting data generated a thorough inventory of zoonotic bacteria in the rodent sample without any previous knowledge of their presence. We concluded that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in bacterial genus detection. Nevertheless, only the 16S approach was able to determine bacterial diversity in each individual, which then permitted the derivation of bacterial prevalence and interaction patterns within host populations. We are persuaded that NGS techniques are very affordable candidates and could become routine approaches in future large-scale epidemiological studies.
