We thank Prof. J. Webster for access to the raw microsatellite data of Kokry-Bozo (Mali) and the Schistosomiasis Collection team at the Natural History Museum in London (SCAN) for providing S. mansoni worms. We are grateful to all villagers in Senegal for their cooperation and thank the Senegalese field team (M Diop, A Fall, N Sy, M Wade, A Yague) for their dedicated help with the fieldwork.
