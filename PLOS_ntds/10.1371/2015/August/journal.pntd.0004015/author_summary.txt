Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million people worldwide and causes more than 280,000 deaths per year. Current control strategies are based on chemotherapy, but recurrent reinfection of people living in endemic areas makes researchers search for an effective vaccine to provide long-term protection against schistosomiasis. The generation of long-lived high-affinity antibodies after vaccination is a pivotal step for anti-schistosome vaccine to eliminate schistosomiasis. Considering it is well-known that Tfh cells are specialized effector CD4+ T cells that provide help for germinal center (GC) formation and induce GC B cells to develop protective antibody responses, understanding the biology of Tfh cells in schistosomiasis patients is fundamental for vaccine strategy development. Here, for the first time, we documented increased frequencies of total and activated peripheral memory Tfh cells in schistosomiasis patients. Furthermore, we showed that Tfh2 cells were a major contributor to increased frequency of peripheral memory Tfh cells in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. More importantly, we found the significant correlations of the percentage of Tfh2 cells with both the frequency of plasma cells and the level of total IgG antibody in schistosomiasis patients.
