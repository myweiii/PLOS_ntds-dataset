Scrub typhus is a serious, neglected tropical disease that is endemic in large parts of Asia and northern Australia. It is caused by the bacterium O. tsutsugamushi, which is maintained in Leptotrombiculid mites, small arthropods that occasionally bite humans and transmit the disease. O. tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium, which means that it can only survive and grow when it is physically enclosed within a cell, both when it is living in its vector mite, and when it is living in the human or other mammalian host. This makes it difficult to work with in the laboratory, as it needs to be cultured together with host cells. This technical difficulty is one reason why our understanding of this human pathogen is less well-developed than for many other pathogens of equivalent incidence and severity. Here, we have performed a body of work that was designed to measure and improve methods for growing these bacteria in the laboratory, purifying the bacteria from their host cells without damaging them, and preserving bacteria for long periods of time by cryopreservation. This work will support future efforts to understand the basic science behind this and similar intracellular human pathogens.
