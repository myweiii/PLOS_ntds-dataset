Scrub typhus is a common cause of fever in rural Asia where there is limited access to healthcare, diagnostics, and treatment. It is thought that up to 1 million cases occur per year, but the disease is difficult to differentiate clinically from other infections, such as leptospirosis and dengue, meaning that many infections go undiagnosed and untreated. This review systematically summarizes the literature on the untreated mortality of scrub typhus and describes the outcome from untreated disease. Many articles had incomplete data and relied on a clinical diagnosis of disease, but results showed that scrub typhus is associated with a lower mortality than previously described, at approximately 6%, ranging from 0â€“70%. Further information is required to clarify the mortality according to location, host factors, and clinical syndromes. More widespread access to medical care, coupled with the increased use of affordable and accurate rapid tests, would improve the diagnosis and treatment of scrub typhus. Increased surveillance and investigation into differences in strain virulence by region are required to reliably quantify DALYs and the disease burden from scrub typhus, and to guide empirical treatment strategies.
