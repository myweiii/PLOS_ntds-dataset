Plasmodium vivax malaria is a debilitating, occasionally life-threatening, and economically burdensome disease in Central Latin America, where 70%- 80% of the population lives with the risk of infection. We performed a gene expression profiling experiment taking advantage of a previously described sporozoite challenge experiment in Cali, Colombia that reported more severe malaria symptoms in subjects who have never experienced malaria. We show that no major differences are seen in the transcriptomes of uninfected naïve and semi-immune volunteers prior to infection, but differential expression of both neutrophil and interferon-related genes was evident at onset of malaria. Several hundred genes showed a stronger response in the naïve individuals just as parasites appear in the peripheral blood, and these fall into several pathways of interest. These findings show how information from gene expression profiling of whole blood can reveal the type and duration of the immune response to P. vivax infection, and highlights a subset of genes that may mediate adaptive immunity in chronically exposed individuals.
