Members of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group, including tick-borne encephalitis virus, remain a significant cause of human disease and are responsible for at least 10,000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis each year. One of the principal questions in their epidemiology is how they persist from year to year in a given area. To attempt to explain the long-term maintenance of members of this group, we exposed Ornithodoros parkeri, O. sonrai, and O. tartakovskyi ticks to Karshi virus, a member of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. Ticks were exposed to Karshi virus either by allowing them to feed on viremic suckling mice or by intracoelomic inoculation. To determine their ability to maintain the virus for an extended period of time and to transmit Karshi virus, ticks were allowed to feed individually on suckling mice after various periods of extrinsic incubation. Ticks exposed to Karshi virus, either orally or by inoculation, remained efficient vectors of Karshi virus, even when tested >2,900 days (approximately 8 years) after their initial exposure to virus. Therefore, these ticks may serve as a long-term maintenance mechanism for Karshi virus and potentially other members of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group.
