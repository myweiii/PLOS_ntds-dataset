The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was created in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases (PRDs) of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. EDCTP funds research focusing on clinical trials for diagnosing, preventing and treating these diseases. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to 1) measure research output and citation impact from European and African researchers working on PRDs, 2) describe collaboration patterns, and 3) assess the citation impact of research funded by EDCTP. Citation analysis is a commonly used bibliometric tool to analyse scientific literature. Overall, the volume and citation impact of papers from sub-Saharan Africa has increased since 2003, as has collaborative research between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. Papers arising from collaborative research had a higher citation impact than non-collaborative research and >90% of publications from EDCTP-funded research projects were published in high-impact journals. These results suggest that research on PRDs in sub-Saharan Africa is growing and that the EDCTP partnership contributes to high-impact, collaborative research published in high-impact journals. By providing research funds and supporting activities to strengthen the research environment, the partnership contributes to sub-Saharan African researchers taking the lead in PRD research.
