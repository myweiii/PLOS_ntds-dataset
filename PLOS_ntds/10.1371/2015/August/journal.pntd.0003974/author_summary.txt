Elimination of domiciliated vectors led to a decreased prevalence of Chagas disease in parts of Latin America. In Central America, where the domiciliated vector Rhodnius prolixus has been almost eliminated, Triatoma dimidiata, which cannot be eliminated, continues to threaten the population in vast areas. To maintain the risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi at lowest levels despite limited resources, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras integrated community-based vector surveillance into local health systems. One challenge to sustaining surveillance is to ensure continuous responsiveness to reports of household infestation from the community. Our research in 12 study areas in the three countries over a five-year period investigated eight potential determinants of health service responsiveness, including volume of vector notifications, local geography, demography, manpower, and managerial approach. We found that consistent (quarterly) monitoring by departmental personnel within the local health services was associated with high response rates. Results of interviews added additional insight.
