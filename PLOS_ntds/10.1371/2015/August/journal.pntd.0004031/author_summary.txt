The type six-secretion system (T6SS) is a molecular syringe that many Gram-negative pathogens use to kill other bacteria, including commensal bacteria of the human gut. We investigated how the environment of the intestine, specifically commensal bacteria, the mucus lining, and bile affect the T6SS of the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae. First, we showed that the mucins, a family of proteins ubiquitously found in the intestine, activate the T6SS thereby allowing V. cholerae to kill other bacteria. Second, we showed that the magnitude of killing is regulated by bile acids. Certain bile acids produced by the host decrease the killing of bacteria by the V. cholerae T6SS. Last, we demonstrated that prominent members of the host microbiota metabolize these bile acids that enhance bacterial killing by V. cholerae into bile acids that diminish the bacterial killing effects of the T6SS. Our study suggests that the gut microbiota is an important first line of defense against bacterial pathogens, and that this line of defense may be impaired in individuals in poor health. Promoting a healthy microbial environment in the gut could play a role in counteracting cholera by reducing the ability of Vibrio cholerae to compete in the gut.
