In this study we examine the treatment of the intestinal worm infection Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil transmitted helminth that is common in the developing world and in the Aboriginal communities of northern Australia. Oral ivermectin is generally accepted as the treatment of choice for this condition. We screened an Aboriginal community for Strongyloides infection over the course of 2 years and measured the outcome of treatment in the 92 cases we found. This study measures the success or otherwise of treatment, and looks at whether there are any factors that could influence the rate of treatment failure. The results suggest that ivermectin is an effective treatment for Strongyloides in this setting, and that pre-existing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a risk factor for treatment failure, an observation of great interest in Aboriginal communities where the prevalence of both conditions is very high. We discuss some possible mechanisms to help explain this previously unknown relationship.
