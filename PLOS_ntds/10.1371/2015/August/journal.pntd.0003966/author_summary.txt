Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected but deadly disease occurring in north-eastern India, the south-eastern lowland of Nepal, and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh; all part of the Lower Gangetic plains. Districts at higher altitude, such as those situated in the foothills of the Himalaya in Nepal, are considered non-endemic. Consequently, diagnostic, therapeutic and surveillance facilities are not available, and sporadic cases of VL occurring in residents of these districts are considered the result of Leishmania donovani infection during travel. This parasite is transmitted from man to man through the bite of a sand fly, Phlebotomus argentipes. To investigate the increasing number of cases reported from some villages in the Nepal hills, we interviewed former VL cases, as well as their healthy co-villagers, on their history of travel, we checked their blood for signs of infection, and we set traps to capture sand flies. We found that many residents had been infected, symptomatically as well as asymptomatically, regardless of travelling to endemic areas. Moreover, we managed to capture sand flies and found DNA of leishmania parasites inside. This proves that there is indeed ongoing local transmission in hill districts and that surveillance and control activities should be extended.
