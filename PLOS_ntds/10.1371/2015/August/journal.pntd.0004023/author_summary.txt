Remarkable advances have been made in elucidating the pathogenesis of rabies. One of the hallmarks of rabies infection is that human patients do not develop VNA. In this present study, immune responses were investigated in dogs after infection with a highly attenuated RABV (TriGAS) or a highly pathogenic, truly wt RABV (DRV-NG11). DRV-NG11 was isolated from the brain of a rabid dog and has not been passaged in laboratory animals or in cell culture. IM infection of dogs with TriGAS induced early activation of DCs and B cells in the blood, and production of VNA in the periphery, whereas, IT infection with TriGAS induced a high level of VNA not only in the serum but also in the CSF. On the contrary, infection of dogs with DRV-NG11 failed to elicit VNA. As a result, none of the dogs infected with wt DRV-NG11 survived. The ability of DRV-NG11 to replicate and spread without triggering an immune response to glycoprotein is evidently an important facet of its pathogenicity.
