Mapping of lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by W. brancrofti is usually done by employing a rapid diagnostic test that permits the detection of worm antigen in daytime blood. This is sometimes combined with a thick blood film (TBF) for microscopic examination, as confirmatory tool for detecting W. bancrofti Mf in peripheral night blood. During recent epidemiological surveys using immunochromatographic card test (ICT) to map LF in areas highly endemic for loiasis, positive card tests were observed in individualsâ€™ amicrofilaremic for W. bancrofti during night TBF examination, as well as by parasite DNA detection. The possibility of ICT cross-reacting with L. loa antigen was envisaged, but so far associations between ICT positivity and L. loa endemicity levels and loads of Mf in day blood have not yet been established. Moreover, M. perstans another filaria with blood dwelling Mf, that is often sympatric with L. loa, could contribute to the observed ICT cross-reactivity. The authors investigated the cross-reactivity of ICT in areas with contrasting endemicity levels of L. loa and M. perstans in Cameroon. Results incriminated L. loa as the major confounder in ICT cross-reactivity, with significant association between ICT positivity and loiasis both at individual level (load of Mf/ml of blood) and endemicity level (Mf prevalence). M. perstans displayed no association with ICT positivity. The findings raised concerns about the specificity of the whole blood ICT used for LF mapping in loiasis co-endemic areas. The development of an algorithm for LF mapping in loiasis co-endemic areas will be important to validate the LF map obtained using ICT in Central Africa.
