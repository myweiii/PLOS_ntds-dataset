Soil-transmitted helminthiases are a group of parasitic diseases caused by intestinal worms that are linked to poor physical and cognitive development among preschool aged children. The administration of deworming drugs designed to reduce the intensity of the worm infection in the child is effective and efficient intervention to control the disease and has set the goal of deworming 75% of at-risk children by 2020. However, global WHO-reported coverage decreased from 37.1% to 24.7% from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, the first coverage estimate released was 23.9%, but as in previous years, this estimate did not adequately capture coverage achieved through Child Health Days, which are integrated campaign-style events where deworming is often co-delivered alongside vitamin A supplementation and other high impact child interventions. In this paper, we mailed a questionnaire to UNICEF country offices requesting data pertaining to preschool age deworming conducted through Child Health Days. After reviewing submissions and integrating data into the global databank, we report that the global coverage now stands at 49.4% putting us on track to achieve the global goal by 2020. The sharp increase in coverage illustrates the importance of Child Health Days for attaining global pre-SAC coverage goals.
