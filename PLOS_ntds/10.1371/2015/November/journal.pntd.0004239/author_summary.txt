In this study, we showed that, although pastoralist communities living in Ijara district of Kenya had a positive attitude towards RVF prevention, they had little knowledge regarding the vectors, transmission, and signs or symptoms of RVF. Community members were not aware that abortion of pregnant animals and high death of young animals are alarming signs of RVF. A gap between the recommended and actual practices was also observed, as the necessary preventive measures against RVF were not being practiced. Poor practices regarding RVF prevention were associated with low knowledge regarding the disease; thus improving knowledge could lead to better practices among livestock keepers. To help address these gaps and promote good knowledge on RVF, we recommend that relevant institutions carry out public awareness campaigns. Radio may play an important role in conveying such health information to the public. There is also need to identify and facilitate removal of barriers to behavioural change related to the prevention of RVF among the study population. If effected, these interventions will therefore impact positively on pastoralist communitiesâ€™ livelihoods, as disruptions of livestock market chains, which are a common occurrence whenever there is an outbreak of RVF, could become a thing of the past.
