There is clear evidence that visual impairment generally reduces quality of life. However, relatively little is known about the impact that trachomatous trichiasis (TT) has on the lives of affected people with and without the presence of visual impairment. We measured the impact of TT on vision and health-related quality of life in 1000 people with TT using standard WHO quantitative tools and compared these with 200 trichiasis-free controls, matched to every fifth trichiasis case on age, sex and location. We found TT cases had lower vision and health related quality of life than controls regardless of visual impairment and other health problems suggesting the burden of TT goes beyond visual loss. The results provide solid data for advocacy and encourage programme leaders and funders to secure resources to promote trichiasis intervention. Trichiasis causes considerable physical and psychosocial trauma including sleep disturbance, low self-esteem and possibly a less stable marriage regardless of visual impairment. These suggest that, timely treatment is needed not only to prevent visual loss but also alleviate physical and psychological suffering and social exclusion of TT patients, thereby improving their physical and psychological health, general functioning and social relations.
