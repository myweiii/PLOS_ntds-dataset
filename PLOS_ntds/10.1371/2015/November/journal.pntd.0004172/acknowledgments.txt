We are grateful for the support from the study communities, individuals and field/research assistants who helped in undertaking this study. The NTD Support Center at the Task Force for Global Health developed the LINKS system used for mobile data collection. We would also like to acknowledge four key individuals, from three organizations, Mr. John Gibb and Dr. Delna Gandhi from DFID, Dr. Julie Jacobson from BMGF and Ms. Ellen Agler from END FUND. Without their personal commitment to eliminating NTDs from Africa and their efforts to secure the financial support this project would not have been possible.
