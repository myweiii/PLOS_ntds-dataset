Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 is thought to be the sole causative agent for cholera in Bangladesh and most of the high risk developing countries. Whilst historically Vibrio cholerae serogroup O139 has been seen to cause sporadic disease, the overall numbers of reported O139 clinical cases are low, with none reported in Bangladesh since 2005. Here we report four patients suffering from cholera attributed to serogroup O139 V. cholerae. Cases 1 and 2 were symptomatic (isolated strains 1, 2), and cases 3 and 4 were asymptomatic (isolated strains 3, 4). All cases were from urban Dhaka and represented a range of age groups. Cases 2â€“4 presented with no sign of dehydration whereas case 1 showed some signs of dehydration. Phenotypic and whole genome sequence data indicates that one of the four O139 V. cholerae isolates represents a novel O139 subtype. Since natural infection with V. cholerae O1 or vaccination with currently available licensed cholera vaccines (e.g., Dukoral) provides little protection against O139, we conclude that V. cholerae O139 remains in circulation and is still causing a low incidence of cholera. Therefore, further studies looking at the significance of these isolates towards the total burden of cholera in Bangladesh is warranted, including clinical evaluation, genome sequencing and immunobiochemistry.
