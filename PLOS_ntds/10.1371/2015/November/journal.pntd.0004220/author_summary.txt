Leptospirosis, caused by a diversity of pathogenic species within the genus Leptospira, is a worldwide public health problem affecting both developed and developing countries. In 2003, the whole genome sequencing of pathogenic Leptospira interrogans strain 56601 opened the genomic research of this specific pathogen and accelerated genomic sequencing speed afterwards. The availability of whole genome sequences of the pathogenic species L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, saprophyte L. biflexa and the intermediate L. licerasiae, which represented three phylogenetic groups of Leptospira spp., has undoubtedly facilitated the understanding of the genetic complexity of this organism. Genome drafts of more than 300 strains have been released recently. The analysis of these sequences will provide invaluable information for understanding the evolution and adaption to various environment of the Leptospiraceae. Extrachromosomal replicons are important for communication of genetic information between bacteria. Despite first leptospiral genome was sequenced in 2003, these small auto-replicons, however, were not identified in the whole genome sequence of pathogenic L. interrogans until 2014. How to effectively identify the presence of small auto-replicons in Leptospira cell is a technical challenge which hinders researchers in fully understanding the complexity and diversity of Leptospira genomes. In this study, we report identification of small auto-replicons in 15 Leptospira strains endemic in China by S1-PFGE analysis, independent of genome sequence assembly. Further analysis suggested that these plasmids are widely presented in Leptospira species. The study, combined with the recently available genomic sequencing data, will help us to elucidate the diversity of Leptospira genomes and a deeper insight into evolutionary perspective of this unique clade of organism.
