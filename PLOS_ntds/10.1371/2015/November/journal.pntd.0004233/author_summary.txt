Filariae are predominantly tissue-dwelling nematodes of the Onchocercidae (Spirurida). They are parasites of terrestrial vertebrates and some of them are particularly well known as agents of human diseases in tropical environments (e.g. onchocercosis, lymphatic filariosis, loaosis). Because of their predilection for host tissue sites, filariae are difficult to collect and their diversity is far from being well-investigated. Given the lack of fossilized material, it is not possible to formulate a comprehensive evolutionary hypothesis for this group based exclusively on morphological studies. Molecular analyses on the other hand have so far been based on a limited number of filarial species only or have used genetic markers convenient for species differentiation but not for retracing filarial history. Thus a consistent evolutionary framework for this family is still not in place. The originality and strength of the present study rest within its ability to access an unusually large range of biological samples, comprising 48 species representing seven of the eight onchocercid subfamilies. Using a new multi-gene dataset analysis, five major clades within the family were defined, including i) a group of ancestrally-derived subfamilies, ii) Setariinae as a sister group to all remaining subfamilies and iii) one large clade comprising genera of the Dirofilariinae, Onchocercinae and Splendidofilariinae.
