Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that in Africa is maintained in populations of owned, free-roaming domestic dogs. Rabies can be controlled by mass vaccination, by ensuring that a certain proportion of the dog population is immune to the disease. Maintaining this proportion of immune animals creates herd immunity, reducing the spread of disease even among non-immune individuals, eventually leading to its elimination from the population. Maintaining herd immunity to rabies in free-roaming dog populations can be challenging, particularly in communities that lack regular access to veterinary services. In these communities, mass vaccination is usually implemented in annual campaigns, of relatively short duration. Between campaigns, the proportion of immune individuals in the population declines, often dropping below the critical threshold as vaccinated dogs die and susceptible dogs enter the population through birth or migration. We measured these rates of birth, death and migration in a typical population of free-roaming dogs in South Africa, and showed that vaccinating 70% of the population during annual campaigns would be sufficient to maintain herd immunity to rabies in the period between campaigns. This is achievable even in populations that have high turnover and are growing rapidlyâ€”the most challenging circumstances to maintaining herd immunity. These findings increase confidence in the feasibility of eliminating dog rabies from Africa through mass vaccination.
