We are indebted to all participants in this study who took time to answer our many questions and who accepted to provide a blood sample. We also wish to thank all members of the field team who lived in very basic conditions for 11 months while completing the baseline component of this study. Finally, this analysis would have not been possible without the support of Henri Som√© who programmed all the PDAs and carefully managed all the databases to minimize any possible errors.
