Vector control using releases of sterile insects is a well-known approach. ‘Genetically sterile’ male Aedes aegypti have been developed and released in a modern realisation of the sterile insect technique. Released engineered males seek out and mate with wild females, with the resultant offspring dying before they reach maturity. Control of a wild vector population can therefore be achieved by maintaining sustained releases of sterile males whilst ensuring sufficient distribution and coverage of released males across the target area. In order to efficiently plan releases of these, individuals’ detailed knowledge of how they disperse in the field is required. We present an analysis of the dispersal of these engineered male Aedes aegypti using data from field experiments in Brazil. Our results provide detailed information on how the mosquitoes disperse over their potential flight range.
