Murray Valley encephalitis virus is the most significant cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in humans in Australia, and can also cause neurological disease in horses. This study reports an expanded phylogenetic study of this virus and the first molecular evolutionary analysis. Of the four recognized genotypes of Murray Valley encephalitis virus, only two were found to be actively circulating (genotypes 1 and 2), and genotype 1 was dominant. Distinct genetic sub-lineages within genotype 1 were found to have recently emerged. Molecular clock analysis indicated that genotype 2 viruses are the oldest genetic lineage while genotype 1 viruses are the most recent to diverge. The co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages of this virus in northwestern Australia, comprising the oldest and youngest lineages, supports previous findings that MVEV circulates endemically in this region.
