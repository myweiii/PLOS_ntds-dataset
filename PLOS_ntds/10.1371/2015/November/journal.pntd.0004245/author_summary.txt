The Republic of Haiti has highest estimated burden of human rabies in the Western Hemisphere, at 130 estimated human deaths annually. Rabies surveillance systems in the majority of the developing world, including Haiti, are ineffective, resulting in underreporting of cases and contributing to the further neglect of this disease. In 2013 a passive rabies surveillance program was implemented in three of Haiti’s 140 communes near the nation’s capital city. Four animal rabies surveillance officers conducted 778 suspect animal rabies investigations in a two-year period and on average found a rabid animal for every 7.4 investigations. Prior to the implementation of this surveillance program Haiti reported an average of two canine and seven human rabies cases each year, for the entire country. This program identified 70 rabid animals and an additional 36 probable rabid animals in only a selected area of the country. These 106 cases represent an 18-fold increase in animal rabies reporting in Haiti. These findings support that canine rabies is a significant burden in Haiti and present data that can be used to improve human rabies burden estimations and enhance canine rabies control efforts.
