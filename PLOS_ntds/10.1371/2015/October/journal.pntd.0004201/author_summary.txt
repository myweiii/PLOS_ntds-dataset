African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) is caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T.b.gambiense. After infection through the bite of the tsetse fly vector, parasites initially disseminate in the blood and lymphatic systems, in what is known as the early or haemolymphatic stage of infection. However, as infection progresses some parasites enter the brain, initiating the late or meningoencephalitic stage of infection. This is a critical step in the progression of disease. In rodent model infections, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses associated with infection have been demonstrated to promote invasion of the brain and we predicted that this process may be inhibited by administration of the counter-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during the early stage of infection. We demonstrate that in IL-10-treated mice, trypanosome invasion of the brain is diminished and neuro-inflammatory pathology is reduced. As evidence suggests that systemic inflammatory responses are also associated with promotion of CNS invasion in human patients, we believe that our results offer the possibility of new treatments to delay brain involvement and to identify individuals at high risk of neuroinflammatory complications.
