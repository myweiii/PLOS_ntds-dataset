Increasing resistance to antimonials has paved the way for the oral drug miltefosine for PKDL treatment. Recent studies show a significant decline in the final cure rate of VL after miltefosine treatment in the Indian subcontinent. This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of miltefosine treatment in a large number of PKDL cases with 18 months follow-up. PKDL cases that completed miltefosine treatment responded well and showed initial cure; however, with 18 months of follow up period, the final cure rate was only about 85%. Treatment regimen based on high dosage over short duration resulted in high relapse rate. We observed that the parasites isolated from the cases that relapsed were more tolerant to miltefosine (>2 fold) compared to the isolates from pre-treatment stage. Estimation of parasite load at pre-treatment stage indicated that the patients with higher initial parasitic burden were at a higher risk of relapse. The declining efficacy of monotherapy with miltefosine warrants the need of alternate regimens for treatment of PKDL.
