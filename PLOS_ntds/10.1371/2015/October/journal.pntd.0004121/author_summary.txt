Tsetse flies transmit trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness. Visual baits to attract and kill tsetse are an important method of vector control, and the rational improvement of these baits depends on a mechanistic understanding of tsetse behaviour. Visual baits are often panels of insecticide-treated cloth which tsetse must contact to become dosed with insecticide. However, most of the tsetse that are attracted to approach visual baits circle them rather than landing. Colour is one factor that might be important in eliciting landing responses, and thus bait optimisation. Visually-driven tsetse behaviour can be understood by investigating how a flyâ€™s five types of photoreceptor respond to differently coloured baits, and determining how each of these photoreceptors contributes to behaviour. I applied this approach to data recorded in two previous field studies. I found that tsetse contacted visual baits due to two behavioural mechanisms: a comparison between the responses of several photoreceptors that underlies attraction and landing, and a UV photoreceptor-driven mechanism that likely drives dispersal towards open sky and causes tsetse to collide with visual baits accidentally. If the mechanistic basis of tsetse behaviour is understood, it may be possible to design baits that exploit these mechanisms and optimise tsetse control.
