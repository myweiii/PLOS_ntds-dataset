Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most relevant deep mycosis in Latin America, is caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The involvement of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the immunity against PCM has been previously demonstrated, however its underlying mechanisms are still to be elucidated. Using Foxp3GFP transgenic mice, we found that natural Tregs migrate to the lungs of infected mice, where they become activated. Depletion of Treg cells led to reduced fungal load, diminished pathogen dissemination and increased Th1/Th2/Th17 immunity. Further, after performing adoptive transfer experiments using immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice, we demonstrated that isolated CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells were able to confer some degree of immunoprotection and that CD4+Foxp3- T cells alone contributed to fungal elimination and enhanced T cell immunity, but induced vigorous inflammatory reactions in the lungs. Nevertheless, transfer of Tregs combined with CD4+Foxp3- T cells generated more efficient and balanced immune responses able to limit pathogen growth and excessive tissue inflammation, leading to regressive disease and higher survival rates. Altogether, these loss- and gain-of-function approaches allow us to propose a dual role for Treg cells in pulmonary PCM, their deleterious effects by impairing T cell immunity and pathogen eradication, and their protective role by suppressing exacerbated tissue inflammation.
