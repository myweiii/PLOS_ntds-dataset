In this study we demonstrated the binding of TconTS lectin domains (TconTS-LD) to high-mannose N-glycans and provide evidence for a biological function for this interaction. TconTS1 and TconTS2 lectin domain bind to galactosyl as well as mannosyl glycans with different affinities as shown by glycan array analysis. Along this line, we have also demonstrated binding of TconTS-LD to high-mannose N-glycans on glycoproteins, which is competitively inhibited by the corresponding free high-mannose N-glycans, underlining the TconTS-LD substrate specificities. TconTS1 dimerisation is mediated by TconTS-LD binding to its N-glycans and enzymatic N-deglycosylation of TconTS leads to an increase of monomers. STD NMR results obtained indicate that oligo-mannosylated glycans bind to TconTS-LD to a different site than lactose. In summary, this is good evidence that the lectin domains of TconTS1 and TconTS2 play relevant roles modulating the biological functions of these and possibly other trans-sialidases. Further detailed analysis on TconTS-LD and its role in enzyme activity will lead to a better understanding and possibly to new strategies against Nagana in livestock.
