Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the cause of an ongoing explosive outbreak of arthritic disease in the Americas. Related alphaviruses cause human/animal disease globally, yet no vaccines or antivirals exist for human use. Although numerous candidate vaccines and therapies are being developed, little is known about the specific viral targets of an effective host immune response. Previous studies have used peptide or monoclonal antibody approaches, which can have serious limitations. Chimeric viruses between closely related species are proven tools to study a variety of viral characteristics. Using this approach, we developed a panel of viruses, which highlight the importance of the alphavirus domain B in protection in mice and serum neutralization in humans. Previous work on flaviviruses has shown that subunit approaches can be effective for vaccination and diagnostic purposes. Thus, the use of E2 domains as vaccine antigens and in clinical diagnostics for alphaviruses warrants further study.
