Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease caused by the larval cysts of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium following accidental ingestion of tapeworm eggs. Neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of seizures and epilepsy in developing countries. The clinical manifestations depend on many factors including the number, size, location, stage of the parasites and host age, gender and immune responses. However, the most important determinant is whether the infection is restricted to the brain parenchyma (associated with seizures disorders but generally with a good prognosis) or if it involves the subarachnoid spaces in the brain (associated with an exuberant growth of the parasite, intracranial hypertension, and often resulting in mortality). In the current study, we characterized the relationship between T. solium specific immune responses and cyst location. We show that patients with subarachnoid disease have higher suppresive immune responses than the parenchymal group, potentially representing a parasite strategy to survive. Our findings implicate immune responses to be among the mechanisms that underlie the diverse clinical manifestations in neurocysticercosis.
