Monkeypox virus is a close relative of Variola virus, the agent of smallpox, and causes a similar disease in humans, with classic pox skin lesions. Up to 10% mortality has been associated with some strains of monkeypox. Monkeypox disease occurs in central and west Africa. It is transmitted to humans from wild animals, but the reservoir species that maintains this virus in nature has not been identified. The Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) was implicated as a possible source during the 2003 US monkeypox outbreak which resulted in human disease. To understand how the Gambian pouched rat could maintain and transmit the virus, six Gambian pouched rats were infected with Monkeypox virus engineered to express a marker gene, luciferase, which is detectable within the live animal via bioluminescence. Two animals served as uninfected controls. Viral shedding was quantified. Two of three animals infected via the intradermal route became clinically ill. Those infected intranasally showed no signs of disease, but the virus was detected in the nasal and oral cavities and distant sites within their bodies. All infected animals shed live Monkeypox virus. This study indicates that Gambian pouched rats could serve to transmit Monkeypox virus to humans in Africa.
