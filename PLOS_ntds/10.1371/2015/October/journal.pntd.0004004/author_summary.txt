Chromoblastomycosis is a severely mutilating disease caused commonly by two fungal species groups in Cladophialophora and Fonsecaea, which occur in arid climates or in the tropical rain forest, respectively. Understanding the population structure and evolution of chromoblastomycosis is important to reconstruct the epidemiological history and to identify evolutionary process and environmental drivers of disease spread. We used two sequence markers; internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and the partial ÃŸ-tubulin (BT2) gene, as well as AFLP markers, respectively, to investigate the population structure and differentiation of 73 C. carrionii strains and 60 strains of three Fonsecaea species. These agents of human disease have diverse distribution patterns and population dynamics even though they share a common ancestor within the order Chaetothyriales. It may be speculated that they have taken advantage of and adapted to human hosts as a new ecological niche.
