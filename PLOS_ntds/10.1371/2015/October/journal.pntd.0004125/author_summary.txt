Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of disease and deaths among young children. In Africa they contribute to more than one tenth of childhood deaths. Parasites like Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia are all common causes of diarrheal illness, but there are few studies on these enteroparasites among Tanzanian children. In this case-control study, we included 701 cases and 558 controls, all < 2 years of age, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We assessed the prevalence of C. parvum/hominis, E. histolytica and G. lamblia by PCR, and the association with potential risk factors such as demographic data, clinical symptoms, HIV status and seasonality. One or more parasites were found in 14.9% of the samples. C. parvum/ hominis and G. lamblia were found in 10.4% and 4.6%, respectively, while E. histolytica was not found in any of the samples. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium was high, particularly in children with HIV, and its prevalence increased during the rainy season. Among cases, Cryptosporidium was found more frequently in stunted children, although any causal association could not be established in the current study. G. lamblia was more often implicated in asymptomatic infections than in overt diarrheal illness. The prevalence of G. lamblia increased with age, and breastfeeding seemed to protect the children from G. lamblia. This study presents relevant information about the prevalence and clinical characteristics of these intestinal parasites in Tanzanian children.
