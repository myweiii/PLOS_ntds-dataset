Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects both the individual and the community as a whole. Its transmission and life cycle depend on non-safe water, as infection is acquired bathing in fresh water. As in many neglected diseases, information about it is scarce in many areas, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is the case in Angola, where a prolonged civil war has hampered development and research for many years. This paper highlights the epidemiology of the disease in Cubal, main town of a rural area in central Angola. It shows a very high prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in the school-age population of the area; the risk is higher among the children living closer to one source of water. This population must be considered as a high-risk community for the development of complications. We advocate for the use of indirect tests for diagnosis, as urine dipstick and colorimetric test, due to their easiness of use and low price. At the same time, it relates the presence of the disease with signs of severity that are usually observed at an older age, suggesting that prevention must be initiated as soon as possible. Overall, this paper will provide the research and medical community with essential data for future intervention strategies to manage schistosomiasis in the region.
