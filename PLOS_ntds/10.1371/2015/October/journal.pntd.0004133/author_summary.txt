Nodular worms frequently infect primates, pigs and ruminants. These intestinal nematodes induce inflammatory masses in the colon wall that cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and potential death. Through microscopic and molecular analyses, we studied the presence of nodular worms in three non-human primates (chimpanzees, baboons, black and white colobus) and humans inhabiting the Sebitoli area, at the extreme north of Kibale National Park in Uganda. Three different Oesophagostomum species were identified in the primates studied and we confirmed the existence of a recently described clade in baboons. Because the Sebitoli chimpanzees displayed a high prevalence of infection and because a high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and apes occurred in our study area, the risk of transmission of O. stephanostomum between the two species cannot be neglected. Thus, our results add to our understanding of nodular worm infection in location where non human primates and humans are co-existing, and underline the necessity to conduct further research at a local scale in a public health concern.
