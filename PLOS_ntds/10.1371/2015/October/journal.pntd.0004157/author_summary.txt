Improved diagnostic methods for the detection of Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) infection in humans is required for effective surveillance and control of this food borne parasite and the prevention of OV-induced bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma or CCA). In this study, a novel urinary antigen detection method was established for quantitative diagnosis of opisthorchiasis by a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (urine OV-ES assay). Analysis of paired feces and urine samples from 235 subjects in Don Chang sub-district in Khon Kaen Province, Northeast Thailand revealed 81% sensitivity and 70% specificity of the urine OV-ES assay when compared to the current gold standard diagnostic method. Moreover, levels of antigen detected by the urine OV-ES assay significantly correlated with intensity of OV infection (P< 0001), with and the proportion of antigen positive diagnosis associated with increasing intensity of infection. Forty four percent of individuals determined to be egg negative subjects by the gold standard method formalin ethyl-acetate concentration technique were positive by the urine OV-ES assay. The ease and noninvasiveness of urine sample collection and the high diagnostic accuracy of the urine OV-ES assay provide an alternative means for the diagnosis of human opisthorchiasis and facilitate the prevention and control of opisthorchiasis in resource limited setting of Southeast Asia.
