Dengue fever is an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Dengue fever is of great interest in the Pearl River Delta economic zone (PRD) of Guangdong province, China because the outbreak in 2013 was the largest in the previous 10 years. Due to the low degree of diversity in the climatic conditions in the PRD, socioeconomic and environmental factors may be the major contributing factors. The objective of this paper was to perform an assessment and detect the socioeconomic and environmental impact on cases at the smallest administrative unit (the township level). Six factors were identified in this work, representing urbanization, poverty, accessibility and vegetation. The effects of all these factors were found to be significant. The results showed that the relative importance of different risk factors may vary across the PRD. The higher risk areas and vulnerable populations identified in this paper will provide guidance for public health practitioners to create targeted, strategic plans and implement effective public health prevention and control measures.
