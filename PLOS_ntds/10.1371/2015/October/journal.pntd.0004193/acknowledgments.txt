We thank Dr. Michelle Clements and Dr. Fiona Fleming at the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) at Imperial College London and two anonymous reviewers for critiquing the manuscript. Dr. Dora Pereira provided helpful references for the possible mechanisms of S. mansoni and anaemia. We appreciate the active involvement and patience of the people of our 30 study villages in Mayuge District, Uganda. We are grateful for the hard work of the laboratory technicians and field assistants from the Vector Control Division in Uganda. The Schistosomiasis Research Group at the University of Cambridge and the SCI were instrumental to setting up this project and providing insightful discussion during early presentations of this work.
