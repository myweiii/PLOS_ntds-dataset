We have used cytokine release assays to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients living in an area where the organism is endemic following an outbreak. Some 21.05% of SOT recipients with no previous history of leishmaniasis had been in contact with the parasite; the risk of these individuals becoming infected by Leishmania is high, a consequence of their need to be maintained in an immunosuppressed state. The results indicate the usefulness of whole blood stimulation assays, and of IFN-γ/TNF-α analysis, for determining exposure to Leishmania and confirming cure from visceral leishmaniasis in SOT recipients.
