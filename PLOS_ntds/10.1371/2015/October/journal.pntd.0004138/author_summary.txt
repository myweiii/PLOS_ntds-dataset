A significant number of PKDL patients have been detected in the endemic areas of Malda who would remain undiagnosed without active mass surveys. Such active survey is required in other endemic areas of the country to attain the ultimate goal of eliminating Kala-azar from this part of the world by reducing the source of infection. PCR-based method is helpful in confirming diagnosis of PKDL, which is not applicable at field level. A referral laboratory at district or state level can be a solution to the problem. Since PKDL cases do not have a fatal outcome, treatment administration of these cases can be deferred until confirmed results are obtained, which requires about 7 daysâ€™ time. The detection of leishmanial DNA in skin lesions during successive treatment courses is essential to establish whether/ when PKDL patients are parasite free during/after treatment and to determine which PKDL patients need treatment for a longer period.
