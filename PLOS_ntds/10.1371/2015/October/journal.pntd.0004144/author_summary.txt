Dengue virus (four serotypes) is transmitted primarily by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and currently 2.5 billion people are in risk of being infected. The incidence of this neglected disease is increasing in developing countries where communities have not been able to effectively remove mosquito sources and their economies cannot afford the vector chemical control. Our study is collecting some of the baseline information necessary to evaluate a novel biological control strategy that would release Ae. aegypti males mosquitoes infected with the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. These fungus-infected males transfer the fungus to female mosquitoes through leg contact during the mating process (This is called auto-dissemination). The fungus killed 50% of males within 4 days of being exposed. The fungus infection also increase the time that males need to mate with 5 females mosquitoes and reduced the sperm production by 87% 5 days after being infected. The ability of fungus-exposed males (FEMs) to find and mate with females in the laboratory or a small greenhouse was the same as for uninfected males. In particular, in the small greenhouse FEMs made more mating attempts without insemination than the uninfected males (more than twice the attempts). During both attempts and successful matings, the FEMS were able to transfer fungus to females confirming that auto-dissemination does occur. We also showed that the amount of fungus transferred to female, even after the 5thmating (about 10% of maleâ€™s conidia load) was sufficient to kill 50% of females within 3 days. These results indicate that there is potential for auto-dissemination of M. anisopliae from males to females as a dengue control tool.
