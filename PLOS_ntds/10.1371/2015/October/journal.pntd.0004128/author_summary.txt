In general, Bartonella infections are zoonooses and are transmitted to humans by hematophagous (blood eating) arthropods such as fleas, lice, ticks, mites and sand flies. Bartonella bacilliformis is found only in Andean regions of South America and is transmitted to humans by a few select species of sand flies, resulting in Carrión’s disease. Our current understanding is that Carrión’s disease is not a zoonosis, as an animal reservoir has not been identified. In this study, we analyzed B. bacilliformis colonization in two species of sand flies in an attempt to understand why Lutzomyia verrucarum is a competent vector and Lutzomyia longipalpis is incapable of transmitting this pathogen between humans. We found that B. bacilliformis remains in the abdominal midgut of the non-competent vector and is progressively digested until no viable bacteria remain (7d). Furthermore, large groups of L. longipalpis were used to demonstrate that this non-competent species is incapable of mechanically transmitting viable bacteria between artificial blood meals simply by contaminated mouthparts. In L. verrucarum, B. bacilliformis colonizes the lumen of the digestive tract beyond the intra-peritrophic space in large numbers and persists (>14d).
