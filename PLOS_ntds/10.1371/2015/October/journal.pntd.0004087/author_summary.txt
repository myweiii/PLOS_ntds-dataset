Relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) among HIV co-infected patients occurs universally. Evidence on the use of secondary prophylaxis especially in anthroponotic transmission regions was lacking. It was found out now that secondary prophylaxis in addition to antiretroviral therapy for VL in people with HIV infection is useful to decrease the relapse rate. However, this intervention is more effective when started before profound immune deficiency. Patients with low CD4 cell counts continued to relapse significantly despite the use of secondary prophylaxis as compared to those with high CD4 cell counts. Earlier VL case detection and management is crucial. This is the first adequately powered trial that has addressed the use of secondary prophylaxis for prevention of VL relapse in HIV co-infected patients.
