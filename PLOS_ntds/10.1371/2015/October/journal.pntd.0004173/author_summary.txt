Infection with the filarial endoparasites Brugia malayi and its symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia represent a significant burden to both humans and animals. Current treatment protocols include use of multiple drugs over a course of months to years, resulting in high costs, undesirable side effects, and poor patient compliance. By encapsulating two of these drugs, ivermectin and doxycycline, into biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticles, we report the ability to effectively kill adult B. malayi with up to a 4,000-fold reduction in the amount of drug used. These results demonstrate a promising role for the use of nanoscale drug carriers to reduce both the course of treatment and the amount of drug needed to increase affordability of lymphatic filariasis treatment and enhance patient compliance.
