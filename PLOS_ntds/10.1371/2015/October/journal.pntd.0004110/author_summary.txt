The genus Treponema comprises several uncultivable human and animal pathogens including Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (TPA), the causative agent of syphilis, T. p. ssp. pertenue (TPE, the causative agent of yaws), and T. p. ssp. endemicum (TEN, the causative agent of bejel). Simian TPE strain Fribourg-Blanc and T. paraluisleporidarum, the agents of primate infections and venereal spirochetosis of rabbits and hares, respectively, represent animal pathogens. In this study, whole genome sequences of 10 treponemal strains were systematically analyzed for the presence of nucleotide sites where the treponemal strains differed within a single strain. Interestingly, most heterogeneous sites were identified among TPA and TEN strains but not among tested TPE strains. Although heterogeneous sites were found to be mostly strain-specific, several examples revealed the same heterogeneous site was identified in two genomes. These findings indicate that the number of intrastrain heterogeneous sites per genome is limited and that different treponemal strains tend to display variability in the same positions of several genes. The abundance of nonsynonymous mutations, nonconservative amino acid replacements and the fact that most of the heterogeneous sites were located within coding regions suggest that the heterogeneous sites represent beneficial adaptive mutations.
