Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects vulnerable populations such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis can cause life-threatening clinical manifestations such as pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome and has a worldwide distribution, to date, the global burden of leptospirosis has not been estimated. The estimated 1.03 million cases annually result in a total of approximately 2.90 million Disability Adjusted Life Years. For comparison, this is over 70% of the global burden of cholera. Most of this burden of leptospirosis is the result of premature death and is suffered disproportionately by young adult males in resource-poor tropical countries. These estimates place leptospirosis as a leading cause of disease burden amongst zoonotic agents.
