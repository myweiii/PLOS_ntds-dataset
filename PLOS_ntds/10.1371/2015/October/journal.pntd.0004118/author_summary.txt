Effective and safe therapies for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, at an affordable cost are urgently needed in Bangladesh. Although sodium stibogluconate, miltefosine, and paromomycin are included in the National Essential Drug List for VL, only miltefosine is currently registered in Bangladesh. Paromomycin is a low-cost drug that was demonstrated to be an efficacious and safe treatment for VL in endemic areas of India, which led to approval of paromomycin IM injection (PMIM) for the treatment of VL in India in 2006 and inclusion of PMIM in the WHO Essential Medicines List in 2007. A subsequent Phase IV trial in India revealed a similarly high efficacy and safety profile coupled with high treatment compliance in a rural outpatient setting. We confirmed the effectiveness, safety, and high compliance of PMIM when used in an outpatient setting in Bangladesh. This study supports the registration of PMIM as a low-cost treatment option for VL in Bangladesh.
