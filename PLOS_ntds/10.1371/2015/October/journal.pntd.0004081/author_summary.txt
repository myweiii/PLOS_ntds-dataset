Japanese encephalitis virus is the etiologic agent of the most medically important viral encephalitis in South Asia with thousands of deaths per year. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between Culex mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, such as wild boars and pigs. Vaccination of domestic pigs has been suggested as a strategy to reduce viral disease transmission to humans, in line with the now-called “One Health” concept. Lentiviral gene transfer vectors represent a novel vaccination platform with an unprecedented ability to induce robust humoral immunity in various animal species. In our study, we demonstrated that immunization of pigs with a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing virus-like particles of Japanese encephalitis virus is particularly efficient at eliciting specific humoral immunity. The titers of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the lentiviral vector are sufficient to confer protection in domestic pigs against the different genotypes of Japanese encephalitis virus observed in Asia.
