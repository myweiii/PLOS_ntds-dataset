With a view to refining studies of tsetse fly behaviour, we used a catch method, in the field in Zimbabwe, to assess and improve the efficiency of 0.5m2 electrocuting grids commonly used to sample tsetse that collide with netting while in flight or which alight on cloth. We found that the efficiency of both sorts of grid was improved if the ~40kV electricity supply pulsed at 1ms intervals, as opposed to the 5â€“15ms commonly used in the past. Efficiency was also improved if the energy per pulse was at least 70mJ. For the netting grid, which is ideally required to be invisible to the flies, the visibility seemed reduced if the netting were much finer than that used previously, and if the distance between the grid and its supporting frame were increased from 2.5cm to 27.5cm. The indications for muscoids and tabanids were much the same as for tsetse. Using these field results and a simple model of grid performance, we suggest the specification of grids suitable for various sampling purposes.
