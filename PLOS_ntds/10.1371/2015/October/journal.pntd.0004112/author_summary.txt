Our study alerted authorities to a hitherto unrecognised high prevalence of C. burnetii infections, acted as a catalyst for the introduction of a national vaccination programme for protection of sheep and goats from brucellosis using Rev1 vaccine, demonstrated the benefits of a coordinated approach and fostered a better understanding of the nature of infection in different hosts and of the constraints for control faced by government services. A notable feature of the study was the enthusiasm and interest displayed by all of the participants throughout, from heads of government services to field personnel and villagers. Livestock owners regard zoonoses as adversities that affect their livestock and members of their households and do not partition them separately as medical or veterinary problems. Control programs need to take that perception into account and wherever possible avoid vesting ownership separately into veterinary or public health agencies.
