Bartonella is a genus of small bacteria with worldwide distribution, transmitted by blood-sucking insects, and is capable of causing disease in humans and animals. Some of the clinical presentations of Bartonella spp., such as cat scratch disease, trench fever, and bacillary angiomatosis are well documented; however, novel presentations have been described in the last two decades, ranging from cyclic flu-like syndrome to neurologic disease and life-threatening endocarditis. Asymptomatic human infection is possible and accidental blood transmission has been reported. Bacterium isolation is very difficult because they grow slowly and require special culture media and procedures. Serology testing poorly predicts active Bartonella infection, except in infection of cardiac valves. Therefore, diagnosis is generally challenging. However, when molecular detection techniques are coupled with special culture protocols, enhanced sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. We investigated Bartonella spp. infection prevalence in a large blood donor population and confirmed bacteremia in 1.2% of the subjects. Bloodstream infection was detected with at least three different molecular methods in 3.2% of donors. These results indicate that Bartonella is a genus of importance for transfusion medicine.
