Buruli ulcer is known to be endemic to Nigeria since at least 1967, however epidemiological data are rare and incomplete. In total, only 51 Buruli ulcer patients were described in 45 years, all found in Southern Nigeria. This is likely a result of the lack of adequate public health structures dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of Buruli ulcer in the region. Here, we report a large cohort of 127 PCR-confirmed Nigerian patients treated in neighbouring Benin. Nigerian patients presented mainly severe lesions of Buruli ulcer, and this is linked by the fact that period prior consultation is delayed (24% of the patients waited more than one year between the beginning of the lesion and the consultation in the Buruli ulcer treatment centre in Pob√®). We identify South Western Nigeria as an important endemic area for Buruli ulcer, and believe our results will be of importance to Nigerian health authorities, the World Health Organisation and NGO's involved in management of Buruli ulcer.
