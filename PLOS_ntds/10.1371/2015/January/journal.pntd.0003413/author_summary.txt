Light microscopy (LM) has been the mainstay of malaria diagnosis for case management and surveillance. The introduction of molecular based diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1990s resulted in increased reporting of Plasmodium infections in communities compared to LM, indicating that sub-microscopic (SM) Plasmodium infections are endemic in a variety of different settings. The prevalence and transmission potential of SM P. falciparum was reviewed; however, information on the prevalence and distribution of SM P. vivax in different settings is not available. In this article, the authors analysed LM and PCR results described in 38 publications (44 studies), and revealed that SM P. vivax is highly prevalent across different geographic areas with varying transmission intensities. On average, these infections made up 67% of P. vivax infections detected by PCR in cross-sectional surveys, and were relatively more prevalent in areas where malaria was under control and moving towards elimination. By contrast, SM P. vivax is not prevalent in clinical malaria suspects. These findings highlight that for detection of clinical malaria LM and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are adequate, however, to detect very low density infections that are largely asymptomatic but still contribute to transmission, more sensitive diagnostic tools are needed.
