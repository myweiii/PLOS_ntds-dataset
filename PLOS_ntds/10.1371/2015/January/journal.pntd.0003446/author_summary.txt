Infectious diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death among young children in developing countries, and a major cause of morbidity in all age groups. The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli contribute substantially to this burden of diarrheal illness, and have been a focus of vaccine development efforts for more than forty years following their discovery as a cause of severe diarrheal illness. The heat-labile, and/or heat stable enterotoxins that define ETEC are produced by a diverse population of Escherichia coli. This inherent genetic plasticity of E. coli has made it difficult to identify antigens specific to ETEC that are highly conserved. Therefore, identification of protective antigens shared by many ETEC strains will likely play an essential role in development of the next iteration of vaccines.
