Snake bite is a major public health problem throughout rural communities in West Africa and leads to a significant number of deaths and disabilities per year. Even though effective antivenoms exist against the locally prevalent carpet viper and other poisonous snakes, they are generally not available in community settings, possibly because of their high acquisition cost. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of making antivenom more broadly available in Nigeria by comparing the treatment costs associated with antivenom therapy against their medical benefit in reducing the risk of mortality. We find that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) associated with making antivenom available in Nigeria was $2,330 per death averted and $100 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Both of these suggest that snakebite antivenom is highly cost-effective in Nigeria and they also compare very favorably against other commonly funded health interventions for which similar estimates exist. Since a substantial reduction in mortality and DALYs could be achieved at a relatively modest upfront cost, expanding access to antivenom to broader parts of the population should be a priority consideration for future investments in healthcare.
