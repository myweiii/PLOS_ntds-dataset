A marked decrease in incidence of Chagas Disease has been observed in the last decade achieved by vector control strategies; however, there are still geographical areas where the disease reaches endemic proportions. Due to high morbidity and disease burden, other avenues of Chagas control, such as vaccines and therapeutic agents need to be employed for comprehensive disease control and mitigation. As there are no vaccines available currently, two drugs (Benznidazole and Nifurtimox) have been the mainstay of treatment. However, these drugs produce multiple side effects and frequently lead to early termination of the treatment. In this study, we have successfully developed a new method to evaluate the presence of Chagas biomarkers in the plasma of infected drug treated mice. Our study shows that high biomarker levels in T. cruzi infected mice, after drug treatment, can indicate treatment failure. Our assay provides a global picture of parasitemia in the host and a positive result would thus suggest that the treated animals continue to harbor T. cruzi parasites somewhere in the body. This study provides a new method to test for T. cruzi infection and for assessing the effectiveness of treatment.
