Ninety percent of schistosomiasis occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, where 91% of HIV-infected children reside. Both schistosomiasis and HIV affect the kidney, but their respective effects on kidney disease in children are not well described. Our prior work in HIV-infected adults demonstrated a high prevalence of kidney disease, possibly worsened by schistosomiasis, but adults are less commonly and less heavily infected with schistosomiasis than children. Therefore, we sought to describe the prevalence and factors associated with renal dysfunction (defined operationally as eGFR <60mL/min/1.73m2 and/or albuminuria >20mg/L in a single urine test) among HIV-infected children and their uninfected siblings living in a schistosomiasis endemic area. We found that half of HIV-infected children and more than one third of HIV-uninfected children had renal dysfunction. Schistosomiasis was the only factor significantly associated with renal dysfunction, increasing odds of renal dysfunction by 2.5-fold. Nearly 50% of the renal dysfunction we observed in both groups could be explained by schistosomiasis. The strong association between schistosomiasis and renal dysfunction among both HIV-infected and uninfected children should remind clinicians to screen for schistosomiasis. It also ought to spur further prospective research to assess for causality and outcomes in the relationship between S. mansoni and kidney disease in children.
