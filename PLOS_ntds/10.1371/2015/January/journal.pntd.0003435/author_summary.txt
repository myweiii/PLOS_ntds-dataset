Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by schistosome parasites that affects millions of people worldwide. The current reliance on a single drug (Praziquantel) for treatment and control of the disease calls for the urgent discovery of novel schistosomicidal agents. One approach that can expedite drug discovery is to find new uses for existing approved drugs, a practice known as drug repositioning. Currently, modern drug repositioning strategies entail the search for compounds that act on a specific target, often a protein known or suspected to be required for survival of the parasite. Drug repositioning approaches for schistosomiasis are now greatly facilitated by the availability of comprehensive schistosome genome data in user-friendly databases. Here, we report a drug repositioning computational strategy that involves identification of novel schistosomicidal drug candidates using similarity between schistosome proteins and known drug targets. Researchers can now use the list of predicted drugs as a basis for deciding which potential schistosomicidal candidates can be tested experimentally.
