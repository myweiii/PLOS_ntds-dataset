Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes Chikungunya fever in humans. The symptoms, particularly joint pain, can be severe and long lasting, and outbreaks can have serious socioeconomic impact. CHIKV is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that co-exists geographically with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV). This causes difficulties in diagnosis because the symptoms are similar between CHIKV and DENV infections. It is important to differentiate between CHIKV and DENV infections, with good diagnostic methods. In this paper, we found that 72%â€“100% of CHIKV-infected patients had antibodies that recognized E2EP3, a part of a CHIKV protein. In contrast, a low percentage of flavivirus-infected patients had antibodies that recognized E2EP3. This suggests that testing patients for the presence of E2EP3-recognizing antibodies will aid in diagnostic differentiation between CHIKV and DENV infections. Interestingly, patients infected with non-chikungunya alphaviruses had moderate levels of antibodies that recognized E2EP3. While it was generally known that the alphaviruses have fairly conserved amino acid sequences, it was unknown until now, to what extent the antibodies against non-chikungunya viruses would also recognize E2EP3 from CHIKV. This paper provides insights about the E2EP3-recognizing antibodies from patients with different mosquito-borne viral infections and these insights will inform approaches to diagnostics and vaccination.
