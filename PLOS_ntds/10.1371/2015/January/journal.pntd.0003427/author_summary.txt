Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by attacks of Orientia tsutsugamushi-carrying mites, and is the most prevalent febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region. If not properly treated with antibiotics, patients often develop severe vasculitis that affects multiple organs, and the mortality rate can reach 30%. To explore the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the host-pathogen interaction, we characterized metabolic changes in various organs and the serum of O. tsutsugamushi-infected hosts. After O. tsutsugamushi infection, the host experienced decreased energy production, as well as a severe deficiency in re-methylation sources and glutathione, which impaired purine synthesis, DNA and protein methylation. In addition, abnormal pathways for phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis and phosphoethanolamine methylation were utilized in the enlarged spleen of O. tsutsugamushi-infected hosts. These results suggested that metabolic profiling could provide insight into global metabolic changes in O. tsutsugamushi-infected hosts, and increase our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of O. tsutsugamushi, as well as providing novel therapeutic targets for scrub typhus.
