Many people use human waste as an agricultural fertilizer, often called “night soil.” If the waste is not properly treated, the use of night soil may promote the spread of infectious diseases. We suspected that night soil use may facilitate the spread of the water-borne disease, schistosomiasis, as some schistosomiasis eggs can survive in the environment for weeks. We conducted a study in 36 villages in rural China in order to see if the amount of night soil used in a village was associated with schistosomiasis. The study was conducted in an area where schistosomiasis reemerged and persisted despite an aggressive disease control program. We found half of households reported using night soil—it was used on all major crops and by people across the socio-economic spectrum. We also found that night soil use was strongly associated with schistosomiasis infection in 2007, but not in 2010. Our findings show the use of human waste as an agricultural fertilizer is common in our study region and may increase schistosomiasis infections. The extent to which night soil is used and risks of this practice should be evaluated as part of disease control programs targeting schistosomiasis and other human helminthiases.
