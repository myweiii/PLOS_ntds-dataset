Dengue is currently the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, and is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical countries. An estimated 390 million infections occur annually, and over 70% of the current global dengue disease burden is borne by people who live in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. DENV serotype and genotype data is lacking in many parts of this region, limiting our attempts to understand the observed patterns of hyperendemicity and disease severity. Many countries in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific region are popular tourist destinations, and dengue has been identified as a cause of travel-related illness in people returning from endemic countries. We sequenced the E gene of DENV isolated from travellers returning to Western Australia from 7 countries throughout Asia between 2010 and 2012. The majority of DENV originated in Indonesia, predominantly Bali, a popular travel destination for Australians. We identified hyperendemic transmission of all four DENV serotypes in Bali in 2010; circulating DENV included dominant local strains which had circulated for several years in Indonesia and Singapore, as well as strains more recently introduced into Bali from other countries in the region. Finally, we show the emergence of a new lineage of DENV2 (Cosmopolitan genotype) in 2011â€“2012, which should be monitored. Travellers may act as sentinels and provide important information on DENV genotypes and linages circulating in countries where locally generated detailed genetic data may not be available.
