Humans can be infected with five malaria parasite species: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, and P. ovale. Although the vast majority of malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide can be attributed to P. falciparum, non-falciparum malaria parasites can also cause clinical disease. Researchers use nucleic acid based detection methods, such a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to detect low-density malaria parasitemias that can evade microscopic detection. P. ovale was recently identified to exist as two subspecies, P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri, that look identical but differ genetically. In this study, we developed a novel real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to detect all P. ovale parasites, based on a conserved gene between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. We also used DNA sequencing to differentiate between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri from a small sample of P. ovale asymptomatic infections in Western Kenya. Through the use of our novel rbp2 qPCR assay, we aim to characterize the prevalence of P. ovale in future epidemiological studies in order to better understand this neglected malaria parasite species.
