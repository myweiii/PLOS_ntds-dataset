Leishmaniasis is one of the major diseases of importance in public health and its precise diagnosis may represent one of the most relevant challenges for the control and possible eradication of the disease. In this context, recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides based on Leishmania genes have emerged as valuable targets for serodiagnosis due to their increased sensitivity, specificity and potential for standardization. Cathepsin L-like (CatL) genes are more abundant in stationary promastigotes and amastigotes, and have less than 40% identity with human proteins and more than 60% identity with other Leishmania species. We mapped a linear B-cell epitope in the CatL protein sequence and compared its performance with the recombinant protein and current serology methodologies for the diagnosis of human tegumentary and visceral leishmaniasis as well as of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Both the recombinant protein and synthetic peptide showed higher specificity and sensitivity than crude preparations commonly used for other antigens, and thus, they are valuable targets to compose an antigen panel that could significantly improve leishmaniasis diagnosis.
