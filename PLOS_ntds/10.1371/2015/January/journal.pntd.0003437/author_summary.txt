Buruli ulcer is a skin disease, which is endemic in over thirty countries, mostly in West Africa, with affected populations being largely rural. The causative organism, Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), is an environmental mycobacterium and although transmission is unclear, frequent exposure to these MU-contaminated environments have been suggested as risk factors. We conducted this study on the premise that if patients are infected from MU-contaminated water bodies, then the genotype of MU strains in these patients should be identical to those in their community associated water bodies and wetlands. Using Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) as a genetic tool, we determined the genotypes of MU from both water bodies and patient samples. Comparison and overlap of these genotypes, within each community, suggest that patients were possibly infected from at least one water body. Additionally, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections and may be acting as reservoirs. Our findings suggest that future ecological and molecular studies in the hope of elucidating a definite transmission route, should focus on source-tracking MU infections to community associated risk environments while employing a OneHealth approach in the process.
