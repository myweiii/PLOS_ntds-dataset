Chagas disease is caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. After the onset of acute infection, all individuals enter the chronic phase and approximately 70% of them never have symptoms. However, nearly 30% of infected individuals develop symptoms, mainly of heart disease, even decades after the initial infection. Currently, it is unclear how the immune response controls infection and prevents the development of heart disease in some infected people. We have characterised the memory CD8+ T cell subsets in chronic chagasic patients, including a newly described population of cells called memory stem cells. This T cell subset seems important for replenishing the other T cell populations. The findings in this manuscript show that chronic chagasic patients with severe disease have the following: a) a low frequency of memory stem cells, b) no antigen-specific memory stem cells, and c) CD8+ T cells with less effector function compared with asymptomatic patients. These results indicate that the lack of T cell population renewal and the decrease in cells with multiple effector functions may be associated with the clinical outcome of chronic Chagas disease.
