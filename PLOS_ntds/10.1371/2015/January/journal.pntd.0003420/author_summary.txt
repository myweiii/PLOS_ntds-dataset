Scrub typhus, also known as tsutsugamushi disease, is a zoonosis transmitted by chigger bites (larval trombiculid mites) and the pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi (O. tsutsugamushi), a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium. It is distributed widely in the Pacific regions of Asia, and the islands of the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. People with outdoor activities that involve contact with grasses or shrubs are at highest risk. Scrub typhus has existed in Southern China for thousands of years, but it has been noted to spread from the South to the North of China in recent decades. Though this research we studied the disease burden of scrub typhus with disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and developed a forecasting time series model for human clinical disease in Laiwu, China. Results demonstrated that the disease burden of scrub typhus was increasing year by year in Laiwu, and it was higher in females than males. Moreover, DALY rates in females and males were highest for persons in the 60â€“69 years age group. Of all the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models tested, the SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)12 model was the best fit for scrub typhus cases in Laiwu. The disease occurred mainly in autumn, with a peak in October.
