Non-typhoidal Salmonella, such as Salmonella Typhimurium, generally cause self-limiting gastroenteritis. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a novel genotype called sequence type (ST) 313 is circulating and causes bloodstream infections in infants and HIV-infected individuals. In contrast, the most common genotype found throughout the rest of the world is ST19, which has been highly studied. Currently, the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium ST313 is not well understood. In our study, we present evidence that S. Typhimurium ST313 strains from Mali, West Africa, survive and replicate better within a diverse set of primary human and murine macrophages and cell lines, inducing significantly less host-cell death as compared to S. Typhimurium ST19. Flagellin expression in the S. Typhimurium ST313 strains was found to be attenuated compared to S. Typhimurium ST19, thereby causing decreased inflammation. We conclude that S. Typhimurium ST313 have evolved phenotypically to be an intermediate between S. Typhimurium ST19 and the highly invasive typhoidal Salmonella serovars S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.
