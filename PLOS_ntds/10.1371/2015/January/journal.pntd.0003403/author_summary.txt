Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a severe neoplasia caused by a retrovirus named human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). There are 5 to 10 million carriers worldwide, but only 2% to 5% will manifest ATL. The patients present different clinical and laboratory features. Therefore, this neoplasia was classified in acute and lymphoma types which presented poor prognosis, with a median survival time around 6 months and the less aggressive chronic and smoldering types. The mechanisms involved in the development of this disease are not well known. Microsatellites are short tandem repeats of DNA spread throughout the genome. Alterations in these sequences have been related to the development of cancers. In Japan, one of the highest endemic areas of HTLV-1 infection, alterations in microsatellites have been observed in the aggressive types of ATL and were related to poor prognosis and progression of disease. In the current study, in which we included many chronic and smoldering patients, we showed that microsatellite alterations were also present in the less aggressive ATL and were not necessarily associated to ATL progression and aggressiveness.
