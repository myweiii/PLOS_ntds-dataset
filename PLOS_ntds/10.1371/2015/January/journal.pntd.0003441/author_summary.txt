Respiratory melioidosis is a lethal disease presentation of the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is found in tropical regions worldwide. Respiratory melioidosis has also been highlighted as a concern in the biodefense community given the potential for weaponization of B. pseudomallei. This study demonstrates that respiratory melioidosis models can significantly vary in their disease presentations in mice, depending on whether the upper respiratory tract represents an initial site of infection. We have demonstrated that lung-specific infections of mice, which avoid nasal cavity colonization, result in a course of disease with greater maturation of pneumonia and systemic spread, and we propose that this represents a critical advance in the field of studying respiratory melioidosis. We further characterize that the capsule virulence determinant, previously considered important for respiratory melioidosis, has reduced significance when characterized in the context of lung-specific disease, while the Type 3 Secretion System cluster 3 is a critical virulence determinant for B. pseudomallei required for efficient colonization of the lung as well as spread to other tissues.
