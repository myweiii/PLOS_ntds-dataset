Bartonella quintana, the etiologic agent of trench fever and other human diseases, is known to be transmitted by the feces of body lice. Recently, the DNA of this bacterium has been detected in bed bugs. Several pathogens have been associated and suggested to be transmitted by bed bugs, despite the insufficient evidence to support this vector role. The aim of the present study was to assess the competence of bed bugs in the transmission of B. quintana using an experimental artificial model of infection. To this end, bed bugs were fed with human infected blood meals. On the 3rd day post-infection (dpi) B. quintana was detected molecularly in 100% of experimentally infected bed bug. The bacterium was also detectable in bed bug feces starting on the 3rd dpi and persisted until 18Â±1 dpi. Although immunohistochemistry assays localized the bacteria to the gastrointestinal bed bug gut, B. quintana was also detected in the first and second instars larva. The present work highlights the need to reconsider monitoring of bed bugs for the transmission of pathogens.
