We reconstructed metabolic pathways of 23 organisms including 13 nematode species, using their complete deduced protein coding sequences and compared them to 10 non-nematodes. We observed that metabolic potential availability is concomitant with phylogenetic and/or ecological similarity, with the exceptions providing interesting case studies. We also studied changes in metabolic profiles under different developmental stages of 4 nematode species using stage-specific transcriptomic data. A comparison of the variation patterns in these profiles led to recognition of modules that share metabolic profiles at various life-cycle stages or during development. The undertaken analysis improved genome annotation and the obtained results provided insight into parasitism, resulting in identification of taxonomically-restricted pathways and enzymes that may provide new mechanisms for control of nematode infections.
