Scrub typhus is one of the high burdened infectious diseases in endemic rural areas. Our study showed that the disease could be endemic in urban areas. Indigenous urban scrub typhus may also have significant impact in terms of a disease burden and differential diagnosis. A low rate of characteristic eschar and skin rash may make the clinical suspicion more troublesome. Scrub typhus is the 3rd most frequent notifiable infectious disease in South Korea. Seoul is a densely populated capital city located in northwestern South Korea. We epidemiologically identified indigenous urban cases. A subgroup of them showed mild clinical characteristics. Direct mite collection from a suspected infection site, Mt. Gwanak in Seoul, showed that Helenicula miyagawai (87.4%) and Leptotrombidium scutellare (9.2%) were the dominant species. In addition, O. tsutsugamushi-specific gene, tsa56, was identified in a fraction of the collected H. miyagawai. The 18S rDNA sequencing of the chigger mites was complementarily helpful for the differentiation of species. Our data are from one region, but urban scrub typhus is likely a scenario in endemic areas. Urban areas should be included as possible locations for scrub typhus.
