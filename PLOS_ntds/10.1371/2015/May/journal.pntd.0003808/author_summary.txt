Dengue has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease globally. With increasing global trade and population movement, the disease is transferred to regions which were previously dengue free. When dengue vector exists and weather factors are suitable, there is the possibility for dengue transmission and even outbreaks happening. Dengue is still believed to be a non-endemic disease in China, with imported cases playing a vital role in local dengue transmission. The situation of dengue is becoming more and more severe with two successive large outbreaks hitting southern China in 2013 and 2014, and the dengue outbreak in 2014 was unprecedented. In this study, we aim to develop a dengue forecasting model that would provide an early warning of dengue outbreak to allow local health authorities and communities to implement timely effective control measures. Our model showed that imported cases in the previous month, monthly minimum temperature in the previous month and monthly accumulative precipitation with three month lags could predict dengue outbreak ahead by one month. We concluded that these variables could be used to develop an early dengue warning model to provide evidence-based decisions for disease control and prevention and including the utilization of limited resources.
