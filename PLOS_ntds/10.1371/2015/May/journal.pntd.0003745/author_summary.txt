Emerging insecticide resistance in disease vectors is of great public health concern. Discovery of new targets and novel strategies for insecticidal interventions to control vector borne diseases is a public health imperative. Nanotechnology offers great potential for molecular genetic investigations and for delivery of effector molecules for control of disease vectors. We have developed a tool box of hydrogel nanoparticles (NPs) with the biodistribution and tissue tropism characteristics for gene structure/function studies and for delivery of vector lethal cargoes to adult mosquitoes. Nanotechnology will likely be useful for molecular investigations and potential control of the arthropod vectors of other neglected tropical diseases.
