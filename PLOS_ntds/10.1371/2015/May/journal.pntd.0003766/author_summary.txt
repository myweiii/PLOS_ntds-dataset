Even though leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind, there is still a lot unknown about its transmission and why some people develop the disease and others do not. Leprosy is often seen as a disease of the poor, but which aspects of poverty are associated with leprosy are still under study. Recently though, food shortage has been identified as a risk factor for leprosy in two socioeconomic studies. In our study, lead in a poor area of Bangladesh, we further investigated this link by interviewing recently diagnosed leprosy patients during a food shortage period. We found that compared to a control population, leprosy patients have less money to spend on food, have less household food stocks and have a less diverse diet. The patient group had a lower consumption of highly nutritious foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables. An inadequate diet for a longer period of time leads to nutrient deficiencies. The bodyâ€™s immune system, however, needs proteins, vitamins and minerals to effectively fight off infections. We conclude that people who are living in poverty and who are not able to get an adequate, diverse diet have a higher chance of developing leprosy.
