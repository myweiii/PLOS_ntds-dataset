Fascioliosis is considered an emerging disease in humans, causing important losses in global agriculture through the infection of livestock animals. The outcome of resistant parasites has increased the search for new drugs which may contribute to disease control. In recent decades, Fasciola cathepsins (FhCs) have been defined as the principal virulence factors of this parasite. Despite being in the same protein family, they have different specificities and, thus, distinct roles throughout the fluke life cycle. Differences in specificity have been attributed to a few variations in the sequence of key FhCs subsites. Currently, the structure-based drug design of inhibitors against Fasciola cathepsin Ls (FhCLs) with unknown structures is possible due to the availability of the three-dimensional structure of FhCL1. Our detailed structural analysis of the major infective juvenile enzyme (FhCL3) identifies the molecular determinants for protein binding. Also, novel potential inhibitors against FhCL3 are proposed, which might reduce host invasion and penetration processes. These compounds are predicted to interact with the binding site of the enzyme, therefore they could prevent substrate processing by competitive inhibition. The structure-based drug design strategy described here will be useful for the development of new potent and selective inhibitors against other FhCs.
