Understanding the bacterial causes of fever, particularly in the era of reported decline of malaria, is very important. In Tanzania, data on the prevalence of these diseases in several regions is limited. These infections cannot be recognized clinically, and thus the lack of diagnostic tools in most health facilities leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of febrile patients. This cross-sectional study was carried out in children at Kilosa district hospital in Tanzania. Among 370 enrolled patients, 85 (23.0%) had malaria parasites, 43 (11.6%) had presumptive acute leptospirosis and 26/200 (13%) had confirmed leptospirosis. Presumptive acute brucellosis due to B. abortus was identified in 26 (7.0%) and B. melitensis was among 57 (15.4%) of the enrolled patients. Presumptive typhoid fever was observed in 38 patients (10.3%), while 69 (18.6%) had urinary tract infections. Co-infections between bacterial diseases with malaria were observed and thus indicate the necessity of considering multiple infections in patients with malaria. These findings are of relevance to clinicians since they should consider bacterial causes of fever including zoonotic diseases in the routine diagnosis of febrile patients. Also, the findings provide evidence to policy makers and national disease control programs.
