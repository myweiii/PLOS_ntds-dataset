Chagas disease is an infection caused by the haemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It is one of the most important public health problems in Latin America, and was first described by Carlos Justiniano Ribeiro das Chagas, a Brazilian physician and scientist, in 1909. It is mostly vector-borne transmitted to humans by contact with faeces of triatomine bugs. The World Health Organization estimates that about 6 to 7 million people are currently infected with T. cruzi worldwide. The disease is characterised by acute and chronic phases. The immune response during disease development is crucial for protection because immunological imbalances can lead to heart and digestive tract lesions in chagasic patients. In this work we analysed the role of receptors of immune cells known as Natural Killer cells (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor—KIR) and their ligands (Human leukocyte antigens—HLA) in chagasic patients compared to healthy individuals. The uncontrolled activation of NK cells can lead to tissue damage, which, in turn, leads to the development of serious chronic illness. We found that KIR-HLA complex may be related to a risk factor in the chronic Chagas disease and chronic chagasic cardiopathy.
