Vector-borne parasitic diseases are still the major cause of morbidity and mortality in both humans as animals. Some of these parasites have been well studied, including the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, since these cause major fatalities in humans. However, other parasites like Babesia divergens, who closely resemble malaria parasites, are currently becoming a major concern since these are zoonotically transmitted to humans from their natural hosts (e.g. cattle) by ticks. Their rising levels indicate the possibility of human medical emergencies occurring. Unfortunately, basic biological processes in these parasites are poorly understood due to their neglected status. In this manuscript, we describe for the first time high-content analysis of the development of B. divergens parasites in vitro over time. We applied cell biological and advanced functional molecular strategies to also provide the first descriptors of the parasiteâ€™s transcriptome during life cycle development. This information is unique and to not only dramatically expand our information base on Babesia biology, but also provide information that can be exploited for future drug discovery endeavors.
