Triatomine bugs are the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), they transmit the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi by infectious blood-sucking. In the southern Cone of South America, Triatoma infestans is the major disease vector. The efficacy of chemical control strategies is mostly based on pyrethroid application; however, the growing reports of resistant bug populations in Argentina and Bolivia urges to find innovative vector control measures. Among alternative control tools, entomopathogenic fungi were already shown to be effective against T. infestans; furthermore, pyrethroid-resistant insects are unable to counter entomopathogenic fungal infection. Pheromone-based technologies are widely used to help improve the insecticide killing efficacy; here we will show the usefulness of the fungal biopesticide combined to T. infestans contact aggregation pheromone to reduce bug population. That this low cost, low-tech tool can help control T. infestans, regardless their susceptibility to current chemical insecticides, will be shown by field, laboratory and mathematical modeling assessment.
