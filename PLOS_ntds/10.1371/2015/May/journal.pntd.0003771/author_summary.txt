Some of the most immediate challenges that the world faces are caused by insecticide-resistant mosquitoes that seriously threaten human health, via the diseases they transmit. Temephos is a major larvicide that has been used extensively for the control of Ae. albopictus and its often sympatric Ae. aegypti. Here we identified temephos resistance, and showed that specific carboxylesterase genes are overexpressed in the resistant strain through gene amplification. It is striking that exactly the same CCE genes, namely CCEae6a and CCEae3a, which are clustered in Ae. aegypti genome, have also been found associated with temephos resistance in this species. Identification of genes responsible for insecticide resistance is a key step in order to make careful risk assessments regarding the emergence of resistance and to design effective and sustainable vector control strategies. The gDNAâ€”resistance associated marker (i.e.: the gene amplification which was confirmed to be genetically linked with the phenotype) can be used to follow the dynamics of resistance in the field, as well as facilitate population genetic studies for this highly invasive vector. The transcriptomic data that were produced represent a significant genomic resource, which will facilitate molecular studies in Ae. albopictus.
