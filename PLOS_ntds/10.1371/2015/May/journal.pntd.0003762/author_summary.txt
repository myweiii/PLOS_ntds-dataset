Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp, is a globally widespread zoonosis. In this study, our focusing on serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains of Leptospira using MLST as a tool for phylogenetic analysis that has led to a better understanding of evolution of Leptospira. This totally consisted of 120 epidemic strains from five geographically diverse regions were isolated over the past 50 years in China and 8 strains from seven different countries. 17 STs were identified in these 128 strains by MLST analysis. Adding 116 serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae in the Leptospira MLST database and studies previously described, 22 STs were identified in the 244 isolates. The genetic diversity of Leptospira belonging to serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae from China was generally different from that of isolates elsewhere. Results of the 16S rRNA sequencing typing and MLST genotyping method were nearly consistent. Here, MLST revealed the high diversity of STs among the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains in China. Our present study provides a blueprint for further phylogenetic research. More convenient molecular techniques have to be developed to identify and characterize Leptospira species and STs.
