We are grateful to the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) secretariat for advisory support. We thank the staff of the SCORE parasitology team in Pemba who helped with the collection and examination of urine samples that were subjected to reagent strip testing and urine filtration. We are indebted to the laboratory technicians from Unguja and Pemba, namely Mtumweni A. Muhsin, Mwanaidi A. Khamis, Asha S. Hassan, and Abdalla M. Omar who prepared and analyzed the stored urine samples with the UCP-LF CAA tests. We would also like to thank Muriel Rabone for creating the maps for Fig 2. Last but not least, we acknowledge the children visiting primary schools in Pemba for their participation in the study.
