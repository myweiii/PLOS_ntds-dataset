Schistosomiasis is one of the major parasitic diseases in developing countries and still causes 200,000 deaths per year. Mass drug administration programs with praziquantel, the drug of choice against schistosomiasis, are currently undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africa. Praziquantel, although efficient against adult worms, fails to cure early infection. The complex developmental stages of schistosomes and migration through varying host compartments with different local drug concentration are a challenge for drug treatment. After infecting their mammalian host, schistosomula traverse through skin and the vasculature of lung, liver and intestines. During their migration, they develop from larvae to paired adults in approximately 4 to 5 weeks. So far, drug effects have been analyzed on adult worms or freshly transformed schistosomula only. Information about the effects on the larval stages is lacking. We were able to transfer the larval development of the first three weeks into the culture dish. This tool can be used for the analysis of drug effects against schistosomula and for investigation of the accessibility, expression and localization of antigens. Rendering the parasite’s larvae vulnerable to the host’s immune system by increasing antigen presentation is an important aspect of drug activity. We demonstrate on in vitro-cultured Schistosoma mansoni larvae, that SmCD59a and SmKK7, as examples for hidden antigens, become accessible to antibodies following drug treatment.
