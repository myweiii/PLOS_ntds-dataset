During the past decades, dengue fever has become the most common arthropod-borne viral disease, imposing a substantial economic and disease burden in most tropical and subtropical countries, including Mexico. Dengue incidence and severity have dramatically increased in Mexico, with transmission regularly reported in 28 of 32 states. Objective estimates of the burden of dengue are important to inform policy decisions and priorities. We merged multiple data sources to estimate (i) total episodes, (ii) costs per episode, (iii) surveillance and vector control costs, and (iv) disease burden (2010â€“2011). Results suggest that Mexico had about 139,000 symptomatic and 119 fatal dengue episodes per year on average. The annual cost, including surveillance and vector control, was about US$170 million, or $1.56 per capita, comparable to other countries in the Americas. Annual disease burden averaged 65 disability-adjusted life years per million population, with most of the years lost to disability corresponding to ambulatory episodes. The results show a substantial burden of dengue on the health care system and economy of Mexico. This quantification of the economic burden should help public health officials make informed decisions about current and promising new preventive and control measures to reduce dengue infections.
