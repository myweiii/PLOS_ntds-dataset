Cryptosporidium spp. are a frequent cause of diarrhoea worldwide. While both animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission has been reported from industrialized countries, human-to-human transmission clearly prevails in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, data on the distribution of zoonotic and human subtypes is limited for rural African regions, where children are in very close contact to animals. We conducted a case-control study with 2232 stool samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic children living in the rural Ashanti region of Ghana. The combination of molecular typing results and clinical data helped to untangle transmission routes and to analyze the association of clinical symptoms with specific Cryptosporidium subtypes. Our study results demonstrate seasonal transmission with no clusters of specific subtypes. All subtypes detected have so far been only encountered from human specimens, strongly suggesting a predominantly human-human transmission among children living in the rural Ghana, despite close contact to livestock. Therefore, public health control programmes need to primarily focus on hygienic conditions among young infants below the age of two years. Of interest for practicing physicians, vomiting is a frequent symptom, especially in C. parvum infections.
