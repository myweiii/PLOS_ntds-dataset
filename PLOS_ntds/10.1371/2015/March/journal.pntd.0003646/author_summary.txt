Parasites are often assumed to cause little harm to their arthropod vectors, even though they commonly reproduce inside the arthropods and exploit their nutrients, even causing lesions when crossing internal barriers. Thus, the interests of parasite and vector may well not be aligned and we can expect the parasite to exploit its vector just as it does with its main host, with consequent negative effects on the vector’s fitness. Here, we show that this occurs with Trypanosoma cruzi in its bug vector (T. cruzi causes Chagas disease, affecting ca. 8 million people and disease management is principally attained via vector control). Our results indicate that the parasites delay insect moulting, which is likely beneficial to them as they need time to develop in the insect before the next bloodmeal (that only occurs post-moult). We also show parasite-induced mortality over the narrow range of temperatures which the insect prefers and over which it performs best. In vitro growth of the parasite increases with temperature and we discuss how this may help explain the effects in vivo. Overall, these results will be important to understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease and provide an evolutionary context to explain the parasite′s interaction with its vector.
