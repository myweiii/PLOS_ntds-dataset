The prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (LF), in The Gambia was among the highest in Africa in the 1950s when about 50% of the adult population was positive for microfilaraemia. However, surveys conducted in 1975 and 1976 revealed a dramatic decline in LF endemicity in the absence of systematic treatment with anti-filaria medicines. This decline in LF prevalence in all villages was partly attributed to a significant drop in human-mosquito contact through a sustained reduction in rainfall in the 1960s and 1970s and the widespread use of insecticidal nets to protect against malaria. We asked the question in 2013 whether the rapid scale up in the use of insecticidal nets for malaria control in Gambia had resulted in the interruption of LF transmission. In this paper we present the results of three independently designed filariasis surveys conducted over a period of 17 years (1997â€“2013), and involving over 6000 subjects in 21 districts across all administrative divisions in the country. In 2001, tests performed to detect circulating filarial antigens (CFA) in serum samples collected between 1997 and 2000, in three divisions, failed to show positive individuals from two that were previously highly endemic for the LF. Results of the second survey conducted in 2003 indicated that five of the 21 districts were slightly endemic for LF with CFA rates of 1% or 2% but MDA was never implemented in The Gambia. The results of our final survey conducted in 2013 were unequivocal in confirming the absence of transmission of LF in all 21 districts surveyed using WHO recommended statistically robust and validated tool known as transmission assessment survey (TAS). The Gambia achieving a non-endemic status for LF represents a significant step in the efforts to shrink the filariasis endemicity map and demonstrates the value of cross sector approaches in disease control.
