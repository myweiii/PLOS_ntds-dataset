Leishmania is the parasite responsible for the disease leishmaniasis, present in all continents. Leishmania parasites are spread through infected sand-flies and, during transmission into the vertebrate host, neutrophils are among the first cells to arrive at the infection site. Since neutrophils are key players at the frontline of defense against invading organisms, we investigated their response to Leishmania braziliensis. Importantly, L. braziliensis causes both Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis, two clinical manifestations characterized by their chronic development and by the presence of skin lesions with tissue destruction. Upon inoculation of mice with L. braziliensis, neutrophils rapidly arrive at the site of infection. We then observed that culture of mouse neutrophils with L. braziliensis induced the expression of adhesion molecules, production of Reactive Oxygen Species and secretion of elastase and TNF-Î±, two important inflammatory mediators. Also, infection with L. braziliensis induced neutrophil apoptosis, a cell death mechanism key for regulating inflammation. Our results show that neutrophils respond to presence of the L. braziliensis parasites by becoming activated and undergoing apoptosis. We suggest that this outcome modifies the local environment at the site of parasite inoculation and thus contributes with parasite killing in the infected host.
