The authors are grateful to Mr. M. Chirinda and his staff for field help, to Dr. A. Wilson for advice on cattle treatment, and to Mr. W. Shereni, Director of the Division of Tsetse Control, Zimbabwe, for encouragement. None of the Rekomitjie work on dung fauna would have been performed if Mrs. M. Lovemore had not called our attention to dead beetles near pats.
