Melioidosis cases are on the rise in endemic areas of northern Australia and Thailand. This potentially severe infectious disease affecting humans and animals in the tropical belt is caused by the gram negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Domestic gardens are a common point of exposure to these environmental bacteria and B. pseudomallei are more prevalent in the dry season in gardens when compared to other areas. This is why we analysed whether common gardening practices such as regular watering (irrigation) or soil fertilizing change the occurrence of B. pseudomallei. We conducted a soil microcosm experiment with a range of fertilizers and soil types as well as a longitudinal interventional study over three years on an experimental fertilized field site in an area naturally positive for B. pseudomallei. Irrigation was the only consistent treatment to increase B. pseudomallei occurrence over time. The effects of fertilizers upon these bacteria depended on soil texture, physicochemical properties such as pH or salinity and vegetation. B. pseudomallei occurrence was also associated with imported grasses. With increasing populations in endemic areas, these findings inform the identification of areas in the anthropogenic environment with increased risk of exposure to B. pseudomallei.
