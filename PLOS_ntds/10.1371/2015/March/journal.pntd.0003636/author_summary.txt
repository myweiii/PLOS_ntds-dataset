Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira and affects millions of people, worldwide, each year. Laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis currently relies on methods that are flawed in many areas. Current methods are outdated, time consuming and expensive. They rely on a continuous supply of animal products (rabbit anti-sera) and require specialist expertise and equipment. The current gold standard diagnostic assay for leptospirosis (MAT) cannot determine IgG from IgM antibodies and relies on live cultures, which presents problems in the way of maintenance and attenuation. Development of a new diagnostic assay for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis that is specific, sensitive and able to discriminate between IgG and IgM classes of antibodies—as well as being more cost effective—will significantly improve the capabilities for detecting leptospirosis infections. It will provide medical professionals with more valuable diagnostic information and public health professionals with improved epidemiological information.
