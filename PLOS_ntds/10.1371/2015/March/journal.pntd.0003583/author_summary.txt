In order to achieve global elimination of lymphatic filariasis, it may be necessary to consider alternative approaches to mass treatment using higher or more frequent dosing with the existing drugs used in the programmes. Outside Africa, the drugs used are albendazole and diethylcarbamazine given annually. The current study is the first to examine the use of higher or more frequent dosing in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area outside Africa. Four groups of infected subjects were followed for two years using standard techniques for monitoring drug efficacy in Odisha, India. We showed that higher doses of albendazole, or 6-monthly treatment, were more effective than the standard regimen in producing clearance of microfilaria and reductions in antigenemia. Additionally we found that these regimens were more effective in killing the adult filarial worms in the lymphatics. Importantly, the higher doses used did not increase the risk of side effects. These alternative approaches could accelerate lymphatic filariasis elimination either at the end of existing programmes or to permit new programmes to achieve their goals faster.
