Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) exist ubiquitously in the environment and cause many kinds of diseases including pulmonary infection. Despite this, NTM does not match compulsory report policy in many countries, such as China. Thus, the epidemiology of NTM is generally unknown. Furthermore, misdiagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterium disease as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) frequently occurs in clinical settings because of similar clinical manifestations. Therefore, elucidating the epidemiology and distribution of NTM species is important and may have a profound and lasting impact on the prevalence of pulmonary NTM disease. In our study, we enrolled smear-positive sputum samples during 2008 from Jiangsu province in the eastern region of China. Traditional biochemical tests and molecular biological methods were performed to distinguish NTM isolates to species/complex level. For the first time, we provide a snapshot of the epidemiology and geographic distribution of NTM in Jiangsu province. The proportion of NTM was 3.37% of all the Mycobacterium isolates and the species of NTM differed by area.
