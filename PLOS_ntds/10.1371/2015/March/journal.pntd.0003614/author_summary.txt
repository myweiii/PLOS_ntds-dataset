Indigenous peoples are especially affected by Chagas and other neglected tropical diseases. One of the most numerous ethnic groups in the Gran Chaco region of South America is the Qom (Toba) people. The living conditions of Qom households most likely differ substantially from those of Creoles, and their association with house infestation by triatomine bugs has not been investigated. This is important because the major vector species have adapted to thrive in human sleeping quarters, and in addition to housing construction patterns, other ecological and sociodemographic factors may affect house infestation. We found that Qom households had much higher domestic infestation than Creole ones, in conjunction with more precarious housing, fewer poultry and livestock. The unexpectedly high local residential mobility of Qom households combined with the large fraction of recently-built houses (derived from a rapidly increasing population with a very young age structure during recent decades) may explain why domestic infestation was much lower than expected from the lack of recent insecticide spraying campaigns. Domestic infestation and bug abundance increased with overcrowding and refuge availability, and decreased with household education levels and insecticide use. These results are useful for designing improved interventions and household risk stratification.
