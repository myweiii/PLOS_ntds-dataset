Bartonella are bacteria that infect many different mammal species and can cause illness in people. Several Bartonella species carried by rodents cause disease in humans but little is known about their distribution or the importance of bartonellosis as a cause of human illness. Data from Africa are particularly scarce. This study involved trapping of rodents and other small mammals at two sites in Kenya: Asembo, a rural area in Western Kenya, and Kibera, an informal urban settlement in Nairobi. Blood samples were collected from trapped animals to detect and characterize the types of Bartonella carried. At the Kibera site over half of the trapped rats were infected with Bartonella very similar to human pathogenic strains isolated from rats from other global regions. In Asembo, Bartonella were detected in four of the five animal species trapped and these Bartonella were less similar to previously identified isolates. All of the small mammals included in this study were trapped in or around human habitations. The data from this study show that Bartonella that can cause human illness are carried by the small mammals at these two sites and indicate that the public health impacts of human bartonellosis should be investigated.
