Many researchers consider the Sudan as the mycetoma homeland. The first report on mycetoma was at the turn of the eighteenth century, and since then many documents on mycetoma have been reported. However, there is no recent report on mycetoma in the country. In 1977 Mahgoub published data on mycetoma in Sudan, but no more data were published until the MRC was established. The present study reports on 6,792 patients with mycetoma seen and managed at the MRC in a period of 23 years. This is the largest reported number of cases on the disease at national and international levels. The clinical presentations of the reported patients were in line with the previous reports on mycetoma from the Sudan and elsewhere. Still, many patients presented late with advanced disease and enormous disabilities and deformities. Some of them had a fatal outcome due to several complications. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, outcome is still unsatisfactory. There is a need for more research to develop effective treatment of mycetoma and field friendly diagnostic techniques. Adequate preventive and control measures to reduce the disease morbidity and mortality are needed.
