Hookworm is a parasitic worm that can infect the human intestine. Infections are common in low- and middle-income tropical and subtropical countries, particularly where sanitation conditions are poor. Control programs aim at preventing heavy infection intensities, which are associated with morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for hookworm infection and intensity, and to predict their distribution in the Champasack province, southern Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic. We found that almost half of the 3,371 people examined were infected with hookworms. Better-off people had a lower risk and intensity of infection. Females showed lower prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection than males, except women aged 50 years and above, who were the most heavily infected. Preschool-aged children had the lowest infection levels. Hookworm transmission appeared to occur within, rather than between villages. Hookworm infections are widespread in the Champasack province, with homogeneous infection intensity and somewhat lower infection risk west of the Mekong River, which offers higher living conditions. Hookworm control should be intensified in the Champasack province, particularly in the mountainous areas.
