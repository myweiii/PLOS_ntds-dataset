Schistosomiasis and fascioliasis are caused by two related trematodes found within the phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), and are classified as neglected diseases of poverty due to their effects on people living in the most underprivileged areas of the world. With no vaccine currently near development, and the existing strategy for global control based on the over-reliance on single-class chemotherapies, there is an urgent requirement for the identification of next generation anthelmintics. Here we demonstrate that 7-keto-sempervirol, a natural product derived from Lycium chinense, displays dual anthelmintic activity towards both Schistosoma mansoni (causative agent of schistosomiasis) and Fasciola hepatica (causative agent of fascioliasis). Utilising objective and phenotypic matrices, we show this activity to be selective (compared to a human cell line) and moderately potent against S. mansoni and F. hepatica larvae. This anti-larval effect translates into additional activity against both S. mansoni and F. hepatica adults where 7-keto-sempervirol induces phenotypic abnormalities including tegumental damage, motility disruption and oviposition inhibition. Due to 7-keto-sempervirolâ€™s anthelmintic activity against multiple life stages of two parasitic trematodes, we contend that this starting chemical scaffold could be used to develop more effective compounds useful in controlling important parasites of biomedical and commercial relevance.
