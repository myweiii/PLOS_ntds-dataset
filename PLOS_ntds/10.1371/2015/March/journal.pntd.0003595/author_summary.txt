Plasmodium vivax is one of two major parasite species causing human disease. This parasite can lie dormant in the liver as a hypnozoite, before later reactivating to cause blood-stage infection. Treatment to eliminate the dormant hypnozoite stage relies mostly on a single drugâ€”primaquine. Understanding the rate of primary infection versus hypnozoite reactivation is important to understanding primaquine efficacy and drug resistance, as well as the development of new drugs targeting hypnozoites. Here we use mathematical modeling to analyse data from two clinical cohorts and show that up to 96% of infections may be caused by hypnozoite reactivation. We also use modeling to understand the impact of drug resistance, seasonal infection and subject age.
