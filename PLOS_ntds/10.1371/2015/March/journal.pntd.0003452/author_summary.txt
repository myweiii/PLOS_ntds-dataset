Recently added to the World Health Organization list of neglected tropical diseases, scabies is an under-recognised cause of morbidity in many developing countries, due to secondary bacterial infection of the skin that can in turn lead to serious systemic complications such as kidney disease and, potentially, rheumatic heart disease. Despite the apparent burden of disease in many countries, there have been few large-scale surveys of scabies prevalence or risk factors. We undertook a population-based survey in Fiji of scabies and impetigo to evaluate the magnitude of the problem and inform public health strategies. We examined 10,887 people across 75 communities in all four geographical divisions of Fiji, covering both urban and rural areas. The national prevalence of scabies and impetigo was 23.6% and 19.6% respectively, and highest in children aged 5â€“9 years. We found that scabies was very strongly associated with impetigo. Scabies was twice as high in iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians compared to Indo-Fijians. Our study shows that scabies occurs at high levels across all age groups, ethnicities, and geographical locations. Improved strategies are urgently needed to achieve control of scabies and its complications in endemic communities.
