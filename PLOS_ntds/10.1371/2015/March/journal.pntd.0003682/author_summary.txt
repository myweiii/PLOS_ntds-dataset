Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness and the World Health Organization plans to eliminate it as a public health concern worldwide by the year 2020. It can be difficult for local trachoma programs to assess whether disease is headed towards elimination in their area. Mathematical infectious disease models describe that when a disease disappears, its prevalence across communities in that area form an exponential distribution. However, this theorem has never been tested with field data. In this study, we take trachoma prevalence data from Tanzania, in an area where trachoma was known to be disappearing, and find that the prevalence forms an exponential distribution. The implications of this study could be applied to other infectious diseases to provide evidence that prevalence is headed towards elimination.
