Rabies has been a serious public health threat in Flores Island since its introduction in 1997, with significant economic consequences for the government due to the cost of providing vaccines for humans and dogs. Vaccination of dogs against rabies offers a safe and effective means to prevent rabies in humans in the long term. The local government of Flores Island has implemented dog vaccination campaigns throughout the island, free of charge for all dog owners. However, the uptake rate of vaccinating dogs is too low to control the disease. Identifying factors associated with the dog ownersâ€™ decisions to vaccinate their dogs provides information to policy makers to increase vaccination uptake in the future. This study evaluated the impact of rabies knowledge and socio-demographic factors of dog owners on the uptake of the 2012 dog vaccination campaign. Overall, the uptake rate of the 2012 vaccination campaign was low. Levels of knowledge about rabies and its control were high, but not associated with uptake of vaccination. Geographical accessibility was significantly associated with vaccination uptake. Targeted distribution of information in those villages with poor accessibility may increase vaccination uptake in the future. Information should cover vaccination schedules and methods to restrain dogs.
