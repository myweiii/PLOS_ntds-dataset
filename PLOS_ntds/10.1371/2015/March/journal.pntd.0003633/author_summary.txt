Loiasis recently emerged as a disease of public health importance because of the risk of rare severe adverse events (SAEs) associated with the rapid killing of Loa loa microfilariae in heavily parasitized individuals following ivermectin treatment. for onchocerciasis. The possibility of developing these SAEs has been slowing down the control of onchocerciasis in some endemic communities. Based on information available at the Osun State Ministry of Health, the detailed geographic distribution of L. loa in Osun State is still awaiting elucidation. The results of this study revealed an overlap in geographic distribution of loasis and onchocerciasis in many communities in Osun State. The overall Community Microfilaria Load (CMFL) for L. loa was below the threshold level of endemicity that could be associated with the risk of SAEs after ivermectin treatment. Most individuals with slightly high L. loa microfilaria are either O. volvulus microfilaria free or have very low microfilaria load. The low prevalence of co-infection of both diseases in the study area is an indication that loiasis may not pose any serious epidemiological threat to the distribution and sustainability of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciaisis.
