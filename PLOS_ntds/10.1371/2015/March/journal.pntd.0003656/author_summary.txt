Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by worms from the genus Schistosoma, is one of the most widespread neglected tropical diseases in the world. Due to the intensive use of praziquantel, some reports of drug resistance have emerged. Thus it is important to search for new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment disease. This research showed that epiisopiloturine, an imidazole alkaloid extracted from the leaves of Pilocarpus microphylus, has activity against S. mansoni in vivo. This material is produced as a by-product of an existing commercial process, and thus can be produced in large quantities at relatively low cost. The low toxicity and high drug tolerance in mammals shows the potential of epiisopiloturine as a new candidate schistosomicidal compound.
