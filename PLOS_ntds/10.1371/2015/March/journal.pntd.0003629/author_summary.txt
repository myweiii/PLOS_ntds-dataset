This paper describes a simple and cost-effective system for screening biological samples for virus-infection. The authors demonstrate the application of two antibodies to detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is a common molecule produced in infection by a number of different viruses. The use of antibodies which react with double-stranded RNA independently of sequence allows for detection of a diverse range of viruses and has been instrumental in the detection of known arboviruses from three different families and the discovery of a number of previously unknown viruses from Australian mosquito populations. This system provides a rapid and economical approach to virus surveillance and discovery. This is the first report of anti-dsRNA antibodies used in a streamlined system for virus detection and discovery in field-caught samples.
