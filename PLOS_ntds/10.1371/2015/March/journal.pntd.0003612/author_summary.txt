Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is covered by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoproteins, which shield parasites from effectors of the host immune system. The most abundant protein is the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which plays an essential role in antigenic variation and the ability of the parasite to evade the immune system. VSGs are N-glycosylated in a site-specific manner by different oligosaccharyltransferases giving rise to complex and mannose-rich N-glycans. In this study, we report that the carbohydrate binding agent, stinging nettle agglutinin (UDA, Urtica dioica), exhibits trypanocidal activity, impairs endocytosis, and cytokinesis and induces parasite lysis. We have investigated the mechanisms conferring resistance in order to understand UDA mode of action and found that resistant strains present changes in the expression of oligosaccharyltransferases, and modifications in the nature of the predominant VSG, therefore resulting in important changes in N-glycan composition. The modification in surface glycans gives rise to reduced infectivity in vivo further underscoring the role of glycosylation in parasite virulence. Our findings show that carbohydrate binding agents that bind effectively to surface glycoproteins can provide a novel avenue for design of drugs to combat African trypanosomiasis.
