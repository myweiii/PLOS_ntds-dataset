Leptospirosis is a disease of worldwide significance, and it is also an important zoonotic disease, particularly in developing countries. Subclinically infected rodents maintain leptospires in nature, and some that recover from the primary leptospiral infection may release the bacterium in their urine for the rest of their lives. These rodents serve as a potential source of leptospiral infection to animals and humans. Non-rodent mammals can also be reservoirs of leptospiral infection to animals and humans. Globally, animal and human leptospirosis has been attributed to rodents. There is limited knowledge on the occurrence of the disease in domestic animals, humans, wildlife and rodents in many parts of Tanzania, including the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem. Serological examination of cattle, goats, humans, buffaloes, zebra, lions, rodents and shrews in the ecosystem revealed the presence of antibodies to serogroups Sejroe, Hebdomadis, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagie, Australis and Ballum. These serogroups infect not only their usual hosts but also other animal species, which can in turn act as reservoirs of these serogroups to other animals and humans. This study demonstrates the distribution of leptospiral serogroups in domestic animals, humans, wildlife, rodents and shrews in the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem. The results of the current study will help in developing appropriate interventions for preventing or mitigating the impacts of infections in domestic animals, humans, wildlife, rodents and shrews. Our results also suggest that human and animal populations are at risk of contracting the infection.
