Diarrhoea is an important cause of illness and death among young children in low- and middle-income countries. Nonetheless, very few epidemiological studies of diarrhoea have been conducted in Mexico during the last two decades. In recent years, a group of bacteria known as diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) have been recognized as a major cause of diarrheal illness worldwide. This group cannot be identified by the conventional biochemical methods used for other diarrhoeal pathogens such as Salmonella or Shigella, which limits its identification. We conducted a study in Yucatan, Mexico, to identify the bacterial causes of acute diarrhoea in children less than five years of age who required hospitalization. All DEC strains were further characterized for the presence of six E. coli supplementary virulence genes (SVG). Of the 831 children with acute diarrhoea, a bacterial pathogen was found in 56%. DEC was the most prevalent (28%) pathogen, surpassing Salmonella and Shigella. Among children with DEC diarrhoea, 44% were moderately or severely ill. Thirty-six percent of the DEC strains had one or more SVG, which were more common in older children. Our results strongly suggest that DEC carrying SVG are an important cause of moderate to severe bacterial diarrhoeal disease in Mexico.
