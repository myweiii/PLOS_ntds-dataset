Dengue disease has become a major global public health concern, but an ideal diagnostic test that permits early and rapid diagnosis is not yet available. Improving diagnostic performance in this area is a major challenge and necessitates the development and evaluation of new efficient, accurate methods. According to the kinetics of dengue infection in serum, virus isolation and nucleic acid or antigen detection are the most specific diagnostic methods during the early acute stage of disease; serology is often used for diagnosis later in the course of infection. In order to provide an earlier and reliable dating of the dengue infection, few recent studies showed that the detection of specific IgA in the serum is a useful diagnostic parameter. Exploring that new approach, this study was carried out to assess the performance of a Platelia Dengue IgA Capture assay for dengue infection detection, newly developed by Bio-Rad, using 184 well-characterized samples provided by the French Guiana NRC sera collection of the Institut Pasteur in French Guiana. This study revealed good overall performances of this test, constituting promising assistance in dengue diagnosis, especially in hyper-endemic countries.
