An acute dengue virus infection usually starts with a febrile disease phase that can progress to severe disease around the time fever abates (defervescence). Here we study dengue patients that were included very early after the onset of disease and carefully monitored in a longitudinal cohort study. Our results show that time after the onset of disease has a major impact on the transcriptome profile of patients with dengue, which is confirmed by comparing our results with three other dengue studies that included patients at different disease stages. There is a gradual shift in transcriptome profile from an ‘immunity & inflammation’- to a ‘repair & recovery’ phenotype. Furthermore, the expression of gene network modules could be linked to specific clinical parameters of dengue virus infection. Platelet counts and the levels of fibrinogen and albumin are shown to be good markers for the activity and timing of the disease, reflecting relevant biological processes in the patient. In contrast, conventional WHO classification systems did not show any association with any of the 25 gene modules identified and only yielded a few differentially expressed genes. The expression level of gene modules specific for certain biological processes in dengue support earlier detection of progression to severe disease and may improve clinical management.
