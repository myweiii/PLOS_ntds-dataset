Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL), caused by the single cellular protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania, is treated in Suriname with pentamidine isethionate (PI). Standard treatment consists of 3 intramuscular injections of 4 mg per kg bodyweight given in 7 days. Compliance to treatment is low which may lead to treatment failure. A shorter treatment course of PI, 3 days, may aid in solving the compliance problem. In this study CL patients were included in two study arms, the control arm, PI 4 mg/kg/injection, three injections in 7 days (84 patients) and the intervention arm, PI 7 mg/kg/injection, two injections in 3 days (79 patients). Based on the study results it cannot be concluded that that the 3 day regimen is at least as good (non-inferior) to the 7 day regimen, as far as clinical and parasitological cure, toxic and adverse events. Based on these findings there is no evidence to change the standard treatment of 3 injections of 4 mg/kg PI in Suriname.
