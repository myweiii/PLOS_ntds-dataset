Neurocysticercosis is caused by infection of the brain with the larval (cyst) stage of the tape worm Taenia solium in humans and pigs. Antiparasitic drug treatment is compromised by worsening of neurological symptoms during therapy due to reactive inflammation triggered by the dying parasite. The immune mechanisms that cause this inflammation are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the nature of inflammation after treatment in pigs naturally infected with T. solium cysts. Evans blue dye injected into infected pigs marks areas in the brain where the normally impermeable capillaries have become more permeable, allowing damaging cells and molecules to leak out into the brain. By microscopy and measurement of gene expression for inflammation-inducing immune mediators, we show that inflammation in the brain tissues around cysts is more severe with increased vessel leakage. Furthermore, the levels of these mediators increased after antiparasitic drug treatment. A significant implication of these findings is that it may be possible to inhibit the inflammation around parasites using drugs or biologics that inhibit these inflammatory pathways and, thereby, reduce local brain damage during treatment. These observations may also be applicable to other inflammatory conditions that affect the brain.
