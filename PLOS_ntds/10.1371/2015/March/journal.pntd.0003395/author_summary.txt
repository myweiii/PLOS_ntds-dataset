Since there is no vaccine or treatment available for dengue fever, its prevention relies on community participation. Residents are asked to remove from their houses and gardens all receptacles where mosquitoes can breed. Exploring the public perception regarding dengue prevention is crucial for detecting obstacles to their participation in the proposed preventive activities. The authors explored and compared the community's perceptions before and after the first dengue outbreak in Madeira Island. For the first time it was possible to study the effect of a dengue outbreak in the public perceptions regarding its prevention. After the dengue outbreak, the authors found an improvement in the perception of the community. However, even after experiencing an outbreak, the majority of the residents still did not understand their role in the dengue prevention and, thus were not ready to adhere to it. Moreover, the authors also observed some new myths within the community after the outbreak (which were not present before the outbreak). The improvement of community perceptions was expected. However this search also revealed that this experience can surprisingly promote the emergence of new myths which may hamper the community engagement in the dengue prevention.
