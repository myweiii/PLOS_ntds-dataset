Leishmaniasis is one of the most important human neglected parasitic diseases worldwide. Although it is considered a disease of the developing world, it is currently spreading northwards, outbreaks are occurring in endemic areas, and foci of the disease are appearing in previously non endemic countries, not necessarily associated to HIV as it occurred in the past. In the Old World, the disease has two clinical forms, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. While the cutaneous form is mostly asymptomatic, the visceral form implies various degrees of severity, also being historically associated and influenced by the HIV co-infection. Since 1997, antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available for HIV treatment, subsequently influencing the evolution and epidemiology of leishmaniasis. In this paper we use hospitalized leishmaniasis discharge data, in order to describe this disease´s geographical and temporal trends and its main epidemiological characteristics by patients´ HIV status since ART introduction, in Spain between 1997 and 201.
