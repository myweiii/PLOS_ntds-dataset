Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease commonly transmitted from animals to humans. Though this disease affects more than three quarters of a million people every year and takes a disproportionate toll on the poor in in tropical regions, few virulence factors have been identified and very little is known regarding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Symptoms vary from fever and fatigue to severe pulmonary hemorrhage and death. Approximately 5â€“10% of Leptospira infections in humans are chronic (>1 year) and asymptomatic (no overt signs of disease). Nonetheless, very little is known about the clinical significance of these infections. In this report, we show that non-invasive tools namely proteomic analysis of urinary exosomes can be used to identify differences between healthy and Leptospira-infected rat kidney and between Leptospira-infected male and female rat kidney. In future studies, these analyses will be extended to determine clinical significance and extent of renal dysfunction in the asymptomatic human.
