Extracellular trypanosomes, causative agents of sleeping sickness and Nagana, threaten human and animal health throughout the world. Anemia is a hallmark feature of virtually every type of trypanosome infection. During the early phase of experimental murine trypanosomosis, acute anemia occurs as witnessed by a 50% reduction in red blood cells within a 48 hour time span. The acute nature of this phenomenon suggests the implication of a consumptive process such as erythrophagocytosis. However, due to the multiple significant drawbacks of the presently used phagocytosis techniques, this has never been straightforwardly demonstrated. Here we developed a new erythrophagocytosis assay based on the labeling of red blood cells with the acid-sensitive dye pHrodo. This assay unequivocally distinguishes erythrophagocytozing cells in vivo and in vitro via flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Using this new assay, we show that the acute anemia during experimental trypanosomosis is a result of enhanced erythrophagocytosis by activated liver monocytic cells and neutrophils as well as by activated splenic macrophages. Moreover, the red blood cell membrane composition and stability are altered during the infection, priming them for enhanced clearance by the myeloid phagocytic system.
