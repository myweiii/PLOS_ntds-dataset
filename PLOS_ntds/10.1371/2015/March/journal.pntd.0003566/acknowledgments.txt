We would like to thank Dan Neafsey for providing information on the library preparation and sequencing at the Broad Institute. We would also like to acknowledge the late Dr. William E. Collins in making this manuscript and the research of many other malaria investigators possible through his generosity and critical contributions towards preserving the many isolates and strains of human and non-human primate malaria parasites adapted to New World and Old World monkeys and apes. The raw sequences generated for the locus-specific analysis of the Mauritania samples are freely accessible through SRA (see S1 Table for accession numbers).
