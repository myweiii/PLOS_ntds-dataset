Buruli ulcer (BU) is a disease of the skin and soft tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The resulting skin lesions provide a niche for survival of other microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, which may cause delayed wound healing. This study investigated the presence, diversity, and spatio-temporal distribution of S. aureus in BU patients from Ghana during treatment by isolating the bacteria from nose and wound swabs or wound dressings. S. aureus isolates were subsequently characterized by two complementary DNA typing approaches. This showed that 19 (63%) of the 30 investigated BU patients carried S. aureus. Five (26%) of these 19 BU patients carried the same S. aureus type in their anterior nares and wounds. Seven (37%) patients carried the same S. aureus type in their wounds, which is indicative of transmission. Three of them (16%) carried at least two different S. aureus types at the same time in their wounds, while five (26%) carried different S. aureus types over time. Notably, five (17%) BU patients tested positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These findings imply that the spatio-temporal diversity of S. aureus in BU is most likely related to factors such as antibiotic pressure, and insufficient wound care and hygiene.
