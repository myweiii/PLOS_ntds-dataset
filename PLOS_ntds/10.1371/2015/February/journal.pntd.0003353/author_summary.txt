Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a major health problem in Uganda, as there are recurrent sporadic outbreaks of the disease in traditionally endemic areas in south-east Uganda, and continued spread to new unaffected areas in central Uganda. In this study, we evaluate the evolutionary dynamics underpinning the origin of new disease foci and the impact of host species on parasite genetic diversity in Uganda. We found three distinct genetic clusters of T. brucei in Uganda and southwestern Kenya. Clusters 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These three clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation (T. b. brucei vs T. b. rhodesiense), host or date of collection. Our results show expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense. They also confirm the emergence of the human infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as Tbr reservoir, as confounders that shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
