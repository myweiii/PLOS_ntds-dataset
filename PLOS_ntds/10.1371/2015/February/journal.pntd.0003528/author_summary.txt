Dengue is a viral disease transmitted between humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It is an increasing health problem in tropical regions, with no vaccine or drug available. The main approach used for dengue prevention and control is reducing mosquito numbers, which is commonly done by spraying insecticide around the houses of reported dengue cases and their neighbors. This assumes that mosquito populations around the home contribute to onwards transmission of dengue to other people living near the identified case, and that by reducing these populations further infections can be prevented. A previous study in rural villages in Thailand showed that dengue infections did cluster near the house of a case, but it is not clear whether this would also be the case in a densely-populated urban setting like Ho Chi Minh City. In this study, we show that people living close to a dengue case in HCMC were in fact no more likely to be infected with dengue over a two week period than controls who did not live near a dengue case, although they were two times more likely to have evidence of a recent dengue infection at enrollment. This suggests that dengue risk might cluster around households in this setting, but that responsive insecticide spraying around the homes of reported cases is unlikely to prevent many additional infections.
