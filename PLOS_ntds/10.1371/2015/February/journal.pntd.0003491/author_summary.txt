Patients infected by S. stercoralis are at risk of fatal complications. It is therefore mandatory to demonstrate complete response to therapy. Post treatment evaluation should be done with highly sensitive diagnostic methods, which can exclude the persistence of the infection. Serology is more sensitive than fecal examination and coproculture. In this study, we compare the post-treatment performance of five serology tests, and suggest that they can be useful for the follow up of patients with S. stercoralis infection, especially in non-endemic areas, where there is no risk of reinfection. In fact, the results of the tests show a progressive decrease, towards negativization, of the values (expressed in different units, depending on the specific test) through time.
