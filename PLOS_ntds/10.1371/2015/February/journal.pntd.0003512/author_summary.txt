Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is an endemic disease of Latin-American countries, affecting an estimated 8 million people in 21 countries. It is spread by the bite of triatomine reduvid bug. Due to immigration towards non-endemic regions, the disease can spread and affect people around the world via blood transfusions. Infection usually occurs in childhood, and some patients may develop acute myocarditis; however, most remain asymptomatic for many years before chronic cardiac and/or gastrointestinal manifestations appear. Chagas disease is characterized by an acute phase, which is generally asymptomatic, or oligosymptomatic, an indeterminate phase, which may persist for several years, and a chronic phase in which dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias are primarily observed and sudden death may occur. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years. In this work, we demonstrate the pathophysiological role of proteins secreted by T. cruzi on cardiac arrhythmias. The antigenicity of these fractions was tested by an immunological test using chagasic patientsâ€™ sera associated with arrhythmias. We showed that perfusion of the proteins secreted by T. cruzi, in an isolated beating rat heart model, induced cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia and complete atrioventricular block.
