Cryptosporidium is a common zoonotic gastrointestinal parasite. In a cross-sectional survey of humans, non-human primates (chimpanzees and baboons) and livestock in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem, Tanzania, Cryptosporidium infection rate was 4.3%, 16.0% and 9.6% respectively. Infection was not associated with clinical disease in people; however, living in a household with an infected person increased oneâ€™s risk of infection. Phylogenetic analyses identified clusters of Cryptosporidium with a mixed host background. Surprisingly, the Mitumba chimpanzee community, which shares a natural boundary with a human community, had a lower occurrence of C. hominis compared to the Kasakela chimpanzee community, which resides in the forest interior (less human exposure). However, Kasakela chimpanzees were also infected with C. suis, suggesting a transmission cycle linked to sympatric bush pigs. Our findings highlight the complex nature of zoonotic parasite transmission and stress the need for further studies in similar systems.
