Onchocerciasis or river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis, which can lead to disfiguring elephantiasis, are two neglected tropical diseases that affect millions of people, primarily in developing countries. Both diseases are caused by filariid nematodes; onchocerciasis is caused by Onchocerca volvulus and lymphatic filariasis is caused by Brugia malayi, B. timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti. Currently, there are no drugs available that are highly efficacious against adult worms; existing drugs mainly kill the first-stage larvae (microfilariae). While these drugs can reduce the transmission of infections in a population, the adult filariids (macrofilariae) can continue to produce microfilariae and perpetuate the cycle of infection. Finding a drug that could kill the adult worms would be an important tool in eliminating onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. To identify potential macrofilaricidal drugs, we developed a high throughput screening method to test FDA-approved drugs on adult Brugia spp., which serves as a model for O. volvulus. Using this screening method, we identified a drug called auranofin that kills adult Onchocerca and adult Brugia spp. in vitro, inhibits the molting of O. volvulus L3s, and reduces the worm burden in an in vivo gerbil-B. pahangi model system. Auranofin is known to inhibit a critical enzyme called thioredoxin reductase in some parasite species, and subsequent testing of the effects of auranofin on the thioredoxin reductase of Brugia indicates that this may be auranofinâ€™s mode of action in this nematode as well.
