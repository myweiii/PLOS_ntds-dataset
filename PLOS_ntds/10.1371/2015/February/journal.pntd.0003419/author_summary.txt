In this report we have characterized the venoms from three species of Bitis snakes involved in accidents with humans in the Sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica rhinoceros and Bitis nasicornis. These venoms possess a combination of proteases that can directly affect the coagulation system and the systems involved in the modulation of blood pressure regulation and salt balance via generation of vasoactive peptides. We also demonstrated in vitro that the deleterious effects of these venoms can be efficiently blocked by experimental horse antivenoms produced against B. arietans or B. g. rhinoceros plus B. nasicornis venoms.
