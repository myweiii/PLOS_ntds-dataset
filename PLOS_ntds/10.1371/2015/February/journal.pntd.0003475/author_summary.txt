Dengue vector surveillance programs regularly use household surveys for searching breeding sites that are positive for Ae. aegypti larvae. Infestation indices are calculated as the percentage of positive houses, or percentage of positive containers, and are used to guide control actions and to issue alerts. However, these indices are costly and prone to error due to variation in searching effort and the sometimes cryptic nature of the mosquito egg laying behavior. In the recent years, many devices for trapping mosquitoes were developed. One problem when deciding which trap to choose for surveillance is the lack of a gold standard to compare trap-based indices with. In this scenario, choice relies on the behavior of the trap indices, that is, how well they inform about mosquito population growth, decline, or spread. Our study compared infestation indices produced by four different trap schemes as well the immature survey. We observed that any trap is more sensitive in detecting the mosquito presence than the immature survey, and they are better in capturing the temporal variation in mosquito abundance as well. However, traps are very different in terms of cost, ease-of-use and sensitivity and trap choice should further consider these factors.
