Nematode parasites are a plague on the human condition in many developing countries with limited health care and sanitation. The morbidity produced by these parasites limits human health, development and prosperity. Nematode parasites also adversely affect animal welfare and production. Vaccines are not effective, so anthelmintic drugs are necessary for prophylaxis and treatment. Most anthelmintics belong to one of three classes: the macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin, moxidectin); the nicotinic anthelmintics (levamisole, pyrantel, derquantel) or; the benzimidazoles (albendazole, mebendazole). With the limited number of drugs available, there is real concern about the development of resistance. Tribendimidine was developed in China in the mid-1980s as a broad spectrum anthelmintic against soil-transmitted nematodes. Its mode of action has been investigated molecularly in C. elegans and on expressed nAChRs but, its mode of action has not been investigated directly in parasitic nematodes. Here we describe its effects on muscle contraction and electrophysiology in the pig nematode parasite, A. suum, which is very similar or the same as the human parasite, A. lumbricoides. Here we show that tribendimidine is a B-subtype selective nicotinic anthelmintic agonist that activates muscle nAChRs that are pharmacologically different from other cholinergic anthelmintics. It is concluded that tribendimidine could be effective against nematode parasites resistant to another cholinergic anthelmintic.
