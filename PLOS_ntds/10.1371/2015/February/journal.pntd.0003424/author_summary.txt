DENV infection first manifests as an undifferentiated fever before either settling without complications, or progressing to severe disease requiring inpatient admission and careful supportive intravenous fluid management. The ability to differentiate DENV infection from other febrile illnesses, and to predict those at risk of severe disease is likely to be important. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available DENV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for children admitted with febrile illness to a hospital in Cambodia during the DENV transmission season. We found sensitivity of the DENV RDT to be 58% and specificity to be 85% versus reference assay DENV serology. We then modelled the ability of clinical features, basic laboratory parameters, and DENV RDT result at presentation of the child to distinguish DENV infection from other febrile illness, and determine the need for critical care admission. We found that the DENV RDT did not increase the accuracy with which we diagnosed DENV infection, and was not helpful in deciding which children required critical care admission. Indeed, the relatively high prevalence of serious bacterial disease in the cohort of children indicated a broad microbiological differential diagnosis in all febrile children, regardless of their DENV infection status.
