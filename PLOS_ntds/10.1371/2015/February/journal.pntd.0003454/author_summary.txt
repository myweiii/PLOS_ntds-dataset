As one of the worldâ€™s most prevalent zoonotic diseases, schistosomiasis remains a serious worldwide public health problem. An immunoproteomics approach was used to identify potential immune diagnostic molecules from S. japonicum TG proteins extracted from adult schistosomes. Probes were derived from sera collected from uninfected rabbits and rabbits at 2 and 6 weeks after infection with S. japonicum as well as praziquantel-treated rabbits. SjPGM and SjRAD23 were identified as potential diagnostic markers for the disease. High sensitivity and specificity and low crossreactivity were observed for rSjPGM-ELISA and rSjRAD23-ELISA, which were used to detect water buffalo schistosomiasis. In addition, these two proteins induced a short-lived antibody response since specific IgG antibodies to them declined quickly after chemotherapy and had the potential to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy against S. japonicum. Our study provides information for screening potential diagnostic antigens and establishing more sensitive schistosomiasis diagnosis techniques.
