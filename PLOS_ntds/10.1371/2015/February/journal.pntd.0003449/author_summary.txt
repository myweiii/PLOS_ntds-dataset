Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. When a sandfly bites a vertebrate host, it injects a cocktail of salivary proteins meant to facilitate blood feeding. The constant exposure to sandfly bites in endemic areas triggers a humoral response against the major antigenic components in the saliva. These antibodies can be then exploited to measure exposure to vector sandflies, which is useful for surveillance in leishmaniasis control programmes. In Saudi Arabia, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is mainly transmitted by the Phlebotomus papatasi sandfly. Here we study the recognition of the main antigenic salivary protein from Ph. papatasi, PpSP32, in leishmaniasis patients and healthy individuals from three CL endemic areas in Saudi Arabia. Anti-PpSP32 antibody levels were significantly higher in CL patients presenting active infections from all geographical regions compared to the CL-cured and healthy individuals. Furthermore, higher anti-PpSP32 antibody levels correlated with the prevalence and type of CL lesions observed in patients. Our results suggest that previous long-term exposure to sandfly saliva can have a role in modulating the severity of leishmaniasis infection, resulting in a milder form of the disease.
