Hantaan virus (HTNV) causes human hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with a mortality rate of approximately 15% in Asia. At present, the primary treatment for HFRS is limited to critical care management and the use of anti-viral drugs, such as Ribavirin. However, the cytokine storm at the acute phase of HFRS, which is thought to contribute to the development of the disease, is still lacking an effective way to prevent. An alternative way to prevent the development of cytokine storm is of priority to overcome the problem. We found that IL-33 and sST2 levels were higher in the plasma of HFRS patients, especially in their acute phase. Although both of them were positively correlated with the severity of the diseases, they acted in different roles in the regulation of the immune response during HTNV infection. In vitro study showed that IL-33 acted as an initiator of the cytokine storm in HTNV-infected endothelial cells, while sST2 acted as an inhibitor of the process. For the first time, we defined the IL-33/ST2 axis as inflammatory regulators during HTNV infection. Our results may provide a novel therapeutic target of HTNV infections.
