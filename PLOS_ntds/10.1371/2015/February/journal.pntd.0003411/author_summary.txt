Leishmaniasis is an important disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries. Leishmania amazonensis is an important agent of leishmaniasis in Brazil, leading mainly to localized (LCL) and sometimes to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), depending on the host immune response to infection. We believe that host immune response affects not only the clinical form and survival of Leishmania, but also the phenotype and virulence of the parasite. To analyze the effects of the host on Leishmania phenotype, we compared protein expression (proteome) of parasites isolated from wild type mice and from mice lacking T cells. We identified some protein isoforms differentially expressed, which may further be studied as potential virulence factors.
