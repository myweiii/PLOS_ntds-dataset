Assessment of the health and number of nematodes still relies heavily on subjective monitoring of their motion. Although less-subjective techniques exist that utilize the motility as the primary indicator, the current approaches tend to be designed for use with larger worms and not for early developmental stages. We have describe here a sensitive technique that converts the motion of nematodes into electrical waveforms, which then be used for an estimation of the number parasites present, and for detailed analysis of alterations in their movements. Using parasites of different sizes, including different stages of Brugia sp. and Caenorhabditis elegans, we have shown that the system can analyse samples containing up to 1000 microfilariae/ml, and can be used to used to detect the decrease in motility as a worm loses viability. We have also demonstrated its use in assessing the effects of chloroquine and imatinib on filariae. This sensitive technique is likely to be value to research and field laboratories where there is a need to rapidly estimate the number of parasites present in liquid samples, and can be used in drug screening programs to assess the effects of different anthelminthics.
