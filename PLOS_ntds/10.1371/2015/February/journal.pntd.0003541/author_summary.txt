PCM triggers a typical granulomatous inflammatory reaction with PMN playing a major role; these inflammatory cells are crucial in the initial stages of PCM, participating in the innate immune reaction and also directing the acquired immune response in the later stages. In some PCM patients, these immune mechanisms are insufficient to eradicate the infection, and need to be boosted with antifungal drugs that have to be administered for long periods and can show serious side-effects. We aimed to develop a novel and safe way to activate PMN through low-level laser irradiation of the bone marrow in the mouse femoral medulla. LLLT increased PMN viability and activation, shown by a significantly greater production of protein and ROS, as well as a higher fungicidal capacity; PMN even retained their higher metabolic activity and fungicidal ability after a second exposure to the pathogenic fungus in vitro. This is the first time that LLLT has been shown to increase the immune response against a fungal infection, and could be a promising and safe technique to be used with antifungal drugs in PCM.
