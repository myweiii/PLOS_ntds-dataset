Studies to determine drug efficacy in experimental models of leishmaniasis involve several difficulties. Parasite quantification in tissues is generally done by techniques that are laborious and time consuming, such as limiting dilution and microscopic counting of amastigotes in imprinting of infected organs. To overcome some of these problems, we described in this study an experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) using parasites expressing luciferase. Leishmania infantum chagasi, the etiologic agent of VL in Latin America, was genetically manipulated to express the luciferase gene in order to produce light upon addition of luciferin. We inoculated these parasites in hamsters and, about one month post-infection, we detected light in the abdominal and/or pelvic region, indicating widespread infection. We compared the data obtained by bioluminescence with microscopic counting of amastigotes in imprinting of infected spleens and both methods showed concordant results. Aiming to validate our model to be used in drug effectiveness experiments, we performed the experimental treatment with pentavalent antimony, the first choice drug for VL treatment in Latin America. We also treated infected hamsters with miltefosine, the only oral drug used for leishmaniasis treatment and for which effectiveness against L. infantum chagasi infected hamsters had not yet been reported.
