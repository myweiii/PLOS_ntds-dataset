Mosquito-transmitted diseases are among the most challenging infectious threats worldwide. Mosquito control is crucial for preventing infection and disease, particularly when effective vaccines or drugs are unavailable. A major drawback of current mosquito control strategies is that mosquito breeding sites are often overlooked, and therefore left untreated, during control campaigns. One appealing alternative proposes exploiting the innate breeding-siteâ€“finding ability of female mosquitoes to have them disseminate tiny insecticide particles that poison their offspring. Thus far, however, this idea has only been tested in small-scale trials. Here we show that mosquitoes effectively transferred insecticide particles from dissemination stations to sentinel breeding sites over distances between 3 and 400 m in a tropical urban neighborhood. This yielded high breeding-site coverage, with up to 94.3% of sentinel breeding sites presenting evidence of contamination with mosquito-disseminated insecticide. We recorded a 10-fold increase of juvenile mosquito mortality and a 10-fold decrease of adult mosquito emergence during the four-month dissemination trial. In combination with other tactics, this approach has the potential to considerably enhance mosquito-borne disease prevention, particularly in urban settings.
