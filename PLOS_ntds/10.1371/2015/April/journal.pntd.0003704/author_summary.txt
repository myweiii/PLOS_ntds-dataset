Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. However, first-line drugs have different types of limitations including toxicity, price, efficacy and mainly emerging resistance. The WHO has recently recommended a combined therapy in order to extend the life expectancy of these compounds. The emergence and spread of Leishmania antimonial-resistant parasites have led to a high rate of antimonial failure in India and have raised questions about the selection and propagation risk of drug resistant parasites. The spread of drug-resistant parasites in the field probably depends on their transmission potential, which is influenced by, among other factors, the relative fitness of drug-resistant versus drug-susceptible parasites. In light of this, we have designed experimental studies to determine whether Leishmania donovani parasites resistant to single and combinations of anti-leishmanial drugs present any advantages in their ability to bear the different stress conditions versus a susceptible L. donovani line. Our results suggest that resistant parasites acquire an overall fitness increase and that resistance to drug combinations presents significant differences in their fitness capacity, particularly in intracellular amastigotes.
