Although dengue viral infections cause severe clinical disease, the majority of individuals infected with the dengue virus (DENV) develop asymptomatic infection. The function of DENV specific memory T cells in relation to past clinical disease severity is incompletely understood. In this study, we sought to investigate the function of DENV specific memory T cell responses in a large cohort (n = 338) of individuals who were naturally infected with the DENV but developed varying severity of clinical disease. We found that T cells of individuals who were hospitalized due to dengue and those with mild/sub clinical dengue infection produced multiple cytokines when stimulated with DENV-NS3 peptides. In addition, we have also validated a novel T cell based assay, which can be used to determine the past infecting DENV serotype. We found that 92.4% of DENV seropositive individuals responded to at least one DENV serotype of this assay and none of the seronegatives responded. Moreover, the peptides used in this assay did not cross react with Japanese encephalitis virus. Therefore, this assay is likely to be useful in determining the past infecting DENV serotype in immune-epidemiological studies and also in dengue vaccine trials.
