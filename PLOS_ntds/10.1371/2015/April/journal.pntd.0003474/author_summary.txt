Australia is the only remaining high-income country reporting endemic levels of trachoma, with infections occurring predominantly within rural and remote Indigenous communities. Although the Australian government has recently invested large sums of money to combat the disease, it remains unclear whether the national goal of controlling trachoma by 2020 will be achieved. Here, we use a novel individual-based simulation model to estimate the impact of numerous potential future invention strategies and intensities. Our model is the most sophisticated trachoma transmission model to date, and the first to specifically represent trachoma in Australian Indigenous communities. Model projections suggest that although the current intervention strategy and intensity are unlikely to achieve the target of national control by 2020, the likelihood of achieving this goal can be significantly increased by shifting the intervention strategy and increasing the intensity of key intervention components such as screening, treatment and facial cleanliness activities. Our findings that the most resource rich country with endemic trachoma may require a more intensive intervention effort to control the disease suggest that challenges may remain in the fight for the global control and eventual elimination and eradication of trachoma.
