Despite knowing the significance of Wolbachia in helminth infections, our understanding of immunity and pathogenesis remains incomplete. Therefore, considering the gravity of the problem, the present study provides evidence that Wolbachia heat shock protein 60 induces apoptosis and senescence through TLR-4. Also, binding of rWmhsp60 to TLR-4 triggered caspase cascade activation following, ROS-mediated mitochondrial potential loss. Moreover, we found that nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 was predominantly related to TLR-4 expression and resulted in apoptosis- and senescence-mediated inflammation via TNF-α and IL-6. Hence, we hypothesized that modifying TLR-4 expression may provide a plausible target for designing antiparasitic drugs. Here we have shown that induction of autophagy by rapamycin destabilizes TLR-4 expression and protects monocytes from rWmhsp60-induced apoptosis and senescence. In addition, rapamycin-induced monocytes were unresponsive to rWmhsp60 and triggered lymphocyte activation after PHA stimulation. Thus, synergistic usage of rapamycin with existing anti-filarial drugs might reduce the TLR-mediated inflammatory reactions following microfilaricidal treatment.
