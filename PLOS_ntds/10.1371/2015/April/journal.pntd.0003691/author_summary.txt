The population of Okinawan immigrants is considered vulnerable to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection because the Okinawa region in Japan is an endemic area. The second Brazilian largest Okinawan community is set in Campo Grande, Middle-West Brazil. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and risk factors associated with HTLV infection among Japanese immigrants and their descendants living in Campo Grande. The prevalence of 6.8% of HTLV-1 infection that was found is considered high. The HTLV-1 infection was associated with age ranged from 45 years old or older. Most infected individuals are Okinawan descendants. The HTLV-1 rate found in the present study indicates that the prevalence of this infection remains high among this Japanese community. This study emphasizes the importance of implementing preventive and diagnostic public health policies to decrease the risk of HTLV-1 transmission among Japanese communities throughout Brazil.
