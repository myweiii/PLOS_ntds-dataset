Accurate diagnostic tests play a key role in patient management and control of schistosomiasis, especially in China where the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum infection is low in recent years. The present study aimed to assess the utility of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detection of light intensity infection or false-negative patients and for the evaluation of chemotherapy effectiveness in patients, targeting the highly repetitive retrotransposon SjR2 of S. japonicum, using 110 serum samples of schistosomiasis patients. The results showed that the LAMP assay had high sensitivity of 95.1% for the diagnosis of S. japonicum infection with the lowest intensity (EPG<10). For the assessment of efficacy after treatment with praziquantel, the negative conversion rate increased from 23.4%, 61.7% to 83.0% at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months post-treatment by LAMP, whereas for ELISA and IHA, the negative conversion rate remains at a low level (25.5% by ELISA and 31.9% by IHA) even at 9 months after treatment. Our results demonstrated that the LAMP assay may provide a valuable tool for the diagnosis of Schistosoma infection, especially for cases of light infection which is coincident with the current endemic situation.
