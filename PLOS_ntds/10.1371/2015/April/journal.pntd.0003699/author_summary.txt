Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease which is endemic in more than 80 countries, although 90% of cases occur in India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Most treatments are complex, expensive and require long application periods. AmBisome is one of the newest treatments available, but evidence for its safety and effectiveness under routine program conditions in resource-poor endemic areas remains sparse. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) ran a VL clinic from 2010 until 2014 in Fulbaria District, Bangladesh. Our retrospective study was based on all available data from this clinic, comprising 1521 patients diagnosed with primary VL who were treated with AmBisome 15mg/kg in three equal doses of 5mg/kg. We found that this treatment was safe (less than 1% of patients experienced a severe adverse event) and effective (more than 95% of patients were cured with one treatment) after 12 months. The youngest and oldest patients, and patients with large spleen size at the end of treatment, were more likely to experience a relapse. More than half of the relapses occurred between 6 and 12 months after treatment, therefore we recommend that clinical trials and treatment protocols adopt a minimum 12-month follow-up period.
