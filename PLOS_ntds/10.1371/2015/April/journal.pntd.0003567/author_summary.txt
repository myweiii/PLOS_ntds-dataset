Ebola virus disease is a disease of social intimacy. The main infection pathways are through nursing of the sick and through preparation of corpses for burial. In African rural communities these are activities mainly undertaken by close family members. Infection thus spreads to those most intimate with the patient. In effect, Ebola virus disease exacts a high price for family loyalty. It also causes a potential breach between family members and the authorities responsible for imposing infection control. Understanding the social pathways through which infection spreads, and the conflict of human values invoked by infection control are thus key topics in managing the current Ebola epidemic in Upper West Africa. The paper offers a picture, based on case study data from central Sierra Leone, of some of the social factors to be taken into account in efforts to control the epidemic.
