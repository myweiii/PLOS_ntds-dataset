Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic infection in the world and represents a major public health problem, especially in tropical climates. The processes by which some Leptospira species cause infection, disease, and colonization of carrier animals remains poorly understood. Specific binding of Leptospira molecules and host molecules are likely important for infection and colonization. To identify Leptospira molecules that mediate attachment to host substrates, prior studies have evaluated Leptospira membrane proteins for binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. More recent data, however, show that Leptospira bind more efficiently to cells than to ECM. In search of adhesins mediating the latter activity, our study evaluated the direct cell binding activity of recombinant forms of a group of previously reported Leptospira ECM adhesins. Only one of these proteins, OmpL1, demonstrated reproducible direct cell binding activity. Further work will focus on identification of the mammalian receptor for OmpL1 and determining the biological significance of this activity during infection.
