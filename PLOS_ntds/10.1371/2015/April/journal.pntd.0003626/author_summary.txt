We report a high seroprevalence for antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae in Southwestern Tanzania, a group of bacteria that is mostly transmitted by ectoparasites such as fleas, lice, mites, and ticks. Serum samples from 1.228 persons were selected, and 67.9% were positive indicating past infection. Seropositivity was clearly associated with warmer temperature, low population density and elevations below 1,500 m. These infections may have been caused by Rickettsia africae, which is transmitted to humans by a cattle tick, and was found in similar settings in Africa. To investigate further on the significance of SFG rickettsioses on disease burden in the area, investigations in acutely febrile patients should be conducted.
