There is growing evidence to support the expanded use of spatial repellents for vector control, but there are still many uncertainties about how repellents work and how their long term use may impact vector populations over time. Here, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments that investigated spatial repellent (SR) behaviors in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to airborne transfluthrin, a volatile pyrethroid commonly used in repellent products. We were able to show that repellent insensitivity is linked to reduced insecticide susceptibility and increased knock down resistance allele frequency, indicating that sub-lethal doses of airborne transfluthrin can elicit SR behaviors in mosquitoes by inducing an agitated state via neurotoxic pathways independent of olfactory stimulation. This raises questions about how the use of volatile pyrethroid repellents may impact insecticide resistance in target vectors over time, highlighting the need to further understand all of the physiological drivers of SR behaviors and emphasizing the requirement to develop new repellent active ingredients with novel, non-toxic mechanisms of action.
