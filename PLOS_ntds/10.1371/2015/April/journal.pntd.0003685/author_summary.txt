The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) which is associated with the diseases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, tropical spastic paraparesis etc., can cause transfusion-transmitted infections, it also can be transmitted by sex or breastfeeding. Globally, approximately 20 million people are estimated to be infected by HTLV-1, and 90% of them remain asymptomatic carriers during their lives. Previous studies had revealed that Japan, Central and Western Africa, the Caribbean islands and Central and South American were the regions with the highest HTLV-1 prevalence in the world. Little is know about the HTLV prevalence in China. We performed a 10-year blood screening survey to systematically characterize the prevalence of HTLV infection among bloods in Fujian province in southeast China since 2004. The HTLV-1 prevalence in blood donors is significantly higher in southeast China, especially in the northern cities of Fujian province, such as Ningde. Moreover, similar molecular characteristics of prevalent HTLV-1 sequences in southeast China, Taiwan and Japan suggested a same origin of these viruses.
