Gastropod-borne parasites may cause debilitating clinical conditions in animals and humans. The infection occurs by consumption of intermediate hosts (i.e., snails). However, the ingestion of fresh vegetables contaminated by water and/or snail mucus has been proposed as a transmission source for some zoonotic metastrongyloids (e.g., Angiostrongylus cantonensis). Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior cause severe clinical conditions in cats and their prevalence is increasing in feline populations. The epidemiology of feline lungworm infections is poorly understood and the role of gastropod molluscs, as vectors of the disease, is questioned. Since metastrongyloid nematodes may use other little-studied infection pathways, the presence of A. abstrusus and T. brevior larvae was herein assessed in the mucus of Helix aspersa snails and in the water where specimens died. The finding of A. abstrusus and T. brevior infective L3 in the mucus shed by H. aspersa or when infected gastropods die submerged in water indicates that alternative pathways for the transmission of feline lungworms may occur. Accordingly, these results should spur the interest of the scientific community towards the delineation of further infection routes for other metastrongyloids of major human concern, such as Angiostrongylus costaricensis and A. cantonenis.
