Bacterial pathogens are recognized by the host upon infection through interactions between their virulence factors and host cell receptors leading to the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells. Salmonella Typhi, the etiologic agent for typhoid fever, however harbors a number of factors, such as a polysaccharide capsule, which prevent the detection of these virulence factors, and thereby dampens the innate host response. Besides bacterial virulence factors, the host can detect endogenous danger molecules which are released upon tissue damage. S100A8/A9, an extracellular protein complex, is such a danger signal that is able to further amplify the systemic inflammatory response upon infection. In the present study we investigated the role of S100A8/A9 during invasive Salmonella infection and observed a marked increase of this protein in patients with typhoid fever, which correlates with disease stage and severity. Furthermore we found that S100A8/A9 directly inhibited the growth of Salmonella species in vitro thereby functioning as an antimicrobial. When mice were infected with Salmonella, the levels of S100A8/A9 were also elevated but mice lacking this protein did not have an altered host response to infection. The role and importance of the elevated levels of S100A8/A9 in human typhoid fever requires further study.
