DNA and other nucleic acid vaccine technologies are advancing quickly, and new potent delivery methods are demonstrating great potential in human clinical trials. In this manuscript, we report a highly protective DNA vaccine against the yellow fever virus. This vaccine was engineered with a molecular adjuvant technology to enhance the exposure of the vaccine antigens to the immune system, resulting in augmented CD4+ helper responses. We postulate that the robust CD4+ responses help the B cells and the CD8+ cells mature more efficiently and produce better antibodies and cytotoxic cells, respectively. Our results show that vaccination with this yellow fever DNA formulation elicited protective levels of neutralizing antibodies and very strong cellular responses at similar levels to the responses elicited by the live attenuated 17DD vaccine. In addition, these results also suggest a very important role for cellular responses in mediating protection against yellow fever virus. The results reported here are very promising and further studies may lead to a new yellow fever vaccine for human use.
