Local and systemic hemorrhage are typical manifestations of envenomings by viperid snakes. Hemorrhagic activity is due to the action of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) in the microvasculature, especially in capillaries. There are large differences in the hemorrhagic potential of SVMPs, depending on their domain composition. The present study compared PI, PII and PIII hemorrhagic SVMPs for their tissue distribution and their ability to cleave proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM), especially those of the basement membrane (BM) that provides mechanical stability to microvessels. Observations indicate that PII and PIII SVMPs, which exert a high hemorrhagic activity, are preferentially located in microvessels, whereas PI SVMP is distributed in a more widespread fashion in the tissue. In addition, when these toxins are injected at doses that induce a similar hemorrhagic effect, they cleave type IV collagen to a similar extent, showing differences in the cleavage patterns of other ECM components, such as laminin, nidogen and type VI collagen. The analysis of the exudates resultant from the action of these SVMPs in the tissue revealed many similarities and some differences in the exudate proteomes. Overall our results indicate that hydrolysis of type IV collagen is a key event in the onset of microvessel damage, and that the ability of SVMPs to bind to microvessels greatly determines their hemorrhagic potential.
