Visceral leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies, is known as kala-azar in South Asia, and has been targeted for elimination in that region. The aim is to reduce its incidence to a low level so that it is no longer a public health problem. Elimination strategies include good surveillance for occurrence of the disease. We assessed surveillance in Gaffargaon subdistrict of Mymensingh district in Bangladesh where occurrence of kala-azar is high. We randomly sampled 4703 households and searched for kala-azar cases that had occurred between January 2010 and December 2011. We then searched for medical records of these cases in the patient registers of Gaffargaon upazila or subdistrict health complex (UHC). We interviewed cases, their families and health staff responsible for the monthly reports of kala-azar. We also observed the UHC recording system. We detected 58 cases, but 29 (50%) were not recorded in the Gaffargaon UHC. Problems include the heavy reporting burden for multiple diseases, variation in staff experience, high demands on the staff time and complexity in the recording system. Recording was more likely for adults, males, those given drugs at the UHC, and more recent treatment. Our findings have implications for kala-azar surveillance.
