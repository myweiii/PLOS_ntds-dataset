We are grateful to Communicable Disease Control, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Government of Bangladesh. We are also thankful to the management and staff of the Upazila Health Complex of Gaffargaon for providing all sorts of supports needed for the study. Staff involved in data collection for the study worked to their utmost sincerity, hard-work and honesty. This research work would not be possible without the spontaneous participation of the community members of Gaffargaon.
