Dengue appears to be endemic in Africa with a number of reported outbreaks. In February 2013, several individuals with dengue-like illnesses and negative malaria blood smears were identified in Mombasa, Kenya. Dengue was laboratory confirmed and an investigation was conducted to estimate the magnitude of local transmission including a serologic survey to determine incident dengue virus (DENV) infections. Consenting household members provided serum and were questioned regarding exposures and medical history. RT-PCR was used to identify current DENV infections and IgM anti-DENV ELISA to identify recent infections. Of 1,500 participants, 13% had evidence of current or recent DENV infection. Among those infected, 44% reported fever in the past month. Most (73%) febrile infected participants were seen by a clinician, and all but one of the 32 participants who reportedly received a diagnosis were clinically diagnosed as having malaria. Having open windows at night, not using daily mosquito repellent, and recent travel outside of Kenya were associated with increased risk of DENV infection. This survey provided a robust measure of incident DENV infections in a setting where cases were often unrecognized and misdiagnosed.
