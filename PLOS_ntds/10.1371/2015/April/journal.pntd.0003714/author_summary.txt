African trypanosomes are motile parasites that cause sleeping sickness. They multiply first in the blood then cause death mainly by effects on the brain: immune system cells, including T cells and dendritic cells, play major roles in this. Thinking we might see the attack on the brain, we infected mice with trypanosomes and used a two-photon microscope, which allowed us to image the superficial brain and the delicate tissue between the skull and the brain called the meninges without making a hole in the skull. The mice (which were anesthetized) had been genetically modified so that T cells and dendritic cells were fluorescent, as were the trypanosomes. We did not notice much happening in the brain itself, but in the meninges, in a compartment called the dura, huge numbers of T cells and dendritic cells appeared. Trypanosomes also moved from the blood into this compartment. Since T cells, dendritic cells and trypanosomes had not been videoed in the meninges before, we began by observing them carefully: their numbers, their movements and their interactions. The accumulation of lymphocytes is a sign of meningitis, a feature of infection by a wide range of pathogens and our results suggest interesting future work.
