Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions worldwide and needs more attention and better diagnostic methods. Strongyloides stercoralis can undergo an autoinfection cycle and can cause hyperinfection involving the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems and disseminated infection in other organs. Although endemic areas are mostly developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions with only sporadic transmission in temperate areas, the disease is a threat to developed world populations through immigrants, refugees, travelers, and military personnel. The disease can have catastrophic effects when a patient is immunocompromised or when an infected organ is transplanted into a vulnerable recipient. Due to the threat to public health, the intricate life cycle of S. stercoralis, the need to perform multiple follow-up diagnostics to ensure treatment success, and the necessity to rule out multiple co-endemic parasitic infections, it is imperative to develop new diagnostic assays that are simple and efficient while retaining maximal sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we use a well-known recombinant protein, Ss-NIE-1, to optimize assays using both an ELISA format and a multiplex platform to meet these needs.
