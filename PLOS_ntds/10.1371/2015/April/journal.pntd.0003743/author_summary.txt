Malaria is one of the most serious public health problems in the world, with 3.3 billion people at risk of contracting the disease and almost one million deaths annually, primarily in children younger than five years of age. Undernutrition is also a morbidity of importance to the public worldwide and primarily affects children in tropical regions. In the present study, we sought to analyze the relationship between malaria and undernutrition in children living in a rural Amazonian community where malaria is endemic. Children from 1 month to 14 years of age were followed-up for 12 months through passive case detection (i.e., the presence of malarial parasites in peripheral blood in case of fever). Anthropometric and hemoglobin measurements and active malaria case detection tests (to detect asymptomatic parasitaemia) were conducted at the beginning and end of the follow-up period of 12 months. Children who had at least one episode of malaria during this period presented lower mean anthropometric index scores compared to children who did not have malaria. We concluded that malaria had a negative impact on the nutritional status of children living in an endemic area at the Western Brazilian Amazon, where Plasmodium vivax predominates.
