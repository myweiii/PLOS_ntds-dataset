The use of high quality data and information has become essential for public health agencies to monitor and protect population health. Technological advancement has enabled the development of sophisticated disease surveillance systems by many countries. Increasingly, countries are making surveillance data publicly available to their constituencies. A key role of international agencies such as the World Health Organization is the integration and curation of country data at the global level. Because it can be confusing to navigate the current online disease data landscape, we assessed the availability and consistency of online available surveillance data for dengue provided by the World Health Organization and two example countries (Brazil and Indonesia). We found that data availability declined substantially after 2005 and that consistency between sources was limited to 84%, representing a discrepancy of half a million cases. These limitations reduce opportunities for the efficient use of country data to counter public health threats. A new financial and operational model is needed to advance the use of disease data at the global level. Industry and academic partners need to step up to support this mandate.
