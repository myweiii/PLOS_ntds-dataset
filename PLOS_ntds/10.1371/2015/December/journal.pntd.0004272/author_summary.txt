Schistosomes feed on blood and we have previously shown that its processing begins in the esophagus, which does not act simply as a conduit. It comprises anterior and posterior compartments, each surrounded by glands that secrete proteins into the lumen. Erythrocytes are ruptured as they pass through the compartments and leucocytes are tethered and killed but blood fails to clot. We wanted to identify the proteins secreted from these glands by sequencing the transcriptomes of head and tail preparations to pinpoint those messenger RNAs predominantly or exclusively present only in the heads. We found approximately 50 such proteins, the largest group of 27 being encoded by microexon genes. A second group comprised hydrolytic enzymes that operate at an acid pH. We showed by hybridisation experiments that expression of these genes is indeed localised to either the anterior or the posterior gland. We have suggested that this complex mixture of secreted proteins act together to perform the biological processes that occur in the lumen or, in the case of O-glycosylated membrane proteins, form a protective lining coat. We now want to discover which of them can serve as immune targets in infected animal hosts.
