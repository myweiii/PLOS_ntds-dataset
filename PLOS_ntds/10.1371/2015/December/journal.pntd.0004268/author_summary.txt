The hydatid tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is able to survive in its mammalian hosts for many years without being digested by proteases. Two E. granulosus Kunitz proteins with potent protease inhibitory properties were identified and characterized. These Kunitz proteins may provide protection to the parasite from proteolytic digestion. These newly identified proteins are promising targets for developing new control interventions against echinococcosis, and one has potential as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic.
