Scabies is a parasitic infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is a risk factor for bacterial skin infections and as a result of these secondary infections, individuals with scabies are also at risk of kidney disease and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Traditionally the management of scabies has involved treating individuals and close contacts with topical medicines. Although this normally cures the patient, individual treatment does not have any impact on the overall amount of scabies in a community. There is now significant interest in trying mass drug administration (MDA) against scabies using ivermectin, a tablet which is a very effective treatment. A key question for scabies control programmes is how long the beneficial effect of MDA lasts. In this study we provide fifteen year follow-up on one of the first communities in the world to ever receive ivermectin MDA for the control of scabies. These communities had received intensive scabies control between 1997 and 2000 but then no further MDA or surveillance. We found that the amount of scabies had remained extremely low following the treatment programme and that bacterial skin infections had also remained low. This data suggests that long term control of scabies can be achieved with an initial intensive control programme.
