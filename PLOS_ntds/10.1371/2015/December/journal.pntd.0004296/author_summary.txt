The study of dengue transmission is essential for proposing alternatives to diminish the cases and the cost of dengue treatment and control. The traditional paradigm establishes that transmission chain starts around a case, but there are few studies that determine the risk, therefore, we studied if to live around a dengue case increases the risk to get infected by Dengue virus. We interviewed and took blood samples from people cohabitating with dengue cases and neighbors in two Mexican communities, to compare we interviewed and took blood samples from subjects of areas without dengue cases in these communities. We found that people cohabitating and neighbors had more risk to get infected. Younger and older person, the workers, families with children younger than 5, houses with toilets with no direct water discharge, and areas with more mosquitoes, also had increased infection risk until one month after the fever onset of dengue case. After this month the frequency of dengue infections was only influenced by the seasonal behavior of dengue and the age of the subjects. Also, we found that 60% of infections are asymptomatic and older people have less risk to develop symptoms. This study suggests that dengue transmission in these locations is initially peridomestic, around the houses of infected subject who may be asymptomatic (without symptoms), and it is influenced by other characteristics of the individual, the neighborhood and the community. After this peridomestic transmission, dengue spreads in the community probably by adults who mostly suffer asymptomatic infections and have higher mobility, which complicates the application and affects the results of vector control programs.
