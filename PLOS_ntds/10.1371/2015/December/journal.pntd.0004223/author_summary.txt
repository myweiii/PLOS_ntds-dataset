Taenia spp. can cause tapeworm infections in the human gut, and infection with the larval stage of Taenia solium (cysticercosis) can lead to serious outcomes, such as epilepsy. Transmission occurs in areas with poor sanitation and a lack of adequate meat inspection practices, although there are still gaps in our understanding of how socio-economic, behavioural and environmental factors influence the occurrence of these parasites. Humans and pigs residing in 416 households in an area of western Kenya were tested for larval stage infections (cysticercosis). Statistical methods were applied to examine the relationships between a range of socio-economic, behavioural and environmental factors and disease occurrence. The results indicate that several factors, including land cover, influence the distribution of cysticercosis infections in humans and pigs. Further research in this area may provide significant understanding regarding the influence of environmental drivers on Taenia spp. infections, delivering evidence to support the targeting of disease control activities.
