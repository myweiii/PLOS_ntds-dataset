Fasciola hepatica is a helminth that infects mainly ruminants, causing great economic losses worldwide. Importantly, fasciolosis is also considered an emerging zoonosis with an increasing number of human infections globally. As other helminths, F. hepatica is able to regulate the host immune response favoring parasite survival in the host. In this work we investigated whether glycoconjugates produced by this parasite play a role in the host immune-regulation. Glycans, composed by carbohydrate chains, participate in important biological processes, but their role during Fasciola infection has not been previously addressed. We found that glycoconjugates are involved in the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and in the production of the Th2-like cytokines IL-4. Furthermore, we found that they are also involved in the modulation of dendritic cell maturation, the most efficient antigen presenting cells. Indeed, the parasite is able to inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells in a process that is glycan-mediated and dependent on a mannose-specific receptor. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of parasite glycoconjugates in the modulation of host immunity and might be applied in the design of vaccine strategies to prevent infection.
