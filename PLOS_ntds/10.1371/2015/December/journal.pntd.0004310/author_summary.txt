Trichinellosis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses worldwide. The key factor for Trichinella spiralis to survive in its host is evading from the attacks by the immune defense system. Our previous study revealed that paramyosin from Trichinella spiralis (Ts-Pmy) played a role in evading host immune attacks by binding to human complement C8 and C9. Here, we demonstrated that Ts-Pmy inhibited classical complement activation by binding to human complement C1q. As a result, classical complement pathway-mediated hemolysis was inhibited in the presence of Ts-Pmy. Additionally, Ts-Pmy inhibited C1q binding to THP-1-derived macrophages and C1q-induced macrophages migration. These results suggest that Trichinella spiralis paramyosin is a potential immunomodulator involved in the evasion of the host complement attack by binding to C1q in addition to C8/C9, and therefore is a potent vaccine target against trichinellosis.
