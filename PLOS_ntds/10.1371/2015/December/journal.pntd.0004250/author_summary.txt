In Africa, epidemic outbreaks of yellow fever continue despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Effective understanding of disease epidemiology and control requires the ability to reliably identify vectors of yellow fever. The mosquito Ae. bromeliae, a competent vector of yellow fever virus, cannot be reliably morphologically differentiated from its sister species Ae. lilii, which does not bite humans and so does not transmit yellow fever. DNA sequencing of four molecular markers allowed comparisons of how they perform at distinguishing these species. We found that the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) barcoding region and nuclear apolipophorin 2 (apoLp2) and cytochrome p450 (CYPJ92) were unable to reliably distinguish these species. Conversely, genetic variation at the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was able to confirm the vector Ae. bromeliae and non-vector Ae. lilii as distinct species. Based on ITS sequence differences, we developed a robust molecular method to identify the vector Ae. bromeliae from its sister species Ae. lilii. Consequently, we find that these species use the same larval habitats including banana, cocoyam and Dracena spp. in Uganda. Whereas only Ae. lilii appears to be present in Benin and only Ae. bromeliae in Tanzania, we confirm that both species occur in Uganda. Reliable species designation will promote more detailed studies of distribution, ecology and vector status essential for disease risk assessment and mosquito control.
