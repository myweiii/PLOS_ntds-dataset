The tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of a frequently life-threatening disease. CCHFV is present in a wide geographic area with potential for expansion. Moreover, CCHFV segmented genome reassortment leads to new strains with potentially different virulence. Studying CCHFV is highly necessary, but requires dedicated, resource-intensive, high biosafety and security laboratories. In part due to the need for high containment, CCHFV studies have been limited, and developing tools to study CCHFV has been difficult. We report the development of a system that mimics the CCHFV life cycle and produces virus-like particles (VLPs) that are similar to CCHFV in cell culture, but do not form infectious CCHFV and therefore do not require the use of special laboratories. We generated VLPs representing several pathogenic CCHFV strains with robust reporter signal activity. This allows VLPs to be used in testing cell entry inhibitors against a wide array of CCHFV strains. In addition, VLPs can be used in a variety of cell lines and in cells directly isolated from humans. Our results also suggest that the CCHFV strain IbAr10200, which is commonly used in the laboratory, may not accurately reflect the activity of circulating pathogenic CCHFV strains, as the surface glycoproteins of IbAr10200 confer reduced entry efficiency of VLP into cells derived directly from humans. In addition, we show that drugs with proven anti-CCHFV properties inhibit VLP activity, and identify a monoclonal antibody that prevents cell entry of VLP made using glycoprotein genes from different, pathogenic CCHFV strains.
