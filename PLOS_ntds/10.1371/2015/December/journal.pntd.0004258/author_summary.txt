The basic metabolic system CYP (cytochrome P450) is essential for biotransformation of sterols and xenobiotics, for synthesis and degradation of signaling molecules in all living organisms. Most eukaryotes including free-living flatworms evolved numerous paralogues of the CYP gene. Notably, by contrast, flukes and tapeworms–the etiologic agents of major neglected tropical diseases of humanity, have only one gene. However, the role of P450 in the physiology and biochemistry of helminths is not known. This report presents the first functional study of the CYP enzyme of any of the parasitic flatworms. We focused our research on the food-borne human liver fluke, Opisthorchis felineus, an emerging source of biliary tract diseases in Russia, Kazakhstan and central Europe. Here we report that this liver fluke has evolved a highly expressed functional monooxygenase system with broad substrate specificity. Tissue localization studies and suppression of CYP mRNA by RNA interference revealed the CYP function is linked to the excretory system and possibly to metabolism and detoxification. The fluke’s monooxygenase likely is a model for orthologues of the singular CYP of parasitic flatworms at large, where it plays a critical role in the pathogen’s metabolism that contributes to worm survival and drug resistance.
