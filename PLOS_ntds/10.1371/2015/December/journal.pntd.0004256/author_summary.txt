Soil-transmitted helminth infections remain prevalent in many low-resource areas of the world. The World Health Organization recommends that schoolchildren in countries where these infections remain common receive deworming medication two times a year. However, previous research has shown that people who live in countries where these infections are common are frequently reinfected within 6 months of taking deworming medication. Programs that improve sanitation and hygiene might help complement deworming programs to reduce reinfection and prevent transmission. We conducted a survey of women and children in rural Bangladesh to understand potential sanitation and hygiene interventions that could complement deworming. We found that people who took deworming medication and had access to a hygienic latrine had a lower worm infection prevalence than people who only took deworming medication. We also found that people who took deworming medication and had a house with a finished floor had a lower prevalence than people who only took deworming medication. Our results suggest that coupling deworming with sanitation and flooring interventions may be a more successful strategy for reducing STH transmission in the long run.
