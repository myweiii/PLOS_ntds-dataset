Mycobacterium ulcerans is an infection that can affect all age-groups. It causes necrosis of skin and soft-tissue often resulting in severe outcomes and long-term disability. However, due to the majority of infections worldwide occurring in children and young adults, there is a paucity of information available in elderly patients. It is important that elderly patients are not neglected as the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes may differ significantly from younger patients related to relative immune defficiencies, co-morbidities and increased potential for drug interactions. We specifically examined patients with M. ulcerans disease aged â‰¥ 65 years and showed that they comprise a significant proportion of patients affected in Australian populations. They present with more severe and advanced disease forms, and suffer from increased toxicity and reduced effectiveness of the currently recommended treatments. Therefore, our study demonstrates that increased efforts are required to diagnose M. ulcerans disease earlier in elderly populations, and that research is urgently required to develop more effective and less toxic treatments for this age-group.
