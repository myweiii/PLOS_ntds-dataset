The development of rapid serodiagnostic tests for African sleeping sickness and other diseases caused by kinetoplastids relies in part on the affordable production of parasite-specific recombinant antigens. The majority of cases of sleeping sickness are caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. gambiense) which is transmitted when bitten by an infected tsetse fly. Existing tests rely on the utilisation of extracts from the parasite or use antigens raised in animal models. In this study we have shown that using a cell culture system devised from a parasite similar to T.b. gambiense recombinant antigens can be produced that are as effective in rapid diagnostic tests as the native antigens purified from T.b. gambiense parasites grown in laboratory rodents. We compared the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the antigens we produced recombinantly to native antigens currently used in diagnostic kits against a panel of human sera. The evaluation on sera from 172 T.b. gambiense patients and from 119 controls without sleeping sickness showed very high diagnostic potential of two recombinant antigens where the response was not significantly different to that from the native antigens. These results indicate that a combination of these recombinant antigens has the potential to be used in next generation rapid serodiagnostic tests.
