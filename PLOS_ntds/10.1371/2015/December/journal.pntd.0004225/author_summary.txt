Most epidemiologic studies in developing countries carried out for amoebiasis is either based on microscopy alone or culture/ microscopy used as a screening tool, have poor sensitivity and specificity and thus fails to figure out its true magnitude. The purpose of this study was to assess the true prevalence of amoebiasis in selected North Eastern states of India using DNA based screening technique followed by PCR assay for species discrimination. In addition, PCR assay confirmed that only 55.8% of the samples, resembling E. histolytica by microscopy, were true E. histolytica, implying that remaining 44.2% of so-called infections were due to other nonpathogenic Entamoeba spp. We found a higher prevalence of amebiasis (13.7%) using DNA dot blot screening compared to conventional microscopy and culture based screening. Poor living condition, previous history of infection in a family member, unhygienic toilet facility, children in age group <15 yr, participants having lower levels of education and daily laborers were identified as significant risk factors for amoebiasis. Thus, the techniques like DNA dot blot hybridization and PCR based detection adopted in the present study over and above the conventional screening methods can reduce misdiagnosis of the disease appreciably from the population living in this endemic area.
