The genus Paracoccidioides is composed of species that are causative agents of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a neglected human granulomatous mycosis, endemic in Latin America. To survive in the human host, fungi must tolerate and overcome in vivo micro environmental stress conditions, including low oxygen levels. Paracoccidioides spp. depicts differential responses to several stresses such as iron/zinc deprivation, oxidative and nitrosative stresses and carbon starvation. In addition, Paracoccidioides yeast cells recovered from liver of infected mice demonstrated adaptability to the host conditions. Mechanisms by which fungi sense oxygen levels have been characterized, although this is the first description in Paracoccidioides spp. Little is known about hypoxia in thermally dimorphic fungi and nothing has been studied in Paracoccidioides genus, one of the representatives of this group of pathogens. A detailed characterization of the hypoxia responses was performed using proteomic and heterologous genetics approaches. Paracoccidioides genus have a functional homologue of the key regulator of hypoxia adaptation in fungi, SrbA, a SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) orthologue. The proteome during hypoxia provided a global view of metabolic changes during this stress and species of the Paracoccidioides genus have a functional SrbA. Our study provides a better understanding of the fungal adaptation to the host and it can improve the arsenal of molecules for the development of alternative treatment options to paracoccidioidomycosis, since molecules related to fungal adaptation to low oxygen levels are important to virulence and pathogenesis in human pathogenic fungi.
