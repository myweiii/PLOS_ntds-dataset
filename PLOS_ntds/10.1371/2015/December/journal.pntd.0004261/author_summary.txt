Giardia is the most common gastrointestinal protozoan parasite of humans. This parasite causes diarrheal disease and is correlated with post-infectious conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. In the absence of a vaccine, treatment is limited to drugs such as metronidazole, against which clinical resistance is reported. Effective control of Giardia requires a detailed understanding of its biology, and in turn, complete characterization of the standard in vitro culture system. Using RNA sequencing assisted by informatics to functionally annotate hypothetical proteins, we investigated transcriptional changes in axenic Giardia trophozoites at three growth phases over 96 hours. We found two large groups of differentially transcribed genes that indicate changes in the antioxidant system and central carbon metabolism over time. A putative novel signaling pathway may act together with putative transcription factor-binding motifs to regulate these transcriptional changes. Our results suggest that dissolved oxygen in Giardia culture medium may cause oxidative stress early during in vitro growth and that oxygen depletion may limit the efficiency of glycolysis in the declining phase. This work enhances our understanding of the transcriptional flexibility and metabolism of Giardia in vitro.
