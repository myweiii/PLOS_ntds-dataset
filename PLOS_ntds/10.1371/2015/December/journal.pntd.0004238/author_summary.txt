Leishmaniasis is a group of parasitic diseases caused by intracellular protozoa belonging to the genus Leishmania, pathological manifestations ranging from self-healing cutaneous forms to severe visceral infections that result in death. These clinical outcomes are dictated by the Leishmania species initiating the infection and are influenced by early responses of host immune cells, which ultimately initiate an IL12 mediated immune response in resolving infections. Like the diseases themselves, the magnitude of IL12 induction in hDCs is Leishmania-species and strain specific, where species that elicit visceral disease do not induce IL12, while most cutaneous disease-causing L. major strains induce robust IL12 responses and confer life-long immunity. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the ability of these innate immune cells to discriminate between pathogens remain elusive and have been primarily investigated in murine model systems. Here we identified L. major LPG as a major PAMP that induces IL12 in hDCs. Elucidation of this critical component of human immunity to L. major has ramifications for leishmaniasis vaccine development.
