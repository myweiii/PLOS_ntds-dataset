The preliminary genomic sequencing data used for the deduction of LFG ortholog sequences in a number of schistosome species were provided by the parasite genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and were obtained from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/HGI/. We thank NÃºcleo de Enteroparasitas/Centro de Parasitologia e Micologia at Instituto Adolfo Lutz for supplying the S. mansoni-infected hamsters.
