Although P. vivax is not as deadly as the more widely studied P. falciparum, it remains a pressing global health problem. Here we report the results of a whole-genome study of P. vivax from Cord√≥ba, Colombia, in South America. This parasite is the most prevalent in this region. We show that the parasite population is genetically diverse, which is contrary to expectations from earlier studies from the Americas. We also find molecular evidence that resistance to an anti-malarial drug has arisen recently in this region. This selective sweep indicates that the parasite has been exposed to a drug that is not used as first-line treatment for this malaria parasite. In addition to extensive single nucleotide and microsatellite polymorphism, we report 18 new genetic loci that might be helpful for fine-scale studies of this species in the Americas.
