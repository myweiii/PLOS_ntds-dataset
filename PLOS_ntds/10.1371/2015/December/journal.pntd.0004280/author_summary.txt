Mass drug administration using the highly effective drug praziquantel (PZQ) is currently the method of choice to combat schistosomiasis. However, this treatment regime has limitations; in particular, it does not prevent re-infection and sporadic parasite resistance against PZQ is a continuing threat. The path to the successful control of schistosomiasis is highly challenging and must consider, not only the complex nature of the host-parasite interaction, but also the capacity to assess disease burden and parasite re-emergence in communities where successful control has been achieved. Furthermore, control programs must be economically sustainable in endemic countries and despite significant recent advancements the elimination of schistosomiasis may still be some time away. Accordingly, there is a definitive need to formulate innovative approaches for the development of improved diagnostic tools to accurately assess the disease burden associated with active schistosome infections. Here we describe the usefulness of a phage display library to mature antibody fragments derived from lymph node RNA of the natural buffalo host of the Asian schistosome, Schistosoma japonicum, following an experimental infection. These mature antibody fragments were able to bind native parasite proteins and could thus be used to develop a low cost and accurate point-of-care diagnostic test.
