Pregnant women are at high risk of complications and fetal deaths when ill with cholera. However, they have been excluded in most cholera vaccination campaigns because of the lack of safety data on oral cholera vaccines during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine if the risk of pregnancy loss changed after the administration of the oral cholera vaccine in Guinea in 2012. We visited all households in Boffa and Koba sub-prefectures, where the vaccination campaign took place, and enrolled a total of 2,493 women in the study. In this large retrospective cohort, we found no association between fetal exposure to the cholera vaccine and the risk of pregnancy loss or malformation. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable during a cholera episode and should be included in vaccination campaigns when the risk of cholera is high, such as during the outbreaks.
