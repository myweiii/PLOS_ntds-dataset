Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonosis that is primarily transmitted to humans via infected mosquito bites. Although most acute RVF infection results in a nonspecific febrile illness, 1% of cases develop hemorrhage and 50% of these may result in death. Person-to-person transmission has not been described, but high viral titers have been observed during hemorrhagic complications, suggesting the potential for direct person-to-person transmission. This article describes an estimated risk of RVF nosocomial transmission during an outbreak setting and contrasts the suggested infection control precautions to that of other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) such as Ebola virus disease (EVD).
