Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. It is widely distributed in the tropics where it results in a chronic and debilitating disease. Nearly 1.4 billion people in 73 countries worldwide are threatened by lymphatic filariasis, with an estimated 120 million people infected, and more than 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease. Mass drug administration of appropriate chemotherapeutic agents has been successful in eliminating the infection in some endemic areas supporting the contention that global elimination of the infection has become feasible. Before targeting lymphatic filariasis for elimination, it is necessary to map its distribution in order to identify areas where treatment is required. In this present study, two surveys were carried out in each of eight Regions of Cameroon to assess the endemicity status and intensity of the infection. Lymphatic filariasis was found to be endemic in all Regions surveyed and in almost all the constituent health districts. As virtually all of these Regions and health districts were found to be eligible for MDA treatments, baseline data were also acquired that can be used by the national program for the evaluation of the success of mass drug administration on the endemicity and transmission of the disease.
