The authors are grateful to Food, Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority (FMHACA) of Ethiopia for kindly donation of ABZ reference standard. Additionally, we would like to thank the staff of the Laboratory of Drug Quality of Jimma University (Markos Duguma, Henok Teshome, and Yimer Mekonnen) and the Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Laboratory of Jimma University (Bizuwarek Sharew, Yesufi Seid and Yerosa Dinsa) for their technical assistance. We acknowledge one of the reviewers for his/her George Orwell's inspiring quote 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others (from: Animal Farm)’, which was paraphrased in this manuscript as “all medicines are not created equal”. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the director, teachers, parents/guardians of the children of the two schools for their unfailing co-operation during the study.
