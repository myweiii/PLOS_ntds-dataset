Human tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis (HTBMb) is a lesser-known form of the disease. The main route of transmission of HTBMb is the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, causing mostly extrapulmonary disease. M. bovis is naturally resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that allows for a shorter treatment course. Therefore, if M. bovis is not properly identified or if there is resistance to other drugs, proper treatment may be hindered. Most laboratories in developing countries do not routinely perform mycobacterial cultures, and only a few laboratories can identify M. bovis. Therefore, HTBMb cases are believed to be underestimated. We report a large proportion of M. bovis isolates and an increasing isolation trend across time. We report a large proportion of M. bovis isolates from pulmonary samples, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human airborne transmission. Also, we showed that M. bovis isolates were more frequently resistant to streptomycin, perhaps as a result of antibiotic usage in cattle. This work underscores the need for identification to the species level, proper susceptibility testing, as well as a stricter control of bovine tuberculosis.
