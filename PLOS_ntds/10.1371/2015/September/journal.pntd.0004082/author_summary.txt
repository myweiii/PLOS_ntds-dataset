Intestinal helminth infections are among the most prevalent parasitic diseases and about 1 billion people are currently infected with intestinal helminths. Incidence of intestinal helminth infections is high due to both socio-economic factors that facilitates continuous re-infections and the lack of effective vaccines. In this context, further knowledge on the host-parasite relationships is required to elucidate the factors that determine the expulsion of the intestinal helminths or, in contrast, the chronic establishment of the infections. Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda) is an intestinal trematode that has been extensively used as experimental model to investigate these factors. Depending on the host species. E. caproni is rapidly rejected or develops chronic infections. Herein, we analyze the changes in protein expression induced by E. caproni infection in a host in which the parasites develop chronic infections. These data may serve to get a better understanding of the factors determining the development of chronic intestinal infections. A total of 37 spots were identified differentially expressed. These proteins were related to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium and the control of homeostatic dysregulation, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins among others. This suggests that the changes in these processes in the intestinal mucosa may facilitate the development of chronic infections.
