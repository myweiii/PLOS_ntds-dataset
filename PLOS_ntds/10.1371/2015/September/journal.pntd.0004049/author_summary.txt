Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The wounds of most BU patients are colonized with different microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus. This study investigated patient-to-patient transmission events during wound care in a health care center. S. aureus isolates from patients who visited the health center at the same time points were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing. Analysis of sequence data confirmed transmission of methicillin resistant S. aureus and methicillin susceptible S. aureus among patients that took place during wound care.
