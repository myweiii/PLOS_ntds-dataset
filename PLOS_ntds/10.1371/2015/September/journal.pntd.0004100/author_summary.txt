Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne disease affecting humans and represents a huge public health burden in affected countries. Symptoms are often non-specific hence the need for an early, sensitive and specific diagnosis of dengue for appropriate management as well as for early epidemic detection. Currently, almost all laboratory diagnostic methods require a blood specimen that may be sometimes be difficult or inconvenient to obtain. In this study, we assessed the possibility to use saliva and urine samples as alternatives to blood specimens in dengue diagnosis. We demonstrated that the performances of the different diagnostic methods (RT-PCR, NS1 antigen detection and anti-DENV IgM/IgG/IgA ELISAs) were in general not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma, but that the use of these body fluids obtained by non-invasive methods could be of value in certain circumstances such as outbreak investigations or in young children (once they are old enough to comply to instructions), in addition to the situations when blood cannot be easily collected (e.g., lack of phlebotomist, refusal of the procedure, etc.).
