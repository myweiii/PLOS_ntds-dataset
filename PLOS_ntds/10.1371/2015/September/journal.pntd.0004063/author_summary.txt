The parasitic infection schistosomiasis afflicts millions of people worldwide and is clinically treated using a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Despite the fact that PZQ has served as a stalwart anthelmintic for decades, the molecular basis of action of this clinical agent is poorly understood. This lack of mechanistic information impedes the rational design of alternative therapies and highlights the need for new approaches for studying the target(s) and effectors engaged by PZQ in vivo. Here, we exploit the predictive phenology between free-living planarian regenerative screens and parasitic neuromuscular physiology to reveal a broad efficacy of ergot alkaloids in phenocopying the action of PZQ. In planarian regenerative screens, data highlight structural features of the ergoline scaffold that yield specific regenerative effects to promote or inhibit head regeneration. Ergot alkaloids with efficacy in regenerative assays were also found to modulate the contractility of schistosomules. Overall, these data highlight a possible therapeutic potential of ergot alkaloids as antischistosomals and the action of PZQ as an ergomimetic.
