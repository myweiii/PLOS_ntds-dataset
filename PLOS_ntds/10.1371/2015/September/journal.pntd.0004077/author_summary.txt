Aquatic snails transmit schistosome blood flukes, causing a parasitic disease second only to malaria in its global health impact. The mechanisms by which some snails naturally resist infection are poorly understood, but if characterized could enable protocols to interfere with transmission of the disease. Here we identify a region of the snail genome that correlates with resistance to infection, and we examine its effect on immunity jointly with a previously described resistance gene. Variation at other candidate genes has no effect on parasite resistance in this laboratory population. The two resistance regions could serve as targets to block parasite transmission via snails.
