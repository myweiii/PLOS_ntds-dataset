Dengue is a viral infection of worldwide importance with up to 96 million cases annually. Cholesterol, a type of lipid, may play a role in dengue virus infectivity and severity, but changes in cholesterol levels over the course of illness are not well-understood. To investigate the relationship between development of severe dengue and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), we analyzed data from a prospective hospital-based study of pediatric dengue in Managua, Nicaragua (August 2005â€“January 2013). Because different classifications of dengue severity are used, we performed analyses using three different classifications. Cholesterol decreased over the course of illness and differed across disease outcome, regardless of classification scheme. Greater decreases in LDL-C than HDL-C were observed among dengue-positive patients versus patients with other febrile illnesses and among severe versus mild dengue cases. In multivariate models, lower total serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels at presentation were associated with subsequent risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (World Health Organization 1997 classification). Our results suggest that reduction in LDL-C is likely driving decreases observed in total serum cholesterol levels among dengue-positive patients and should be explored as part of a prognostic biomarker panel for severe dengue.
