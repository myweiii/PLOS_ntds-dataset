Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease passed from animals to peopleâ€”either through direct contact with animals or indirectly via the environment. The disease can be found worldwide but is more important in tropical and subtropical countries. Due to their sheer genetic diversity, virtually all mammals can be infected by leptospires. People can be infected from a broad range of animals including livestock, pets and rodents. Transmission pathways differ among animal species as well as across rural and urban landscapes and environmental conditions which influence survival of pathogenic leptospira in surface water and moist soil. Consequently, spatial and temporal patterns of disease incidence are complex; however, a better understanding is crucial for the planning and implementation of effective interventions. We systematically reviewed the scientific literature to identify regional risk factors and assess their importance. We found considerable heterogeneity among studies indicating that epidemiological patterns are highly setting specific. Floods and heavy rain appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia. Exposure to rodents as well as behaviour and sanitation are often important risk factors indicating potential areas for interventions.
