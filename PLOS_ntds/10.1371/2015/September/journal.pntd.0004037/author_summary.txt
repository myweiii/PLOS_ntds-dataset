Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an infectious disease caused by fungi of genus Paracoccidioides (P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii). PCM is endemic in Latin America, with a greater incidence in Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. Over the last years, studies are focusing on neutrophilsâ€™ (PMNs) actions against P. brasiliensis, due to the capacity of these cells to develop different defense strategies against pathogens. and especially due to constant presence of inflammatory infiltrates full of PMNs in the granuloma of the disease. As PMN release of both granular and nuclear material, identified as Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), is a spectacular action mechanism against microbes, we seek to identify whether this process would be an important mechanism triggered against P. brasiliensis. Thus, we showed for the first time the identification of NETs in tegumentary lesions of patients with PCM by viewing the individual components of NETs. Beyond that, we demonstrated the entrapment of P. brasiliensis in vitro by these structures released from human PMNs of patients with PCM and healthy donors, with different patterns, in a dependence of the evaluated strain. Our data provides important new information regarding the role of PMNs against P. brasiliensis, opening new avenues for the research on immunity of PCM.
