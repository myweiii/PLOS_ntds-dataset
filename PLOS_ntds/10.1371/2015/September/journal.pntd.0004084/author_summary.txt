The canid adapted intestinal tapeworms, Echinococcus granulosus, E. multilocularis and E. shuiqucus are well known to be endemic in Northwestern China. The first two species can cause fatal disease in humans. Although E. shiquicus has not been reported to infect humans, all three species can be transmitted by dogs. The very close relationship between dogs and humans can readily lead to human infection. To aid the surveillance and management of echinococcosis, effective diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. We developed a single tube multiplex PCR assay for the accurate identification and discrimination of the three Echinococcus species for use in both clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies.
