    "Introduction": "Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is widely distributed worldwide, occurring in 98 countries and affecting approximately 1.5 million people every year. Approximately 90% of the cases are concentrated in 6 countries, including Brazil [1,2].\nIn Brazil, TL is endemic in all regions, with the highest incidence occurring in the northern region of the country [3]. The Amazon rainforest is located in the northern region and contains a large diversity of parasites, with 7 currently known species of Leishmania that causes leishmaniasis, L. (Viannia) braziliensis, L. (Viannia) guyanensis, L. (Viannia) lainsoni, L. (Viannia) naiffi, L. (Viannia) shawi, L. (Viannia) lindenbergi and L. (Leishmania) amazonensis [4,5].\nIn the state of Rondonia, the incidence of TL is high (68.29/100,000), with notifications of approximately 1000 new cases per year [3]. The species L. (Viannia) guyanensis [6], L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) lainsoni [7], and L. (Leishmania) amazonensis [8] have been found in Rondonia. However, the frequency of the occurrence of each species is unknown because of the small number of cases studied.\nClinical manifestations of TL can range from simple cutaneous lesions (CL) to more severe presentations that are classified as diffuse (DCL) and mucosal (ML) leishmaniasis. Most authors report that approximately 5 to 10% of both asymptomatic individuals and patients who have been given inappropriate chemotherapy or have recovered from TL can develop ML [9\u201311]. The number of patients with ML in the northern region is also higher compared with other regions of Brazil, and in Rondonia, approximately 12% of all reported cases are mucosal injuries [3].\nThe factors involved in the aggravation of TL are still not fully understood. Some authors report that the species of the parasites and vectors, genetic characteristics and immune status of the host [12\u201315] and, more recently, the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) [16,17] may be related to the diverse clinical outcomes of the disease. This diversity of factors, alone or combined, make understanding the pathogenesis of TL a challenge, particularly in regions such as the Amazon [18].\nLRV1 was described primarily in the L. (V.) guyanensis strain that was isolated from a patient with CL. When the strain was inoculated in hamsters, it led to the development of mucosal injury [19], which led to the hypothesis of the importance of viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease. Subsequently, the virus has been described in L. braziliensis [20], L. major [21], and recently in L. aethiopica [22]. Some studies have shown that high loads of LRV1 within parasites was related to the worsening of lesions, which caused tissue destruction due to an exaggerated response of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cascading effect from the dsRNA recognition via Toll Like 3 [16,22].\nGiven the prognostic significance of the Leishmania species involved in the infection and the presence of LRV1, our study aimed to identify Leishmania species and investigate the presence of LRV1 in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis to provide new evidence on the relationship between both the frequency of the virus and the different species of Leishmania with the clinical manifestations of TL.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Patient recruitment\nPatients at the Rondonia Reference Hospital for Tropical Medicine, CEMETRON who were previously diagnosed with leishmaniasis from March 2012 to April 2013 were invited to participate in the study.\nCEMETRON Hospital is located in Porto Velho and is a reference center for patient care with various infectious diseases in the state of Rondonia, serving patients from throughout the state and from the border region between the Acre and Amazonas states.\n\n\nEthics statement\nThe ethical recommendations of the Brazilian National Council of Health were followed with a research protocol registered and approved under the Certificate of Presentation for Ethics Appreciation code CAAE No. 0020.0.046.000\u201311 by the Ethical and Research Committee of the Center of Research in Tropical Medicine (CEP/CEPEM). Patients who voluntarily agreed to participate in the research were appropriately informed and signed a consent form. Patients were diagnosed according to the recommendations of the Brazilian Ministry of Health [23] routinely applied at the Hospital, which includes clinical and epidemiological criteria. The clinical manifestation of TL was classified as Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL), Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML), concomitant Cutaneous and Mucosal Leishmaniasis (CL+ML), Disseminated Leishmaniasis (DL) and Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (DCL). Considering implications that HIV coinfection may have on disease outcome, it is important to notice that following the recommendations of the Brazilian Ministry of Health [23], HIV serological tests are routinely offered to all patients with leishmaniasis. All patients included in the present study were HIV negative.\nSamples from the 156 patients diagnosed with TL (109 CL; 38 ML; 5 CL + ML; 3 DL and 1 DCL) were included in the study.\n\n\nCollection and processing of samples\nSample collection was performed using a sterile cervical brush placed in direct contact with the internal edge of the lesions. Sampling was performed in duplicate; one sample was used for DNA, and the other was used for RNA extraction. The collected material was immediately stored in an RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) for preservation of RNA and was stored at -20\u00b0C until the time of analysis. The DNA was extracted using the PureLink DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the protocol established by the manufacturer. The infection was confirmed using a polymerase chain reaction directed toward a fragment of the heat shock protein 70 gene (HSP70) [24] and the kinetoplast DNA [25].\nPCR amplifications were performed for hsp70 in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL, containing 5 \u03bcL of DNA, 0.4 \u03bcM of each primer, 200 \u03bcM dNTP, 0.75 mM MgCl2 and 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase Invitrogen (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR assays were performed using the following cycling: 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 58\u00b0C for 45 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The amplified fragments were visualized on a 2% agarose gel (Fig 1A) stained with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). For species identification, enzymatic digestion was performed with two restriction enzymes in separate reactions (HaeIII and BstUI) and was visualized on a 3.5% agarose gel (Fig 1C and 1D respectively) stained with GelRed. Reference strains were employed for comparison of fragment profiles in all PCR-RFLP reactions: L. amazonensis (IFLA/BR/1967/PH8), L. guyanensis (MHOM/BR/1975/M4147), and L. braziliensis (MHOM/BR/1975/M2903). Samples that were not identified by PCR-RFLP were submitted to DNA sequencing for species identification.\nAgarose gels [2% for (a) and (b), and 3.5% for (c) and (d)] stained with GelRed. a) PCR product of a fragment of the hsp70 gene of Leishmania. 50 bp: molecular weight marker of 50 base pairs; Lines 1\u20135: clinical samples positive for Leishmania; NC: negative control; PC: positive control and W: White. b) RT-PCR amplification of the ORF 1 fragment of LRV1. Lanes 1\u20134: clinical samples positive for LRV1; NC: negative control; PC: positive control and W: white. PCR-RFLP of hsp70 fragment digested with (c) HaeIII and (d) BstUI. 1: L.

Total RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and reverse transcription was obtained using SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cDNA was submitted to PCR to amplify a 240 bp fragment (LRV1 F\u2013 5\u2019-ATGCCTAAGAGTTTGGATTCG-3\u2019/LRV1 R\u2013 5\u2019-ACAACCAGACGATTGCTGTG-3\u2019) corresponding to the ORF1 region of the viral genome. The forward primer matches exactly the previously described region [26]. The reverse primer was designed using Primer3 [27] and checked for specificity using Primer-BLAST [28]. The amplification reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL containing 3 \u03bcL of cDNA, 0.2 mM of each primer, 200 \u03bcM dNTP, 0.75 mM MgCl2 and 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the following cycling: 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 57\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The fragments were visualized on a 2% agarose gel (Fig 2B). The cDNA obtained from the strain MHOM/BR/1975/M4147, donated by Cole\u00e7\u00e3o de Leishmania do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (CLIOC), was used as a positive control for all reactions. Some amplicons were sequenced using capillary Sanger sequencing standards protocols to check proper and specific amplification.\nFrequency of the LRV1 infection is two times greater among ML than CL (p< 0.0001).\n\n\nStudy design and statistical analyses\nA case-control study was conducted to evaluate a possible higher frequency of LRV1 among the ML patients (cases) than among those with CL (controls). It is important to emphasize that CL usually precedes ML in the clinical evolution of the disease; thus, some of the CL patients classified as controls may develop ML in the future. Because LRV1 is a non-infecting virus [29], it was assumed that the Leishmania-virus association was already established before human infection by the parasite. The adopted study design can be classified as conservative because that type of sampling bias decreases the statistical power in finding a significant association.\nData analysis was performed using SPSS version 19. Descriptive analysis of the observed absolute and relative frequencies and their respective confidence intervals of 95% were calculated. The Fisher exact test was applied to evaluate the hypothesis of association using a one-tailed probability. The null hypothesis was that there is no relationship between the presence of LRV1 and the type of injury, and the alternative hypothesis was that LRV1 frequency is increased in patients with mucosal lesion. The relative risk of the presence of LRV1 in patients with ML and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. The relative risk was defined by the ratio of the probability of the presence of LRV1 in mucosal lesions to the probability of the absence of mucosal lesions in LRV1.",
    "Results": "Samples from the 156 patients diagnosed with TL were included in the study and five different Leishmania species were found (Table 1). The most frequent species was L. braziliensis, with 121 cases (77.6%); 86 patients presented with CL, 28 presented with ML, 5 presented with CL + ML and 2 patients presented with the disseminated form of the disease. L. guyanensis was detected in 18 (11.5%) patients; 12 presented with CL, and 6 presented with ML. L. lainsoni, L. amazonensis and L. shawi were the less frequent species and were identified as infecting three (1.8%), two (1.3%), and two (1.3%) patients, respectively. Six (3.9%) samples could not be identified and were classified as Leishmania sp. Four samples were suggestive of mixed infection associated with L. guyanensis and L. braziliensis after enzymatic digestion and were considered to be inconclusive.\nLRV was detected in L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis and in L. amazonensis and L. lainsoni; thus, this represents the first report, as far as we know, of LRV in L. amazonensis and L. lainsoni (Table 1). At least one LRV1 positive sample amplicon of each Leishmania species was sequenced to assure the specificity of the amplicon, as well as to provide stronger evidence of the virus presence, considering the differences among sequences. The sequences were deposited at GenBank [30] with the following accession numbers: KT347134, KT347136, KT347137, KT347138, KT347139, KT347140 (from L. braziliensis), KT34735, KT347141, KT347142 (from L. guyanensis), KT347143 (from L. lainsoni) and KT347144 (from L. amazonensis). Further studies are needed to provide stronger evidence on LRV taxonomy and its relation with Leishmania taxonomy. Some samples with unclassifiable Leishmania species were also LRV positive.\nPatients who showed the least frequent types of injuries, such as CL + ML (n = 5), DL (n = 3) and DCL (n = 1), were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses to avoid confounding factors. Thus, analyses of the association between the presence of the virus and the disease were tested in a total of 147: 109 samples with cutaneous lesions and 38 samples with mucosal lesions, with 36.7% and 71.1% positives for LRV1, respectively.\nIn total, sixty-seven (45.58%\u201395%CI 37.7\u202653.6) samples were positive for LRV1. Forty (59.70%\u201395%CI 47.7\u202670.6) of these samples were from cutaneous lesions, and 27 (40.30%\u201395%CI 29.3\u202652.2) were from mucosal lesions. Among the 80 negative samples for LRV1, 69 (86.25%\u201395%CI 76.8\u202692.3) were from cutaneous lesions, and 11 (13.75%\u201395%CI 7.6\u202623.1) were from mucosal lesions (Fig 2).\nThe relative risk of patients presenting with positive LRV1 mucosal lesions (39.30%) relative to patients presenting with negative LRV1 mucosal lesions (12.30%) was 2.93 (95%CI 1.59\u20266.36), with Fisher\u2019s exact test of association p-value less than 0.0001.",
    "Discussion": "The results presented herein indicate the diversity of the Leishmania species and the complexity of the disease in the studied region. This study reports at least five different Leishmania species in Rondonia and a high frequency of LRV1 in cutaneous and mucosal lesions. The Leishmania species diversity reported here is similar to that observed in other Amazon regions, but differences in the frequency of each species were observed. In our study, L. braziliensis was the most frequent species observed associated with human disease, followed by L. guyanensis. L. lainsoni and L. amazonensis were each identified in just one patient. Considering the regions bordering the state of Rondonia, L. braziliensis was also reported as the most frequent species causing TL in Acre (Brazil), Mato Grosso (Brazil) and Bolivia [31]. However, L. lainsoni was the second most frequent species; L. naiffi and L. guyanensis were less frequently identified as causing TL in humans in Acre [32]. Studies conducted in Bolivia demonstrated that TL is predominantly caused by L. braziliensis [33,34] and less frequently caused by L. amazonensis [35], L. lainsoni and L. guyanensis [31,36]. There are few studies identifying Leishmania species in clinical samples from the state of Mato Grosso, but infections caused by species other than L. braziliensis are rare; few cases are reported as being caused by L. amazonensis [37], L. lainsoni or L. shawi [24]. A different scenario is observed in the state of Amazonas; L. guyanensis is the most frequent species causing human CL, followed by L. braziliensis, L. amazonensis and L. naiffi [38].\nMucosal lesions due to L. guyanensis, a parasite whose distribution is restricted to the Amazon region, have previously been described [39,40]. The present results reinforce the participation of L. guyanensis as a causative agent of human ML, which was previously commonly associated with L. braziliensis. The presence of these two etiological agents that are involved with the development of a more severe disease phenotype in the Amazon region can be an important factor in determining the high number of mucosal lesions that are observed in the region [3] in contrast to other Brazilian regions where mucosal lesions are caused exclusively by L. braziliensis. Another factor that might contribute to the severity of the disease in the Amazon is the high frequency of LRV1 in this region, which is discussed below.\nTen samples showed inconclusive hsp70 RFLP profiles. Of these, four samples were suggestive of mixed infection, presenting fragments corresponding to two different species: L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis (Fig 1). The sequences obtained were compatible with either L. braziliensis or L. guyanensis. In this case, the PCR product should be cloned before sequencing to evaluate the possibility of mixed infection; this was not performed in this study.\nThe frequency of LRV is rarely described in clinical samples. The first report of searching for LRV in samples from patients presenting with TL detected two positive cases, among a total of 11 investigated subjects [26]. Another study analyzing samples from TL patients from the Brazilian southeast region analyzed 47 samples and the virus was detected in 12 [41]. In addition to these studies, another study, analyzing biopsy fragments from patients presenting with CL, ML and both forms from different Brazilian regions, focused on patients from the city of Rio de Janeiro (located in the Southeast), where L. braziliensis is the agent of TL. The virus was detected only in two samples, corresponding to samples from L. guyanensis-infected patients [42]. Overall, these studies indicate that the severity and chronicity of the disease are not associated with only the presence of LRV. However, not only the presence of LRV but also the LRV burden can have an important role in disease progression (Ives et al 2011).\nThe role of LRV on the metabolism of Leishmania has not been studied in detail, and there is no information concerning why some strains are infected by the virus and others are not [17].\nThe percentage of ML samples positive for LRV compared with the samples that were negative shows that the presence of the virus contributes significantly to disease aggravation, as previously demonstrated in an animal model [16], but is not a determinant factor in the development of mucosal injury because 28.9% of the samples from mucosal infection showed no LRV infection.\nRecently, it was demonstrated that L. guyanensis infection, regardless of LRV content, induces a Th1 response mediated by MyD88 and TLR-9, two important adaptor proteins from the innate immune response, demonstrating that both proteins are important for the development of healing responses against L. guyanensis parasites [43]. Patients with mucosal lesions and that are negative for LRV1 may have hyper reactivity, representing an individual predisposition to the disease, whereas those presenting with cutaneous lesions positive for LRV may indicate that each patient will develop a metastatic phenotype dependent on their immunological status and/or time post infection.\nOur results indicate that a set of factors must be involved in the aggravation of an initial skin lesion, requiring a combination that has not yet been clarified, and that LVR plays a pivotal role in disease prognosis. Studies of the patients\u2019 immune status correlating the parasite species and presence of LRV1 may clarify the role of the host.\n\nConclusions\nThe parasites isolated in the Amazon region have higher genetic diversity than do isolates from other Brazilian regions [44]. Factors such as the wide geographic distribution, relatively well-conserved forests, a great diversity of natural reservoirs and understudied vectors may contribute to this diversity. The relationship between the genetic variability of Leishmania spp. and the high rate of LRV infection in the Amazon needs to be deeply investigated.\nOur study showed that LVR infection in the studied region is correlated with the severity of the disease, increasing the relative risk for developing mucosal injury by 2.93 times; however, this influence appears to be limited to the region studied because other studies report that the presence of LRV1 does not correlate with severe chronic TL caused by L. braziliensis in other endemic areas in Brazil. LRV seems to have a variable contribution to the emergence of mucosal lesions, alone or in conjunction with other factors, such as the genetic characteristics of the host and/or species-specific parasite virulence factors.\nStudies with clinical follow-up are needed to confirm the involvement of the virus in the pathogenesis of the disease and the possible role of LRV in the metabolism of the parasite to clarify this unusual symbiosis."
