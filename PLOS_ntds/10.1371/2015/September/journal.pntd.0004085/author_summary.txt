In the life cycle of the parasite Echinococcus granulosus, hydatid cysts produce the pre-adult form, which has the ability to either differentiate into an adult worm (strobilation) or dedifferentiate into a secondary hydatid cyst. We used different protein tags that allowed for the visualization and purification of proteins produced specifically after the induction of strobilar development to identify proteins that might be involved in this process (temporally controlled and context-dependent). As a result, we found proteins that are involved in important processes during development, such as energy metabolism, control pathways and cellular communication. We believe that these results will be useful for the development of scientific approaches to controlling and preventing cystic hydatid disease.
