Alveolar echinococcosis is one of the mostly deadly human parasitic diseases if left untreated. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, followed by two years of benzimidazole treatment. Unfortunately, only about 30–40% of patients have a resectable disease, while the others require medical treatment with benzimidazoles. As this therapy is only considered to be parasitostatic and as there are not yet reliable tools to assess parasite viability, the treatment usually is life-long. In this study, we evaluated FDG-PET/CT and antibody levels against the recombinant Emll/3-10 antigen as markers for parasite viability, allowing to select patients in whom chemotherapy could be stopped with low risk of AE-recurrence. Eleven 11 patients were identified with negative FDG-PET/CT-scans and anti-EmII/3-10 antibody levels in whom benzimidazole treatment was stopped with no evidence of AE-recurrence within a median follow-up of 70.5 (range 16–82) months. Therefore, this study provides evidence that benzimidazole treatment is parasitocidal in a subset of patients.
