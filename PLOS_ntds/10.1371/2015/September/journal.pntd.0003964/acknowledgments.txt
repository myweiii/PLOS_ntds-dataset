This paper is dedicated to Prof. R. W. Ammann, who unfortunately died on June 24th 2015. He established the clinical research program on alveolar echinococcosis at our institution and remained the driving force even after his retirement. He was also instrumental in initiating this trial.
We thank our nursing staff for support of the study and we are indebted to the hospital and family physicians for excellent cooperation.
