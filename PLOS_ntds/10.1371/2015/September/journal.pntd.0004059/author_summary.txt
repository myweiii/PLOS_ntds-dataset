Trichuris trichiura and Trichuris suis are whipworms found in humans and pigs, respectively, causing morbidity in humans and being associated with production losses in pigs. Although Trichuris from non-human primates is attributed to T. trichiura, hence considered the same species as the one infecting humans, several recent reports question this assumption. Morphologically similar parasites that have a wide global distribution and/or those capable of infecting several host species may comprise several ‘hidden’ species. In this study, we sequenced, annotated, and compared the mitochondrial genomes (including published genomes) of Trichuris obtained from different hosts in different geographical regions, including humans (Uganda and China), pigs (China, Uganda, and Denmark) and two types of non-human primates (baboons and françois’ leaf monkey). We found high genetic distinctiveness between human Trichuris from China and Uganda. Likewise, pig Trichuris from Denmark and other regions also showed considerable, although lower, genetic diversity. This suggests that both pig- and human-derived Trichuris may represent different species with potential differences in endemicity, which may have important implications for implementing effective control strategies. Our data also suggests that Trichuris infecting primates comprises several species and may be transmitted from non-human primates to humans.
