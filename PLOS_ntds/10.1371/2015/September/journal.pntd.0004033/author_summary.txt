Rheumatic heart disease is the result of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. The disease causes permanent scarring of the heart values, which results in heart failure, stroke and early death. It primarily affects the worldâ€™s poorest and most disadvantaged populations and despite the availability of cheap and effective prevention strategies receives little attention from policy-makers and funders. One of the major difficulties has been measuring how many people die prematurely from this disease. Simply counting up deaths is highly inaccurate and so an alternate strategy was needed. Focusing on Fiji in the Western Pacific, we pulled together information from several different health databases using a process called record-linkage. We then worked out how much more frequently rheumatic heart disease patients die than you might expect when comparing them to persons of similar age, gender and ethnicity in the general population. From these data we estimate about twice as many patients were dying from the disease than had been previously suggested. Most of these deaths occurred earlier than was thought with substantial knock-on effects for the economy. On balance we think this strategy for measuring mortality is useful and robust, and it will be increasingly possible to employ it elsewhere.
