We thank the Ministry of Health and the National Disease Control Programme for providing the datasets as well as their employees who compiled them, particularly those at the Ministry of Health Health Information Unit. Access to and use of the data was approved by the Permanent Secretary for Health in Fiji and the Fiji National Health Research Committee. TP thanks Professor Adrian Hill for supervision and guidance, Professor Michael Goldacre for suggestions on record-linkage, and Ms Nia Roberts for advice on the systematic review, all at the University of Oxford.
An earlier version of this study based on a deterministic record-linkage procedure was presented at the World Congress of Cardiology 2014. [40]
