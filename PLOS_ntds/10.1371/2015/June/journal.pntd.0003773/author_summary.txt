Trypanosomatidae are responsible for approximately half a million human fatalities per annum and the situation is compounded by substantial economic losses due to affecting live stock as well. Trypanothione reductase (TR) is an essential key enzyme of the unique trypanothione-based thiol metabolism of the trypanosomatidae and TR is a promising target for the development of selective inhibitors. However, TR is a very hard to attack target in standard drug discovery approaches. Therefore, we developed a combined and iterative in vitro and in silico screening approach, which led to a high number of novel TR inhibitors. 82 of those showed activities down to the nM range against T. cruzi TR. Moreover, the four most active compounds were selected for determining the inhibitor constant. In first on parasite efficacy studies, three of those compounds inhibited the proliferation of bloodstream T. brucei cell line 449 with EC50 values down to 2 Î¼M.
