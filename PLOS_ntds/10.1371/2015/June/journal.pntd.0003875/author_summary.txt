Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite of the Leishmania genus. It is transmitted by infected sandfly (the phlebotomines) and caused either visceral or tegumentary leishmaniasis depending on the species. In areas of endemicity for leishmaniasis, not all individuals exposed to the same environment develop the disease. It has been suggested that the genetic background of the individual may play a key role. The peri-rural regions of Manaus, the capital city of the Amazonas state of Brazil has become over the years endemic areas of mainly L. guyanensis American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis because of the constant deforestation and new settlements. Infected symptomatic patients most often develop localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), characterized by a single or multiple well-demarcated cutaneous ulcer with raised borders and granulomatous center. In this study, we tried to understand why some individuals develop cutaneous leishmaniasis while other in the same area do not by genotyping two polymorphisms situated the TOLLIP gene and we saw that both polymorphisms are associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
