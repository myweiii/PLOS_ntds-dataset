Chagas disease is transmitted by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The main form of transmission in endemic areas involves a life cycle in which blood-sucking triatomine vectors get infected by biting an infected animal or person. The saliva of blood-feeding arthropods contains a remarkable diversity of molecules that target the hemostatic and immune systems of the host. Thus, the systematic study and characterization of salivary proteins constitutes a strategy for identifying new exogenous compounds that may serve as prototypes for development of new drugs as well as strategies for vector control. Our group has studied the antihemostatic and antithrombotic properties of several exogenous inhibitors. In this report we demonstrated that the TXA2-binding proteins, dipetalodipin and triplatin, impair platelet-assisted formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have been described as web-like structures of DNA and proteins that play an important role in killing of pathogens. In addition, NETs have been recently implicated in thrombus formation. According to this, we demonstrate here that dipetalodipin and triplatin exhibit antithrombotic activity in two distinct in vivo mice models that are highly dependent on platelets. Remarkably, both molecules inhibited thrombosis without promoting excessive bleeding. Altogether, our results provide new insight into the antihemostatic effects of TXA2-binding proteins and may help to elucidate the mechanisms of saliva to avoid hostâ€™s hemostatic responses and innate immune system.
