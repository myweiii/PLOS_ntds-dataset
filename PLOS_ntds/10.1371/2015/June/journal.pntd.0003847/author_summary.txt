Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a yeast that commonly causes meningitis in HIV infected individuals in Africa, where it may account for up to 500,000 deaths every year. In this highly translational and multidisciplinary study, we used genetic analysis techniques to show that Cryptococcus found in Southern Africa represents a hotspot of genetic diversity. We combined this data with the results of microbiological techniques that assess the natural virulence traits that the yeast uses to survive and infect humans to further show that genetic diversity is associated with differences in cryptococcal phenotype. Finally, we analysed detailed clinical data on patients to investigate the clinical effects of infection with different lineages, and showed that one genetic lineage (VNB) is significantly associated with worse survival. Whilst much of our prior knowledge regarding the genetic basis of virulence is derived from studies on laboratory-adapted cryptococcal strains, our findings from this large and comprehensive MLST genotyping study of clinical isolates—linking genotype, phenotype, clinical presentation and outcome—provide direct insights into the contribution of pathogen lineage to virulence in human cryptococcal meningitis.
