Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a widespread zoonosis caused by protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. CanL is endemic in more than 70 countries, including regions of southwestern Europe, where the main vector is Phlebotomus perniciosus. Saliva inoculated into the host during blood feeding provoke species-specific antibody response. They could be used as a serological marker of exposure to sand flies and, in leishmaniasis endemic areas, also as an indication of Leishmania infection risk. However, in case of large-scale serological studies, it is difficult to obtain appropriate amounts of crude salivary antigen from laboratory-reared sand flies. Therefore, we studied if specific salivary recombinant proteins could be suitable to replace whole saliva as an antigen for serological assays. Antibodies recognizing recombinant salivary protein in naturally bitten dogs were highly correlated with antibody response against whole saliva. Seasonal exposure of dogs to sand flies led to antibody response fluctuations related to the period of activity and abundance of vectors. In a context of high CanL endemicity, we found a significant association between progressive CanL infections and antibodies against sand fly saliva. Thus, salivary recombinant proteins could be used as suitable tool for investigations host exposure to sand flies in endemic settings.
