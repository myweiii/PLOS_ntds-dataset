Leptospirosis is a common cause of fever in the developing world but often goes undiagnosed and untreated due to its non-specific clinical features and the limited availability of point-of-care diagnostics. This review systematically evaluated available literature to clarify the mortality from untreated leptospirosis. Untreated patients were defined as patients not receiving antibiotics, dialysis, or treatment on an Intensive Care Unit. All patients had a confirmed laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis through culture, PCR or serological tests. Results showed that mortality from untreated leptospirosis is significant in older patients and those who develop complications such as jaundice and renal failure, but mortality is low in younger patients and those with anicteric disease. There was a high degree of bias within studies due to limitations in diagnostics and missing data. The data presented in this review, when coupled with improved understanding of the true incidence of the disease, will help estimate the burden of disease from leptospirosis. Increased surveillance and accurate point-of-care diagnostics are required to better understand the incidence of disease and outcomes from leptospirosis. Empirical treatment strategies of undifferentiated fever should focus on early treatment of fever to reduce mortality from leptospirosis.
