Leishmania parasites are the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a wide spread disease in tropical and subtropical areas. The microorganisms have been shown to be well-adapted to their hosts and are able to enter their target cells where they replicate themselves. To ensure these processes, Leishmania disrupts a multitude of cellular signals and protective mechanisms, which overall attenuates immune responses against the parasites. A key factor for inflammatory processes, also during infections, is IL-1β. As previous studies suggested a dysregulation of IL-1β levels after infection with Leishmania parasites, we herein investigated the underlying mechanisms. Our work reveals that Leishmania suppressing IL-1β production through its virulence factor GP63. Furthermore, our data suggests that the parasites can dampen the maturation of IL-1β after different stimuli. In this regard we established a role for the suppression of the kinase PKC and the generation of reactive oxygen species, as well as the cleavage of cellular proteins that are important for IL-1β-generation. Thus, we here present a novel aspect for how Leishmania parasites can counteract host protective mechanisms.
