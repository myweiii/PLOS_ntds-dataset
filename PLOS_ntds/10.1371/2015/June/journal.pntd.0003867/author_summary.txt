Rabies is an important but preventable cause of death in Ethiopia. We assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices of animal bite victims attending an anti-rabies health center in Jimma Town, Ethiopia. We found generally high levels of knowledge about rabies. Participants recognized domestic dogs as the source and identified a range of appropriate preventive measures, including avoidance of bites and the need for dog confinement. Despite this reasonable level of knowledge, attitudes and practices that were not consistent with rabies prevention were identified. In particular, a belief that rabies could be cured by traditional healers (herbal medicine) was common among the participants, especially among those who lived in rural areas or who were of Protestant faith. Further, few of the dog owners actually confined their dogs and practiced vaccination. First aid following a suspect rabid bite was inadequate in the majority of participants and, contrary to established guidelines, most animals were killed rather than placed under quarantine following a bite incident. Female bite victims were more likely to report improved animal management practices while those of Muslim faith tended to report unfavorable animal management practices. These findings highlight the need for culturally- and gender-sensitive awareness raising programs that improve first aid and healthcare seeking behavior as well as appropriate animal management in order to prevent rabies-related deaths in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia.
