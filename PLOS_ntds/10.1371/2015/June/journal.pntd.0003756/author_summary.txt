Maps have long been used to not only visualise, but also to inform infectious disease control efforts, identify and predict areas of greatest risk of specific diseases, and better understand the epidemiology of disease over various spatial scales. In spite of the utilities of such outputs, globally comprehensive maps have been produced for only a handful of infectious diseases. Due to limited resources, it is necessary to define a framework to prioritise which diseases to consider mapping globally. This paper outlines a framework which compares each diseaseâ€™s global burden with its associated interest from the policy community in a data-driven manner which can be used to determine the relative priority of each condition. Malaria, HIV and TB are, unsurprisingly, ranked highest due to their considerable health burden, while the other priority diseases are dominated by neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne diseases. For some conditions, global mapping efforts are already in place, however, for many neglected conditions there still remains a need for high resolution spatial surveys.
