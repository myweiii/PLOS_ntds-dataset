Trachoma remains the leading preventable cause of infectious blindness in the world. Identifying risk factors for active disease that are amenable to intervention is key to successfully designing effective control programs to eliminate blinding trachoma. Association between cooking fire and eye inflammation makes biological sense, and multiple other studies, but conducted in adults, have been reported. This is the first detailed study of the risk of trachoma or infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in children associated with a broader exposure to cooking fires. We were able to identify an important risk factor: a strong relationship between cooking fire exposure while sleeping and active trachoma that appears to substantially increase the risk of intense inflammation, which may play a role in perpetuating the disease in the community reservoir, the children. Hence a higher risk for transmission and re-emergence in communities seeking elimination. This finding may suggest modifications to current behavioral risks that were not considered before and may significantly impact the progression of the disease.
