Leptospirosis is an important but largely under-recognized public health problem in the tropics. A sensitive, specific and practical point-of-care laboratory test is needed to improve clinical management in resource-limited settings. We developed a recombinant LigA protein based IgM assay (IgM ELISA) and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the test during outbreaks in the clinical-setting of a highly endemic country, the Philippines. Sensitivity and specificity of LigA-IgM ELISA and the whole cell-based IgM ELISA, which is included in WHO guidance, were evaluated with cases diagnosed by the standard serological test, MAT, culture and loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) as the composite reference standard and blood bank donors as healthy controls. The sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the LigA-IgM ELISA was significantly greater than those of the whole cell-based IgM ELISA on admission. When we re-defined the laboratory confirmation by LigA-IgM ELISA and LAMP, the clinical findings were more characteristic of leptospirosis than the diagnosis based on MAT/culture/LAMP. Our results suggest that LigA-IgM ELISA could be a useful diagnostic test in a real clinical-setting and help timely initiation of antibiotics to prevent severe outcomes of leptospirosis.
