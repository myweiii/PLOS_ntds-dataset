Sparganosis is a neglected tropical disease; its diagnosis is difficult and it is often misdiagnosed. ELISA using the crude or ES antigens of plerocercoids cross reacts with other helminthiases. Cysteine protease is a type of hydrolase and plays important roles in the development and survival of parasites; it has been used for diagnostic markers and vaccine targets for some parasitic diseases. In this study, a 36 kDa Spirometra erinaceieuropaei cysteine protease (SeCP) was expressed and purified. The results showed that SeCP was a plerocercoid stage-specific protein located in the teguments and parenchymal tissue. The rSeCP had cysteine protease activity and functioned to degrade host proteins. Vaccination of mice with rSeCP induced high levels of IgG1 and anti-rSeCP antibodies with the ability to kill plerocercoids in an ADCC assay. The rSeCP had a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting anti-plerocercoid antibodies, and could be used as a potential antigen for serodiagnosis of sparganosis.
