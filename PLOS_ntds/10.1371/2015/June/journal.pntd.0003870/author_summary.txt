Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi are protozoa parasites that cause sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, respectively, two neglected tropical diseases endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The high genetic diversity found in the T. cruzi population and the highly diverse repertoire of surface glycoprotein genes found in T. brucei are crucial factors that ensure a successful infection in their hosts. Besides responding to host immune responses, these parasites must deal with various sources of oxidative stress that can cause DNA damage. Thus, by determining the right balance between genomic stability and genetic variation, DNA repair pathways have a big impact in the ability of these parasites to maintain infection. This study is focused on the role of a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein named MSH2 in protecting these parasitesâ€™ DNA against oxidative assault. Using knock-out mutants, we showed that, besides acting in the MMR pathway as a key protein that recognizes and repairs base mismatches, insertions or deletions that can occur after DNA replication, MSH2 has an additional role in the oxidative stress response. Importantly, this extra role of MSH2 seems to be independent of other MMR components and dependent on the parasite developmental stage.
