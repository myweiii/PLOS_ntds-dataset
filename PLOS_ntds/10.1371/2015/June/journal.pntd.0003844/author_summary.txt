Yersinia pestis is a highly pathogenic bacterium and the causative agent of human plague. It has caused three recognized pandemics and is a current human health problem in many countries of Africa, Asia and the Americas, including Madagascar. The pathogen cannot be eradicated from natural plague foci as it persists in various known and cryptic rodent reservoir species. Genotyping is a critical tool in understanding the molecular epidemiology and possible kinetics of plague. In the present study, we succeeded in extracting DNA and genotyping directly from human clinical samples from Madagascar. We applied three different methods, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) analysis. Relative to their discriminatory power, all three methods provided important genotype information useful for understanding the molecular epidemiology of the disease, revealing that multiple, distinct genotypes caused human plague in Madagascar within one year, 2007.
