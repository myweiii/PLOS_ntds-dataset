Buruli ulcer (BU) is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and its toxin, mycolactone. Since 2004, BU has been treated primarily with antibiotics rather than surgery and skin grafting. The current first-line regimen is an oral drug, rifampin (RIF), and an injectable drug, streptomycin (STR), daily for 8 weeks. Because STR injections are painful and have potential side effects, such as hearing loss, a replacement drug is sought. Emerging evidence of the efficacy of the anti-leprosy drug clofazimine (CFZ) against tuberculosis prompted an evaluation of CFZ + RIF as well as another all-oral regimen, RIF + clarithromycin (CLR) in a mouse model of BU. The results showed that RIF+CFZ initially acts more slowly against M. ulcerans than RIF+STR or RIF+CLR but it stops mycolactone production and is as good as RIF+STR and better than RIF+CLR at preventing relapse of infection. A drug regimen with a combination of three drugs, RIF+STR+CFZ, for one or two weeks followed by RIF+CFZ has the potential to limit the duration of STR treatment and achieve comparable cure.
