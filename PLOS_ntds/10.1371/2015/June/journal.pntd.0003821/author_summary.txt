To identify whether a person is infected with parasitic worms, stool or urine samples are examined for worm eggs. The drug praziquantel is used against the parasitic disease schistosomiasis. However, there is no definitive agreement as to how the efficacy of praziquantel is best expressed. We put together a database from various studies of the efficacy of praziquantel against schistosomiasis. Efficacy was measured using customary methods: cure rate (CR: percentage of people with eggs in their stool/urine before treatment who became egg-negative after treatment); and egg reduction rate (ERR; percentage reduction in the number of eggs in the stool/urine after treatment, where the mean number of eggs from all people treated is calculated using either geometric or arithmetic means). We found that arithmetic and geometric means can be used interchangeably only if treatment efficacy is very high; arithmetic means are more sensitive to capture drops in efficacy expressed by ERR. A valid complement for drug efficacy monitoring is to study the distribution of individual responses in egg excretion that allows identifying in a single measure both those who had an adequate response to treatment and those who respond less well; e.g., the 5% of the patients with the lowest ERRs.
