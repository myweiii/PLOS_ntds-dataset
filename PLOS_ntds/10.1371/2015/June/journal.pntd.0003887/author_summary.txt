The World Health Organization recognized snakebites as a neglected tropical disease in 2009. Venomous snakebites cause substantial morbidity and mortality particularly in tropical developing countries and predominantly affect people in remote and poor communities with little voice and representation. Reliable epidemiological data on incidence are not available for many regions where snakebites are an important public health problem. Hospital statistics profoundly underestimate the real incidence, because the majority of the snakebite victims are treated in their village by traditional healers. Only well-designed, community-based surveys can assess the true rate of morbidity and mortality caused by snakebites in a particular area. The present surveys reveal a high incidence of snakebites in rural communities in Laos. All snakebite victims received traditional treatment in their village, because effective treatment in the hospitals is not available so far. In order to prevent disabilities and fatalities, medical staff and students need training in the management of venomous snakebites and antivenom the essential drug and only specific treatment must be available.
