Plasmodium vivax is the predominant malaria parasite in Latin America, Asia and the South Pacific. Different factors are expected to shape diversity and population structure across continents, e.g. transmission intensity which is much lower in South America as compared to Southeast-Asia and the South Pacific, or geographical isolation of P. vivax populations in the South Pacific. We have compiled data from 841 isolates from South and Central America, Africa, Central Asia, Southeast-Asia and the South Pacific typed with a panel of 11 microsatellite markers. Diversity was highest in Southeast-Asia, where transmission is intermediate-high and migration of infected hosts is high, and lowest in South America and Central Asia where malaria transmission is low and focal. Reducing the panel of microsatellites showed that 2â€“6 markers are sufficient for genotyping for most drug trials and epidemiological studies, as these markers can identify >90% of all haplotypes. Parasites clustered according to continental origin, with high population differentiation between South American and Central Asian populations and the other populations, and lowest differences between Southeast-Asia and the South Pacific. Current attempts to reduce malaria transmission might change this pattern, but only after transmission is reduced for an extended period of time.
