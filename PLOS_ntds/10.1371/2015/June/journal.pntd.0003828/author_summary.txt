Chagasâ€™ disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and affects 8 million individuals worldwide. The life-long infection begins with a short acute phase, which is associated to parasites circulating in the bloodstream, tissue parasitism, and various signs and symptoms including those related to myocarditis. After resolution of the acute phase, about 30% of those chronically infected will develop abnormal ventricular repolarization with hypertrophy, myocarditis and fibrosis by yet undefined mechanisms. MicroRNAs play a key role in silencing gene expression and are essential elements of the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. Here we describe for the first time the effect of acute T. cruzi infection on host miRNA expression by screening 641 rodent miRNAs in heart samples. A number of miRNAs have significantly altered expression upon infection and several of them correlate with T. cruzi parasitism and electrocardiographic changes. Pathway analysis results suggest that these dysregulated miRNAs can potentially affect gene networks and signaling pathways related to increased ventricular depolarization and repolarization times. Our study provides new insights on miRNA regulation of genes relevant to parasitological and cardiological outcomes.
