Helminth infections are a major health problem in the tropics and most affected are children. The parasites are able to influence the immune system from a T-helper 1 type response to a T-helper 2 type response. There is evidence that in infected individuals the immune response following vaccination is impaired. Thus pre-treatment with a single-dose of an antihelminthic treatment before vaccination could be a simple and cost-effective intervention to improve vaccine efficacy. In the present study we investigated whether a single-dose antihelminthic treatment with albendazole influences the vaccine outcome to a seasonal influenza vaccine in primary school children living in Gabon, Central Africa. We observed a trend towards a higher anti-viral antibody titer after vaccination in the pre-treated group compared to the placebo control group, albeit not statistical significant. Furthermore we detected a higher concentration of total IgA but not of vaccine-specific IgA. In conclusion, our findings show subtle effects of antihelminthic pre-treatment but are not conclusive enough to recommend a single-dose of albendazole before vaccination to improve vaccine immunogenicity but encourage to conduct further studies in endemic areas with other treatment regiments.
