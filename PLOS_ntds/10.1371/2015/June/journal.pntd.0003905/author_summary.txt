Yaws is a bacterial infection closely related to syphilis. The WHO has launched a worldwide campaign to eradicate yaws by 2020. For each clinically apparent case, many close contacts are infected but do not show clinical signs, which is called latent yaws. Currently, diagnosis for these patients relies on the detection of antibodies using syphilis serology. Reliance on detection of antibodies for diagnosis of latent yaws is problematic as the test may remain positive with a low titre despite successful treatment. This makes the interpretation of surveillance data in a post-mass treatment setting difficult for programme managers. In syphilis, PCR can detect T. pallidum ssp. pallidum in the blood of patients with latent disease. We used similar techniques to try and detect the yaws bacterium in the blood of patients seen as part of a study of yaws in the Solomon Islands. Although many people had positive antibodies for yaws consistent with latent yaws, we were unable to detect the bacterium in the blood. This may reflect the lower virulence of the yaws bacterium compared to syphilis. Currently available molecular techniques are therefore not able to aid programme managers in conducting post-mass drug administration surveillance for latent yaws. The development of alternative diagnostic tests should be considered.
