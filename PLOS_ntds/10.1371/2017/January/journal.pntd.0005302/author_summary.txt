Aedes aegypti is the major vector of emerging or re-emerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses worldwide. As there is still no vaccine or specific treatment for these diseases, their prevention relies mainly on insecticide-based interventions. Unfortunately, vector control programs are facing operational challenges with mosquitoes becoming resistant to commonly used insecticides in several regions across the world. To facilitate the design of suitable resistance management strategies for control of this vector, we investigated the molecular basis of insecticide resistance across four Malaysian Ae. aegypti populations. Transcriptional analysis revealed that 204 genes were commonly over-expressed with cytochrome P450 genes (CYP9J27, CYP6CB1, CYP9J26 and CYP9M4) consistently found as the most up-regulated detoxification genes in all populations indicating that they likely play an important role in the observed resistance. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validated the over-expression of all cytochrome P450s except for CYP6CB1. Polymorphism analysis of CYP9J27 sequences revealed a high polymorphism (except in Joho Bharu), suggesting a lack of directional selection on this gene. The predominant expression of cytochrome P450s suggests that synergist-based control tools could be used to improve control of this major dengue vector across Malaysia.
