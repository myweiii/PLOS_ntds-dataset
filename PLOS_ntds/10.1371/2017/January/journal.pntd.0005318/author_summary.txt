The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) glycoprotein E2 mediates cell attachment and consists of three domains A, B and C. Since the cell entry process of CHIKV is not understood in detail, we analyzed the binding properties of the three E2 domains with proteins expressed in E. coli or as Fc-fusion proteins and the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on E2 cell binding and CHIKV entry. The two surface-exposed E2 domains, A and B, both bound to cells and domain B bound only to cells expressing GAGs. Domain A bound additionally to GAG-deficient cells and domain C did not bind to cells. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector and CHIKV entry were enhanced in cells expressing GAGs. Our results suggest that CHIKV uses at least two entry mechanisms, one GAG-dependent, via attachment through E2 domain B, and the other GAG-independent, via binding of domain A. These data give indications that CHIKV uses multiple mechanisms to enter cells and shows the potential of GAGs as lead structures for developing antiviral drugs. In addition, it shows that domain A and B might constitute good targets for vaccine development.
