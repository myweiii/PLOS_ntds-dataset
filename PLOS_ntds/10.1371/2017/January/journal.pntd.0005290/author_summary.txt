Diarrheal disease is responsible for one in ten deaths among children less than five years of age globally. Innovative interventions to address gaps in the clinical care of these patients are lacking, yet will likely reduce the morbidity and mortality from diarrheal diseases. Therefore, the objective of this pilot study was to take a technology-enabled approach to improve guideline adherence, including antibiotic selection for diarrheal disease management in a resource-limited setting. To do this we adapted WHO guidelines to a smartphone platform and evaluated the approach in Bangladesh at two rural hospitals. The platform was durable and demonstrated positive improvement in guideline adherence. The results suggest that the decision-support tool was associated with a decrease in intravenous fluid use while maintaining safety, an increase in use of the recommended antibiotic, and a decrease in use of medications not recommended. This study represents a critical first step towards technology-enabled decision-support tools for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.
