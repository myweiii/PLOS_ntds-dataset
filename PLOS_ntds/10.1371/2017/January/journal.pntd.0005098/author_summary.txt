Worldwide, over one billion people are infected with intestinal worms (roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms). In worm-endemic areas, women of reproductive age are a high risk group for infection because of their poor nutritional status and increased physiological needs during pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and lactation. To measure the effect of providing mothers with deworming treatment soon after delivery, we conducted a trial in 1010 mother-infant pairs. Mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a single-dose deworming tablet or a placebo tablet. Mothers and their infants were visited in their homes at 1 and 6 months following delivery. At the 6-month time point, among all mother-infant pairs, we could not detect an effect of deworming on infant growth or morbidity. We did, however, observe that, among women who were infected with intestinal worms at baseline, deworming had a beneficial effect on important infant growth outcomes. The potential benefit of maternal postpartum deworming in populations with higher prevalences and intensities of intestinal worms, particularly where infections with whipworm and hookworm predominate, warrants further investigation.
