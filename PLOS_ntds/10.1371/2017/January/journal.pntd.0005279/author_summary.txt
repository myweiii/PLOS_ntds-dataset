Lymphatic filariasis is a disfiguring and debilitating neglected tropical disease caused by filarial parasitic nematodes including Brugia malayi. The immune mechanisms that drive host tolerance and host resistance to blood circulating microfilariae are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the interaction between B. malayi microfilariae and human peripheral blood leukocytes. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are the most abundant leukocyte population present within the human circulatory system and can release DNA-based extracellular traps (NETs) that capture and kill specific pathogens. We show that human neutrophils release NETs in response to B. malayi parasites. These NETs promote leukocyte-to-worm attachment but do not kill the microfilariae. Despite this, we highlight that neutrophils and monocytes can kill these parasites in vitro. Interestingly, the population of healthy human blood donors appeared to split into two distinct phenotypes: “Mf killers” and “non-killers”. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that activation of the complement system does not significantly contribute to leukocyte mediated parasite killing. Our study provides new insights into host-microfilariae interactions and the role that the human innate immune system plays in filarial parasite defense and the regulation of microfilaremia, a key determinant of disease transmission.
