Although Salmonella are a common global cause of mild gastro-intestinal illness that usually presents with self-limiting diarrhoea, the invasive nontyphoidal form of Salmonella disease manifests as bacteraemia which often presents only with fever. If left untreated, iNTS disease often results in death. iNTS disease is more common amongst people with impaired immunity, and in developing countries particularly in Africa. Data on the epidemiology of iNTS disease in Africa are sparse, making it difficult to estimate the true disease burden. This study aggregates all published cases of iNTS disease in Africa from 1 Jan 1966 up to 31 Dec 2014 and shows the relative importance of NTS as a cause of community acquired bacteraemia and deaths in Africa. The findings are important in raising awareness of iNTS disease and driving research to help develop effective control and preventive strategies to limit the disease. Important interventions needed for iNTS disease include rapid diagnostic tests and vaccines, as well as measures to improve hygiene.
