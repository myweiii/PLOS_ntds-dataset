Gambian sleeping sickness is a tsetse-transmitted disease which, without treatment, usually results in death. Unfortunately no medical prophylaxis exists to prevent infection in humans but curative medicines and vector control options are available. Recently there has been a push to reduce disease burden and a target incidence of 1 reported case per 10,000 people per year is hoped to be achieved in 90% of regions by 2020. Subsequently there is a goal of zero transmission by 2030. Using mathematical modelling, we assessed how different intervention strategies such as improving screening and treatment or introducing vector control can help in achieving these goals in a high endemicity setting. Following model simulation, we predict that improving current screening can reduce the time taken until the elimination targets are met. However it is very unlikely that the reported case target will by achieved by 2020 without additional vector control. We found that vector control has great potential to reduce transmission and, even if it is less effective at reducing tsetse numbers as in other regions, the full elimination goal could still be achieved by 2030. We recommend that control programmes use a combined medical and vector control strategy to help combat sleeping sickness.
