Several mosquito species including Aedes aegypti transmit pathogens as adults that cause disease in humans and other vertebrates. It has also long been known that mosquitoes host bacteria in their digestive tract, which are primarily acquired during the larval stage and transstadially transmitted to adults. Our recent results indicate that axenic larvae, which lack bacteria, do not develop beyond the first instar, whereas larvae with living bacteria develop into adults. To better understand the effects of bacteria on mosquito development, we compared growth, molting and gene expression in larval Ae. aegypti that contained several species of bacteria, only one species of bacterium (Escherichia coli), or no bacteria. Results showed that larvae containing several species or only E. coli grew and molted very similarly while larvae with no bacteria grew minimally and never molted. A number of Ae. aegypti genes with roles in regulating growth were differentially expressed in larvae without bacteria when compared to larvae with bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that mosquito larvae without bacteria do not grow or molt because of defects in assimilating nutrients.
