Wolbachia is a naturally occurring endosymbiotic bacterium that, when introduced into a na√Øve mosquito host, has been shown to effectively reduce the replication and transmission of pathogens such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, yellow fever virus and Plasmodium. However, a recent study has indicated that, under certain conditions, transiently infected Wolbachia can enhance West Nile virus infection in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. We wanted to investigate whether this enhancement effect could also be observed in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and if so, whether it is specific to the nature of the Wolbachia infection model under study (transient vs stable). We compared the replication and transmission of dengue virus and WNV (Kunjin strain) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbachia and mosquitoes stably infected with the identical Wolbachia strain. Contrary to the previous study, our results show no enhancement of replication or transmission for either dengue virus or WNV (Kunjin strain) in mosquitoes transiently or stably infected with Wolbachia.
