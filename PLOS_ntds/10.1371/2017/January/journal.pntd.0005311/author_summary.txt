Leishmaniases are a wide spectrum of parasite diseases caused by different species of the genus Leishmania. Among them, visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Currently chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic and suffer from extensive drug resistance. However, the development of a safe and effective vaccine has to deal with the complications erased from the different immune responses of the human population. It is suggested that a solution to that problem is the design of candidate vaccines containing appropriate multi-epitope peptides for the induction of protective immunity. Furthermore, the selection of proper adjuvant and biocompatible delivery systems for the peptide(s) chosen should enhance their immunogenic potential. Subsequently, for this work, we used a synthetic peptide designed to contain overlapping epitopes obtained from the sequence of a known immunogenic Leishmania protein, Cysteine Protease A (CPA). The peptide was selected to be delivered along with MPLA adjuvant co-encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles. The data presented in this study show the immunogenicity and the prophylactic potential of the proposed nanovaccine against L. infantum in the susceptible model of visceral leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice, further suggesting that rationally designed peptide-based nanovaccines are promising vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis.
