The soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the hookworms Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale, are the most prevalent intestinal helminths of humans, causing morbidity in developing countries. Large-scale preventive chemotherapy with albendazole or mebendazole is the major control strategy against STHs in mass drug administration (MDA) programs. In veterinary parasites, intensive reliance on the same anthelmintics has led to the emergence of benzimidazole (BZ) resistance, which is caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism at either codon 200, 167 or 198 in the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene. A great concern is that the intensive use of anthelmintics with suboptimal efficacy may lead to the development of resistance in human STHs. We developed novel genotyping assays to screen for β-tubulin polymorphisms in T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides based on the SmartAmp2 method. SmartAmp2 is a unique genotyping technology that detects a mutation under isothermal conditions with high specificity and sensitivity. The SNP detection assays were rapid, sensitive and highly specific for the detection of SNPs associated with BZ resistance with the potential to be used for monitoring in the field.
