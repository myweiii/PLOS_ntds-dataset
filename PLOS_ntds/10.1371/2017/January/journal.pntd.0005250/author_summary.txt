Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a worldwide-spread zoonosis, affects livestock mammals and humans with significant economic and public health impact. It is caused by the infection with the larva of cestodes belonging to Echinococcus granulosus complex, a series of parasite species with preference for different hosts. Among them, Echinococcus canadensis larva uses mainly camels, goats and pigs as hosts. Species/genotypes belonging to E. canadensis are considered the second most common cause of human CE, but its contribution may be underestimated since causes asymptomatic or more benign infections than other E. granulosus complex species. The most relevant antigen for CE diagnosis is a lipoprotein called antigen B (AgB). AgB antigenicity is linked to its protein moiety that is encoded by several genes. One of these genes, AgB2, seems to be differentially expressed within E. granulosus complex. Using high sensitivity proteomic tools we analysed the composition of AgB obtained from E. canadensis larva, detecting the protein products of all AgB genes, except AgB2. Since AgB subunits have been widely used as antigens in immunoassays for human CE diagnosis, our results indicate that using AgB2 protein product in these assays may lead to false-negative results, particularly in geographical areas where E. canadensis species/genotypes circulate.
