    "Abstract": "Much is known about the mode of action of drugs and resistance mechanisms under laboratory growth conditions, but research on the bacterial transcriptional response to drug pressure in vivo or efficacious mode of action and transient resistance mechanisms of clinically employed drugs is limited. Accordingly, to assess active alternative metabolism and transient resistance mechanisms, and identify molecular markers of treatment response, the in vivo transcriptional response of Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b to treatment with ceftazidime in infected lungs was compared to the in vitro bacterial response in the presence of drug. There were 1,688 transcriptionally active bacterial genes identified that were unique to in vivo treated conditions. Of the in vivo transcriptionally active bacterial genes, 591 (9.4% coding capacity) genes were differentially expressed by ceftazidime treatment. In contrast, only 186 genes (2.7% coding capacity) were differentially responsive to ceftazidime treatment under in vitro culturing conditions. Within the genes identified were alternative PBP proteins that may compensate for target inactivation and transient resistance mechanisms, such as \u03b2-lactamses that may influence the potency of ceftazidime. This disparate observation is consistent with the thought that the host environment significantly alters the bacterial metabolic response to drug exposure compared to the response observed under in vitro growth. Notably, this study revealed 184 bacterial genes and ORFs that were unique to in vivo ceftazidime treatment and thus provide candidate molecular markers for treatment response. This is the first report of the unique transcriptional response of B. pseudomallei from host tissues in an animal model of infection and elucidates the in vivo metabolic vulnerabilities, which is important in terms of defining the efficacious mode of action and transient resistance mechanisms of a frontline meliodosis chemotherapeutic, and biomarkers for monitoring treatment outcome."
