The mode of action and resistance mechanisms for many clinically used drugs are elucidated under defined artificial laboratory growth conditions, and do not necessarily represent the efficacious mode of action or predict the transient resistance mechanisms that are active during infection. Here, we report the unique transcriptional response of B. pseudomallei from host tissues and demonstrate the efficacious mode of action and transient resistance mechanisms of the frontline meliodosis chemotherapeutic, ceftazidime.
