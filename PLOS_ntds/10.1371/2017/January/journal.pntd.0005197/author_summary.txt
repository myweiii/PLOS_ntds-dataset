Viral diseases transmitted via Aedes mosquitoes are on the rise, such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Novel tools to mitigate Aedes mosquitoes-transmitted diseases are urgently needed. We tested whether commercially available insecticide-impregnated school uniforms can reduce dengue incidence in school children. To test this hypothesis we designed a school based randomized controlled trial where we enrolled 1,811 school children aged 6–17. For study monitoring, we also measured the effect of the impregnated uniforms on the survival of Aedes mosquitoes based on a standard bioassay test called WHOPES cone test. Furthermore, we counted the number of Aedes mosquitoes in classrooms and outside areas of classrooms. In the control schools, 3.7% and in the intervention schools 3.3% of the students had evidence of new dengue infections during the 5 month long school term, which indicates that there was no protection against dengue infections despite the fact that the knockdown effect of the impregnated uniforms was very high in the laboratory. We also showed a significant reduction of Aedes mosquitoes in the classrooms of the intervention schools. So why did this not translate into clinical protection against dengue? We assume the reason was the rapid wash-out effect of permethrin. Despite the company’s claim that impregnated clothing would withstand up to 70 launderings, we found a rapid decline in permethrin efficacy already after 4 washes, with the efficacy to below 20% after 20 washes. If rapid washing-out of permethrin could be overcome by novel technological approaches, insecticide-treated clothes might become a potentially cost-effective and scalable intervention to protect against diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.
