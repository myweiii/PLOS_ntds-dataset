Research addressing the severe clinical complications associated with ZIKV infection, including GBS and congenital ZIKV syndrome, are urgently needed. Key to this effort is development of well-characterized animal models that recapitulate human disease. Adult wild-type mice infected with ZIKV can develop viremia in some instances, but they do not emulate the disease associated with the severe congenital and adult neuropathology. Several groups have recently described type I or type II IFN-deficient murine models that are permissive for viral replication in several organs including the brain. The major limitation of these models is they utilize immunodeficient knockout mice lacking key components of the innate antiviral response. We describe the use of a lethal murine model for ZIKV where the innate response of immunocompetent mice is suppressed only at the time of infection. We show that the mice develop severe neurological disease similar to that previously demonstrated in mice deficient in the type I or II IFN response. Using this model, we provide a detailed description of the ZIKV-associated pathologic changes, which mirrors the neuropathogenic properties of ZIKV in humans. These studies provide a baseline for assessment of medical countermeasures that can prevent or treat such pathogenic effects caused by ZIKV infection.
