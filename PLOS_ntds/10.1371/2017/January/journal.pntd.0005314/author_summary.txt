Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration. The elimination target places high demands on monitoring and evaluation systems, for timely detection of ongoing transmission and possible recrudescence. Guidelines recommend using serological evaluation by Ov16, to determine the presence of IgG4 antibodies to the antigen Ov16 in children of less than 10 years in order to detect exposure to the O. volvulus parasite. In this paper, we use the mathematical model ONCHOSIM to explore how the post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children (measured 1 year after the last round of MDA) is related to local transmission conditions, observed trends in infection during mass drug administration the duration and coverage of mass treatment, test characteristics, mf prevalence and likelihood of interruption of transmission. The level of seroprevalence that is indicative of successful elimination was found to depend on local transmission conditions. This should be considered in survey methodology and criteria for defining whether mass drug administration can safely be interrupted. Remaining uncertainties about the dynamics of seroconversion and seroreversion further complicate the interpretation of seroprevalence data and the definition of thresholds.
