Triatomines are hematophagous insects including vectors of T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, a huge public health issue, especially in South America. Whether these arthropods carry other pathogenic microorganisms is currently unknown. We investigated the presence of different arthropod-borne pathogens, including Bartonella spp., by quantitative PCR. Bartonella species were identified using ftsZ, gltA and rpoB gene sequencing and a new genotype of Bartonella spp. was detected in Eratyrus mucronatus specimens, an important vector of T. cruzi to humans. This agent is closely related to several human and animal pathogens. Depending on the gene fragment used, this agent shares 84% to 91% of identity with B. bacilliformis, the agent of the deadly Carrionâ€™s disease. The possibility of transmission of potentially pathogenic bacteria could be an additional threat to human health since E. mucronatus bugs are more and more anthropophilic.
