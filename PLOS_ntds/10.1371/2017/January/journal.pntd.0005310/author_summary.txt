In populations living in adverse conditions due to poverty, a wide variety of intestinal parasite infections can be observed. These infections are usually diagnosed by stool microscopy, but can be easily missed if the procedures used are inaccurate or performed in a suboptimal way. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of intestinal parasite infections in an informal settlement in Beira, Mozambique. We also compared the diagnostic performance of five different microscopic techniques and real-time PCR for the detection of DNA of five helminth and five protozoa species. For this purpose, a single stool sample was collected from members of 63 households, evenly distributed within the settlement. Parasitic infections were found to be highly abundant in the 303 examined samples. Virtually all individuals were found to be infected with at least one helminth species and a majority of the stools showed multiple parasites. None of the classical microscopic techniques was suitable to detect all different pathogenic species. Hence, the outcome of several microscopy procedures had to be combined to get a complete picture. We found PCR to be the most accurate diagnostic approach, even in this hyper-endemic setting. However, DNA detection is a high-tech technology, generally not applicable in resource-poor settings.
