Onchocerciasis is a vector borne disease that is still a major health burden in endemic countries, despite twenty years of control that has led to effective control and reduction of blindness and morbidity in West Africa. To reach the goal of onchocerciasis elimination, alternative strategies are needed to overcome existing hurdles. Ivermectin is used for mass drug administration (MDA) and kills the microfilariae, thus preventing uptake by the vector and reducing transmission. Since adult worms live for 10 years or longer, MDA requires many years of treatment, a heavy burden on health care systems. Inadequate population coverage, sub-optimal responses, possible development of resistance and the risk of severe adverse reactions with co-endemic Loiasis are current hurdles for achieving elimination. The search for new drugs that could enhance elimination by permanently sterilizing and killing the adult worms has identified a 4–6 weeks course of doxycycline, a slow-killing drug due to its indirect mode of action by killing endosymbiotic bacteria. The present study aimed to investigate a new anti-Wolbachia drug, minocycline, and doxycycline in combination with one of the standard broad-spectrum anti-helminthic drugs, albendazole, to identify shorter treatment regimens. Our data confirm the efficacy of a 4-weeks doxycycline regimen and show that albendazole has additive effects when used in combination with doxycycline. In addition, comparison of a 3-week course of minocycline with a 3-week course of doxycycline revealed a trend for stronger efficacy of minocycline. Further development of anti-Wolbachia and anti-filarial drug combinations are warranted to improve treatment options to overcome existing hurdles and for use in “end-game” scenarios when switching from MDA to “test & treat” strategies.
