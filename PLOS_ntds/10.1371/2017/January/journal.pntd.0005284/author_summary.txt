Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a neglected parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. After the acute phase, a chronic debilitating disease is established and different clinical forms may develop. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most severe alteration, affecting about 30% of patients, and is characterized by myocardial remodeling and interstitial fibrosis due to changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Immune response is important to determine clinical outcome and/or disease establishment; however, it is not completely known how it participates in cardiac remodeling. Our study aims to understand the capability of neutrophils and monocytes from IND and CARD patients to produce matrix metalloproteinases and cytokines in response to in vitro stimulation with parasite-derived antigens. The present study showed that neutrophils and monocytes may contribute for inflammation and fibrosis in Chagas' cardiomyopathy through the production of MMPs and cytokines, respectively.
