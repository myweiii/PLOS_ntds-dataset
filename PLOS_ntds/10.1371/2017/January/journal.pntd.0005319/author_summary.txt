The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemic is currently expanding. In 2015, 38,332 cases of Chikungunya were reported to the Brazilian epidemiological surveillance system. To date, no serosurvey has described the impact of the disease on rural communities in Brazil. We conducted a survey in which households in the Chapada district, located in Riachão do Jacuípe in Bahia, were randomly selected for serum collection to perform a CHIKV antibody test. More than 100 cases of Chikungunya were reported in the Chapada district following a three-month period of rain. Eighteen months after the start of the outbreak, we identified that 20% of the population had acquired CHIKV, and 13/24 (54.2%) reported fever and joint pain over the previous two years. The rate of symptomatic CHIKV infection was 40.7%. We identified a moderate seroprevalence of Chikungunya in the Chapada district, and half of the patients reported arthralgia and fever over the previous two years.
