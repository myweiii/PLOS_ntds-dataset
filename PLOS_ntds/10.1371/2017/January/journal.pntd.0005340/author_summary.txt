Lymphatic filariasis (LF) was highly endemic in Bangladesh at the start of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 2000, with approximately 70 million people at risk. To address this burden, the National LF Programme implemented mass drug administration (MDA) in 19 highly endemic districts to interrupt transmission, and conducted sentinel site assessments in 15 low endemic districts. In 2011, as part of the LF Programmeâ€™s endgame surveillance strategy, the standard WHO Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) was used to show the reduction below transmission thresholds in order to stop MDA in all 34 endemic districts by testing a total of 136,080 primary school-aged children in 2,464 schools using rapid diagnostic tests. The data show that LF transmission has been interrupted in all districts except one, with the latter requiring two further two rounds of MDA. Bangladesh can now be considered, after 15 years of LF programmatic activities, as having very low or no risk of LF infection and is therefore on track to meet National and Global elimination targets of 2020.
