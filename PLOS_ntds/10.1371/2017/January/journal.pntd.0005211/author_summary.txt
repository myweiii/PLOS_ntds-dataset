The burden of trachomatis trichiasis (TT), a complication of trachoma, is largest in the poorest societies of our world. One part of the World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to eliminate blinding trachoma is surgery for patients with TT, and trachoma programs in endemic countries have worked to increase the availability of surgical services. However despite these efforts, uptake of surgery remains low. In this study, we sought to identify the barriers that prevent TT patients from receiving sight-saving surgery. We interviewed residents with TT who did and did not have surgery. We found that fear was the biggest barrier among all participants, not just those who did not have surgery. But despite this fear, those who received surgery reported more often a fear of losing further vision had they not had surgery, highlighting that an understanding of the visual loss with TT is a possible motivating factor. Barriers to surgery included concern for going unaccompanied, and the perception that self-management was sufficient. Eliminating trachoma requires refining how surgery and education about the disease are presented to residents of endemic communities, including outlining treatment logistics, surgical outcomes, and the natural course of untreated TT.
