Leishmaniasis is the denomination of a worldwide widespread group of tropical neglected diseases caused by protozoa belonging to Leishmania genus. Several factors have competed to worsen its spreading, such as climate changes and the recent conflict in Syria. The visceral form is the most severe among them and it is fatal if untreated. There is no vaccine for humans and the therapeutic arsenal is quite limited. Drug repurposing is a strategy that aims to look for new uses for well stablished drugs. This approach has been pointed as an attractive option to fasten the development of new treatment for leishmaniasis. Here, the authors evaluated the activity of cyclobenzaprine (CBP), a classical muscle relaxant, in a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis and investigated mechanisms involved in its leishmanicidal action. CBP was effective in reducing the parasite burden both in cell culture and in the liver and spleen of Leishmania-infected mice. Furthermore, the experimental data suggested that CBP interferes in the redox balance of the parasite and modulates the immune response of the host. Altogether, these results encourage further studies to evaluate the therapeutic usage of cyclobenzaprine for leishmaniasis.
