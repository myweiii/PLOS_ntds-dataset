The wide distribution of the mosquito vector and the co-circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes has led to increases in the incidence of dengue in the Americas, where it is a major public health concern. Identifying molecular epidemiological trends may help to identify the reasons for the re-emergence of dengue across Latin America and the Caribbean, and, in turn, enable disease control and management. We conducted this review using well defined methods to search for and identify relevant research according to predetermined inclusion criteria. The objective was to obtain a clearer understanding of changes occurring within dengue serotypes that have resulted in substantial genetic diversity and the emergence of endemic and epidemic strains in different parts of the region. There remain fundamental gaps in our understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of dengue and its relation with disease, and it is not possible to correlate accurately spatial or temporal trends in disease epidemiology, disease severity, or the genetic diversity of DENV. It is important to maintain comprehensive epidemiological surveillance throughout the region (including sequencing of viral strains) to detect new DENV lineages and to understand the regional patterns of DENV dissemination.
