Several intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens, some of that with zoonotic potential, often occur in free-ranging cat populations. Stray cats are abundant in touristic areas of Greece, where they live in free colonies. With the aim to enhance our knowledge on the hazard posed by cats living in Greek touristic spots, the present research has evaluated the presence of intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray cats living in selected areas. The study demonstrates that these pathogens are present in Greece and that appropriate control measures should be implemented to minimize the risk for cats and people.
