The genus Leishmania includes approximately 53 species, 20 of which cause human leishmaniais, a significant disease that has afflicted humans for millennia. But how ancient is Leishmania and where did it arise? Some suggest Leishmania originated in the Palearctic. Others suggest it appeared in the Neotropics. The Multiple Origins theory proposes that separation of certain Old World and Neotropical species occurred following the opening of the Atlantic. Others suggest that an ancestor to the Euleishmania and Paraleishmania appeared on Gondwana 90 to 140 million years ago (MYA). We performed a detailed molecular and morphological characterisation of a novel Australian trypanosomatid. This parasite is a sibling to the Neotropical Zelonia costaricensis, a close relative of Leishmania, and designated as Zelonia australiensis sp. nov. Assuming Z. costaricensis and Z. australiensis split when Australia and South America separated, their divergence occurred between 36 and 41 MYA. Using this event as a calibration point for a phylogenetic time tree, an ancestor of the dixenous Leishmaniinae appeared in Gondwana ~ 91 MYA. This study contributes to our understanding of trypanosomatid diversity by describing a unique Australian trypanosomatid and to our understanding of Leishmania evolution by inferring a Gondwanan origin for dixenous parasitism in the Leishmaniinae.
