The Flavivirus genus member Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (JEV), causes severe brain disease in tens of thousands of children across Asia every year. JE is vaccine preventable, and the immune response to JEV plays a major role in disease outcome. However, the response to JEV is hard to study as JE affects young children in rural areas. Related flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (which has no good vaccine), can influence the outcome of JE, probably due to cross-reactive immune responses. T cells (a subset of white blood cells) respond to virus infections, but we know little about the timing and nature of T cell responses to JEV after infection and whether T cells are protective against JEV.
We used the live JE vaccine SA14-14-2 as a model to study the immune response to JEV. We found T cell responses frequently after JE vaccination. In this small group of volunteers, many of whom were exposed to dengue virus, most of the T cell responses tested cross-reacted between JEV and dengue virus. However, only about two thirds of people made antibody responses to the vaccine. Studying these responses could help design new vaccines for use against JE and dengue in Asia.
