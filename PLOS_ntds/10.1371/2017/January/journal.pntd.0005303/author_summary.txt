Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease which has been reported in over 33 countries, mainly located in tropical and subtropical regions. It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an environmental pathogen associated to slow-moving water. The sources and reservoirs of M. ulcerans remain elusive and are still to be discovered. In a first attempt to address this issue we used high-throughput carbon substrate profiling of M. ulcerans. The reported results show that some nutrients, naturally available in organisms present in M. ulceransâ€™ environment, are metabolized by this microorganism. This carbon substrate determination should help improve the culture of M. ulcerans as well as suggest potential environmental reservoirs in Buruli ulcer endemic regions.
