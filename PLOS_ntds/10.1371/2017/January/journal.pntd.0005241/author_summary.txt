Burkholderia pseudomallei (B. pseudomallei), the causative agent of melioidosis, is endemic across parts of South East Asia and Northern Australia. Of the key features of B. pseudomallei, is its ability to remain latent in the host causing recrudescent disease years after initial infection. However, it still remains unclear as to where B. pseudomallei resides to escape from host immune sensors and antimicrobial pressure. Here, we have found that B. pseudomallei was able to enter into the nuclear compartment of host cells. The nucleus may play a role as a temporary abode for persistence, leading to recurrrent episodes of infection.
