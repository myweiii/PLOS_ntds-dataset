The data about flea-borne emerging or re-emerging infections throughout Iran are limited. This paper showed that the flea fauna of Iran were dominated by seven families. Moreover flea-host association analysis indicates that rodents are common hosts of flea families and most vertebrates hosted fleas belonging to the subfamilies Xenopsyllinae, Ctenophthalminae and Amphipsyllinae. We showed that the Persian jird (Merions persicus Blanford, 1875) and the Xenopsyllinae are respectively the major vertebrate and potential vectors of flea-borne diseases in Iran. Further efforts are needed to inventorize and screen molecularly wild and domestic mammals flea fauna (>3kg) in order to monitor the risk of and control flea-borne infections in Iran, especially in the ecoregions with high diversity of flea and host species and in the old endemic plague foci of the country.
