Leptospirosis is zoonotic disease of global importance, with over a million cases and nearly 60,000 deaths annually. Symptomatic disease presentation ranges from a mild febrile disease with non-specific symptoms to severe forms, characterized by multi-organ failure, lung hemorrhage, and death. Factors driving severe outcomes remain unclear, but the host immune response likely plays an important role. In the present study, we applied high throughput techniques to identify the antibody profiles of patients with severe and mild leptospirosis. We discovered a limited number of immunodominant antigens, specific to patients. Surprisingly, we found the antibody repertoire varies in patients with different clinical outcomes and hypothesized that patients with mild symptoms were protected from severe disease due to pre-existing antibodies, while the profile of patients with severe outcomes was representative of a first exposure. These findings represent a substantial step forward in the knowledge of the humoral immune response to Leptospira infection, and we have identified new targets for vaccine and diagnostic test development.
