I would like to thank Dr. Mark Molitch, Dr. Susan Hou, and Dr. Douglas Villarroel, founders, for giving me the opportunity to perform research at the CMHP. I am very grateful to the CMHPâ€™s staff, volunteers and health promoters for invaluable support during the study. Many thanks to the members of my dissertation committee at the University of South Florida, especially my faculty advisor Dr. Roberta Baer, for their guidance. Much gratitude to the anonymous reviewers who helped strengthen this article substantially. Finally, I am forever indebted to the patients of the CMHP for sharing their stories and experiences.
