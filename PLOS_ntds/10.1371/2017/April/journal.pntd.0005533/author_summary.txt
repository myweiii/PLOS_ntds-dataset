Control of mosquito borne diseases is being seriously challenged by the ongoing development of insecticide resistance. Resistance of Aedes albopictus, a major arbovirus vector, to the organophosphate larvicide temephos was recently associated with the up-regulation, through gene amplification, of two carboxylesterases; CCEae3a and CCEae6a. Here we investigated the worldwide distribution and origin of the amplified esterases, which is of great value for designing and implementing efficient vector control programs. Individuals with amplification of both esterases were found in Greece and Florida (U.S.A), representing a single amplification event that spread between the two countries, highlighting the importance of passive transportation of disease vectors carrying resistance mechanisms, which is mainly facilitated by human activities. In addition, individuals with amplification of the CCEae3a only, but not the CCEae6a, representing a second and independent amplification event were found in Florida. The worldwide haplotypic diversity obtained for CCEae3a is consistent with the highly invasive nature of the Aedes albopictus.
