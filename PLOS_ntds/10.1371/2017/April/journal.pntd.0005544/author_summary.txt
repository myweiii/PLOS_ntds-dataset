A number of experimental anti-schistosomiasis vaccines are under development. Our results have implications on the vaccinesâ€™ design and implementation. Design: For optimal impact at the population-level we found that the best vaccines are the ones that substantially reduce the acquisition of new worms and that kill existing worms with high potency. The next best vaccines for optimal impact at the population-level were those that both markedly reduced acquisition of new worms and reduced the shedding of eggs from residual worms. Implementation: For the best impact on transmission, we found that mass coverage in repeated rounds is required at an interval less than the mean durability of the vaccine-induced immunity. If the vaccine does not effectively kill existing worms, combining vaccine with MDA in these implementation rounds would compensate. Without vaccination, MDA programs have to be offered at five times higher frequency and for longer periods in order to get comparable impact at the population level.
