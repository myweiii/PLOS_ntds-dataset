Nipah virus (NiV) was identified in the late 1990s as the causative agent of severe respiratory and neurological disease in Malaysia and Bangladesh. The virus is transmitted by inhalation, contact or consumption of contaminated material. In this study, our objective was to characterize NiV-induced disease progression in the African Green Monkey model utilizing clinical imaging capabilities. In this work, we also provide the first temporal evaluation of the immune response to infection following NiV infection and the first characterization of disease following aerosol exposure. Here, we found that NiV infection following intratracheal and aerosol exposure lead to a severe respiratory disease and rapid disease course with no overt clinical evidence of neurological disease. Despite the rapid course of disease, changes in the cytokine response and peripheral immune cell populations suggest development of a cell-mediated immune response in the latter stage of disease. While the current model for evaluating NiV infection is useful for testing of medical countermeasures, further work is required to understand how this model can represent human disease.
