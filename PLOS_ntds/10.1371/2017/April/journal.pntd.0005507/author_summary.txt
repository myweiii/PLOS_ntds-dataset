Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi associated with food/beverage consumption is presently an important route of infection in Brazil and Venezuela. Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina and Ecuador have also reported to have acute cases of Chagas disease transmission through the oral route. Significant studies about this form of T. cruzi infection are largely lacking. In addition to the classic cardiac involvement, orally-infected patient progress to a highly symptomatic disease and increased mortality rate (8–35%), surpassing the calculated mortality produced by the disease resulting from the biting of infected insect vectors (5–10%). Here, we explored by in vivo bioluminescent images, qPCR and fluorescence microscopy the primary site of parasite entry and multiplication in oral infection (OI). Our results clearly demonstrated that the oral cavity is the main T. cruzi target region in OI, leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity and parasite dissemination to the brain and peripheral tissues. Interestingly, facial edema, paraesthesia of the tongue, gingivitis and dry cough were already described in affected patients. These findings might be associated to our present data, which describe for the first time the nasomaxillary region as the main target tissue following oral T. cruzi infection.
