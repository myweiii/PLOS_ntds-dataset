Q fever is a zoonotic diseases caused by a bacterium so called Coxiella burnetii. Domestic ruminants (primarily cattle, sheep and goats) are the most important reservoir of C. burnetii in the nature. Q fever is mostly asymptomatic in livestock and animals. Clinical manifestations of Q fever in humans includes asymptomatic, acute, chronic to fatigue syndrome. Acute Q fever is defined as primary infection with C. burnetii, and <60% of infected patients may be asymptomatic. Acute Q fever can manifest as a flu-like and self-limited illness. Chronic Q fever is accompanied with endocarditis and vascular infection which is fatal if untreated. The results of this meta-analysis showed the prevalence of IgG phase I and II antibodies of C. burnetii among human in Iran were 19.80% and 32.86%, respectively. The prevalence of Q fever antibodies in cattle, goat and sheep were 13.30%, 31.97% and 24.66% in Iran, respectively. Seroprevalence of Q fever among human and domestic animals is considerable. Preventative planning and control of C. burnetii infections in Iran is necessary. Active surveillance and further research studies are recommended, to more clearly define the epidemiology and importance of C. burnetii infections in animals and people in Iran.
