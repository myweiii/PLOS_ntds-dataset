Enzymes are catalysts that drive both a forward and reverse chemical reaction depending on the thermodynamic properties. FoF1-ATP synthase is a multiprotein enzyme that under normal physiological conditions generates ATP. However, when respiration is impeded, this rotary molecular machine reverses and hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons and maintain the essential mitochondrial membrane potential. While this activity is exceptional in most eukaryotic cells, the unique composition of the Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrion dictates that the infectious stage of this human parasite is utterly dependent on the hydrolytic activity of FoF1-ATPase. While searching for better chemotherapeutics against Human African Trypanosomiasis, several trypanocidal compounds were determined to interact with this enzyme, but they indiscriminately inhibit both the ATP hydrolytic and synthetic activities. A more promising approach involves the conserved eukaryotic protein IF1, a unidirectional inhibitor that prevents just ATP hydrolysis. Auspiciously, we identified this protein homolog in T. brucei (TbIF1) and its expression is tightly regulated between life stages of the parasite. Importantly, the introduction of exogenous TbIF1 protein specifically inhibits FoF1-ATPase and is lethal for the infectious stage of T. brucei. Therefore, we have identified a natural inhibitor of an essential and druggable enzyme that can be exploited for future structure-based drug design.
