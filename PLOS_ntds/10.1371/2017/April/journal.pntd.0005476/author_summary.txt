The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is one of the largest public health intervention till date based on mass drug administration (MDA). MDA interrupts transmission by clearing larval parasites from blood so that they are unavailable for mosquitoes. The current communication describes independent assessment of annual MDA of diethylcarbamazine and albendazol in endemic area of Gujarat state, India during years 2010â€“2015. The process indicators coverage and compliance rates and impact indicator microfilaraemia were studied following WHO guidelines. We report results from 125,936 nocturnal blood smears and 17,551 population in 120 clusters. Post MDA survey shows high coverage and compliance above 85%. Both drug and epidemiological drug coverage were above recommended average of 80% and 65% respectively. Directly observed consumption improved from 58% in 2010 to 82% in 2015. The reports were shared with program managers and drug administrators to inform development of specific strategies to enhance the program. Microfilaraemia decreased by 68% from baseline year 2005 to 2015. Findings demonstrate implementing MDA gives sustainable results in large populations. After ten rounds MDA, LF transmission is interrupted and microfilaraemia decreased to <1%. Now, Gujarat State is ready for post-MDA surveillance and Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS).
