In this work, we show that riboflavin plays a key role in the trypanosomatid life cycles and describe a novel family of riboflavin transporters (RibJ) with uptake function. Despite the vital importance of riboflavin for all living cells, RibJ are the first transporters described in protists. We functionally characterized the T. cruzi and T. brucei RibJ members and the effect of riboflavin analogs on parasite physiology. The structural and biochemical differences presented between human transporters and RibJ members make riboflavin transport and downstream metabolism, attractive and potential trypanosomatid targets.
