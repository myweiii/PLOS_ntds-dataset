Cholera is a highly contagious, acute diarrheal illness, which poses a profound health threat in many parts of the less developed world. The majority of cases are reported from Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, and the Americas (i.e., Haiti) where infections are primarily transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water. Today in the era of widely available rehydration therapies and antibiotics, deaths due to cholera are quite rare. Despite this, early detection of contaminated water sources is crucial for directing early interventions for curbing community-wide transmission. The authors found evidence linking an outbreak of cholera in southern Vietnam to consumption of unsafe water, especially drinking iced tea. This finding suggests the need for a water-monitoring system at ice-making plants. Further research is needed to confirm the biological link between iced tea consumption and cholera infection. Larger studies should also be conducted to understand the clinical consequences of infection with the new cholera agent (V. cholerae O1, altered El Tor strains).
