Our work forecasts the cost and economic burden of the Zika virus across six states in the US which are at the greatest risk of Zika (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). We evaluated the burden by varying attack rates, scenarios, and circumstances. All costs are reported in 2016 dollars. This is the first study to determine the potential economic impact of the Zika epidemic in the US across a wide range of possible scenarios (e.g., different scenarios explored the effects of varying attack rates from 0.01% to 10%). There has previously been debate regarding resource allocations to address the Zika epidemic. Our results are important for decision makers because they identify thresholds at which the economic impact of Zika on these six US states would exceed $0.5, $1.0, $1.5, and $2.0 billion. For example, a Zika attack rate of 1% across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, the six states at greatest risk of Zika infection, would result in total costs that exceed $1 billion. Our study also reveals the primary determinants of Zika-associated costs, which can help guide future data collection and control efforts.
