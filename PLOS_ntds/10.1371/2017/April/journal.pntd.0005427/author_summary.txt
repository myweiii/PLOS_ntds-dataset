The incidence of dog-maintained rabies in Latin America has showed a significant reduction in the last 30 years. Although several countries have achieved its elimination there are still focalized areas in the region where rabies remain endemic. Many factors, including poverty, geographic and environmental features, as well as social, cultural, political and economic variables, have limited the effective implementation of canine rabies control programs in these endemic areas. Critical to the goal of control and elimination of rabies is a robust laboratory diagnostic capacity. This report presents the results of an Inter-laboratory proficiency testing exercise for rabies diagnosis by direct fluorescent antibody test among laboratories across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Our results indicate that although all laboratories can perform the direct fluorescent antibody test, there are substantial differences in the overall results and test interpretation. This study identified important gaps in standardization and/or harmonization between laboratories which could be overcome and corrected with appropriate DFA protocols standardized across the LAC, including its broad distribution and proper training.
