There is an urgent global need for an improved TB vaccine strategy. Adolescents are an important target population for a TB vaccine. In field settings where the need for a vaccine is greatest, co-infection with other pathogens including malaria, HIV and helminths, may interfere with the impact of such strategies. In this study, we used a model TB vaccine candidate based on a genetically engineered viral vector, and with an excellent safety profile, to determine whether there was any immunological interference when this vaccine was used in adolescents who were co-infected with S. mansoni. Our data shows comparable immunogenicity in adolescents infected and uninfected with S. mansoni, suggesting that co-infection with this helminth species may not have an adverse impact on candidate TB vaccines of this type. The vaccine was safe and induced robust cellular responses in both the infected and uninfected adolescents following immunisation. These findings are important and encouraging for tuberculosis vaccine development.
