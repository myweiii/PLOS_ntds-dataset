A single infection with Plasmodium vivax can cause multiple episodes of illness due to dormant liver parasites called hypnozoites. Primaquine is the only drug currently available to treat hypnozoites but is under-used because it can cause life-threatening red blood cell damage in people who have an inherited condition called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In other locations, primaquine is given without testing for G6PD deficiency, putting patients at risk of potentially fatal hemolysis. New rapid diagnostic tests provide the opportunity to screen for G6PD deficiency prior to giving patients primaquine. Our study describes a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted using data gathered from the Thailand-Myanmar border. Our results show that screening for G6PD deficiency followed by primaquine treatment provided a few days of disability-free health per patient treated. This was achieved for similar costs as not giving primaquine to anyone or cost savings when compared to giving primaquine without screening. In addition to the health gains provided to patients, the safe use of primaquine will be a critical tool to eliminate malaria. We provide an interactive cost-effectiveness tool online that can be adapted to other locations to examine the potential costs and benefits of using rapid diagnostic tests for G6PD in different scenarios.
