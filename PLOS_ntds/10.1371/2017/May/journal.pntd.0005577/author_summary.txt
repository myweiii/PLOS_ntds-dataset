Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella and affecting mammals. Human Brucellosis is caused by ingestion of unpasteurized or undercooked food product from infected animals, or close contact with them. The infection with same bacteria even with same type can lead to manifestations varying from patient to patient. And there is no consensus for treating all types of brucellosis. In this paper, we retrospectively reviewed symptoms of Brucellosis in 590 patients living in Xinjiang area of China. We found that the percentage of chronic Brucellosis in Xinjiang from our study was 23.5%, which was higher than previous report. The reason for this increasing can be further explored. We also suggest that, despite the WHO recommended first-line 2-drug regimen is effective and preferred in most cases, the 3-drug regimen of doxycycline+rifampin+levofloxacin for 12 weeks should be recommended for patients with complications or experienced prolonged treatment. These findings are of clinical significance to improve Brucellosis management.
