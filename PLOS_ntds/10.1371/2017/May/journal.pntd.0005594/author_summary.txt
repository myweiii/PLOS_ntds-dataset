The worldwide occurring zoonotic roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati may cause the so-called neurotoxocarosis (NT) in humans, possibly resulting in a variety of behavioural alterations. Comparable alterations to those in humans have been described in T. canis-infected mice, however, reports on T. cati-induced NT are rare. Therefore, the main causative agent of human NT remains unknown. For a better understanding and more detailed characterization of T. canis- and T. cati-induced NT, infected and uninfected mice were exposed to several examinations regarding behavioural alterations and cognitive dysfunctions. Even though both roundworm species share many characteristics, pathogenicity as well as larval migration in the animal model has been described as quite different. The current study additionally highlights differences between behavioural alterations in infected mice. T. canis-infection mostly provoked neurological alterations, whereas T. cati-infection resulted in reduced excitability and flight-related parameters. Exploratory behaviour was reduced in both infection groups in addition to a negative effect of infection on memory function. The presented work provides a valuable basis for further studies and highlights the need for further investigations concerning consequences and differences between T. canis- and T. cati-induced NT.
