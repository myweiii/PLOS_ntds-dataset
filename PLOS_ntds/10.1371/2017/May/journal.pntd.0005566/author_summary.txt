Tse-tse flies are vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses, that are presently targeted by the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) coordinated by the African Union. In Zimbabwe, the government has devoted a full section of the veterinary services to tsetse and trypanosomosis control but the delimitation of tsetse infested areas, which is a pre-requisite to achieve effective control still requires improvement. Here we present a methodology that could help delimit target areas throughout the country, in a pilot study area located in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes. The study, which was carried out in preparation for a vector control campaign, allowed to discriminate areas where tsetse presence was certain, likely or unlikely Habitat degradation due to agricultural activities seemed to play a pivotal role in determining the infestation by tsetse since settled areas had low probabilities for both species which was expected in this group. Application of this model will help reduce the cost of delineating tsetse infested areas in other parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries at a time when funding for tsetse control programmes is reduced.
