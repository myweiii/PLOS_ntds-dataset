Helminth infections and tuberculosis are two of the major health care problems worldwide and share a great deal of geographical overlap. Moreover, helminth infections are known to induce immune responses that are antagonistic to the protective immune responses elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Having previously demonstrated that helminth infections can profoundly alter protective T cell responses needed to control tuberculosis infection, we examined how Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infection influences B cell responses in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in the context of co-infection and showed the Ss infection is associated with dramatic alterations in mycobacterial-specific IgG and IgM responses and levels of B cells and their growth factors BAFF and APRIL. These alterations in B cell responses could have implications for vaccine-induced immune responses to tuberculosis in helminthâ€”endemic countries.
