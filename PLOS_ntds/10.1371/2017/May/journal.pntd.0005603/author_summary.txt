Childhood malnutrition and diarrhea are important problems in lower and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and diarrhea are responsible for more than one third of all deaths in children below five years old globally. Most of these deaths occur because of complications of SAM and/or diarrhea. SAM and diarrhea may simultaneously present in a child, often with serious complications. Ileus is a common fatal complication in such hospitalized children, and is accompanied by abdominal distension and hyperactive, sluggish, or absent bowel sounds heard using a stethoscope. Ileus is confirmed by radiologic evidence of multiple gas-fluid levels in the abdomen. However, the underlying factors contributing to ileus and its management in diarrheal children with severe acute malnutrition is unknown. Our study aimed to ascertain these risk factors and the outcome of ileus in such children by reviewing the data of previously admitted children between April 2011 and August 2012. Of 306 severely malnourished Bangladeshi under-five-year-old children with diarrhea enrolled for 17 months, 45 had ileus. Ileus was independently associated with a reluctance to feed, septic shock, and hypokalemia and had a higher case-fatality rate compared to those without ileus.
