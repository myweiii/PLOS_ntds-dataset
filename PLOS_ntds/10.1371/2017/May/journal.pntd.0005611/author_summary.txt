Outdoor spatial spraying is commonly practiced by local governments as a prevention strategy for dengue and other Aedes-borne viruses. However, it has been publically criticized for its potential to reduce community-level actions such as clearance of mosquito habitat due to a resulting “false sense of security”. This study uses a paired social and entomological survey to analyze the association between residents’ perception that outdoor spraying prevents dengue and household level dengue fever prevention practices and entomological indicators in a city in northern Mexico. Our results suggest that those who view dengue is prevented by outdoor spatial spraying had 1) lower frequencies of elimination of potential mosquito breeding sites and higher frequencies of exposure to the vector, 2) higher entomological risk, and 3) a different socio-demographic profile than those who did not report it as effective. Our findings support the possibility that outdoor space spraying may lead to a “false sense of security” which reduces household engagement in prevention activities.
