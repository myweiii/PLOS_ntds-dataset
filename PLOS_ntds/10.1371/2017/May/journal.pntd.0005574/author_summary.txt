Hookworm infection caused by Necator americanus is a major neglected tropical disease with significant associated morbidity. New tools, such as vaccines, are needed due to the inadequacy of current control strategies. Glutathione-S-Transferase-1 of N. americanus (Na-GST-1) is one of the lead hookworm vaccine candidates; antibodies induced by this vaccine are postulated to interfere with the digestion of host hemoglobin by adult N. americanus hookworms, thereby impairing their development and survival. We conducted two Phase 1 trials of recombinant Na-GST-1 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel in 142 healthy adults living in the United States and Brazil. Each participant received three vaccinations every 2 months by intramuscular injection of the vaccine administered with or without an aqueous solution of the Toll-like receptor-4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA-AF). Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel was well tolerated in both hookworm-exposed and hookworm-na√Øve adults; no vaccine-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing levels observed after each vaccination. The addition of GLA-AF to the vaccine did not result in significantly higher antibody responses. Based on these results, the vaccine will be advanced into clinical trials in children and eventual efficacy studies.
