We would like to thank Prof Mike Doenhoff for providing us with the B. glabrata pigmented hybrid strain and all members of the Hoffmann lab for their support with snail husbandry. We thank the University of New Mexico (Dr Coenraad Adema and Professor Eric 'Sam' Loker) for maintaining the BB02 snails and for dissecting the tissues used for RNA-Seq analysis. S. mansoni-infected mice were provided to TPY by the NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center (Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville, MD) through NIH-NIAID Contract HHSN272201000005I for distribution through BEI Resources.
