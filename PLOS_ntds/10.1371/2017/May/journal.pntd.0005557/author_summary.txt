Yaws is an infectious and disfiguring disease of poverty primarily affecting children in rural communities in tropical areas. Yaws is easily treated by a single dose of antibiotics and is on the World Health Organizationâ€™s eradication list. Yaws was thought eradicated in the Cameroon in the 1950s following aggressive mass-treatment campaigns. In 2010, epidemiological research revealed a resurgence of the disease. This paper discusses the relative success of five different means of detecting yaws in rural areas of Bankim District between 2012 and 2015. While few cases of yaws were detected at local clinics during this time, many cases were detected in the community. The most successful means of detecting yaws were mass outreach programs designed to educate the public about neglected tropical diseases found in the region, and follow up school-based screening programs. These programs were supported by local chiefs and traditional healers and found to be the best way of increasing community awareness about yaws, motivating community health workers to participate in outreach, and fostering trust in the free medical treatment being provided.
