The majority of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections have long-term ramifications on an individual’s health and productivity, contributing to malnutrition, anaemia, and impaired childhood growth. In Timor-Leste there have been intermittent and ineffective STH control programs since 2004. When resources are constrained, having information on the geographic distribution of STH is important to ensure limited resources are targeted to areas most in need. In this study we predicted the risk of Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus and any STH infection in the Manufahi district of Timor-Leste, providing the first available risk maps for STH infection in any part of the country. To achieve this, we assessed the relationship between selected environmental factors and STH infection to create multivariable models accounting for potential clustering of infections in villages and households. Using these multivariable models, we predicted the risk of A. lumbricoides and N. americanus infection across the district based on the environmental variables. We found that the predicted risk of infection with N. americanus in the age group older than 18 years of age and with any STH in 6–18 year olds was high and widespread across Manufahi, supporting the need for control strategies across the entire geographical region. Our study also highlighted the focal nature of A. lumbricoides infection and its relationship with soil pH.
