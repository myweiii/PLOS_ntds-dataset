For the highly infectious and deadly ebolavirus disease (EVD) to date neither specific treatment nor vaccines are available. Rapid and adequate isolation of patients is the only option to contain and to combat spreading of the disease. Reliable and sensitive diagnosis that allows efficient identification of infected individuals is a pre-requisite for outbreak management. External Quality Assurance (EQA) studies are a vital tool to assess individual diagnostic laboratory performance particularly important during the outbreak of novel emerging infections. Therefore, a panel of inactivated ebolavirus samples was generated in order to perform an EQA for ebolavirus diagnostic during the recent outbreak in West Africa to assess performance of mobile laboratories sent to the outbreak countries from different parts of the world. Further, the panel was provided to laboratories in other parts of the world to improve global preparedness in case EVD would spread through international travel or evacuation of infected international staff members deployed to West Africa to fight the disease. While 73.6% of all results reported during this study were rated optimal the performance of the laboratories from the outbreak countries was even better with 82.1% of the results rated optimal.
