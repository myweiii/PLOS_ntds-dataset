Intestinal parasites, diseases of poverty that infect low-income populations and decrease school attendance and earning potential, infect more than 1 billion people worldwide. Current international guidelines focus deworming campaigns on high-risk populations of preschool- and school-aged children, and women of childbearing age. Intestinal parasitic infections also overlap significantly with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is highly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa; and some research indicates that certain intestinal parasitic infections have contributed to the spread of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. While there is a significant body of research examining the intersection between intestinal parasites and HIV disease progression, most of this work has occurred before HIV therapy was widely available in the region. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that focuses on a mixed sex, HIV treatment-initiated adult population, and directly measures intestinal parasitic infection via highly sensitive and specific molecular techniques. The results of this study indicate that adults who are living with HIV and parasitic hookworm infection are at an immunologic disadvantage when compared to adults who are not infected with hookworm. Our results also suggest that integrating deworming medications into HIV care could be an effective way to maximize the health status of this vulnerable population.
