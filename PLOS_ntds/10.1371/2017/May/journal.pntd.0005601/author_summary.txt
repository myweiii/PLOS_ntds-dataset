Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal disease endemic of some Latin America countries. The acute clinical form of the disease, which affects children and young adults, is the most severe form of PCM. It is characterized by a depressed T cell immunity and increased number of blood eosinophils that decreases after antifungal treatment. The role of eosinophils in PCM has never been investigated. We found high levels of eosinophil granules and chemokines in serum of patients. Moreover, patients eosinophils have a higher migratory and adhesion capacity compared to controls. Our results indicate that eosinophils may participate in the early steps of host response to fungi promoting an intense and systemic inflammatory response, which may result in an inefficient immune response against P. brasiliensis in vivo.
