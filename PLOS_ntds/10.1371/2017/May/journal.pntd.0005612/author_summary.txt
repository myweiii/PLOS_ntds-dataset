Snakebite is an important medical problem in tropical regions, including in Nepal where tens of thousands of people are bitten every year. Snakebite can result in life-threatening envenoming and correct identification of the biting species is crucial for doctors to choose appropriate treatment and anticipate complications. This paper compares two different doses of antivenom for the treatment of neurotoxic snakebite envenoming. Out of 157 snakebite victims presenting to one of the study centers, 78 received a low initial dose and 79 received a high initial dose. The proportion of patients who either died, needed breathing support or additional doses of antivenom were the same in the two groups. Overall, patients bitten by kraits did worse than those bitten by cobras. The occurrence of adverse reactions was comparable among those received low or high initial dose respectively. This study is the first to use a rigorous and robust method for comparing doses of antivenom in snakebite victims in South Asia. Although the high initial dose was not more effective than the low initial dose, it offers the practical advantage of being simpler to administer and was as safe as the low initial dose. The development of new and more effective antivenoms that better target the species responsible for bites in the region will help improve future patientsâ€™ outcomes.
