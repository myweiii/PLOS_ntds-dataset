Sirtuins are present in most organisms, including plants, bacteria, and animals. They play a vital role in promoting an organismâ€™s health and survival. These proteins are involved in the regulation of several functions in eukaryotic cells, including transcriptional repression, recombination, cell cycle, cellular responses to DNA-damaging agents, and longevity. Sirtuins are known to be involved in regulation of vital cellular processes. Hence, they have been proposed as promising targets for the development of antiparasitic drugs. Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis is known to express three sirtuins; SIR2RP1, SIR2RP2, and SIR2RP3. We have worked on the functional characterization of the SIR2RP2 protein from L. donovani in this study. We report that the SIR2RP2 is an NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase. This protein is present in the mitochondrion of the promastigotes and deletion of both copies of the gene caused reduced growth, compromised mitochondrial functioning and cell cycle arrest in the transgenic parasites. The transgenic parasites also had reduced infectivity. Deletion of LdSIR2RP2 resulted in increased sensitivity of the parasites to the known sirtuin inhibitors. Furthermore, the sirtuin inhibitors were found to inhibit the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of LdSIR2RP2 thus, indicating that parasitic sirtuins can be exploited as drug targets for antileishmanial chemotherapy.
