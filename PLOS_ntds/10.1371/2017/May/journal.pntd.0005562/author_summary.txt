Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease being among the six endemic prioritized diseases in the world. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania infantum and represents a serious public health problem in Brazil. Dogs are the main source of infection in the urban area and, in Brazil, the main strategies of the Visceral Leishmaniasis Control Program are directed to control the canine reservoir (serological survey and euthanasia of dogs which present reactive serum). In general, diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been presented as a problem for Brazilian public health services. The issue should be attributed mainly to the following factors: 1- range of similar clinical signs observed in other infectious diseases that affect dogs; 2- large percentage of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic dogs; 3- nonspecific histopathological changes; 4- nonexistence of a diagnostic test 100% specific and sensitive. In this work, we developed a synthetic bi-epitope peptide as an antigen for immunodiagnostic ELISA to detect CVL. The biepitope used for ELISA assay accurately distinguish (98% sensitivity and 99% specificity) CVL dogs sera from non-infected dogs sera.
