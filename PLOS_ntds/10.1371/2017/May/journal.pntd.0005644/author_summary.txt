Despite numerous efforts made, a vaccine against leishmaniasis for humans is not available. Attempts based on parasite fractions or selected antigens failed to confer long lasting protection. On the other side, leishmanization, which consists in the inoculation of live virulent parasites in hidden parts of the body, is effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans but objectionable in terms of biosafety. Some efforts have been made to design live vaccines to make leishmanization safer. A promising strategy is the development of genetically attenuated parasites, able to confer immunity without undesirable side effects. Here, we have employed an attenuated L. infantum line (LiΔHSP70-II) as a vaccine against heterologous challenge with L. major in two experimental models. Infection with LiΔHSP70-II parasites does not cause pathology and induces long-term protection based on the induction of IFN-γ producing T cells that are recruited rapidly and specifically to the site of challenge with the virulent parasites. These results support the idea of using attenuated parasites for vaccination.
