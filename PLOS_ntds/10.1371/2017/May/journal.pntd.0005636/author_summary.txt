Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a life-threatening disease in humans caused by the larval stages of E. multilocularis. It has been shown that the infection in humans is associated with a modulated immune response. Depending on multiple factors, such as the stage of disease, total or partial surgical resection and albendazole (ABZ) therapy are treatments of choice. ABZ is known as a parasitostatic drug that has to be administered for years to suppress metacestode development. Here we compared human liver lesions before and after short and long term treatment with ABZ by immunohistochemistry using a broad panel of antibodies. We found a change in the cellular infiltrate, characterized by a shift to an infiltrate rich in T cells, B cells and plasma cells during long-term treatment with ABZ, including a pronounced detection of small particles of E. multilocularis (spems). We argue that ABZ treatment is likely to change the cellular infiltrate, leading to an enhancement of the host immune response during treatment.
