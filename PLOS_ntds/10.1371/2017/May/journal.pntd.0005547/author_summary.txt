Typhoid fever is endemic in Nepal, with Kathmandu coined “the typhoid capital of the world”. We developed a mathematical model to assess the importance of migration and antimicrobial resistance on the transmission of typhoid fever in Kathmandu, Nepal from April 1997 to June 2011. During this period, the burden of typhoid fever increased markedly from January 2000 to December 2003, after which the epidemic declined, but to a higher endemic level than in 2000. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that migration of susceptible individuals into Kathmandu played an important role in the epidemic, and may have been further aided by the emergence of typhoid fever with reduced susceptibility against fluoroquinolones. This study showed that identifying and targeting migrant populations with control efforts could be an important avenue to prevent typhoid transmission and disease.
