Schistosomiasis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and in the tropics and subtropics in particular, infection rates are high. The efficacy of anthelmintic therapy is limited since it has no effect on immature parasite stages and does not prevent re-infection. The root cause of disease is a granulomatous hypersensitivity reaction to parasite eggs entrapped within the intestinal wall and small liver sinusoids. This reaction is mainly caused by CD4+ T cells of the subtype 2 and alternatively activated macrophages. As a repair response it suppresses inflammation but results in hepatic fibrosis (e.g. Symmer's pipe stem fibrosis), portal hypertension and its clinical sequelae, ascites and esophageal varices. We demonstrated herein that a primary infection with female S. mansoni cercariae leads to the suppression of TH2-mediated granuloma size, hepatic fibrosis and disease progression in bisexually challenged mice. This protection is associated with Retnla- and Ctla4-mediated TH2 suppression but not with a reduction in parasite load. Our findings provide evidence that protection against egg-induced granulomatous hyperreactivity is achievable by exploiting gender-specific differences between schistosomes.
