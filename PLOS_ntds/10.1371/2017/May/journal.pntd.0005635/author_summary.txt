Treatment is one of the key strategies for visceral leishmaniasis control and elimination. Historically a number of monotherapy drugs for VL treatment were used in Bangladesh, including pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB), and miltefosine (MF). With the limited number of drugs available, it was necessary to preserve existing drugs and also to develop shorter and safer treatment regimens. At the time the study was initiated, miltefosine monotherapy was a recommended first-line treatment in Bangladesh. The present study aimed to provide safety and efficacy data for three short-course combination regimens including AmBisome, miltefosine and paromomycin when rolled out in field conditions in Bangladesh, and to compare these to AmBisome monotherapy. All combinations proved non-inferior to AmBisome monotherapy and were safe and well tolerated. This study was implemented in field conditions at Upazila level with treatment provided by government doctors, providing further evidence for scaling up new regimens in national program contexts within the public health sector.
