Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and helminth infections are co-endemic in several regions of the world and their immune responses may be mutually antagonistic. We therefore hypothesized that helminth infection would impact and potentially shape Mtb-specific T-cell responses and systemic inflammation in patients suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) enrolled from two helminth endemic regions i.e. Tanzania (TZ) and South Africa (SA). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that TB patients from SA and TZ harbor distinct immune responses to Mtb antigens. Indeed, we showed that Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell responses of TB patients from TZ were composed by a mixed T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 responses. In contrast, the cytokine profile of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells of TB patients from SA was dominated by Th1 cells and associated with TB-induced systemic inflammation and elevated serum levels of type I IFN. Taken together, these data indicate that Mtb-specific T-cell responses are diverse in human populations and can be strongly influenced by host and pathogen genetic background, co-infections and yet unknown environmental factors. Identification of correlates of risk and protection from TB disease will help in the rational development of protective T-cell based vaccines against TB, early monitoring TB treatment outcomes and focused follow up of high risk populations.
