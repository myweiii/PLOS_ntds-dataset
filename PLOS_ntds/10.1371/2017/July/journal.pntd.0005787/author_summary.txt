Rabies is a deadly neglected virus that causes an estimated 59,000 deaths each year worldwide. In 2014, an outbreak of human rabies in adjacent Maputo and Matola cities prompted us to investigate the epidemiology and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites in the two cities. We reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites through both health facility and community investigations and carried out a case control study in affected neighborhoods. We found a total of 14 unreported human rabies cases in a four month period, and 819 cases of animal bites in a three month retrospective review of records. Dogs were responsible for all rabid bites and for 97.8% of animal bites. None of the rabid dogs had been vaccinated. Factors significantly associated with human rabies were: age <15 years, bite by a stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by an unimmunized dog, failure to use soap and water to cleanse the wound, and to vaccinate after the bite. We concluded that the poor implementation of control measures for rabies had led to the outbreak and recommended strengthening implementation, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas.
