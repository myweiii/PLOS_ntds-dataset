The pathogenesis of the serious adverse reactions that occur in patients carrying high loads (usually > 30,000mf/mL) of circulating Loa loa parasites and treated with ivermectin has to date not been clearly defined at the tissue level. These reactions, which can result in the death of many of those affects and cause permanent mental damage in others, inflicts considerable disruption to the important mass treatment programs to control and eliminate filariae where ivermectin is used. The recently described baboon model of hyper-microfilariaemia has been used here to study the pathological changes occurring after ivermectin treatment; the clinico-pathological presentation following treatment in baboons appears to be closely related to those seen in humans. The tissue changes seen suggest that the primary pathological event following ivermectin treatment is a vasculopathy associated with intra-vascular microfilarial destruction within smaller blood vessels that damages them and leads to changes in the tissues supplied by these vessels. The effects of cortisone and aspirin on these changes are also addressed in this study.
