Leishmaniasis are neglected tropical diseases that represent a major public health problem in the world. New outbreaks have been recorded in the outskirts of some cities and phlebotomine vectors show geographic expansion, potentially associated with environmental and climate changes. We investigated a recent focus of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in dogs from two residential condominiums located in an environmentally protected area in the municipality of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The purpose of the study was to investigate Leishmania (L.) infantum infection, the etiological agent of the disease, in vector insects (phlebotominae), domestic (dog) and wild hosts. Antibody prevalence was determined in 1.5% and 1.2% of dogs examined in 2013 and 2015, respectively. In addition, natural infection by the VL agent was confirmed in two species of sand flies and two white-eared opossums. All positive animals were captured near human residences and in forest areas. Scenarios like these, with changes in ecosystems and the proximity of wild and domestic animals and humans, can promote the occurrence of zoonoses. The participation of wildlife in the transmission cycle of zoonoses has assumed greater importance in recent years as a result of the consolidation of the One Health concept.
