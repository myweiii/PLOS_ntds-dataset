Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral hemorrhagic fever affecting primarily livestock in Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula. The conditions leading to RVF emergence are not fully understood, mainly because of data scarcity. Applied to the island of Mayotte (our ecosystem under study), for which 12 years RVF serological dataset are available, and by using a mechanistic model, we demonstrate that RVF epidemics related mainly to the introduction of infectious animals. Our work confirms that anthropogenic factors, such as livestock movements, need to be accounted for in order to understand the epidemiology of this disease. Our model should be tested elsewhere, with ecosystem-specific data.
