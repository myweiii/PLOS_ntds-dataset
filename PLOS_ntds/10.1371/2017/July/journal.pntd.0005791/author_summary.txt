Malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases in the world with hundreds of millions of new cases every year. Malaria is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium which have a complex life cycle, alternating between mosquito and mammalian hosts. Human infections are initiated with a sporozoite inoculum deposited into the skin by parasite-infected mosquitoes as they probe for blood. Sporozoites must locate blood vessels and enter the circulation to reach the liver where they invade and grow in hepatocytes. In the case of Plasmodium vivax, one of the two Plasmodium species responsible for the majority of the disease burden in the world, the parasite has the ability to persist for months in the liver after the initial infection and its activation causes the recurring appearance of the parasite in the blood. Though all clinical symptoms are attributable to the blood stages, it is only by attacking the transmission stages before the formation of hypnozoites (the persisting parasites in the liver) that an impact on the burden of vivax malaria can be achieved. We used state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics tools to identify the total protein make-up of P. vivax sporozoites. By analyzing which proteins are exposed to the parasite surface and determining the degree of proteinâ€™s post-translational modifications, our investigation will aid the understanding of the novel biology of sporozoites and importantly, advise the development of potential vaccine candidates targeting this parasite stage.
