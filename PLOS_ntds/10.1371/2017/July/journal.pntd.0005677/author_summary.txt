The mosquito midgut microbiota plays an important role in mosquito susceptibility to human pathogens and therefore is an important component of mosquito disease transmission. The microbiota can be highly variable, however, and the sources of this variation are not well understood. In this work, we aimed to improve our understanding of the ways in which the mosquito can influence its microbiota. To do this, we utilized strains of Aedes aegypti that vary in their midgut microbial load. We compared the transcriptomes of two strains with highly disparate bacterial loads, and found that genes involved in amino acid metabolism (specifically branched chain amino acid degradation) were differentially regulated between the strains. We found that when we silenced these genes using an RNA interference approach, bacterial loads increased in a strain-specific manner, confirming a role for these genes in controlling proliferation of the midgut microbiota. Overall, these results suggest that differences in amino acid metabolism or catabolism in the mosquito could have important implications for the mosquito microbiota.
