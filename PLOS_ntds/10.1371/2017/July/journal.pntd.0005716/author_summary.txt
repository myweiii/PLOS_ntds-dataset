Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a severe, painful complication of leprosy, which can occur before, during or after successful treatment of the infection. ENL is characterised by severe pain and the development of new painful skin lesions. Other organ systems are often affected. ENL may continue to affect people for many years leading to disability, significant loss of income and sometimes death. ENL often requires prolonged treatment with corticosteroids, thalidomide or other drugs that modulate the immune system. Thalidomide is the most effective treatment but is not widely available or affordable in many leprosy endemic settings. This results in many people taking high doses of corticosteroids for prolonged periods and being at risk of severe adverse effects. In order to assess the efficacy of different treatments for ENL it is important to be able to compare individuals before and after treatment. This is difficult to do in a complex, multi-system disorder such as ENL. To overcome this problem we have developed a scale, which is easy to use, to measure the severity of ENL. In this article, we describe the validation of this scale, which ensures that it is a useful measure of ENL severity.
