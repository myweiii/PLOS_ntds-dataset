Cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic in many countries and definitive diagnosis of disease is crucial. Accurate diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires isolation of infected tissues, culturing of parasites from infected lesion and microscopic identification of parasites. Both approaches are invasive and cause discomfort especially for children. Here, we described a novel method using sequential tape strips for sampling and isolation of DNA from the surface of skin lesions of CL patients for specific diagnosis. This method is a sensitive, non-invasive and cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostic assays. Furthermore, it is painless, rapid, user-friendly and suitable for field studies and heath care centers.
