Syphilis remains a worldwide public health concern as there has been a global increase in the incidence of syphilis. Serologic tests are still considered the mainstay of syphilis diagnosis. Currently, there are three algorithms for screening of syphilis- traditional algorithm, reverse algorithm and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) algorithm. But there is no uniform screening method for syphilis. Different surveys use different screening algorithm. Will the different screening algorithm influence the seroprevalence of serodiagnosis of syphilis in this unique population? For those infected with both syphilis and HIV, the situation is even more complex. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have analyzed the different algorithms for detecting syphilis in HIV-positive people. Therefore, we compared the results of the three syphilis screening algorithms in an attempt to evaluate their screening performance in this unique population. Our results supported the reverse (or ECDC) algorithm in screening of syphilis in HIV-infected populations. In addition, our study demonstrated that the tradition algorithm approach underestimates the prevalence of serodiagnosis of syphilis in HIV-infected individuals.
