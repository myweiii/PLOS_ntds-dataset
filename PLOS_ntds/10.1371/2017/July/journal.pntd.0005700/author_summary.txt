Previous studies of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have focused on clinical symptoms and viral load (or its proxy of cycle threshold value) in the blood of patients measured the day they begin medical care. However, this provides a single snapshot of the illness in time and does not indicate how signs/symptoms and cycle threshold values change over time. This study examined EVD symptoms and the Ebola virus cycle threshold values in patients from the time the illness started to the time they recovered or died. The patients studied were admitted to five treatment units in West Africa over a one-year period. The authors found that the youngest (under five) and oldest (45 and older) patients were least likely to survive EBOV infection. In addition, higher levels of virus in the blood at the time patients sought treatment as well as higher virus levels over the duration of their illness were associated with lower survival. These findings provide important insight into the progression of EVD over time and will help clinicians and other health workers to identify and design interventions for subgroups of patients who are more likely to die from EBOV infection.
