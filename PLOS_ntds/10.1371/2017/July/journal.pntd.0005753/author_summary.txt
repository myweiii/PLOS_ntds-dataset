Plasmodium vivax (Pv) mainly affects Asia, Central and South America as well as Ethiopia. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) Pv prevalence is among the highest worldwide. The biggest challenge for the control of Pv infections is the formation of dormant liver stages, which have the ability to relapse and cause disease even after successful clearance of asexual stages in the blood circulation. Primaquine is the only licensed drug that is able to prevent Pv relapses. A randomized treatment-to-reinfection cohort in Papua New Guinean children permitted permitted the study of Pv and P. falciparum gametocyte carriage after radical cure with Primaquine and to investigate the contribution of Pv relapses to transmission. We found that most gametocyte carriers in this study were detected in asymptomatic infections and that relapses and new infections are associated with similar Pv gametocyte production. These are strong arguments emphasizing the importance of sensitive detection and early treatment of asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium spp. infections and of anti-hypnozoite treatment for an effective control of Pv.
