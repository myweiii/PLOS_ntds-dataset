Bothrops genus is responsible by 80–90% of the snakebites in the Brazilian Amazon, resulting in a subcutaneous and muscular lesion at the site of bite, which many times evolve to local complications, mostly secondary bacterial infections. In this region, late medical assistance is common and probably contributes to the high complication rates related to local necrosis and secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to permanent function loss and disabilities. Even with this high frequency, routine empirical use of antibiotics aiming to prevent secondary infection lacks a clearly defined protocol. In this work, we estimated the efficacy of amoxicillin clavulanate for reducing the secondary infection incidence in patients bitten by Bothrops snakes, and, identified factors related to secondary infections from snakebites. Amoxicillin clavulanate was not effective for preventing secondary infections from Bothrops snakebites, probably because of the resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in bacteria species commonly found infecting the snakebite site. This finding highlights the need of previous knowledge of the secondary infections epidemiology as a cornerstone in the preemptive antibiotics trials in snakebites. Laboratorial markers, such as high fibrinogen, alanine transaminase and C-reactive protein levels, and severity clinical grading of snakebites, may help to accurately diagnose secondary infections.
