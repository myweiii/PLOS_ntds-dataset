Ticks are among the most important vectors and reservoirs of several animal and human pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa. However, very few studies have been done on ticks in Mali. At present, little information is available about tick species infesting livestock or human tick-borne diseases transmitted in Mali. The identification of tick species and the determination of pathogens associated are essential to evaluate epidemiology and risks of human and animal diseases: the One Health approach. Current identification methods are time consuming, expensive and laborious. Previous studies have shown that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses may allow accurate tick species identification. A recent study suggested that it was possible to identify ticks preserved in alcohol by MALDI-TOF MS. The aim of the present study was to improve tick leg sample preparation conditions for their identification by MALDI-TOF MS from Malian ethanol-preserved specimens collected in the field. This study provided 99.4% concordance between morphological and MALDI-TOF identification. The detection of microorganisms was also performed by molecular biology revealing the presence of the presence of Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae. These results support the use of MALDI-TOF MS in entomology, tick diseases epidemiology and improve the knowledge of tick species-diversity and tick-borne pathogens circulating in Mali.
