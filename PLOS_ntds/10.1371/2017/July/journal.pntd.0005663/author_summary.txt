Although the incidence of animal bites is increasing in China, residents’ knowledge about appropriate wound treatment and prompt PEP is insufficient. A face-to-face interview was conducted to investigate whether the wound was treated properly and to determine the time disparity between injury and consultation to the RPCs among animal bite victims. We discovered that a minority of people treated wounds appropriately, and more than one-third of participants delayed the initiation of PEP. A stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors of improper wound treatment and the delay of rabies PEP. Males (OR = 1.871, 95% CI: 1.318–2.656), residents without college education (OR = 1.698, 95% CI: 1.203–2.396), respondents liking to play with animals (OR = 1.554, 95% CI: 1.089–2.216), and people who knew the fatality of rabies (OR = 1.577, 95% CI: 1.096–2.270), were likely to treat wounds improperly after an animal bite. Participants aged 15–44 years (OR = 2.324, 95% CI: 1.457–3.707), residents bitten or scratched by a domestic animal (OR = 1.696, 95% CI: 1.103–2.608), and people who knew the incubation period of rabies (OR = 1.844, 95% CI: 1.279–2.659) tended to delay the initiation of PEP. The results also showed that knowledge of rabies among residents is insufficient. These findings highlight the urgent need for public educational and awareness-raising programs that would improve appropriate wound treatment and prompt PEP to prevent rabies-related deaths.
