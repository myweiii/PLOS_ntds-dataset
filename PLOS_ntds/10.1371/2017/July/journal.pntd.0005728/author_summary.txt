An ideal vaccine should show a broad range of protective efficacy against all serotypes of a particular pathogen. Variations in the structural lipopolysaccharide “O”-antigen mean that it is difficult to induce protection against multiple serotype Shigella strains using a single serotype immunogen. Here, we examined vaccination effects of an attenuated S. flexneri hfq mutant strain overexpressing virulence proteins common to all Shigella serotypes, which was identified from our studies on temperature and osmotic-dependent regulation of the type III secretion system: an essential virulence machinery among Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli species. The deletion mutant lacked the RNA-binding protein Hfq, which led to increased expression of the type III secretion system via loss of regulation, resulting in attenuation of cell viability through repression of stress response sigma factors. Immunization with the hfq mutant of S. flexneri 2a induced systemic immunity and cross-protective efficacy against two different serotypes of Shigella strain: S. dysenteriae type 1 and. S. sonnei. Detection of anti-Shigella antibodies against various strains with different serotypes suggests that generation of antibodies specific for common virulence proteins affords cross-protection against Shigella strains of multiple serotypes.
