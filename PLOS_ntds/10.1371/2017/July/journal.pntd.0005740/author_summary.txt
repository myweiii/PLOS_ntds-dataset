Dengue is a viral illness that can lead to severe and potentially fatal complications. The most common complication is fluid leakage from blood vessels, which can cause low blood pressure or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The majority of patients recover with simple intravenous fluid replacement, however in approximately 30% of DSS cases, recurrent episodes of shock occur, and these patients have a higher risk of fluid overload, respiratory distress and death. We investigated whether using portable echocardiograms (Echo) in the intensive care unit (ICU) to assess cardiac function and intravascular volume parameters as well as blood lactate levels, can help identify these patients. We found patients who developed recurrent shock had higher heart rates and lower Stroke Volume Index (SVI), and higher lactate levels at enrolment than those with 1 episode or no shock. Higher SVI and worse cardiac function after 3 days in ICU was associated with respiratory distress. Admission lactate levels predicted patients who subsequently developed recurrent shock and correlated positively with the total IV fluid volume received. These results demonstrate that Echo-derived intravascular volume assessment and venous lactate levels can help identify dengue patients at high risk of poor outcomes in the ICU, and could assist in the management of severe dengue.
