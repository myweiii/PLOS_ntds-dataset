Leishmaniases are human parasitic diseases caused by several species of insect-transmitted Leishmania. The pathogenic genus Leishmania has close relatives that also colonize the guts of insects but are not able to infect mammalian cells. When the genes and gene expression profiles of pathogenic Leishmania are compared to those of their nonpathogenic relatives, some genes are either only present or expressed at higher levels in the pathogenic parasites. Protein products of these genes are likely to be involved in the parasites‘ ability to colonize two hosts. Identification of their function will lead to a better understanding of leishmaniases and may reveal potential new drug targets to combat disease. Experiments here are aimed at characterizing a gene identified in this manner. The sequence of the gene’s protein product was examined to identify motifs that gave clues to its function, and the protein itself was determined to be located in the cytosol of Leishmania mexicana cells. When the gene was deleted from L. mexicana, it compromised L. mexicana’s ability to grow quickly in culture, to achieve maximal levels of parasitemia in mice, and to achieve maximal parasite loads in insects.
