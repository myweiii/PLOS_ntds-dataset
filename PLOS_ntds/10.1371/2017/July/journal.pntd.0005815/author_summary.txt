Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium. It primarily invades endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Plasma concentrations of interferon (IFN)-γ, several cytokines and chemokines, which are known to recruit natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, were found to be increased in scrub typhus patients. NK cells are known as essential immune cells against several pathogens. In murine models of Rickettsial infection, the clearance of bacteria was found to be significantly associated with NK cell activity. Not much is known regarding NK cells’ role in O. tsutsugamushi infection in humans. This study is very possibly the first to measure NK cells’ level and function of in scrub typhus patients, or to examine NK cell levels’ clinical relevance. This study’s results demonstrate that circulating NK cells are activated and numerically increased in scrub typhus patients. Notably, increased production IFN-γ by NK cells of scrub typhus patients suggests their contribution to enhancement of intracellular bacterial killing in infected antigen presenting cells. Moreover, disease severity corresponded to increased NK cell levels. These findings importantly suggest that NK cells play a role in protecting the host against O. tsutsugamushi infection.
