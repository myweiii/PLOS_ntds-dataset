Leprosy reactions are abrupt inflammatory episodes that can occur before, during or after treatment. Although reactional episodes are the main cause of physical disabilities in patients, there are few genetic studies evaluating this outcome. We studied the influence of both risk factors and genetic markers in leprosy reaction outcomes. For this, we used a population including patients that either did or did not develop a reaction, and we performed a characterization of the genetic markers indicating susceptibility to leprosy. As a result, we identified how variables such as gender and clinical forms influence the amount of time before the occurrence of a reaction. In addition, we highlighted genetic markers related to the timing of the reactionâ€™s occurrence, and associated them with reaction susceptibility. These markers were also related to the production of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our study describes the risk factors and genetic components associated with leprosy reactions and can help in the prognosis and monitoring of patients to prevent clinical complications.
