Control of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the Americas is dependent upon active case detection and treatment. The efficacy and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is based on clinical resolution of disease, not on parasitological clearance. The detection of dermotropic Leishmania in tissues such as nasal and conjunctival mucosa, blood and healthy skin in the absence of signs and symptoms of disease, suggests that despite clinical resolution, parasites persist subclinically. We examined clinical and parasitological factors associated with Leishmania persistence after standard-of-care treatment of CL caused by L. Viannia. We found that a high proportion of CL patients with therapeutically achieved clinical resolution of CL harbor viable Leishmania. A previous episode of CL was found to be a protective factor for parasite persistence. Treated, clinically cured CL patients constitute an important proportion of a persistently infected human population whose clinical and epidemiological significance remains to be determined.
