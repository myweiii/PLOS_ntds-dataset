Since first being recognised in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) has mainly been associated with a mild illness with symptoms including a limited fever and rash. In 2007 the virus spread from Africa and Asia into Micronesia, then in 2013 into French Polynesia and then onwards across Pacific regions and into South America. In these new regions, ZIKV has been associated with more severe clinical conditions including Gullain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and congenital Zika syndrome. Using a mouse strain with a deficiency in the type-I interferon receptor (A129), after challenge with ZIKV using a route that resembles the natural route of infection via mosquito bite we compared the two major lineages of ZIKV: African (ZIKAAF) and Asian (ZIKVAS). Whilst it was known that ZIKVAF causes a lethal disease in A129 mice, we observed a non-lethal infection with ZIKVAS. To confirm the finding, a recent isolate of ZIKVAS was additionally assessed and demonstrated the same observations. Our studies provide new insights into the mechanisms of ZIKV infection in a small animal model; and may help to elucidate the different pathologies caused by this virus.
