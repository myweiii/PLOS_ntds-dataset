Infection with the worm Strongyloides stercoralis is common throughout the developing world, and in some resource poor communities living within developed societies, such as the Aboriginal communities of northern Australia. It is generally agreed that reliable diagnosis of this infection is possible by blood tests, and that the medication ivermectin represents the best available treatment, however questions remain over how to best control and eliminate the infection in areas where it is common. Strongyloides infections may be asymptomatic, and may persist indefinitely without the need for re-infection. The worm is transmitted by contact with contaminated soil. Suggested strategies for control have therefore included mass administration of ivermectin in affected areas, and environmental measures to prevent the contamination of soil. In this study we follow up a group of subjects living in an endemic community three years after they were tested and treated for strongyloides infection. We find a persisting low prevalence of infection in this group in the absence of any environmental changes or further treatment, suggesting that control of the infection in this community might be achieved through simple case finding and treatment alone. In addition, we suggest the use of a lower cut-off value for serological testing in these communities, in order to avoid missing cases of infection.
