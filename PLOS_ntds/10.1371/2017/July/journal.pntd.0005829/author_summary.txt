Snakebite envenomation causes medical emergencies that, depending on the species responsible for the bite, involve different organs and tissues. Envenomation by snakebite is a worldwide problem, and Brazil presents a high incidence of Bothrops bites. Bothrops venoms cause pathological alterations with prominent local effects, such as edema, blistering, hemorrhage, dermonecrosis and myonecrosis, usually followed by poor tissue regeneration and permanent sequelae. Bleeding, coagulopathy, cardiovascular shock and renal failure are typical systemic effects of these venoms. The clinical treatment for snakebite envenoming is intravenous administration of the specific antivenom. However, serotherapy does not efficiently protect against local tissue damage. Additional challenges faced by classical antivenom therapy include the wide antigenic variation of venoms across species and even within the same snake species and the frequent occurrence of adverse reactions that are associated with the administration of immunobiologicals. The development of new effective toxin inhibitors based on the structure of natural antiophidic proteins is an attractive therapeutic alternative. DM64 is a myotoxin inhibitor that was isolated from opossum serum, and its expression as a recombinant protein is paramount to the characterization of its structure-function relationship, an essential step toward the development of alternative strategies to better manage bothropic snakebite envenomations.
