Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted to humans primarily through mosquito bites, but there have also been cases of sexual, perinatal, and suspected blood transfusion transmission. It has been associated with fetal malformations and neurological disorders in adults. The rising concern about this pathogen led the World Health Organization to declare it as a public health emergency of international concern regarding neurological disorders. There is an urgent global scientific effort underway to better understand ZIKV biology and define interactions that occur between the virus and the host cell. We evaluated how ZIKV infection counteracts the assembly of dynamic aggregates of RNA and proteins called stress granules (SGs). We observed that ZIKV blocks SG assembly induced by sodium arsenite (Ars), but not by sodium selenite or Pateamine A. We demonstrate that this difference is related to the ability of ZIKV to modulate the dephosphorylation of eIF2Î± via its phosphatase. Our work demonstrates that ZIKV prevents a host stress response in order to maintain a cellular environment propitious for viral replication.
