Infectious diseases threaten the health and well-being of wildlife, livestock and human populations and contribute to significant economic impact in agriculture and medical care. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are enteric protozoan pathogens that cause diarrhea and nutritional disorders on a global level. Using molecular analysis and a review framework we showed that species and genetic variants within genera Cryptosporidium and Giardia (including two species recently infecting humans) found in an island system are not different from other parts of the world. This similarity is likely due to high gene flow of historical and current human activity (travel and trade) and persistence of large host population sizes, such as cattle and people. We also show that, although species and genotypes are widely distributed, new variants will arise when sampling effort increase and their dispersal will be facilitated by human activity. These findings suggest that geographical distribution of species and genotypes within Cryptosporidium and Giardia parasites may yield important clues for designing effective surveillance strategies and identification of factors driving within and cross species transmission.
