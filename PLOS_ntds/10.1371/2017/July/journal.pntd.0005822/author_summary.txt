Rabies is a deadly zoonotic infection with a global distribution. In 2012, an epizootic of skunk rabies established in northern Colorado, USA and spread rapidly through three counties. The epizootic was documented through reports of dead skunks by the public. We examined the reports to determine how rapidly rabies was moving and which factors could explain the patterns of spread. We compared these estimates of spatial movement of rabies to those obtained from analyzing rabies genetic sequences that we obtained from some of the dead skunks reported by the public. By both methods, we found the virus was moving south at a little over 20 km/year and that most transmission between skunks occurred at short distances (< 4 km). Rabies was most likely to spread to new areas during the first half of the year, when skunk populations were producing new offspring. Our genetic model suggested that roads and rivers in the study landscape did not affect movement speed of rabies. We developed a framework that used the spatial data in the public reports to predict where and when skunk rabies would occur next. This framework could be used on public health surveillance data for other diseases or countries.
