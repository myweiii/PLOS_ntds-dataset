There has, perhaps, been undue focus on malaria as a cause of childhood fever and convulsions, often with delayed/missed diagnosis of other serious prevalent infections, and correspondingly very little published data on the contribution of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in endemic areas. There is also very little published data on the contribution of LVD to childhood morbidity and mortality in Nigeria, a large LVD-endemic country that has in circulation 3 of the 4 currently known lineages of the Lassa virus. This study was carried out to address these gaps. The results should also be of relevance in the formulation of policies for the treatment and control of viral haemorrhagic fevers. The prevalence of LVD was 5.4% among children with clinically undifferentiated fever (n = 243); 3.9% among those with convulsions associated with fever (n = 77) and 6.0% among those with fever but no convulsions (n = 166). The results underscore the importance of LVD as a cause of acute undifferentiated fever. The results also underscore the need of diagnostic testing for LVD in children with acute undifferentiated fever in endemic areas in order to facilitate control, including the prevention of nosocomial transmission.
