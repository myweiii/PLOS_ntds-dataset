Helminthiases are highly prevalent neglected tropical diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide, mainly in the poorest regions. The lack of vaccines against these infections is one of the major constraints in the current parasitology and massive efforts are being done in that direction. Herein, we present a potential mechanism for parasite immune evasion consisting in trapping of surface-bound antibodies within the excretory/secretory products that are deposited over the parasite. This mechanism is aided by parasite-derived proteases, well documented virulence factors that degrade the entrapped antibodies. Altogether, this parasite strategy may serve to minimize the antibody-mediated response and promote the development of chronic infections. The present study has been done using the model trematode Echinostoma caproni, though is expected to work in other helminths, even in other groups of extracellular pathogens. This opens new expectative to better understanding of host-parasite interactions and susceptibility to helminth infections. Therefore, the results presented in this manuscript may contribute to the basis of anti-helminth vaccine development.
