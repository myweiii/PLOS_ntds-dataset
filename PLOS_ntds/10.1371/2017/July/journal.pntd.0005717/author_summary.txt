Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected disease caused by a parasite called Echinococcus granulosus. The dog as a definitive host plays a major role in transmitting the infection to human. The study aimed to investigate the clinical burden of human CE in Palestine during the period between 2010 and 2015. Thirteen hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were targeted. CE patients’ records were reviewed. Patients’ samples were collected including cysts following surgery and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks from histopathology departments. Molecular identification of CE species /genotypes was conducted by targeting nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and confirmed by identifying the DNA sequence and comparing it with those in the Genebank. CE cases were spot-mapped and statistically significant foci identified. A total of 353 CE patients were identified in 108 localities in Palestine from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The average surgical incidence in the West Bank was 2.1 per 100,000 with Al-Khalil district reporting the highest incidence in Palestine. This study revealed that E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.), G1 genotype was the main species responsible for CE in humans. There is need for a surveillance system and risk assessment studies in the rural areas as a prerequisite for control measures.
