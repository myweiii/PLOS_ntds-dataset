Schistosomiasis is one of the important neglected tropical diseases endemic in 78 countries throughout the world. The disease is caused by the parasitic worms known as schistosomes. In the Philippines, S. japonicum is the causative agent of the disease. The prevalence of the disease varies in endemic areas, suggesting that the parasite populations might differ in their genetic composition and infectivity to the human host. In this study, DNA samples of adult worms from seven endemic municipalities were analyzed. Characterization of S. japonicum samples in different endemic sites with varying prevalence provides information on the genetic diversity of the parasite. Results of this study showed that samples in high prevalence endemic areas like Irosin, Catarman and Socorro were genetically diverse as compared to other areas. Information on parasite genetic diversity is therefore important in planning disease control strategies. The results suggest ongoing parasite transmission across geographic endemic areas which should be monitored and used as reference for genetic diversity of the schistosomes attributed to geographic areas, thus a safeguarding precaution should be implemented to ensure localized elimination of the disease.
