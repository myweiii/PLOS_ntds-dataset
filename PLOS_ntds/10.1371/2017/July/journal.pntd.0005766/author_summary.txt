Hansen’s neuropathy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The diagnosis of Hansen disease is based on typical skin lesions, nerve enlargement and presence of bacilli in the skin smear. One of the types of leprosy is a pure neuritic type which manifests without skin lesions. High resolution ultrasound is new modality by which the morphology of the peripheral nerves can be studied. Earlier studies have shown that peripheral nerves are thickened in Hansen’s disease and ultrasound is superior in identifying nerve enlargement when compared with clinical palpation. Good correlation exits between nerve enlargement and electrophysiological studies. The current research was to look for a specific pattern of nerve enlargement and we studied patients with Hansen’s ulnar neuropathy. We found an unique pattern of nerve enlargement in which the ulnar nerve enlargement starts at the sulcus and the enlargement is maximum four centimetres above the sulcus and then it tapers. This pattern of unique nerve enlargement can help especially in diagnosing pure neuritic type of Hansen’s disease, in which skin lesions are absent, and is also useful to differentiate leprosy from other neuropathies in which nerve enlargement can occur.
