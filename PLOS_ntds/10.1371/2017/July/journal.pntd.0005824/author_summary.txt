Plasmodium vivax is the most common human malaria parasite in the Americas, but how and when this species arrived in the New World remains unclear. Here we describe high-quality whole-genome sequence data for nine P. vivax isolates from Brazil, a country that accounts for 37% of the malaria burden in this continent, and compare these data with additional publicly available P. vivax genomes from Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. P. vivax populations from the New World were found to be as diverse as their counterparts from areas with substantially higher malaria transmission, such as Southeast Asia, and to carry several non-synonymous substitutions in candidate drug-resistance genes. Moreover, genome-wide patterns of linkage disequilibrium between pairs of polymorphic sites are consistent with very frequent outcrossing in these populations. Interestingly, local P. vivax is more polymorphic, with less between-population differentiation, than sympatric populations of P. falciparum, possibly as a result of different demographic histories of these two species in the Americas. We hypothesize that local P. vivax lineages originated from successive migratory waves and subsequent admixture between parasites from geographically diverse sites.
