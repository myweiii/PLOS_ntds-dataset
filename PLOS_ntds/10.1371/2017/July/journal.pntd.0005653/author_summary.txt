Aedes aegypti (“yellow fever mosquito”) is of great medical concern because it is the primary vector of important viruses causing dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika, as well as increasingly transmitting yellow fever once again. Due to the Zika outbreak, which started in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread with million cases reported in Central/South America and the Caribbean, this mosquito has attained special notoriety. Brazil is by far the most affected country not only by Zika, but also by dengue and chikungunya. Interestingly, in 1950s Brazil had been declared “free of Ae. aegypti” after a well-documented eradication program. However, during the last 45 years Ae. aegypti reappeared in Brazil causing several dengue outbreaks, with millions of reported cases. Here, we used genetic data to study the reappearance of Ae. aegypti in Brazil after the putative eradication event. Our results support re-invasion; mosquitoes from the non-eradicated areas in Venezuela invaded North Brazil, later expanding their distribution southwards. We also identify specific locations in Brazil, as possible entry points. This knowledge can inform strategies to control the spread of the vector and of the diseases it transmits.
