    "Background": "Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe zoonotic disease caused by the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. AE is commonly associated with a long incubation period that may last for more than ten years. The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify and summarize the current knowledge on statistically relevant potential risk factors (PRFs) associated with AE in humans.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Six bibliographic databases were searched, generating a total of 1,009 publications. Following the removal of duplicate records and the exclusion of papers that failed to meet the criteria of a previously agreed a priori protocol, 23 publications were retained; however, 6 of these did not contain data in a format that allowed their inclusion in the meta-analysis. The remaining 17 publications (6 case-control and 11 cross-sectional studies) were meta-analysed to investigate associations between AE and PRFs. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were used as a measure of effect and separately analysed for case-control and cross-sectional studies. In the case-control studies, the following PRFs for human AE showed higher odds of outcome: \u201cdog ownership\u201d, \u201ccat ownership\u201d, \u201chave a kitchen garden\u201d, \u201coccupation: farmer\u201d, \u201chaymaking in meadows not adjacent to water\u201d, \u201cwent to forests for vocational reasons\u201d, \u201cchewed grass\u201d and \u201chunting / handling foxes\u201d. In the cross-sectional studies, the following PRFs showed higher odds of outcome: \u201cdog ownership\u201d, \u201cplay with dogs\u201d, \u201cgender: female\u201d, \u201cage over 20 years\u201d, \u201cethnic group: Tibetan\u201d, \u201clow income\u201d, \u201csource of drinking water other than well or tap\u201d, \u201coccupation: herding\u201d and \u201clow education\u201d. Our meta-analysis confirmed that the chance of AE transmission through ingestion of food and water contaminated with E. multilocularis eggs exists, but showed also that food- and water-borne PRFs do not significantly increase the risk of infection.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "This systematic review analysed international peer-reviewed articles that have over the years contributed to our current understanding of the epidemiology of human AE. The identification of potential risk factors may help researchers and decision makers improve surveillance and/or preventive measures that aim at decreasing human infection with E. multilocularis. More primary studies are needed to confirm potential risk factors and their role in the epidemiology of human AE."
