Liberia experienced a large Ebola outbreak from March 2014 to January 2016. Collection and management of the data on the outbreak were challenging because surveillance and reporting systems malfunctioned at the time. Diagnostic laboratories, however, were able to register important information independently and more systematically. We obtained data on 16,370 laboratory samples during the outbreak. Analyses of the data revealed that there were differences in sex, age, and place of residence between Ebola cases and non-Ebola suspected cases. Young children, the elderly, and patients living in rural areas were more likely to die because of the disease. Our analysis also found a decreasing trend in the case fatality rate of Ebola during the outbreak. These findings may help support future investigations and lead to a fuller understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
