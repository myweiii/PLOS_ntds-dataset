Since the introduction of multidrug therapy for leprosy in the 80â€™s, different classification criteria for leprosy patients have been proposed and treatment has been progressively shortened. Currently, leprosy patients are classified into paucibacillary/PB and multibacillary/MB based on the number of skins lesions. MB patients (over 5 skin lesions) receive three drugs (rifampicin, dapsone, clofazimine) for 12 months, while PB patients (up to 5 skin lesions) receive two drugs (rifampicin, dapsone) for 6 months. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a uniform treatment (U-MDT) for both PB and MB leprosy patients, regardless any classification criteria. The current study includes results from: laboratory tests (bacilloscopic index/BI, serology and histopathology), clinical evaluation during a long follow-up, and uses adequate epidemiological analysis that gives robust evidence on main parameters used to evaluate the efficacy of U-MDT.
This study reports data among MB leprosy patients treated with regular/R-MDT and uniform/U-MDT regarding: (i) The frequency of leprosy reactions; (ii) BI decrease, (iii) Disability progression and (iv) Relapse. Overall, our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in these outcomes for both treatment groups. In this sense, U-MDT can be considered as part of leprosy policy by control programs in endemic countries.
