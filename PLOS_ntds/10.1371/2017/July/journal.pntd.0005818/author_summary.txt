Toxocariasis is a pervasive helminth infection transmitted to humans via embryonated eggs from soil contaminated by the feces of dogs and cats (Toxocara canis and T. cati, respectively). The most recent seroprevalence study of Toxocara infection in the United States used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III data collected from 1988 to 1994. At-risk groups identified included male gender, non-White ethnicity and low education and socioeconomic status. Since the original study, dogs and cats have increased in number and an improved testing platform has been created using rTc-CTL-1 antigen to Toxocara spp. with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 99%, respectively. In this study, we assessed current seroprevalence based on the NHANES data from 2011 to 2014 using the more specific testing platform. Although overall seroprevalence appears to have decreased from 13.9% to 5.1%; persistent disparities remain associated with at-risk populations including minority ethnicity and low socioeconomic status. Continued work is needed to improve awareness of disease transmission and treatment amongst the general population as well as veterinarians who may care for dogs and cats within the United States and take responsibility for education of the public.
