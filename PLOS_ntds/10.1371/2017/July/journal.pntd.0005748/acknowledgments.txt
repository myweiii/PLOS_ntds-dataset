We thank the health workers in Dar es Salaam region who participated in identifying and reporting lymphatic filariasis patients during this study. Without their hard work, the LF morbidity burden would remain unknown. We further are extremely grateful to the LF patients for their willingness to be identified during this study, and hope that the forthcoming services being provided as a result of this information will help to alleviate their conditions.
