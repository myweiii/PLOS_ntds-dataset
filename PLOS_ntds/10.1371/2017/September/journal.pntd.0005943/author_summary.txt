Lassa fever afflicts tens of thousands of people in West Africa each year. The disease progresses rapidly, but there are no tests available to determine which patients are at high risk for dying. We measured the levels of small molecules in the blood of febrile patients with and without infection by LASV that presented to Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone using Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS), which identifies compounds based on their precise mass. Computational analyses were used to identify compounds that differed in patients with an acute LASV infection, patients with evidence of prior exposure to LASV and patients with fever, but who did not have evidence of exposure to LASV. Several serum metabolites, including factors that are involved in blood clotting and breakdown products of heme, were identified that may prove useful in diagnostic assays that will inform better care of Lassa fever patients or development of therapeutic interventions.
