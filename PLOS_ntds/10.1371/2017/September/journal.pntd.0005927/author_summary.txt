Human paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) represents a serious public health issue due to its disabling sequelae in working-age people and mortality rates (8th among chronic infectious parasitic diseases in endemic countries and first among mycoses in Brazil). Although antifungal drugs have been widely used and provide clinical improvement for patients, the long duration of treatments (commonly from 6 to 12 months) has contributed to non-compliance and worsening of the disease in many cases. Induction of protective immune responses (either prophylactic or immune-therapeutic) remains the most cost-effective approach against most infectious agents. Members of our group have previously reported the protective properties of P10, a peptide contained in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis gp43 antigen, against PCM. However, the magnitude of the CD4+ T-cell responses elicited lacked the capacity of completely protecting experimental animals. We demonstrate here that immunogenic virus-like particles (VLP) carrying multiple copies of P10 peptide substantially improve P10-related cellular immunity in mice. This was particularly true when an adenoviral immunization vector expressed the chimeric VLP. Moreover, VLP/P10 formulations were capable of controlling the host fungal burden and prevented fungal systemic dissemination. The efficacy of diverse VLP/P10 formulations in murine PCM showed at least one promising candidate vaccine against human PCM.
