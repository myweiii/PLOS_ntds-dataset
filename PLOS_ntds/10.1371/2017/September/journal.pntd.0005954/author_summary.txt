Aedes aegypti is a competent vector of mosquito-borne diseases and is the primary transmitter of yellow fever, zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses. Through repeated insecticide treatments over the years, many populations of mosquitoes have developed resistance. Pyrethroid resistance is widespread in Aedes aegypti (L.) and has been problematic in Puerto Rico for decades. Using a pyrethroid-susceptible and a pyrethroid-resistant strain of Ae. aegypti, we created dose-response curves for feeding behavior using fabric treated with four distinct but related insecticides. Resistance ratios were calculated by dividing the LD50 values for the resistant strain by the susceptible LD50 values. We also calculated resistance ratios based on topical treatment, since the total amount of insecticides that the mosquitoes were exposed to in the topical assay could be controlled and compared to the blood-feeding assay. Interestingly, the resistance ratios for the blood-feeding were similar for permethrin and etofenprox, but lower than their respective resistance ratios for topical toxicity. Results from these assays showed a shift in the dose-response curves for blood-feeding amongst the susceptible and resistant strains, which indicated higher concentrations of pyrethroid chemicals necessary to deter blood-feeding behavior in the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rican strain of Ae. aegypti.
