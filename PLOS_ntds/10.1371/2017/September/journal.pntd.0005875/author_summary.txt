Diagnosing the different manifestations of Taenia solium (taeniasis and neurocysticercosis in humans, and pig cysticercosis) presents many challenges. The current paper describes the Optimal and Minimal attributes of the diagnostic tests that would be fit for a variety of diagnostic purposes, presented in the form of Target Product Profiles (TPPs). Four TPPs were drafted, distributed for consultation, and the feedback received was consolidated to produce the final versions presented here.
