The absence of effective therapeutics and vaccines for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases and the limited effectiveness of conventional vector control methods renovated the interest for the implementation and integration of the SIT and genetic control methods for successful area-wide integrated mosquito management strategies. These methods involve the release of mass reared insects genetically sterile, incompatible or resistant to pathogen amplification and transmission which need to effectively introduce in the wild target population adequate sterility or the desired genetically selected traits. The availability of easy and standardized quality control tests could facilitate the adoption of international procedures for mosquito strains evaluation and comparison and to assess strain suitability for effective mosquito genetic control applications.
