Anthrax is a deadly zoonosis, predominantly known to affect wild and domestic herbivores. It has long been assumed that the disease is exclusively caused by B. anthracis, but recently another member of the B. cereus group, Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva), was found to carry both B. anthracis virulence plasmids. Bcbva causes anthrax-like disease in wildlife throughout sub-Saharan Africa and was shown to be an important cause of wildlife mortality in Taï National Park, Cote d’Ivoire, affecting a broad range of mammalian species. While mortality data has routinely been collected in the area for decades, it remains unknown whether non-lethal Bcbva exposure occurs. We therefore conducted a serological study in four primate and one duiker species in which Bcbva-related fatalities were previously documented. Frequent non-lethal exposure should result in a high antibody seroprevalence within wildlife populations, while high lethality would result in low antibody seroprevalence. We found that antibody detection rates were low, suggesting that Bcbva infections in these species are likely often lethal.
