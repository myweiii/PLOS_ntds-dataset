Sub-Saharan Africa is plagued by many diseases, which impede its socio-economical development. One of these diseases, Animal African Trypanosomosis, affects livestock and is caused by the parasites of the Trypanosoma genus (T. vivax and T. congolense). Animal African Trypanosomosis leads to considerable economic losses and renders sustainable livestock industry in Sub-Saharan Africa very difficult. In order to proceed with the selective treatment of infected animals, they need to be properly diagnosed. We recently described the use of an assay to specifically detect T. congolense infections in both experimentally and naturally infected animals. The diagnostic assay employs a Nanobody (Nb), which is the smallest antigen-binding unit derived from camelid heavy-chain only antibodies. Our previous results showed that the Nb-based diagnostic test specifically recognizes T. congolense fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, a glycolytic enzyme that is well conserved amongst other Trypanosoma species. In this paper, we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the high specificity of the Nb-based diagnostic assay. The principles derived from this work may be important for the design and improvement of similar diagnostic tests.
