Yellow fever (YF) is a zoonotic disease caused by yellow fever virus (YFV), which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Sylvatic and urban cycles have been present in different periods, but currently most cases result from human exposure to jungle or forested environments. The World Health Organization considers 13 countries endemic for YFV in the Americas. The objective of this study was to identify spatial patterns and the relationship between key geographic and environmental factors with the distribution of YF human cases in the Americas. Cases of YF from 2000 to 2014 aggregated by county and eight geo-environmental factors were studied via spatial and statistical analysis. A total of 1,164 cases were reported in this time period, with the majority of them located in Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Yellow fever presence was associated with rain, altitude, diversity of non-human primate hosts and temperature. A large clustered geographic pattern of YF cases was identified along the Andes eastern foothills. Although YF cases can be seen as rare events, the results of this study demonstrate that YF human cases in the Americas are geographically concentrated and are not happening at random, even within areas known to be at risk. Determining the geo-environmental factors related to YFV is essential to delineate risk areas and to consequently improve resource allocation and prevent human cases.
