Fasciolosis caused by infection with F. hepatica, F. gigantica and their hybrid strains is an important health issue in medical and veterinary sciences. The economic impacts of infection and disease on production animals is of particular concern in low-income rural areas of developing countries, including in Southeast Asia where aquatic rice production plus low-input large ruminant husbandry, provides an ideal habitat for parasite proliferation. Here, we describe the development of a robust approach to ante-mortem diagnosis capable of differentiating between the two Fasciola spp. and their hybrid. Previously, such differentiation was based on identification of flukes collected post-mortem, because eggs of the two species have overlapping morphology. The major novelty is the demonstration that Fasciola spp. eggs, released by adults in the bile ducts, can be effectively and reproducibly broken and the content made available for DNA isolation. Coupled with part of a traditional sedimentation technique, this approach presents a new molecular diagnostic workflow capable of the specific detection of F. hepatica DNA in samples with â‰¤10 eggs per gram of faeces using a real-time PCR TaqMan assay. The presented workflow enables differentiation of F. hepatica and F. gigantica and their hybrid if a duplex TaqMan real-time PCR assay is included. The ability to process medium to large sample sizes in lieu of a continuous cold chain will enable further research into the epidemiology, control and public health concerns associated with Fasciola spp. infection.
