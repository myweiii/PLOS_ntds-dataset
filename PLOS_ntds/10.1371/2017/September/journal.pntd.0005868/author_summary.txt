Leishmaniasis is among the most neglected diseases and remains a challenge for surveillance and control programs. In response to this challenge, the Regional Program for Leishmaniasis (PAHO/WHO), with the support of advisors and representatives from endemic countries, have created a Regional Information System (SisLeish), based on epidemiological and operational indicators, to provide knowledge of the distribution and tendency of this disease to analyze and monitor the leishmaniasis status in the Americas. Since the implementation of SisLeish, there has been an improvement in the adhesion, quality and data completeness and the results show the effort of the majority of the countries to improve their national database in terms of completeness and availability. Furthermore, it has stimulated several programs to advance their surveillance system and program, and has been an alternative for countries that currently do not have a national information system available. SisLeish has become an essential tool to prioritize areas, where the occurrence of leishmaniasis requires additional attention, assist in the decision-making process, and to guide surveillance and control actions. This article analyses the performance and progress of SisLeish from 2012â€“2015.
