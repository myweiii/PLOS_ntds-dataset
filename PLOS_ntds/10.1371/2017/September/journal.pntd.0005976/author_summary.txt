The biological nature of the midgut escape barrier in insects for arthropod-borne viruses has been a mystery for decades. Here we show that the basal lamina (BL) surrounding the mosquito midgut acts as a barrier for chikungunya virus, an alphavirus, which has emerged in the New World hemisphere around three years ago. The barrier became permissive for the virus during digestion of a viremic bloodmeal inside the midgut lumen. Concurrent with BL permissiveness, we observed that collagen IV, a major component of the BL became temporally degraded while the BL was visibly damaged. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinases such as Ae. aegypti (Ae)MMP1 may be involved in BL degradation. We confirmed that recombinant AeMMP1 exhibited strong gelatinase activity, which was profoundly reduced when recombinant AeMMP1 interacted in vitro with the recombinant Ae. aegypti tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (AeTIMP). When transgenically overexpressing AeTIMP in an attempt to temporally inhibit general MMP activity in the mosquito midgut, we observed that the dissemination efficiency of chikungunya virus became significantly increased, while its midgut infection was not affected. It is possible that AeTIMP overexpression affected BL degradation/restoration permitting increased quantities of virus to escape from the midgut.
