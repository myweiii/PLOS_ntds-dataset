We conducted a prospective study of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Puerto Rico to better understand the etiology of AFI among all age groups in the tropics. Such findings could assist clinicians to identify disease-specific characteristics, which can then be used to initiate proper patient management. We enrolled 8,996 AFI patients and tested them for dengue viruses 1–4 (DENV 1–4) and 21 other pathogens. A pathogen was detected in 55% of patients, most frequently chikungunya virus (CHIKV, 18%), influenza A or B virus (FLU A/B, 12%), DENV 1–4 (11%), or another respiratory virus (ORV, 10%). Participants with dengue presented later after symptom onset and were hospitalized more often (47%) than patients with another etiology of AFI (27% with ORV, 19% with FLU A/B, and 11% with CHIKV). Predictors of patients with dengue differed by timing of presentation but included eye pain, nausea, and low white blood cell or platelet counts; negative predictors included symptoms of respiratory illness. By enrolling febrile patients at clinical presentation, we identified unbiased predictors of patients with dengue as compared to other common AFI. Findings can be used to diagnose dengue patients to provide early and appropriate clinical management.
