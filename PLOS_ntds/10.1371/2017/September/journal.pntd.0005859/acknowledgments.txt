We thank Saint Luke’s Episcopal Hospital patients for their participation in this study. We would like to thank physicians, nurses, clinical laboratory staff and administrative personnel at the Saint Luke’s Episcopal Hospitals in Ponce and Guayama for their assistance to recruiting potential participants and implementing study procedures. In addition, we would like to acknowledge the medical management information offices from Saint Luke’s Episcopal Hospitals for facilitating the review of medical records for admitted participants. We would also like to thank Dr. Brad Biggerstaff from the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases for his critical review of the data analysis and manuscript. In addition, we would like to thank CDC staff members at the Dengue Branch, Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, and Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch (Zoonoses and Select Agent Laboratory) for processing and testing of all clinical specimens. Last, we would like to acknowledge the technical support of Ponce Health Sciences University. Without their interest in and support of this project, the SEDSS sites would have never been established and this study would never have been possible.
