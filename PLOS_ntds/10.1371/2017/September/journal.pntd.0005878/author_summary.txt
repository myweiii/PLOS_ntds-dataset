Little is known about the strains of the Chagas parasite circulating in Central America. This parasite is responsible for the most serious parasitic disease in Latin America and is presently divided into seven different strains. In Central America, the Chagas parasite is spread mainly by one species of kissing bug but what strains are present in this species was largely unknown. We investigated which strains of the parasite are present in this species of kissing bug by examining the DNA extracted from the abdomens of kissing bugs collected across its geographic range. We matched the DNA sequence we obtained with what is available in databases to determine the strain. We found mostly strain TcI (94%) and less of strain TcIV (6%). As particular strains are associated with particular habitats, hosts, and disease symptoms, this work will help us understand why particular symptoms occur in particular areas and help us to target control efforts more efficiently.
