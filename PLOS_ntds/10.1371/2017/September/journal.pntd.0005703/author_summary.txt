The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) uses point-of-care tests for circulating filarial antigenemia to map endemic areas and for monitoring and evaluating the success of mass drug administration (MDA) programs. We compared the performance of the reference BinaxNOW Filariasis card test (ICT) with the Alere Filariasis Test Strip (FTS, introduced in 2013) in 3,682 people in 5 endemic study sites in Africa. Our study confirmed the increased sensitivity of FTS reported in prior studies. FTS/ICT ratios tended to be higher in areas with low residual endemicity after MDA. However, FTS rates were only slightly higher than ICT rates in young children. These results suggest that FTS should be superior to ICT as a tool for mapping and for monitoring and evaluating LF elimination programmes.
