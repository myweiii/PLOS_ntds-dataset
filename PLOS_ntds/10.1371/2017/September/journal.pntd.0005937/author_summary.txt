Schistosomiasis constitutes a major public health problem in Tanzania, with up to 80% prevalence of infection in some areas. Infection with the disease causes abdominal pain, diarrhoea, stunted growth and impaired cognitive abilities in children. Accurate information on the distribution of schistosomiasis within Tanzania is not available for most rural areas. To establish the prevalence of the intestinal form of the disease among communities residing along the shores of Lake Tanganyika, we quantified the presence of the causal agent (Schistosoma mansoni) by searching for their eggs in faecal samples. Children were actively sampled from schools but adult sampling relied on volunteers, so the data from the two age groups were analysed separately. The number of positive samples was high in both but significant differences in prevalence and intensity were found between the sampled villages only for the children. Statistical models accounting for false negative stool samples indicated that the apparent prevalence was a gross under-estimate of the true prevalence of infection. Our results emphasise the importance of considering the type of sampling when assessing risk factors associated with parasitic disease. The information obtained from this study will help to guide the optimal distribution of schistosomiasis control resources in the region, such as through targeted allocation of drugs and personnel to those areas with higher estimated prevalence.
