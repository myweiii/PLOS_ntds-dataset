We like to thank all medical and para-medical staff in the local health authorities throughout Bavaria for their continuous support and cooperative understanding of our laboratory and epidemiological work. We are also grateful to Cecilia Hizo-Teufel and Christine Hartberger for excellent technical support in the laboratory.
