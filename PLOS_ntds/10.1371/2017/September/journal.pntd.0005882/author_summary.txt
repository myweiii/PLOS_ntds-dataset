The most prevalent parasite infection in Latin America causes Chagas’ disease. Diagnosis is based on serologic tests because direct detection of T. cruzi is very difficult beyond its brief acute phase. The complexity of this parasite’s pathophysiology and the human immune system’s elaborate engagement with it makes current indirect diagnosis methods suboptimal. We applied the ImmunoSignature Technology to Chagas diagnosis. In addition to approximating the accuracy of current tests, a single IST test simultaneously distinguished four blood panel diseases, including Chagas. Other unique aspects include the demonstrated ability to identify subclasses within seropositive individuals. Unlike other tests, IST uses chemically-diverse peptides, not proteomic sequences, as antibody-capture ligands to identify antibody binding patterns that differ between health-states. Some of the Chagas-distinguishing ligands were enriched in sequence motifs that aligned to known T. cruzi epitopes; unmapped sequences suggest additional targets exist. While IST is also an indirect method, it holds greater capacity for delivering high-resolution serologic feedback. Relative to providing this test to the millions of individuals estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, IST is both highly scalable and reproducible.
