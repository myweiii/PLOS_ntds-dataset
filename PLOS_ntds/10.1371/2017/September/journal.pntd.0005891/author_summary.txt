Cellular signaling by the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP is ubiquitously found in organisms from human to unicellular parasites. Cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are pivotal regulators of these signaling processes and these enzymes represent important drug targets for a variety of diseases. Eleven PDE families are distinguished in humans and selective inhibition of a single human PDE family without targeting others is feasible. In parasites, interference in the signaling mechanism by PDE inhibition may be fatal. The diarrhea-causing parasite Giardia lamblia contains only one single PDE, named GlPDE. GlPDE activity is highly impaired by a range of PDE inhibitors, which also suppress parasite proliferation in vitro. Thus, there is a good agreement between PDE inhibition and parasite drug susceptibility. We demonstrate molecular differences between human PDEs and GlPDE that can be exploited for the development of GlPDE-selective inhibitors. Finally, our data may suggest localization of GlPDE to mitosome organelles, which are absent in human cells and thus are in the focus as possible targets for the treatment of giardiasis. This may add to the notion that GlPDE represents a potential target for the development of novel anti-giardial drugs.
