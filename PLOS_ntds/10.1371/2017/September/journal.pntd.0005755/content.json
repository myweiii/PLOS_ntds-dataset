    "Introduction": "Dengue fever (DF) remains the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world and it has caused more human morbidity and mortality than any other arbo-viral infection [1,2]. It currently infects 390 million people each year [3]. Dengue fever has presented an acutely difficult and progressive public health challenge in Latin America, as it has increased in prevalence, severity and spread throughout the region [4,5]. In Peru, over half the population live in areas at risk of the disease since it re-emerged in 1984 after 30 years of successful vector eradication [6]. This re-emergence has been attributed to: rapid growth and migration of urban populations, and limited resources directed towards dengue control [6]. Climate change, extreme poverty and poor water supply leading to household water storage have further compounded these effects by increasing the habitation sites of the mosquito, which now populates 17 of the 25 departments in Peru [6].\nDengue viruses are transmitted by female mosquitoes of the Aedes genus which are wide-spread in tropics and sub-tropics [7, 8, 9]. Dengue has been a particular health threat to children living in endemic areas [10] since young children are particularly susceptible to dengue haemorrhagic fever [1,11]. Ninety percent of cases of DHF occur in infants under 5 years of age, where there is a 2.5% risk of fatality [12]. The situation regarding a vaccine against dengue remains complex. Although a vaccine has undergone Phase III clinical trials and is recommended for use in endemic areas, it is not registered for use in young children [13]. Since no effective anti-viral treatment exists globally, and no vaccine is currently available in Peru, mosquito control is the foundation of dengue prevention nationwide [4,14]. Control strategies against the Aedes aegypti vector may also have the combined effect of enhancing protection from other diseases transmitted by the mosquitoes, such as zika and chikungunya. In dengue-endemic countries, control focuses on community and household mosquito eradication strategies. In the Peruvian Amazon, the city of Iquitos is endemic for DF and experiences frequent outbreaks [15]. The inaccessibility of drinking water in homes leads to the use of water storage containers [16], which provide a breeding site for the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In Iquitos, health promotion messages are broadcasted via radio, television and roadside billboards. These predominantly focus on symptom recognition and household eradication of breeding sites through cleaning the house and care or removal of containers that collect water (buckets, tubs, tyres for example) [17]. The local health authority further streamlines control strategies through case-by-case fumigation, larvicide water treatments, home inspections and community education [6].\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, dengue control needs improvement to alleviate its significant burden of disease to endemic countries [18]. Further research is required to target dengue control in areas at risk. To date, few qualitative studies have explored perceptions and experiences around dengue control worldwide, but these have identified certain issues such as misconceptions, confusion with other febrile diseases, the \u201cinvisibility\u201d of dengue and lack of responsibility in control methods [19\u201325]. In Iquitos, dengue-related research has concentrated on studies of epidemiology and entomology [26\u201328]. A recent survey evaluated community knowledge and practices [29], highlighting the misconception that Aedes aegypti bite during the night-time and the subsequent incorrect use of mosquito bed nets. Although informative, the nature of the survey did not allow researchers to explore in depth why misunderstandings exist or how preventative practices are influenced by perceptions. A recent qualitative study performed in Northern Peru and one Peruvian focus group study included within a WHO report found that people may consider vector control to be a lot of work, with reservations about the efficacy of interventions. [17, 30] However, as far as the authors are aware, there have been no other published qualitative studies in Peru which have explored this topic [31], highlighting an important gap in the knowledge base, particularly in this region [32,33].\nThis novel qualitative study sought to better understand the interrelated social and individual factors that determine perceptions, experiences and practices of dengue control, in caregivers of children under 5 years (a term which describes biological parents, step/foster/adoptive parents, wider family members and will be used from this point forward) to an at-risk group. Further understanding of caregivers\u2019 thoughts and actions around DF can help to inform and direct future mosquito control programmes and strategy in the Peruvian Amazon.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nEthical approval was gained from the University of Birmingham Internal Ethics Review Committee (Ref: 2015-6/C1/DK/11) and the Institutional Ethics Committee of Research at the Department of Health, Loreto (Constancia No: 001-CIEI-DRSL-2016).\n\n\nSetting\nThis pragmatic exploratory study was undertaken in the San Juan health centre in Iquitos, north-eastern Peru. The health centre serves 32,848 people in the southern district of the city and offers free state-funded health consultations under the Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS) system for those who qualify as either \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019. Residents who do not qualify for support are still able to access the health centre but a fee is incurred.\n\n\nSampling\nThe power of a purposive sample lies in the intentional selection of participants defined as \u2018information-rich\u2019 [34]. This embraces the importance of individual views to best answer a research question concerning personal perceptions and practices [34]. Participants were purposively selected based on the following eligibility criteria: (i) caregiver to a child under 5 years of age, (ii) aged over 18 years and (iii) living in Iquitos. Following each interview, participant demographics were entered into a database to facilitate exploration of which characteristics (differing in age, gender, level of education and dengue experience) were missing from the sample. Cases with these characteristics were then purposively sought to ensure a maximum variation sample [35].\n\n\nRecruitment\nRecruitment was undertaken during the \u2018wet season\u2019 in February 2016, where the Aedes aegypti vector may be more abundant due to higher levels of rainfall [36]. Eligible participants were identified by clinicians and they were then approached by lead author (AF) with support from an interpreter who explained the study and provided participant information sheets. The reason for participant attendance at the health centre was not recorded. It was made clear that participation was voluntary and would not affect the care participants received at the health centre.\n\n\nData collection\nSemi-structured interviews followed a topic guide developed using existing, albeit limited, literature [19\u201325] and discussion within the research team (S1 Topic Guide). The first two interviews were deemed pilots, due to difficulties with the topic guide and translational discrepancies. After this, the topic guide was revised and translation difficulties addressed before the final eighteen interviews. An iterative process allowed inclusion of novel ideas, until no new concepts were presented and data saturation was achieved [37].\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using real-time interpretation [38] between the researcher, interpreter and participant. Two interpreters were used throughout the data collection; the first interpreter was present for five interviews and the second present for 15. Both interpreters were English language students at the university in Iquitos, with experience interpreting in clinical environments. Although acknowledged that use of one interpreter is preferable, efforts were made to ensure the similarity between interviews by briefing the second interpreter on the issues arisen from the pilot interviews and thoroughly practising interview questions.\nInformed written consent was obtained before each interview which took place in a private room in the health centre. Interviews were audio-recorded and field notes taken. The spoken Spanish was transcribed into English by the researcher and a translator who had experience translating medical projects. Cultural context and the meaning behind colloquialisms were discussed with the researcher to support analysis. A translation lexicon was developed to establish conceptual equivalence [39]. An independent translator reviewed a random sample of two transcripts to assess the quality of translation. Minimal discrepancies between translations were noted, thus no changes were made.\n\n\nData analysis\nData were analysed using Braun and Clarke\u2019s [40] inductive thematic analysis method to identify and interpret themes. An iterative approach was employed, where a constant comparison method ensured data analysis was undertaken in parallel with data collection [41]. Immersion in the data was ensured through repeated reading and familiarisation of the transcripts. Initial codes and themes were generated and a coding rationale produced, with support of NVivo software. Thematic mind maps were developed and themes reviewed using quotes from the text and interviews as a whole.\nTo improve the credibility of analysis, five of the most data rich transcripts were independently coded by a second analyst (EB). Differences and similarities were evaluated and additional interpretations incorporated into the coding framework. Themes were discussed between the analysts and further reviewed by the research team (LJ, GW) which sought to enrich interpretations and reduce bias presented by a single analyst [42]. A reflexive approach to analysis was employed, where notes were made throughout the analytical process to acknowledge the potential impact of research bias [43]. Continued communication between the lead author (AF) and Peruvian clinicians (GMS) clarified cultural misunderstandings and minimised the risk of cross-cultural bias in interpretation and analysis [39].",
    "Results": "Participants\nEighteen interviews formed the final analysis dataset, of which equal numbers were male and female. The average age of the sample was 32 years (range 21 to 56 years). Seven participants reported having suffered DF themselves. A demographic summary of the participants is presented in Table 1. The average length of interviews was 36 minutes (range 24\u201351 minutes).\n\n\nFindings\nThree core analytic themes and eight subthemes (Fig 1) were interpreted within the data: (1) awareness of dengue and its control, (2) perceived susceptibility of children, rural riverside communities and city inhabitants and (3) perceived responsibility of vector control.\n\n\nAwareness of dengue and its control\nEffect of knowledge.All participants had some knowledge about DF as a disease and the ways it can be prevented. Knowledge surrounding general symptoms and mode of transmission was high; all recognised the importance of a persistent \u201cfever\u201d. \u201cHeadache\u201d was the next most commonly recognised symptom, then \u201cbody pain\u201d, \u201cbleeding\u201d, \u201cchills\u201d, \u201cbone pain\u201d and \u201crash\u201d respectively. Likewise, all participants knew that the disease was transmitted \u201cby the bite of a mosquito\u201d and some were aware of the process of transmission [P5, P15, P17, P19].\n\u201cThe transmission of a zancudo* is that it bites an infected person and transfers this to another person.\u201d\n[P5]\n[*Zancudo is a regional Peruvian name for a type of mosquito which transmits diseases.]\n\nDespite correct knowledge about mosquito transmission, two participants had misconceptions about other ways that the disease can be spread. One participant suggested \u201cbabies can get the disease through breast milk\u201d, [P18] whilst another suggested that it can arise through drinking \u201cdirty water.\u201d [P17]\nIn terms of effective preventative practices against Dengue, knowledge that focused on removal of mosquito breeding sites was high. The majority of participants recalled the importance of avoiding stagnant water in their homes and backyards through effective cleaning and water container care (all except P8, P15, P16).\n\u201cWe are very careful with the water containers\u2026 to throw them away, because there can\u2019t be any stagnant water because that is where they breed.\u201d\n[P14]\n\nOthers mentioned the use of larvicide provided by health professionals [P3, P5, P6] and household repellent sprays [P4, P6, P17, P20]. Three participants reported wearing \u201clong clothes\u201d as protection [P3, P14, P18]. One participant deviated from the majority and reported: \u201cI try to keep my home not too dark.\u201d [P16]\nHowever, mosquito biting habits were identified as an error in knowledge in almost all interviews. Only one participant correctly identified that dengue transmitting mosquitoes bite \u201cduring the daytime\u201d [P15]. Many participants specifically identified that these mosquitoes attacked \u201cduring the night\u201d [P4, P5, P6, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P17] whist other participants were uncertain [P3, P7, P8, P14, P16, P18, P19, P20]. One participant understood that health centre staff had told them so: \u201cmost of the time, they [health personnel] tell us that zancudos bite us at night. From 5pm, yeah I\u2019m sure of this.\u201d [P11]\nIncorrect knowledge appeared to directly affect the way people attempted to protect themselves against mosquitoes. When informed about the actual biting habits, one participant revealed: \u201cI was doing the wrong thing\u2026 because I protect more against mosquitoes in the night rather than in the day.\u201d [P13] In this way, most participants stressed the importance of using mosquito nets at night, some as their primary home protection strategy against Dengue [P8, P12]. Interestingly, the only participant who knew about day-time transmission, also emphasised the need for mosquito nets at night. This demonstrated that even with knowledge of day-time transmission, participants still mistakenly viewed mosquito net use at night as effective prevention behavior:\n\u201cWhat I know about dengue is that it is a virus (\u2026) that you catch through zancudos, (\u2026) and for that reason you have to use a mosquito net.\u201d\n[P15]\n\nThese findings may be explained by the direct conflation (merging of pieces of information) of dengue fever and other diseases such as malaria, which multiple participants demonstrated: \u201cmy son now has Malaria\u2026 or Dengue, I don\u2019t know which one!\u201d [P8] Often participants could not differentiate between the two diseases in terms of name, symptoms and were unaware that dengue and malaria were transmitted by different mosquitoes with different biting habits.\n\u201cAre Dengue and Malaria the same?\u201d\n[P15]\n\nThis conflation demonstrates knowledge inaccuracies associated with Dengue. These participants sought clarification from the interviewer, which highlighted both their lack of knowledge and confidence in the knowledge they possessed.\n\nEffect of experience.Often awareness and knowledge about dengue was influenced through direct (i.e. personal) or indirect (i.e. family member or close friend) experience with the disease. Most participants had either direct or indirect experience and were able to recall the signs and symptoms with greater clarity than those who had no experience with the disease.\nSeven participants had personally experienced DF (Table 1). Personal experience influenced individual attitude and behaviour towards the disease in two ways. Firstly, it alerted participants to the true severity of the disease: \u201cit\u2019s not the same when you have a poster stuck on the wall with the symptoms of dengue, as having dengue yourself.\u201d [P8] Secondly, it increased interest and participation in preventative practices, through fear of contracting the disease again:\n\u201cSince I have had the disease myself, always and every day I have to clean well, so that my baby can sleep well. I try to stop this disease from happening to me again.\u201d\n[P4]\n\nLikewise, some participants described how dengue experience affected the knowledge, attitudes and interest of other community members. They suggested that the true impact of the disease is better understood when people experience dengue in their families or close friends:\n\u201cWhen they have dengue, they start worrying about it. Or maybe when a member of their family has dengue, they see that they are ill and what the symptoms are and they start worrying about it by caring for themselves (\u2026) whilst normally, they wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n[P3]\n\n\n\n\nPerceived susceptibility of children, rural riverside communities, city inhabitants\nChildren.The majority of participants highlighted children as a group that were perceived to be most susceptible to DF. Participants offered different explanations to support this view. Some identified the inability of young children to articulate their symptoms as a factor making them more vulnerable to this disease [P4, P9, P10, P11, P14, P20]:\n\u201cChildren (\u2026) are more exposed than an adult (\u2026) they cannot talk, they can\u2019t tell us what is happening to them, what is hurting.\u201d\n[P11]\n\nOthers suggested that the physical weakness of children influenced their susceptibility [P6, P8, P9, P12]: \u201ca baby\u2019s body does not have as much resistance as an adult\u2019s.\u201d [P12]\nTwo participants explained the vulnerability of children by describing their inability to protect themselves without parental support [P3, P15]:\n\u201cIt is more likely that zancudos bite them [children] because they can\u2019t protect themselves if we don\u2019t do anything for them.\u201d\n[P3]\n\nFor that reason, there was a strong element of parental concern highlighted, where child protection was identified as a priority for most. One participant in particular stressed the importance of dengue control in order to \u201csave our lives and the lives of our children.\u201d [P14] Concern was further illustrated through acknowledgement of the potentially fatal nature of DF. This was addressed as a key motivating factor to improve protection:\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take care, we could lose a son or a child.\u201d\n[P14]\n\n\nRural riverside communities.Multiple participants stressed the perceived greater risk of DF in communities living outside the city in the rural rainforest, referring to it as the \u2018jungle\u2019 [P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P14, P18, P20]. Participants showed concern for these people and saw them as a susceptible group of society in the Amazon.\n\u201cThe people that have trouble to recover quickly are those that live in the jungle communities. They are the most vulnerable to catch dengue.\u201d\n[P5]\n\nSome participants spent time working or visiting the rural rainforest, and expressed concern that the people lived there \u201cwithout protection\u201d [P14] due to a perceived higher risk of illness and lack of preventative practices. The vulnerability of rural communities was explored by some through their lack of access to health care services, in contrast to the free and accessible treatment available in the city [P6, P8, P14, P18, P20]:\n\u201cThe people in [jungle] communities cure with home remedies using medicinal plants, but it doesn\u2019t work very well. When it is [a] strong [disease], imagine coming to Iquitos from there! Some people die coming here.\u201d\n[P9]\n\nThese participants emphasised the significance and danger of living far from health services during an outbreak of dengue. The susceptibility of the rural riverside communities was further acknowledged by one participant who described a sense of \u2018rural abandonment\u2019: \u201cThere, in the rural zones, they are abandoned. Here in the city? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d [P18] This indicated the lack of attention and resources that people felt were directed towards rural communities.\nOne participant associated poverty as a factor worsening the susceptibility of rural riverside communities, since poor finances directly affected peoples\u2019 access to health services [P18]:\n\u201cThere [rural riverside communities] the people are poor, well not too poor\u2026 they just don\u2019t have a lot. For example, someone comes to Iquitos and is bringing their child\u2026 they have to come to Iquitos from there to cure them from the disease. You know they don\u2019t have family here, the transport costs and the hotel is going to cost, food costs as well (\u2026) This is a big problem for them.\u201d\n[P18]\n\n\nCity population.Generally, participants in the study felt more protected than other groups such as rural riverside communities and children. However, the majority still acknowledged feeling susceptible to dengue due to the perceived inevitability of the disease.\nParticipants felt susceptible to disease since mosquitoes were perceived to be an invisible threat and thus mosquito bites unavoidable [P6, P8, P9, P10, P11]:\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when the mosquito bites you. For example, right now, a mosquito could bite me and I wouldn\u2019t know if I had Dengue or not.\u201d\n[P6]\n\nFurthermore, the perceived ineffectiveness of preventative practices emphasised the vulnerability that people felt living in Iquitos. One participant voiced: \u201cwe feel protected, but we are not.\u201d [P5] Many demonstrated this through the belief that dengue could not be prevented through individual actions alone [P5, P8, P9, P13, P16, P19]. Household prevention seemed futile:\n\u201cAs much as you clean your house, the mosquitoes still come in (\u2026) as much as you sleep with a mosquito net, you still notice the bite of mosquitoes on your skin (\u2026) sometimes it is out of our hands to control this!\u201d\n[P5]\n\nIn particular, many believed household cleaning [P5, P8], long clothing [P5], garbage collection [P7, P19, P13] and mosquito repellent [P8] was ineffective: \u201cyou can\u2019t prevent that they bite you. I use repellent. And when you sweat, you are unprotected.\u201d [P8] Most participants believed fumigation was an unsuccessful strategy [P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, P13, P17, P19] and some participants attributed this to using a weak poison [P3, P5, P9, P11], or making the \u201cmosquitoes stronger.\u201d [P7]\nAdditionally, participants mentioned the location of Iquitos in Amazon rainforest as a factor influencing DF. Multiple participants were aware that the climate and heavy rainfall were key in enabling mosquito breeding [P6, P8, P9, P12, P13, P14, P15, P17, P18]. This left participants feeling powerless to prevent the disease: \u201cAs we are in the rural riverside, this problem never ends.\u201d [P15]\n\n\n\nPerceived responsibility of vector control\nThe overarching theme of responsibility runs through each narrative and exists in three interlinked but separate dimensions: (i) external responsibility, (ii) community responsibility, (iii) personal responsibility.\nExternal responsibility.The majority of participants believed that the responsibility of dengue prevention lay with external bodies. Some directly acknowledged the government [P14, P20], the health centre [P3, P15, P17] or both [P3, P11, P12, P13] as principally responsible. Others implied more subtly: \u201cI think that health personnel need to look for other ways to solve this problem.\u201d [P8] The same participant further demonstrated this belief by illustrating frustration and lack of confidence in the authorities.\n\u201cThe government plays an important role to prevent it. Maybe the government can give us the health, but they don\u2019t. (\u2026) I wouldn\u2019t be worried about this problem in Iquitos, if the government showed people proper attention.\u201d\n[P8]\n\nIn the same way, an undertone of dependence on the health centre was demonstrated in all interviews. The majority highly valued and relied upon the services provided. Most believed that it was the duty of the health centre to provide both protection and treatment against dengue:\n\u201cHere in Iquitos, people need the health personnel to remind them what to do all the time, because this disease is dangerous.\u201d\n[P19]\n\nFor other participants, the perception of external responsibility was echoed through their reliance on dengue control services provided by the health centre. For instance, most participants expressed a preference for passively receiving information, rather than actively seeking it. One participant directly acknowledged this by emphasising the duty of the researcher to provide knowledge about preventative practices: \u201cit\u2019s difficult for some people to protect themselves, if you don\u2019t give knowledge or teach them.\u201d [P20]\nIn Iquitos, this manifested as a preference for personal home visits by community health workers known colloquially as \u201ccharlas\u201d [P3, P9, P10, P11, P16]. These incorporated home inspections for potential mosquito breeding sites and face to face information about dengue:\n\u201cThe best method is, is receiving \u201ccharlas\u201d (\u2026) a \u201ccharla\u201d explains in detail what the announcements don\u2019t tell you. Yeah, you can get all the information in a \u201ccharla.\u201d\n[P11]\n\nAn additional dengue control service which many participants relied upon was health authority initiated fumigation: \u201cthe most important thing is the fumigation that the regional government do and the authorities.\u201d [P15] Regardless of its perceived efficacy, fumigation was advocated by many [P5, P7, P11, P12, P15, P20]. Some participants questioned its effectiveness but still expressed a need for the practice with \u2018stronger poisons\u2019 [P5] or increased frequency [P20]. All participants advocating its use, suggested that fumigation was essential to control the dengue endemic and this further illustrated the belief in external responsibility.\n\u201cI think that they [health personnel] should go to fumigate houses. I think, in that way, we can stop Dengue 100%.\u201d\n[P7]\n\n\nCommunity responsibility.The majority of participants acknowledged the role of the community as important in dengue prevention. However, this was expressed as a frustration with the lack of community participation in Iquitos. Two participants directly identified the community as principally responsible for dengue prevention [P7, P20]. Many others highlighted an absence of community responsibility through the belief that \u201cthere is not much collaboration from people.\u201d [P19]\nAmongst participants\u2019 views, the lack of community \u201ccollaboration\u201d took two forms: (i) a lack of concerted effort against mosquito breeding sites and (ii) lack of cooperation with health authorities. The first was described by participants through perceived lack of community adherence to routine larvae surveillance (water container care and larvicide use) and frequent domestic waste build up on the streets: \u201csome people don\u2019t put their garbage out at the time indicated, and zancudos use these places.\u201d [P7] The second aspect to the community problem involved direct inhibition of prevention practices provided by the health centre and was expressed by multiple participants [P3, P4, P7, P17, P19]. \u201cSome people don\u2019t allow the health personnel to go into their houses\u201d, [P17] for the purpose of community fumigation, household surveillance or delivery of larvicide and dengue control information.\nParticipants inferred that there was a community-wide lack of interest and responsibility towards dengue control which worsened the issue. Multiple participants expressed views that other people \u201cdon\u2019t feel interested in it\u201d [P6] or \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d [P3] A further explanation for the lack of community cooperation can be inferred by a perception of community inaction. Many believed that only a small number of community members participated in prevention practices, which acted as a deterrent for other households. Individual household prevention seemed futile if not reciprocated by the entire neighbourhood:\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if each family doesn\u2019t clean the water containers properly and maybe your next door neighbour doesn\u2019t do the same as you do and so on, and that can increase Dengue.\u201d\n[P7]\n\nOne participant directly acknowledged a solution: \u201cwe need people to collaborate together against this disease.\u201d [P19] Suggestions were made that the community required \u201cmotivation\u201d [P11] to act, in the form of \u201cincentives.\u201d [P19] This same participant suggested providing treated water, rubbish containers or a community information \u2018office\u2019 [P19].\n\nPersonal responsibility.Some participants acknowledged the importance of personal responsibility in dengue prevention. For some, this was expressed as the solitary, most important responsibility [P4, P16, P19]: \u201cthe responsibility is with your own self.\u201d [P4] For others, it was identified as both the responsibility of government or health centre in addition to each individual family [P3, P14, P15, P20].\nSome participants expressed the idea through a desire, as caregivers to children under 5 years, to protect themselves and their families from dengue:\n\u201cI want to protect my family (\u2026) I am not going to wait for the government to go to my house.\u201d\n[P16]\n\nFor some participants, personal responsibility was shown by an emphasis on family protection: \u201cwho wants to lose someone who you love so much? For that reason, I had to be more careful with them.\u201d [P19] Additionally, another participant related their reliance on personal responsibility to be due to the failings of the community: \u201cthe community doesn\u2019t do anything when you get ill with dengue, because the responsibility is with your own self.\u201d [P4] This feeling was reflected by other participants, who did not feel responsible for anyone other than their own family:\n\u201cThe results are for me and not for all my neighbours\u2026 because it\u2019s for my own protection, for myself and my family.\u201d\n[P15]",
    "Discussion": "This pragmatic qualitative study explored the perceptions of the control of dengue fever with 18 Peruvian Amazon caregivers to children under 5 years. Findings highlighted the importance of these perceptions in shaping individual preventative practice in a community. Key findings include the impact of misconceptions around dengue transmission and the importance of attitude within a community for effective preventative practice.\nThis study found that participants had good basic knowledge of DF symptoms, transmission and eradication of mosquito larvae as preventative practices. In Iquitos, a recent survey found that 65% of people knew someone who had experienced dengue [29]. The current study builds upon this evidence by suggesting explanations for this basic knowledge acquisition such that experience of the disease, information distributed by media campaigns and the existing community health worker system may have influenced and improved knowledge. However, most participants were unaware that dengue mosquitoes bit during the day, which agrees with research by Paz-Soldan et al. that identified only 18.6% of respondents recognised the Aedes aegypti as a day-biting mosquito and most chose mosquito nets use at night as their main protective practice [29]. The present study further explored the link between these misunderstandings and seeks to partly explain this through a conflation of the information regarding dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, whereby people seem to see these diseases as one combined arbo-viral infection. Perhaps, previous dengue control messages in Iquitos have not provided sufficient information differentiating the two mosquitoes and subsequent diseases. Thus many participants may have perceived malaria and dengue as indifferent, which may have effected their preventative practices. For instance, although effective against malaria prevention, the WHO does not advocate bed nets to prevent dengue fever unless individuals sleep during the day [44]. Thus the specific misconception that mosquitoes transmitting dengue are night-biters directly hindered peoples\u2019 abilities to protect themselves at the correct time.\nThis study can help to inform health education strategies to be directed towards individuals and communities to build upon basic knowledge, to target misconceptions and make recommendations for successful day-time protection from mosquitoes (such as using household fumigation and insect repellent). Perhaps, health promotion materials need to place more emphasis on distinguishing between dengue and malaria and the biting habits of their associated vectors to better educate and ultimately help the population to protect the themselves. Regular appraisal of the success of these strategies is required to identify and address future misunderstandings. Findings also recommend an evaluation to appraise how the community health worker system influences knowledge and preventative practice.\nFurthermore, study findings implied that a hierarchy of risk was perceived by participants. Children and rural riverside communities were felt to be the most vulnerable to DF. A perception and subsequent desire to protect children was echoed in the participants\u2019 responses. It should be acknowledged that these views may be specific to caregivers of children under 5 years, the target group of the study, as reported beliefs could have been affected by social desirability [45]. Dengue control campaigns may wish to target this group by focusing on child protection to incentivise families to participate in preventative strategies. Likewise, rural riverside communities were highlighted as vulnerable groups. In the Loreto region, evidence suggests significantly poorer health outcomes and access to health services in rural communities [46]. Participants proposed differences in mentality between people in rural communities and city as a consequence. A study in the Peruvian Amazon identified a reduced dependence on western medicine in rural communities [47], therefore it may be that these rural communities are forced to take more responsibility for their own health with less access to state provided services. This suggests an area warranting future qualitative research since the health beliefs of these people may require independent dengue control strategies.\nParticipants viewed themselves as susceptible to dengue since there was a belief that they were unable to protect themselves or their families from this disease. The assumed inevitability of infection, lack of faith in preventative practices and a powerless attitude towards protection compounded this belief. These results are supported by an existing health promotion theory: the Health Belief Model [48]. This model explains how health behaviour is determined by perceptions of a disease and the strategies used to reduce it and has been used an effective tool in previous published research surrounding dengue control [49\u201352]. In particular, it suggests the impact of perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy as factors influencing health behaviour [48]. In Iquitos, it may be appropriate to suggest that the high perceived susceptibility of dengue positively impacted participants\u2019 preventative practice, whereas a low sense of self efficacy in response to disease prevention may have had the opposite effect. Research in Peru has suggested that a barrier to successful preventative practices may be a perception that control methods like household cleaning are seen as a lot of work. [17] Therefore, acknowledgement that these perceptions shape health behaviour is important for targeting effective health promotion materials.\nA heavy reliance on the government or health centre for health protection and education was further illustrated in the study findings and showed parallels with a common concept in healthcare\u2014paternalism [53]. This describes the act of seeking to promote someone\u2019s wellbeing by interfering with their freedom of choice [54]. In some parts of the world, dengue control programmes have been described as \u201ctoo paternalistic\u201d, focusing on an attitude where the \u2018government controls everything\u2019 [55]. In Iquitos, the community health worker \u201ccharlas\u201d, mandatory fumigation and household inspections could be viewed in a similar way. Although these services have been linked to a reduction in Aedes aegypti indices [56], paternalistic approaches may have the effect of disempowering communities and reinforcing feelings of powerlessness [57]. In turn, disempowered communities may be more susceptible to disease [57].\nIn this way, the combination of reliance on the government and health centre and a belief that dengue cannot be prevented through individual actions highlights a particular problem with the attitudes of the community in Iquitos, in relation to dengue control. These attitudes highlight a challenge to dengue prevention on an individual level, as well as encouraging a lack of participation and cooperation on a community level and vice versa.\nIn endemic countries, community participation is vital to ensure the success, suitability and sustainability of dengue control programmes [57]. In this study, a key finding illustrated the frustration that participants felt towards a perceived lack of community participation. Similar findings have been shown in other studies in Latin America where the concept has been described as \u201cdesuni\u00f3n\u201d or \u201cmala uni\u00f3n\u201d. In English this translates to \u2018disunion\u2019 and represents a lack of community cooperation in dengue control practices [22,58]. In Ecuador, apathy and social irresponsibility were defined as barriers to community participation [22], the results of which are consistent with the study findings. Although the current study offers explanations behind this social phenomenon, additional qualitative research could add insights and clarity to build upon these findings, perhaps by using a more heterogeneous sample or a focus group design.\nEvidence suggests that social mobilization and community efforts are crucial for maintaining dengue prevention [59]. In Iquitos, a lack of community empowerment has been suggested as a barrier to vector control strategies [17]. Thus, there is a need to foster strategies to promote community organisation and empowerment to engage residents in protecting the health of their families and the community as a whole. Successful community-based strategies have been used to reduce the abundance of Aedes aegypti in countries such as Cuba, Colombia, Honduras and Mexico [60\u201363]. For instance in Cuba, \u2018community working groups\u2019 were created using existing formal and informal community leaders and took responsibility for the management of vector control strategies in their own constituencies [60]. Other novel approaches have been used such as involving high school students as health educators in Colombia [62] and school-based education in Honduras [63]. Similar strategies could be utilised in Iquitos to encourage a sense of empowerment with campaigns promoting united participation in communities and emphasising the importance of each individual in working towards control of dengue fever. In this way, recommendations may focus on community led groups organising control efforts, perhaps through dissemination of educational materials or promotion of larvae eradication strategies (the Untadita method of cleaning wash basins, for example) [64]. This may prove pertinent since evidence suggests that people in Peru may not be well informed about effective cleaning methods to be able to effectively eliminate the Aedes aegypti vector from their homes. [17] Such recommendations seek to improve control of the Aedes aegypti vector to not only enhance dengue prevention but protection from other mosquito borne diseases such as zika and chikungunya. Thus, the results from this study may have a wider importance for the public health of this community.\n\nStrengths and limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge the strengths and limitations of the study. The strength of this study lies with the important feedback and insight it provides in the ongoing control of dengue fever and the influence of current health campaigns to community and individual perceptions in an endemic region. However, the qualitative nature requires findings to be interpreted with caution, particularly if generalising the conclusions beyond the sample explored. Qualitative studies are limited by the use of a relatively small number of participants and cannot be considered representative [34]. It is important to consider this when applying the findings to caregivers to children under 5 years who live in similar endemic situations.\nFurthermore, in cross-language qualitative research, the use of translators and interpreters may impact the findings [39]. Braun and Clarke emphasise the importance of deriving meaning from words and data [65], therefore use of an interpreter and translator may have impacted analysis by increasing the risk that meaning was lost in translation. Steps were taken to avoid this potential bias of misinterpretation [39]. Interviews were piloted, a translation lexicon was created and two transcripts were externally validated. Moreover, the benefits of a local interpreter included useful insights into the meaning behind responses and increased cooperation from participants who seemed more relaxed and willing to participate in in depth discussion with a member of their community.\nIn retrospect, a further limitation to the study may be the absence of deeper exploration into the conflation presented in the interviews between dengue and other arbo-viral diseases. Further questioning about the different types of mosquitoes known by participants, as well as distinct control methods, may have proved useful when discussing appropriate recommendations to improve vector control. Likewise, the findings from this study would have been further enriched by closer examination of the individual motivators or barriers to performing protective household practices. Further research may aim to better explore these two limitations.\nFinally, the impact of the lead author (British, female medical student) conducting cross-cultural research must be acknowledged. Culture is defined as a set of distinctive features of a social group [66] thus, as an outsider to the community, preconceptions and values of the principal researcher may have influenced data interpretation and analysis. The potential effect of this was minimised through support with interpretation from the wider research team, to ensure cultural understanding and the use of multiple coders and analysts to reduce the risk of researcher bias.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study contributes to the understanding of perceptions and experiences that influence dengue control amongst caregivers of children under 5 years in an endemic setting. Specific misconceptions around dengue transmission and confusion with other diseases, such as malaria, need to be addressed. In terms of disease control, the lack of community cooperation in mosquito prevention was perceived as a key barrier. This social phenomenon was intensified by attitudes that the government and health centre were responsible for dengue control and the belief that the disease cannot be prevented through individual actions. There is a need to address these perceptions through targeted campaigns encouraging individual and community empowerment in dengue control."
