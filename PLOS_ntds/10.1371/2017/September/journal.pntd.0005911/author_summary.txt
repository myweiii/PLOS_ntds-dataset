Humans are infected by many types of parasites that originate from animals. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a tapeworm infection that affects over 1 million people over the world at any given time, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, and allergic reactions. The lifecycle of this parasite is maintained between dogs and livestock, and humans are ‘accidentally’ infected through ingesting parasite eggs. This makes the control of CE difficult for public health practitioners. Attempts have been made to better understand which animals or environmental factors increase or decrease the number of human CE infections, but mainly with data from only one point in time. In this study, we studied the trends of this disease in Chile, a country with many cases of CE, over a 12-year period. Then, using a statistical model, we examined the risk factors related to animals and the environment that contribute to a higher rate of CE hospitalizations. We found that higher goat density, intermediate precipitation level and low temperatures are important factors associated with an increase in hospitalization rates related to CE in Chile. This new knowledge contributes to a better overall understanding of the trends and risk factors of CE, which will help to implement targeted prevention and control strategies in regions where the disease is common.
