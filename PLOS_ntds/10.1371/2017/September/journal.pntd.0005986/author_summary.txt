Trypanosomatids belong to an ancient eukaryotic lineage that cause devastating diseases in humans and livestock. The elucidation of the genomes of Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major established a landmark in the study of these relevant protozoa. In particular, the genome of T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, evidenced a marked expansion and diversification of gene families likely involved in parasite-host interplay. MASPs (for mucin-associated surface proteins) define the second largest T. cruzi gene family, with ~1400 genes (and pseudogenes) coding for surface glycoproteins involved in parasite infectivity and immune evasion. MASP deduced products bear highly conserved sorting signals on their N- and C-terminal regions that direct and anchor them to the parasite plasma membrane. Conversely, the central and mature domain, the only one displayed on the parasite surface is strikingly variable and exhibit a ‘mosaic-like’ structure made up of different combinations of a large repertoire of short sequence motifs. Few studies have analyzed MASP antigenicity so far, and they were carried out using either low throughput approaches or animal infection models. By means of exquisite peptide micro-arrays technology followed by conventional serological methods we herein present the first non-biased, high-throughput profiling of linear B-cell epitopes from a representative pool (n = 232) of T. cruzi MASPs during human infection. Our findings are discussed in terms of MASP evolution, expression profile and applicability in Chagas disease serodiagnosis.
