Millions of people are at risk of developing African sleeping sickness through infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is fatal if untreated. Current therapies are antiquated and inadequate, requiring hospitalization to deliver them through complex regimens, thus new effective, cheap and easy to administer therapies are urgently required. We recently reported the generation of a new compound that is selectively active against the parasite responsible for the disease, but its mechanism of action was unknown. This body of work identifies the specific target within the parasite as the essential FoF1-ATP synthase (mitochondrial complex V), first by analysing the proteins bound to a tagged analogue of our active compound (in a process known as photo-affinity labelling), and secondly by determining the effects of our active compound on cellular metabolism. With the target now identified work can begin to improve inhibitor potency and selectivity with the aid of rational drug design and structural optimisation towards future drug discovery.
