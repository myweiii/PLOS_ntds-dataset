Secondary bacterial infection of tungiaisis lesions is a threat to jigger infested patients. Once the flea penetrates the skin, it leaves an opening on the skin through which it lays eggs, defecates and breathes throughout it’s life cycle on the host. At the same time, it feeds on the host’s blood hence a direct connection of the environment to the blood stream is established. Chances of bacteria getting into the blood stream is therefore greatly enhanced. Once bacteria gets into the blood, it can lead to life threatening conditions like septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome. Affected communities are oblivious to this danger and they neither seek nor get treated for this parasitosis. The health officials and scientific community also continue to ignore this disease hence it’s extremely neglected. Consequently, not much is understood concerning the disease dynamics, distribution and pathogenesis. This study therefore is a deliberate effort to bring attention to one aspect of the disease dynamics of this menace.
