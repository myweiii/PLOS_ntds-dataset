Rocky Mountain spotted fever is one of the main diseases transmitted by tick bites in Colombia. Studies examining rickettsial seropositivity in humans, potential vectors and amplifying hosts in regions where previous outbreaks occurred are necessary to highlight this disease in the differential diagnosis of febrile syndromes and to implement epidemiological surveillance programs. This study reveals several factors associated with rickettsial seropositivity, including working outdoors, practices related to deforestation and forest fragmentation, and the potential contact between humans and wild animals, such as opossums, that could be involved in the transmission cycle. In addition, it reveals the importance of domestic animals as sentinels of infection as well as the tick species acting as potential vectors of rickettsiae in human and domestic animals.
