We would like to thank the staff and patients at Takeo Provincial Hospital. This work would not have been possible without them. We would also like to acknowledge the Diagnostic Microbiology Development Program (DMDP). DMDP, working with partners, established the diagnostic microbiology laboratory in the Takeo Provincial Hospital and has provided ongoing bench training and technical support to the staff in that laboratory and clinical mentoring to the physicians in the hospital. DMDP also provides reagents and supplies, including blood culture bottles and culture media, to the laboratory. More information about DMDP can be found at www.dmdp.org. Finally, we thank Danielle Deaver for critical reading of this manuscript.
