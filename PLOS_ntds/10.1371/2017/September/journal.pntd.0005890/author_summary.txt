Integrated vector management (IVM) is of the important elements in the Regional Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination strategy. VL supposed to be eliminated from the Region (Bangladesh, India and Nepal) by 2015 which is extended up to 2017. There are several factors are responsible for not achieving the elimination goal and IVM is one of them. In Bangladesh, currently VL vector control activity is confined to indoor residual spraying with deltamethrin. Therefore, it is crucial to identify alternative VL vector control method(s) to enhance VL elimination programme. In the present study we have investigated the efficacy of (1) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with alpha cypermethrin 5WP; (2) long lasting insecticide impregnated bed-net (LLIN); (3) impregnation of local bed-nets with slow release insecticide K-O TAB 1-2-3 (KOTAB); (4) insecticide spraying in potential breeding sites using chlorpyrifos 20EC (OUT) and different combinations of the above. Study findings showed that the combination of LLIN and OUT was the most effective method against VL vector and among single interventions, IRS with two rounds of spraying found efficacious. In addition to IRS, VL elimination programme should consider LLIN plus OUT for vector control in relation to IVM.
