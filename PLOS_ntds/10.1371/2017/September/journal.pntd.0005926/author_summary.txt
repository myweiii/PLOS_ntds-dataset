Dengue disease severity is known to vary widely from the very severe to asymptomatic. There is a wide range of estimates of how many infections result in each of these outcomes. It is known that after a first infection the outcome of a second infection with a different serotype varies over time, but this has not been taken into account in these previous estimates. In this paper, we use modelling methods, combined with information from published dengue research in which individuals are followed over time, to estimate the proportion of infections that result in symptoms at different times after infection. We estimated the proportion of infections that are symptomatic for first infections as 0.18 (95% Credible Interval, CI: 0.16, 0.20), 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.17) for individuals infected in the year following a first infection and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.45) for those experiencing secondary infections after this first year. The estimates here will help understand how cases relate to underlying transmission, which is vital for understanding how much of the population are susceptible to infection and for effectively targeting interventions.
