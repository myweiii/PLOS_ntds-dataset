The causative agent of yaws, Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE), belongs to a group of uncultivable treponemes causing several human and animal infections. Yaws is a multi-stage disease which is endemic in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America. In this study, whole genome sequences of two TPE strains (CDC 2575 and Ghana-051) isolated from patients infected in Ghana, Africa, were determined. Despite being isolated more than 7 years apart (1980 and 1988), both TPE strains had an identical consensus whole genome nucleotide sequence, although showing differences in 14 intrastrain heterogeneous sites. To support the independent character of both strains, re-analysis of available lab records, clinical data and sequencing of the contaminating rabbit chromosomal DNA was performed and revealed differences in TPE Ghana-051 and CDC 2575 samples. The identical genome sequence and the time between isolation of both TPE strains was used to estimate the upper limit of the yaws treponeme evolution rate, which was 4.1 x 10âˆ’10 per site per generation, a mutation rate that is slightly lower than the experimentally determined E. coli mutation rate. Given the obtained data, the most recent common ancestor of syphilis and yaws treponemes is likely to be more than ten thousand years old. However, since our estimation is an upper limit of the evolution rate, one can assume that the real evolutionary rate could have been even slower, and the time to the most recent common ancestor of syphilis and yaws treponemes even longer.
