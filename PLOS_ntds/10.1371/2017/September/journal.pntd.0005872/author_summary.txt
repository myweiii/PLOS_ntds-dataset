The World Health Organization is spearheading the war on neglected tropical diseases, including helminth infections, by encouraging its member states to intensify control efforts. This call has recently been answered in most endemic regions of helminthiasis and governments are scaling up chemotherapy-based control programs in collaboration with private and public partners. However, it is necessary to clearly understand factors driving local transmission dynamics of helminth infections to design effective control programs. Here, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 368 primary schoolchildren in Kwale, Kenya, and identified factors associated with the intensity of Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm infections. The negative binomial generalized linear mixed model showed the intensity of S. haematobium infection was much higher among Muslims and schoolchildren from low socioeconomic status households. High intensity of hookworm infection was associated with sex, SES, distance to river and history of anthelmintic treatment. Our findings demonstrate considering social and cultural drivers of NTDs could be beneficial in designing of efficient control programs and expediting NTDs control.
