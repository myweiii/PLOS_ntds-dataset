Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic disease caused by the life-threatening parasite Leishmania donovani. This chronicity character is a major concern in experimental models of visceral leishmaniasis, since infected animals do not develop any visible sign or symptom before one/two months after infection. Consequently, there is an urge to develop a model that allow the early identification of the parasite in the host’s tissues and an easy follow up of the infection. Therefore, we generated genetically-modified virulent parasites that are concomitantly fluorescent and bioluminescent, and using highly performant imaging approaches, we could detect these parasites in tissues of infected hamsters and mice within a week post-infection. With these parasites, we established, then, a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis that allows prolonged longitudinal studies and enables the investigation of parasite’s survival, using non-invasive in vivo imaging techniques. These features are of extreme importance, particularly for the development of new therapies and vaccines and open up new perspectives on the study of this disease.
