Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic worm infection that affects 218 million people worldwide, the majority of whom live in Africa. Studies have shown that women with schistosomiasis tend to have higher rates of HIV infection, but until now no study has followed people over time to determine whether schistosomiasis increases a person’s risk of becoming HIV-infected. In this ongoing community study in rural Tanzania, we identified 73 individuals who became HIV-infected during follow-up, and 265 control individuals who were similar in age, sex, and location but who remained HIV-uninfected during follow-up. We tested these individuals’ stored blood samples to determine whether they had schistosome infection before they became HIV-infected. We found that women who had schistosome infections had a 2.8-fold increased risk of becoming HIV-infected compared to women without schistosome infections. We found no evidence of increased HIV acquisition in men with schistosome infections. We also found that the concentration of HIV in the blood shortly after people became HIV-infected was higher in those who had schistosome infections than in those who did not have schistosome infections. Our study suggests that schistosomiasis may play a major role in HIV transmission and disease progression in African countries.
