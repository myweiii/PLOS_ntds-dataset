Enteric fever is a bloodstream infection caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi or Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, or C. It is common in low resource settings and linked to poor water quality and sanitation. The disease is also endemic in Cambodia and since 2013 there has been a sharp increase in the number of Salmonella Paratyphi A infections. We sought to compare the clinical phenotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of Salmonella Paratyphi A infections with those of Salmonella Typhi infections in this setting. We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data from clinical charts of 254 patients with a blood culture positive for enteric fever. We also assessed antibiotic susceptibility patterns and sequenced the genome of a subset of isolates. We found that since 2013 the majority of enteric fever cases are caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A which increasingly shows decreased susceptibility to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the current first line treatment. In contrast, in Salmonella Typhi a re-emergence of susceptibility for the former first line antibiotics of ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol was observed. Presenting symptoms of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A were identical, minor differences were observed in laboratory parameters.
