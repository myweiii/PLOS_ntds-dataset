Enteroparasites are among the main issues in public health arena, especially in children of vulnerable communities from developing countries. We performed a combined analysis of the factors that describe parasite prevalence in children and their environment. Our result evidenced a combined effect of socio-demographic and environmental factors acting at different scales (individual, family, and neighborhood) to determine the parasitic infections patterns and health risk of children at Iguaz√∫ Municipality in Argentina. Therefore, this work shed light on the multiple and multilevel factors involved in parasitic diseases, emphasizing the need for action in socio-health and environmental structural issues, not only from the decision-making authorities but also from the individuals, families and communities in favor of promoting healthy environments and healthy individuals.
