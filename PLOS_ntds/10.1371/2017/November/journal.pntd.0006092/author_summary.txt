Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is mainly transmitted to humans by insects that dwell in human habitations and structures closely associated with human habitations, such as kitchen out-buildings, chicken coops, goat corrals, and grain storage bins. Widespread in the Americas, the disease causes chronic illness and often eventual death. No vaccines exist. Available drugs may cause undesirable adverse effects and do not prevent re-infection. Efforts at suppressing the disease have been directed at eliminating the principal insect vector species from human dwelling compounds. Effective insecticide spraying requires finding out where the insects are. Both the average and the variance of the relative number of insect vectors of each species in each habitat are relevant to control efforts. We demonstrate here that the spatial distribution of the insect vectors of Chagas disease obeys a previously unrecognized pattern, known in ecology as Taylor's law (TL): in different habitats, the variance of vector relative numbers is approximately a power function of the mean of vector relative numbers. TL identifies key habitats with high average infestation and highly variable infestation, providing a new instrument for the control and elimination of the vectors of a major human disease.
