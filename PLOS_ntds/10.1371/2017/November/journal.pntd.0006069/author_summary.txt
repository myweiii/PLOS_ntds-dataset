Current diagnosis of Chagas disease is still cumbersome. Diagnosis is based on antibody detection with at least two assays of distinct mechanisms. If a discrepancy exists, a third assay must be performed. However, detection of antibodies is not indicative of current infection. Molecular-based techniques such as qPCR have been used for diagnosis and as a gold standard in the demonstration of therapeutic failure, but availability of genomic material depends on the presence of parasites in the bloodstream. Detection of parasite-derived antigens represents a better alternative for diagnosis, as several proteins are secreted/excreted by the parasites and may be detected in blood and in the urine of infected individuals. This study describes the development of polyclonal antibodies raised against different Trypanosoma cruzi antigens and their applicability for the diagnosis of Chagas disease using the widely-used ELISA format.
