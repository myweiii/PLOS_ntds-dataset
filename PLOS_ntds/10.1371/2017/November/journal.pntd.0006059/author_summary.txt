Infection of the brain with larvae of the tapeworm Taenia solium is called neurocysticercosis (NCC), a disease with varied and serious neurological symptoms. Therapy requires antiparasitic drugs and corticosteroids to prevent seizures caused by treatment due to inflammation around dying parasites. The gene expression of the proinflammatory molecule tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is increased in NCC. We treated three groups of naturally infected pigs with an antiparasitic drug: one group was also pretreated with an anti-TNF-α inhibitor, the second one with a corticosteroid, and the third was not pretreated. All pigs were infused with Evans blue dye (EB), which leaks where the blood brain barrier is damaged by inflammation around cysts. We compared the expression of several genes involved in inflammation, healing and fibrosis and regulation of vascular function in tissues surrounding cysts. In inflamed samples showing leaked EB, the inhibition of TNF-α suppressed nearly all the genes assessed, and this suppression was significantly stronger than the moderate decrease caused by corticosteroid pretreatment on most of the genes. On microscopic examination, the inflammation observed was slightly decreased with both pretreatments in relation to the group that was not pretreated. We believe that the inflammatory route that includes TNF-α should be further explored in the search for better management of inflammation directed to degenerating cysts.
