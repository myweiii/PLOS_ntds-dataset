In February 2016 the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Zika virus infection in the Americas as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). By November 2016, Zika was declared a long-term public health challenge. This change of status implies that Zika is likely to become an endemic problem in the region. Due to the PHEIC status of Zika, most current research has rightly focused on the epidemic stage of the disease; however, it is timely and critical to consider the public health consequences after such epidemic phase. We used one of the largest and most spatially diverse panels of epidemiological surveillance data comprising 12 years of dengue case observations from Brazil and Mexico, and covering an area of over ten million km2. State-of-the-art statistical models, and high-resolution (0.5 Ã— 0.5 degrees) climate and demographic data were used to produce spatially-explicit projections of Zika infection for Latin America and the Caribbean. Model projections were then used to estimate the number of cases with neurological sequelae and their economic cost. Our findings indicate that the potential health and economic burden of Zika could be considerably large for the region should it become endemic. The estimated burden of Zika under an endemic state highlights the need for health authorities in the countries at risk to promote preventive and control measures.
