In this work we demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Glb against the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. At the cellular level, the drug triggered mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, thus affecting ATP generation in the parasite. In addition, since intracystic Glb concentrations were higher than those used in the external medium, we proposed that the drug might enter the cyst through cell surface transporters. The observed effect of the drug on the growth of hydatid cysts in mice leads to the consideration of a novel role of Glb in CE treatment. Therefore, our further studies will focus on the evaluation of ABZ formulations with enhanced bioavailability to achieve an improved in vivo anti-echinococcal effect using both drugs simultaneously.
