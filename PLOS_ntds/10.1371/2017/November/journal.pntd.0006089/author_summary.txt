Using a target-based strategy to develop new drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis we had earlier identified Schistosoma mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8) as essential for parasite development and survival in the mammalian host. Selective inhibitors of this enzyme show promise as lead compounds for drug development. However, the biological role of SmHDAC8 has not been established. We identified the potential partner proteins and the processes in which it is involved by combining two methods: yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry. These approaches yielded complementary sets of potential partner proteins that are actors in about 40 different cellular processes. These include known roles for the human counterpart of SmHDAC8, like interactions with the cohesin complex and the cytoskeleton, as well as novel interactions such as with proteasomes and ribosomal proteins. Our results emphasize the implication of SmHDAC8 in both nuclear and cytosolic processes and the versatility of this enzyme, suggesting why it is vital to the parasite and a promising drug target.
