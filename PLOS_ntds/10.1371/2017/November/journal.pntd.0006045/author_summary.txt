Schistosomiasis, caused by S. haematobium, causes inflammation in the bladder and is common in tropical areas such as Nigeria. Undetected schistosomiasis can lead to inflammation in the bladder which may lead to bladder cancer. Diagnosis of bladder cancer in areas with common urinary schistosomiasis is difficult because the two diseases share many common symptoms. It is therefore important to identify biomarkers that could be used for early diagnosis of both schistosomiasis and schistosomiasis-associated bladder cancer. We chose a proteomic approach to identify these candidate biomarkers in a clinical cohort of urine samples obtained in Nigeria. We found several parasite- and host-specific protein biomarkers that could have diagnostic potential in a urine-based test for schistosomiasis, and schistosomiasis-associated bladder cancer. These include proteins that may also have application in drug or vaccine development. This study is one of the first to catalogue the urinary proteomes of people affected by this neglected tropical disease.
