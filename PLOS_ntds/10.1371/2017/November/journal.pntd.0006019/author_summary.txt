The repeated infection that causes trachoma is spread from person to person via infected ocular and nasal secretions. The World Health Organization (WHO) strategy for trachoma control includes keeping children’s faces clean of discharges, yet “clean faces” are not measured in most of the district surveys that evaluate the impact of programs. We studied the reliability of assessing “clean faces” in 60 children in a village in Tanzania, using trained Tanzania staff with a variety of educational backgrounds. When assessing the same child twice after 50 minutes, the staff showed substantial agreement with themselves. The agreement between a senior grader and each staff member was also excellent. The data suggest that clean faces in children can be reliably assessed, and should be added to district surveys that are measuring the impact of programs on control of trachoma.
