Large scale efforts to control schistosomiasis in several sub-Saharan countries are in progress. In order to accurately monitor the effect of interventions, we need diagnostic tools which are highly specific, sensitive, affordable and easy to use and implement. For Schistosoma mansoni detection the circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) is an attractive option as this antigen is a measure of actively feeding worms and can be measured in urine samples. However, knowledge about how fast this antigen is cleared in response to treatment with praziquantel is necessary for interpretation of consecutive measures based on CCA in order to use this tool optimally. Here we show that CCA is already significantly reduced 24 hours after treatment both in single and double treatment regimens in a community sample from Musoli Village, Uganda. Furthermore, the data supports interpretation of trace measures of CCA as positive since the majority of individuals with trace measures respond to treatment. These observations provide a basis for extended use of CCA-based tools in monitoring treatment efficacy and possibilities for logistically advantageous prevalence screening strategies.
