Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Thailand is caused by two causative agents, Leishmania martiniquensis and Leishmania siamensis. A public health concern brought us to investigate the magnitude of Leishmania infection among individuals with HIV living in an affected area, Trang province, southern Thailand. The results showed a high seroprevalence of Leishmania infection. Using PCR-based technique, DNA detection in the buffy coat was 8.4%, and 1.8% were symptomatic VL. Asymptomatic Leishmania infection could play an important role in disease transmission. Risk factors associated with Leishmania infection among Thai patients with HIV were firstly described. Those who were NIDU and lived in stilt houses were associated with Leishmania infection. Individuals who had lower immunity with detectable viral load were more likely to contract the infection. Interestingly, not only L. martiniquensis and L. siamensis were identified but also L. donovani complex, L. major, and L. lainsoni, were firstly reported among indigenous Thai people. These findings could lead to effective intervention and prevention methods to control leishmaniasis in Thailand. Further studies are needed to investigate the disease development in asymptomatic infections as well as evaluate the prevalence in other regions of Thailand.
