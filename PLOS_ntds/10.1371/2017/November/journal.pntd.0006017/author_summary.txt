In many African countries, children under the age of 5 years are at considerable risk of acquiring parasitic worm infections. Yet, most of the neglected tropical disease control programs in Africa do not include preschool-aged children in deworming campaigns. Chronic parasitic worm infections may impair children’s growth and their cognitive development. We conducted a 12-month prospective study of children younger than 5 years in the Temeke district, Dar es Salaam—the economic capital of Tanzania—to assess the prevalence of parasitic worm infections. Among 310 included children, we found that one in six children was infected with the blood fluke Schistosoma, while one in 11 children were infected with soil-transmitted helminths. Anemia was found among 65% of children, particularly among those infected with parasitic worms. The high prevalence of Schistosoma infection in this urban setting, despite improved water supply and sanitation as well as limited open freshwater contact shows the pressing need to identify parasitic worm transmission hotspots in urban areas. Setting-specific interventions targeting preschool-aged children and urban settlements, among others, should be considered to reduce the transmission of Schistosoma and other parasitic worm infections.
