O. viverrini infection is highly prevalent in northern and northeastern Thailand. The diagnosis of the infection is usually achieved by finding the eggs in feces. However, these eggs are difficult to differentiate morphologically from other Opisthorchis-like eggs. Our study evaluated the prevalence and molecular characterization of Opisthorchis-like eggs in fecal samples collected from 2,609 villagers living in a rural community, in central Thailand, using PCR-RFLP analysis of ITS2 region. This study insists that Sanamchaikate District, Chachoengsao Province, central area, is one of the areas for O. viverrini infection. To understand the transmission dynamics of O. viverrini in the study area, the genetic structure of O. viverrini was also assessed using cox1 and nad1 sequences. The O. viverrini populations showed monophyly and the genetic background was closely related to one isolate from Lao PDR.
