Tsetse flies are economically important insects responsible for transmitting African trypanosomes, which cause debilitating and fatal diseases in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. In the tsetse vector, trypanosomes undergo complex developmental processes in the midgut, culminating with the generation of mammalian infective forms in the salivary glands for Trypanosoma brucei spp. and in the proboscis (PB) for Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax. Molecular studies on tsetse’s PB, and its interactions with trypanosomes, are limited. We used RNA-seq analysis to obtain molecular information on the putative products associated with tsetse’s PB and characterized PB responses to infection with T. congolense. Based on the predicted putative protein profile, the PB appears to be a muscular organ with mechanoreceptors and may have the capacity to sense and respond to chemical cues. Parasite infections of the PB lead to decreased expression of genes whose products are associated with metabolic and immune functions. These data provide insights into tsetse-trypanosome interactions in the PB organ and identify potential candidate targets that can be further explored to develop biotechnological strategies to reduce transmission of trypanosomes by tsetse flies.
