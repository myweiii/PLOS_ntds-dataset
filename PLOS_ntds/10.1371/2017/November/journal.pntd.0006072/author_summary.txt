The reemergence of plague is related to the persistence and dynamics of its reservoirs and vectors. During the human plague outbreaks that re-occurred in Mahajanga harbor, Madagascar in the 1990s, the shrew Suncus murinus was found infected with Yersinia pestis. Combining field surveys, experimental infections and genetic analysis, we examined the role of Asian shrew Suncus murinus in plague transmission and maintenance comparatively with others potential hosts in Mahajanga. The genomes of nineteen Y. pestis isolates recovered from humans, shrews, rats and fleas in this focus were sequenced and compared. We observed the predominance of S. murinus captured during the epidemics and their carriage of the flea vector. Shrews exhibited high resistance to Y. pestis experimental infections. Genetic analyses of the strains isolated from various hosts were consistent with two partially-linked transmission cycles, with plague persisting within the S. murinus population, occasionally spilling over into the rat and human populations. The isolation of a Y. pestis strain from a rat in Mahajanga in 2014 genetically close to shrew strains reinforces this hypothesis. The current circulation of plague within the city highlights the continuing health threat.
