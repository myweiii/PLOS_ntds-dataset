Sri Lanka has a high incidence of snakebite with 80,000 bites occurring annually in a population of 21 million. However, there are very limited data on health seeking behaviour following bites. We undertook a community based island-wide survey in Sri Lanka during 2012â€“2013 and surveyed 165,665 individuals living in 44,136 households. There were 695 snakebite victims and 98% of them had sought health care after the bite; 55% sought allopathic (western medical) treatment and 43% sought traditional treatment. The decision on seeking allopathic treatment was influenced mainly by probable envenoming following the snakebite.
