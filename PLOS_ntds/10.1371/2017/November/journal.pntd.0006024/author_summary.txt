Snakebites have been recognized as a neglected public health problem in several tropical and subtropical countries. Snakes from the genus Bothrops are the most common snakes found in Latin America. Bothrops snakebites frequently complicate with kidney impairment with increased risk of death. The only treatment currently available for Bothrops envenomation is the infusion of antivenom. Therefore, the study of novel therapies to prevent kidney failure caused by snakebites is compelling. Allopurinol is a drug commonly used to treat gout which also presents beneficial antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Allopurinol in a rat experimental model of Bothrops envenomation. In our study, rats that received the infusion of the snake venom presented with reduced kidney function which was improved by Allopurinol. Overall, Allopurinol might represent a novel approach to prevent kidney failure in victims of Bothrops snakebites. This could be a new use for an old and widely available drug.
