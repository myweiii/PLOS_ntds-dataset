Antivenoms (AV) are included in the WHO List of Essential Medicines, being the only treatment available for snakebites envenomings. In Brazil, five types of liquid snake AVs are distributed by the Ministry of Health for national use free of charge to patients. In remote areas, lack of an adequate cold chain impairs AV distribution to health facilities resulting in delay in patient care and, ultimately, in higher complication and case fatality rate. To minimize this problem, a freeze-drying process has been suggested to improve the stability of AVs, but freeze-dried AVs efficacy and safety evidence obtained from clinical trials is still very limited. Freeze-drying is a process by which water is removed from a sample without the need to apply heat. Benefits of lyophilization are: a) Samples are processed in aseptic conditions; b) Process does not use heat, ensuring formulation stability; c) Increases shelf life; d) Samples can be stored at room temperature for a long time; and e) Reduces weight and volume of samples, which is ideal for distribution. In this study, a freeze-dryed formulation is presented as a good alternative for a more stable trivalent antivenom in regions of the Amazon where high temperatures are common and the cold chain is poor. Our results suggest that such a product is adequate for a phase III trial.
