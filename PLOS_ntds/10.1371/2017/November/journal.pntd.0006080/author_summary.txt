Trachoma is an infectious disease of the eye, which is caused by repeated infection with Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium. The disease is the leading cause of preventable blindness. Ethiopia is the most trachoma affected country in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) interventions to control and eliminate blinding trachoma. With the aim of assessing the effect of WaSH intervention on active trachoma in selected woredas/districts of North and South Wollo zones of Amhara Region, Ethiopia, we selected intervention and control woredas, and WaSH program was implemented in the intervention woredas for one year. Baseline trachoma prevalence was conducted in both intervention and control areas before WaSH program was implemented. Prevalence was determined in both study areas after one-year intervention period and was compared with the baseline. The finding showed that the prevalence of active trachoma was reduced from baseline prevalence of 26% to 18% after one-year WaSH program implementation in the intervention woredas compared to the non-intervention woredas. However, as the magnitude of active trachoma prevalence observed after the intervention is still very high. Continued WaSH interventions and periodic monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the impact of WaSH on active trachoma is warranted in the studied areas of Ethiopia.
