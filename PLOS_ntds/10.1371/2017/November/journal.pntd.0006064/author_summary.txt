Argasid ticks (soft ticks) are obligate blood-feeding arthropods that may bite humans. To increase understanding of the bacteria that are associated with these arthropods, we collected soft ticks from different sites in Algeria and used molecular tools to detect and identify bacteria in these ticks. Molecular tools revealed that some argasid ticks tested positive for agents of relapsing fever in humans, and other bacteria of unknown pathogenicity.
