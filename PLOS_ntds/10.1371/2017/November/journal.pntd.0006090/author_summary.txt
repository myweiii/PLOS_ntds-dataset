Leishmaniasis is an antropozoonosis caused by Leishmania parasites that affects around 12 million people in 98 different countries. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania amazonensis can have different clinical forms and severities depending on the parasite strain. We have here shown that two Leishmania amazonensis strains, named PH8 and LV79, which have different virulence in mice, also have different protein signatures. In fact, samples from these strains can be distinguished based on the abundance of all proteins detected and of the differential ones. Differential proteins identified in this work may be employed in the future to predict virulence of parasite strains or isolates.
