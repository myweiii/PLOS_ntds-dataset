Micrurus venoms have neurotoxic activity that is responsible for the serious sequelae in human envenomation. However, various local manifestations of envenoming have been described in patients bitten by different Micrurus species and edematogenic activity has been experimentally demonstrated. Despite the low frequency of edema in Micrurus envenomation, this effect can worsen the clinical manifestations. However, there are few studies on local inflammatory effects induced by Micrurus snake venom. We investigated the edematogenic effect of Micrurus lemniscatus venom (MLV) and participation of neuropeptides and mast cells in inflammation. Results demonstrate that MLV induces prominent edema with rapid onset. Using specific pharmacological interferences, we found that MLV-induced edema is dependent on activation of mast cells and substance P-releasing sensory C-fibers. NKA and NKB tachykinins, histamine via H1 receptor and serotonin are major mediators of the MLV-induced edematogenic response. These findings suggest that mast cell- and C-fiber-derived mediators are promising therapeutic targets to efficiently counteract the local edema induced by Micrururs venoms.
