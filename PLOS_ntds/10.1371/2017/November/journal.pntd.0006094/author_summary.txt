Cutaneous and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL/MCL) are disfiguring diseases caused by a worldwide distributed parasite called Leishmania and its 20 species. Clinical manifestations span a wide continuum from single nodular lesion to disseminated form with mucosal involvement. Though local treatment with cryotherapy and intralesionnal antimony or topical formulations of paromomycin is generally adequate in most of situations, some patients with complex CL/MCL require systemic therapy. No convenient regimen has been proved to be safe and effective for all infecting species, all clinical forms and all patients (e.g. children, pregnant women, adults with comorbidities or immunosuppression). In this study, the authors examined in returning travelers with CL/MCL the effectiveness of an antifungal agent “liposomal amphotericin B” (L-AmB), which is highly effective in visceral leishmaniasis. Surprisingly, rates of healing were lower than in previous reports in this unselected population that reflects clinical practice in non-endemic countries. The observations also suggest that some Leishmania species (namely, L. infantum) may be more susceptible to L-AmB than others. Occurrence of adverse events should raises the question of the benefit-risk balance of L-AmB in CL/MCL. Careful attention to comorbidities and adoption of strict protocols for administration are pre-requisites for the use of L-AmB in patients with CL/MCL.
