Triatomine bugs are the vectors of Chagas disease, still a key public health concern in the Americas. Insecticide spraying efficiently controls house infestation by triatomines, but is useless against sylvatic bugsâ€“which can transmit the disease by simply invading human residences. Although this behavior is common, the drivers of house invasion by wild triatomines remain poorly understood. Using municipality-aggregated data from routine surveillance, we investigated whether and how some major environmental factors affect house invasion by four triatomine species across the transition between Amazon rainforests and Cerrado savannahs in Brazil. We found that house invasion (i) is widespread, (ii) varies by region for some species, (iii) is overall less frequent in areas with higher levels of landscape disturbance, and (iv) is less common in hotter and in rainier sites. Although the effects of landscape disturbance and climate differed somewhat among bug species, the general approach we describe here may help advance Chagas disease risk assessment when house-colonizing vectors are absent.
