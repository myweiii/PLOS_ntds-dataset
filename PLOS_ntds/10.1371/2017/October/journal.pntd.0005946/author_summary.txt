Dog vaccination against rabies is the main method of rabies control in Zambia and it is mainly conducted by the Department of Veterinary Services under the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. This study explores the factors influencing dog vaccination against rabies and the local barriers to rabies control in Nyimba district of Zambia. The study was done in three parts; a review of dog bite cases (n = 215 cases), a household survey and questionnaire (n = 300 households) and in depth interviews with local rabies experts (n = 5). The study found that the community had adequate knowledge about rabies prevention in dogs and humans. The area of residence, the age and financial capacity of the dog owner determined whether or not the household dog was vaccinated or not. The survey of the 300 households revealed that only 8.7% of the dogs were vaccinated against rabies and the dog bite case record review showed that the majority of the dog bite cases were caused by unvaccinated dogs most of which were owned. The study discusses the challenges in controlling rabies and possible reasons for non compliance to dog vaccination by the dog owners in Nyimba district.
