Since it was first identified, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness has been described as invariably fatal. Recent data however suggest that infection by T. b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in its human host including long lasting infections, that can be detected by the presence of antibodies, but in which parasites cannot be seen by microscopy; these cases are known as latent infections. While the factors determining, this varied response have not been clearly characterized, the effectors of the immune responses have been partially implicated as key players. We collected samples from people with active HAT, latent infections and controls in endemic foci in the Côte d’Ivoire. We tested the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 genes on susceptibility/resistance to HAT by means of a candidate gene association study. There was some evidence that variants of the genes for IL4, IL6, APOL1, HLAG, MIF and TNFA modified the risk of developing HAT. These proteins regulate the inflammatory response to many infections or are directly involved in killing the parasites. In this study, the results were statistically weak and would be inconclusive on their own, however other studies have also found associations in these genes, increasing the chance that the variants that we have identified play a genuine role in the response to trypanosome infection in Côte D’Ivoire.
