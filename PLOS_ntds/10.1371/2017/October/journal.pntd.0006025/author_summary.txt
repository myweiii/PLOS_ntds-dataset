Leishmania alternates its life cycle between the invertebrate host, in which the promastigote forms reside at pH 7.0 and approximately 25°C; and the mammalian host, in which the amastigote forms reside at pH 5.0 and approximately 37°C. These environmental changes submit the parasite to dynamic undergo modifications in morphology, metabolism, cellular signaling and gene expression regulation to allow for a rapid adaptation to the new environmental conditions. Leishmania is auxotrophic for many amino acids, such as L-arginine. The L-arginine availability is important for the uptake control by the parasite as well as the intracellular amino acids pool maintenance. Leishmania arginase uses L-arginine to produce urea and ornithine, being the last one a precursor of polyamine biosynthetic pathway, which is used by the parasite to replicate and to establish the infection. L-arginine uptake in L. amazonensis is performed through AAP3, which is encoded by two gene copies arranged in tandem on the genome (5.1 and 4.7 aap3). In this report, we characterized the AAP3 function and expression regulation in parasites maintained in different pH and temperature conditions simulating both insect and mammalian micro-environment. We submitted the parasites to amino acid starvation, simulating mid-gut starvation, a signal for promastigote metacyclogenesis. Our results demonstrated that the changes in temperature and pH, in addition with amino acid starvation or L-arginine supplementation might represent important signals for aap3 expression regulation, mainly for the 5.1 aap3 copy. We also linked the regulation of 5.1 aap3 transcript to the genetic background from the host macrophage. In addition, we localized the AAP3 in the plasma membrane and in the glycosome of L. amazonensis promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, indicating that arginine uptake is directed to this organelle.
