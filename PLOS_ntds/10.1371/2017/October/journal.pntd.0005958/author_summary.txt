Rabies remains a significant and costly zoonotic disease worldwide. While control of canine rabies can significantly diminish the threat to human health, spillover of rabies and related lyssaviruses from bats into terrestrial animals and humans continues to be an important issue. Here we describe the development of a novel rabies vaccine, using raccoonpox virus (RCN) as a viral vector, and a computer designed rabies virus mosaic antigen. We demonstrate that this new vaccine leads to protection against experimental challenge in wild caught big brown bats when administered oronasally or topically. This technology could be adapted to target other bat species and also be directly applicable toward control of vampire-bat associated rabies in Mexico and Central and South America.
