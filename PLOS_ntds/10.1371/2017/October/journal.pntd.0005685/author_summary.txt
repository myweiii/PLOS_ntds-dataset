Strongyloides stercoralis is an intestinal parasite that infects humans by penetrating intact skin. It thrives particularly in tropical countries with poor sanitation. Because it can replicate within its host, it causes long-lasting infections and is potentially fatal in patients with a disseminated infection. S. stercoralis is largely neglected due to the difficulty in detecting it with standard field diagnostic techniques but has recently been found to be very common in Cambodia, with prevalence rates exceeding 40%. It is difficult to identify symptoms associated with infection in endemic areas because co-infections with other helminths or protozoan parasites, which cause similar health problems, are common. We compared clinical signs in infected vs. non-infected participants living in eight villages in Northern Cambodia, and before and after treatment with ivermectin, the drug of choice against S. stercoralis, among 103 patients infected with S. stercoralis only. We also assessed the association between infection and growth retardation among children and adolescents. Of the participants, 31.1% were infected with S. stercoralis. Infected participants were more likely to report itching and urticaria. After treatment, fewer participants reported urticaria, abdominal pain, vomiting and, to a lesser extent, nausea, diarrhea, cough, and tiredness. S. stercoralis infection was associated with growth retardation as expressed by stunting.
