Mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of elephantiasis in the state of Kano in Nigeria, started in the year 2010. It was estimated that by 2015, the MDA programme will be extended to 11 remaining urban Local Government Areas (LGAs). However, MDA in urban areas faces specific challenges, the most prominent being the need to achieve coverage rates of 65% and above. As such MDA alone may not be sufficient to achieve the required programme impacts of reducing LF transmission to levels below which transmission cannot be sustained, and additional interventions may be required. This study set out to confirm the LF infection prevalence in the human and mosquito populations in three urban LGAs in Kano. Individuals were tested for signs of the disease, and mosquito samples were collected and also tested for the worms that cause the disease. The study revealed that of 981 people tested, none had circulating filarial antigen in the blood. However, the mosquitoes collected revealed the presence of the disease-causing worms, but the level of infection was low. The infection in the mosquitoes was also detected in two different types of mosquitoes. Based on the outcomes of this study, and evidence from other West African cities on the transmission of LF, the Federal Ministry of Health recommended that two rounds of MDA be undertaken in urban areas of Kano. A further reassessment after a couple of years is warranted.
