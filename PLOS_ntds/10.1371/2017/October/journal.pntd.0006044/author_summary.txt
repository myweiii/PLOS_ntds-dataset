Opisthorchiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the liver flukes of the Opisthorchiidae family (Trematoda; Platyhelminthes). The liver fluke infections trigger development of the hepatobiliary pathologies such as chronic forms of cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and cholelithiasis. However, the most threatening effect of the Opisthorchiidae infection is an increased risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. With this work we are getting an insight into a host response on Opisthorchiidae infection using a metabolomics approach. Metabolomics is a post-genomic discipline studying the metabolome. The dynamic character of the metabolome, its ability to change in response to the external stimuli makes it an optimal “readout” for exploratory studies aiming for the description of the systemic responses of an organism. Using this approach we demonstrate that that early response to the O. felineus infection unfolds in a gender-dependent manner. Moreover, with this first exploratory analysis of the metabolic response to O. felineus infection in an animal model we present a subset of the metabolites changing during the early phase of the infection and offer a possible physiological interpretation.
