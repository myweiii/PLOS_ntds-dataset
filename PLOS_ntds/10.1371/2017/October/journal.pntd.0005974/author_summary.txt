Children in Sub-Saharan Africa experience frequent enteric infections and antibiotics are often used to treat diarrheal disease. Some bacterial causes of diarrhea have developed resistance to commonly used antibiotics yet this information is rarely available to managing clinicians. We sought to identify which children have antibiotic resistance in hopes that such information could guide clinical decision-making and possible intervention points for reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance. Among children with a bacterial infection identified in stool, nearly all had resistance to at least one antibiotic, and most had bacteria that were resistant to at least three. Children who were younger, those who had an HIV-infected biological mother, and those who were acutely malnourished were more likely to have resistance to at least three antibiotics. This is concerning since these groups of children suffer frequent infections for which antibiotics may be necessary. We also found that children with limited access to flushing toilets and those who lived in crowded homes were more likely to have resistance to at least three antibiotics. Reducing contamination in a childâ€™s home environment may help in controlling antibiotic resistance.
