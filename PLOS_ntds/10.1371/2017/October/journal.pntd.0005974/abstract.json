    "Background": "Reduced antimicrobial susceptibility threatens treatment efficacy in sub-Saharan Africa, where data on the burden and correlates of antibiotic resistance among enteric pathogens are limited.",
    "Methods": "Fecal samples from children aged 6 mos—15 yrs presenting with acute diarrhea in western Kenya were cultured for bacterial pathogens. HIV-uninfected children with identified Shigella or Salmonella species or pathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC, ETEC, EAEC or EIEC) were included in this cross-sectional sub-study. Non-susceptibility to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline was determined using MicroScan Walkaway40 Plus. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to identify correlates of multi-drug non-susceptibility (MDNS, non-susceptibility to ≥ 3 of these antibiotics).",
    "Results": "Of 292 included children, median age was 22.5 mos. MDNS was identified in 62.5% of 318 isolates. Non-susceptibility to cotrimoxazole (92.8%), ampicillin (81.3%), and tetracycline (75.0%) was common. Young age (6–24 mos vs. 24–59 mos adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.519 [95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.91]), maternal HIV (aPR = 1.29 [1.01, 1.66]); and acute malnutrition (aPR = 1.28 [1.06, 1.55]) were associated with higher prevalence of MDNS, as were open defecation (aPR = 2.25 [1.13, 4.50]), household crowding (aPR = 1.29 [1.08, 1.53]) and infrequent caregiver hand-washing (aPR = 1.50 [1.15, 1.95]).",
    "Conclusions": "Young age, HIV exposure, acute malnutrition and poor sanitation may increase risk of antibiotic non-susceptible enteric pathogen infections among children in Kenya."
