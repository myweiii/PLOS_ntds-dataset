Hemorrhagic fever viruses have become of much greater importance in recent years. The more prominent presence of these viruses in a day-to-day setting and their impact on global health has had a positive impact on studying these viruses. Resolving their disease mechanisms and ways to intervene in their replication and associated health burden will stay a challenge for the upcoming decades. This challenge also counts for hantavirus, an emerging zoonosis. No vaccine or antiviral treatment is WHO prequalified or has shown to elicit a good protective or therapeutic antiviral response in humans. One of the main reasons is the lack of good animal disease models and the research focusing on this topic. Without a representative model, it is difficult to investigate new potential drugs. Within this setting we focused on establishing a disease model for the most prominent New World hantaviruses.
