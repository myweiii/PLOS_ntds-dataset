Firstly we are very grateful to the study participants, for volunteering their time and samples, and to the headteachers for accommodating this survey. The survey would not have been possible without the team of data collectors, drawn from the regionâ€™s health offices. Thanks are due to Mr. Nigussie Geletu for organizing and overseeing the data input process, and to the data clerks of the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, for carrying it out. We also thank Dr. Michelle N Clements, Mr. Neerav Dhanani, Mr. Udo Wittmann, and Dr. Martin Walker for their guidance on the statistical analysis, and Dr. Laura J Appleby for her helpful suggestions in the preparation of this paper.
