There are currently few data sets available to aid programmes in planning and budgeting for population-based surveys in low- and middle- income countries. With the objective of identifying cost drivers and key variables influencing prevalence survey costs, the authors collected expenses incurred during the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) which surveyed 2.6 million people across 29 countries. Expenditure from surveying 1,164 districts in 17 countries was analysed. Our results showed that the majority of in-country expenditure was spent on personnel (per diems, accommodation, meals and beverages) (49%) and local transportation (44%) and that the median survey expenditure was US$11,675 per district (or US$15,839 per evaluation unit, US$625 per cluster and US$4.9 per person examined). There were large variations in survey unit costs across settings, based on local geographic, demographic, seasonal effects and local operational characteristics. In addition, the resources required for the global support and coordination of the GTMP were analysed and amounted to US$5.1m (US$3,318 per district or US$5,668 per EU). Global support expenses can be substantial for a large multi-country mapping exercise conducted in a limited period of time such as the GTMP. Findings from this study can be used to inform other disease mapping projects, and to inform planning and budgeting for the prevalence surveys that will assess the impact of trachoma elimination interventions.
