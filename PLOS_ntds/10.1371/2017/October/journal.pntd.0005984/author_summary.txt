Biomphalaria pfeifferi is the worldâ€™s most important snail vector for the widespread human-infecting blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. Despite this, we know relatively little about the biology of this highly compatible African snail host of S. mansoni, especially for specimens from the field. Using an Illumina-based dual-seq approach, we captured a portrait of the transcriptional responses of Kenyan snails that were either uninfected with S. mansoni, or that harbored 1-day, 3-day, or cercariae-producing infections. Responses to infection were influenced both by the extent of schistosome gene expression and infection duration. We note and discuss several alterations in transcriptional activity in immune, stress and reproduction related genes in infected snails and the B. pfeifferi symbionts detected. Several host genes were highly up-regulated following infection and these might comprise excellent candidates for disruption to diminish compatibility. This study provides for the first time a large sequence dataset to help in interpreting the important vector role of B. pfeifferi in transmission of S. mansoni, including with an emphasis on more natural, field-derived specimens.
