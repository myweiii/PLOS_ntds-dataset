Soil-transmitted helminthiases (STHs) caused by roundworm, whipworm or hookworm affect over one billion of the worldâ€™s poorest people mostly living in low and middle income countries, exerting a major health and economic toll. These infections are controlled by regular mass drug distribution to affected populations. But with very few alternative medicines, the effectiveness of treatment programmes is vulnerable to the potential emergence of drug resistance. Despite a recent scale-up of mass drug distribution, systematic monitoring and evaluation of the efficacy of treatment is too rarely undertaken and our knowledge of how the drugs are performing is largely based on information from clinical trials. However, the design and reporting of information from these trials is very variable which makes it difficult to form a comprehensive picture of the status and trends in drug efficacy. Here, we present a systematic review of published studies completed since 2000, characterise variation in their design, implementation and reporting and estimate the abundance of individual participant data. We argue that the co-ordinated sharing of these individual data would greatly increase the capacity of the global health community to monitor effectively drug efficacy, to respond accordingly to changes, and thereby to safeguard the effectiveness of STH control.
