Many people are afflicted in the world by cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The pathogen in this disease is an intracellular parasite. In 2007, The World Health Organization, defined leishmaniasis as a neglected disease. Many treatment modalities have been recommended for cutaneous leishmaniasis, but success rates remain limited. Experimental studies have shown the anti-leishmanial and curative effects of extract of fruits and leaves of Juniperus excelsa (J. excelsa), but there are no documentation in this regard in humans. This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial which evaluated the efficacy of the leaf extract of J. excelsa M. Bieb on human CL. According to the results of this present study, topical J. excelsa M. Bieb hydroalcoholic extract could be a good choice for treatment of CL in conjunction with cryotherapy. Using this extract along with cryotherapy can decrease the duration of CL treatment and also increase the success rate of CL treatment without any significant adverse effect.
