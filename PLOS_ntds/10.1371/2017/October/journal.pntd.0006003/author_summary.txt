Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are a relevant public health problem in resource restricted settings due to their potential to perpetuate poverty, since chronic infections are associated with learning and grow impairment in children and reduced productivity in adults. The current strategy for STH control gives a key role to preventive chemotherapy of risk groups (preschool and school age children and women of childbearing age) with anthelmintic drugs. The drugs recommended for regular deworming are albendazole or mebendazole. This strategy does not target Strongyloides stercoralis, an STH resistant to the recommended drugs in single doses. The efficacy of ivermectin, alone or in combination, for the treatment of Strongyloides stercoralis infection has been reported in controlled trials. We conducted a pragmatic study aiming to assess the effectiveness of community based preventive chemotherapy with albendazole plus ivermectin for the control of STH prevalence and morbidity, in endemic communities of Northwestern Argentina. We found high baseline prevalence of hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis and significant nutritional and hematological morbidity associated with these infections. After three rounds of preventive chemotherapy with albendazole and ivermectin we observed a significant decline in the prevalence of infection and in the prevalence and severity of morbidity.
