We are grateful to the members of the Institute Cell Biology and Neurobiology, National Research Council: Donato Cioli and Livia Pica-Mattoccia for sharing with us their expertise. We also like to thank Giacomo Paonessa, IRBM Science Park S.p.A. for helpful discussions. A special thanks to: Giulia Bolasco and Emerald Perlas of the Epigenetics and Neurobiology unit, EMBL Rome for assistance with microscopy and histology; Flavio Sabatini and Fabrizio Lattanzi for mouse husbandry and Pierluigi Palozzo for dishwashing lab technical support.
We would like to dedicate this work to Sergio Altamura who prematurely passed away at the age of 59. Sergio was the concrete basement top of which we felt comfortable in building our science and to certain extent our lives. We miss you.
