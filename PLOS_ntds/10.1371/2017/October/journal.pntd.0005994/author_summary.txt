Schistosomiasis is a neglected disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. The disease affects hundreds of millions of people in developing countries in the poorest tropical and subtropical regions of the world and it represents a major public health and socio-economical problem in several countries. In humans, these blood flukes reside in the mesenteric and vesicle venules. They have a life span of many years and produce hundreds of eggs daily, which are able to pass through the gut lumen or the bladder to be finally excreted into the environment for maintaining the life cycle. Part of the eggs can be trapped in host tissues inducing immunologically mediated granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis leading eventually to severe sequelae such as hepatosplenomegaly and even death. Importantly, schistosome infections increase susceptibility to other parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases. To date, essentially a single drug, praziquantel, is available to treat this parasitic disease. Despite its high tolerability and efficacy against adult parasites it has an incomplete efficacy across all stages of the S. mansoni life cycle and it does not prevent reinfection. Moreover the potential risk of drug resistance is an increasing concern. In search of novel schistosomicidal molecules we screened a large compound collection using the schistosomula, larval stage of the parasite. We identified eight novel molecules able to impair viability of schistosomula, juvenile and adult worms and also egg formation and production, two important features required for both disease transmission and progression.
