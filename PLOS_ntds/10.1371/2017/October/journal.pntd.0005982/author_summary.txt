Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma, is still a huge burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The modalities for its control are mass treatment of the population with praziquantel, minimising contact with infested water, provision and use of safe water, intermediate host snail control and disposal of stool in toilets/latrines. For sustainable control of the parasite, the recipient communities need to embrace the interventions. In this study, we investigated the perceptions of fishing communities on the Lake Victoria Islands about interventions to control schistosomiasis and their willingness to participate in Schistosoma vaccine trials. We assessed their knowledge of schistosomiasis, their views on the interventions and the interventions most acceptable to them. We show that the community members of this schistosomiasis-endemic area prefer mass treatment with praziquantel, safe water supplies and use of toilets to minimise contact with infested water and snail control. The communities are also willing to participate in Schistosoma vaccine trials. This information is valuable to policy makers and programme implementers intending to set up interventions co-managed by the recipient communities. In addition, the study provides support for future Schistosoma vaccine trials in these communities.
