Babesia spp are garnering more attention as causative agents of human disease, with B. microti responsible for most cases globally. Our study documents potential small mammal reservoir hosts, collected from a large of sample sites, with PCR and sequencing identifying the wide distribution and genetic diversity of endemic B. microti in Southwestern China. Our study adds to body of literature on Babesia in China, while focusing on potential rodent reservoirs of disease. This report will be important for public health, and for researchers in the field of parasitology.
