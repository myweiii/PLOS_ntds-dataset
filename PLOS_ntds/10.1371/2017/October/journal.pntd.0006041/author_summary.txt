Rabies has been repeatedly reported among dog populations in Cameroon, especially in Yaounde, its capital city. However, the relative rates and genetic variability of Rabies Virus (RABV) variants circulating among dog populations in Cameroon are still to be documented. This study aimed to estimate the frequency and genetic diversity of RABV isolates originating from rabid dogs in the southern regions of Cameroon from 2010 to 2016. Overall, 76 of the 100 dog-derived RABV isolates sampled in Cameroon from 2010 to 2016 were successfully characterized. Our findings revealed that studied isolates belonged to the dog-related species 1 of the Lyssavirus genus, specifically 70 Africa-1a, 1 Africa-1b and 5 Africa-2 group-E lineages. The general phylogenetic pattern suggested an in-country geographic differentiation of the circulating RABV variants. This apparent geographic differentiation was contradicted by striking outcasts indicating importation from close or distant regions. Overall, this study uncovered the co-circulation of several Africa-1 and Africa-2 lineages in some southern regions of Cameroon, thus providing base-line molecular data that would be of interest for future stages of implementation of the rabies surveillance and control plan that is being setup in Cameroon.
