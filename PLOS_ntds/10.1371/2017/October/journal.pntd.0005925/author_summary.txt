Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is an ectoparasitic skin disease and belongs to the group of NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases). It is caused by sand fleas penetrating into the skin of the feet, causing an inflammatory reaction with pain and itching. Attempts to remove the flea with inappropriate sharp tools are painful and cause bacterial superinfection, eventually leading to restricted mobility. In resource-poor communities without access to health care, prevention is the most valuable control measure. In this study we identified important risk factors for the occurrence of tungiasis and sever disease. The most relevant risk factors were poor hygiene practices and poor housing conditions. Simple control interventions such as having solid walls and floors in the house, improved access to water and washing with soap could reduce the disease burden considerably.
