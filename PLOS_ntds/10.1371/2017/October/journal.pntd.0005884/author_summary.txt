As onchocerciasis control programs succeed and transition to elimination efforts, different diagnostic tools are needed. The goal of this study was to determine if integrating the Ov16 rapid test is feasible based on acceptability, usability, and cost. A study was conducted in 13 villages in southeastern Senegal in May 2016. Community members were invited to participate in a demographic questionnaire, a rapid test, a skin snip biopsy, and an acceptability interview. Technicians were also interviewed and a costing analysis was conducted. Out of 1,173 participants, 1,169 (99.7%) agreed to the rapid test while 383 (32.7%) agreed to skin snip microscopy. The rapid test result was reactive in 2.6% of those tested, while none of the skin snips were positive. Community members thought the rapid test was performed quickly, was not painful, and provided reliable results. If no one had refused skin snip microscopy, the total cost would have been around $16 per person tested for either method. In this area with little if any remaining onchocerciasis, there was high acceptability and perceived value of the rapid test. This study suggests that implementing the Ov16 rapid test in Senegal is feasible and these findings may be informative to other country programs.
