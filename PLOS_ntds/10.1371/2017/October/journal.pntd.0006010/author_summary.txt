The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has resulted in a severe threat to public health. ZIKV is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, thus it is important to understand virus-vector interactions. Analysis of ZIKV infection in mosquito cells indicated that two RNA interference pathways are involved during infection: the exogenous short-interfering (si)RNA (exo-siRNA) and PIWI-interacting (pi)RNA pathways. If Dcr2, an enzyme responsible for cleaving dsRNA into siRNAs, is knocked out, ZIKV replication is increased compared to control cells. However, the knockdown of Ago2 expression had no significant enhancing effect on ZIKV replication. In the case of the PIWI pathway, only the Piwi4 protein was found to have significant antiviral activity. Furthermore, unlike the capsid (C) protein of yellow fever virus, ZIKV capsid protein does not suppress the siRNA pathway. These results suggest that ZIKV has mechanisms to evade mosquito innate immunity and it is therefore important to understand these virus-vector interactions and the implications they have on transmission.
