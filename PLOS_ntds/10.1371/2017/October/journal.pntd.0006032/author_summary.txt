Rabies is a zoonotic disease. More than 95% of human rabies deaths is dog mediated. Rabies a 100% fatal yet preventable disease; a major public health problem in most of the Asian countries including India. The reduction in human rabies deaths is possible only when our clinical fraternity are aware of WHO recommended rabies post exposure prophylaxis to be offered to animal bite victims. With this in mind, a study was done among clinical fraternities and post graduates of Medicine, Surgery and Paediatrics departments of three tertiary care teaching hospitals affiliated to a medical college. It was observed that, the knowledge regarding reservoir of rabies infection and modes of transmission of rabies infection was satisfactory but the knowledge regarding WHO categorisation of animal exposure and recommended rabies post exposure prophylaxis was inadequate. Bridging this knowledge gap through periodically conducted Continuous Medical Education, Workshops and hands on training is essential for reducing human rabies deaths.
