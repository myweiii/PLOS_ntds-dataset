Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination by 2020. This elimination requires a better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical evolution of this disease. Beside the classical clinical evolution, asymptomatic carriers, seropositive and spontaneous cure of infected persons have been reported in West Africa. Arguments in favor of human genetic susceptibility to HAT have been raised to explain this variability in clinical presentation. This study investigated the genetic polymorphism of 17 genes between controls and sleeping sickness patients in Southern Cameroon in order to improve our knowledge of human susceptibility to trypanosome infections. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in 17 selected genes involved in immune responses and carried out a case-control candidate gene association study and demonstrated differences between variants associated with the disease. From these genes, only haptoglobin (HP) at the SNP rs8062041 was found to have polymorphisms which were strongly associated with trypanosomiasis. The minor allele (T) at this SNP position appeared to be protective against HAT (p = 0.0002395, OR 0.359 (CI95 [0.204â€“0.6319])) reducing the risk of developing disease approximately threefold. The haptoglobin related protein (HPR) is adjacent to HP and is a component of the Trypanolytic factor that kills trypanosomes. The HP and HPR locus is duplicated in some people. The rs8062041 variant may be associated with this duplication and it is possible that increased production of HPR is the cause of the protection associated with rs8062041. The results reported here will contribute to the knowledge of the role of human genetics in disease progression, and thus lead to the identification of novel biomarkers which could involve development of new diagnostics, treatments and intervention strategies.
