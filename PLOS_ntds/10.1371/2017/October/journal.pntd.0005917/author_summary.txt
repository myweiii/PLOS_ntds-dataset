Culex quinquefasciatus is a primary vector of arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) in temperate regions, and in many tropical/sub-tropical regions is implicated in the transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF). Insecticide-based approaches are one of the most important interventions to mitigate disease burden; nevertheless, increased resistance of vectors to insecticides poses a challenge for sustainability and effectiveness of both current and future vector control interventions. Here, Cx. quinquefasciatus collected across a transect from Eastern to South Western Uganda were utilized to infer the likely pattern of the evolution of insecticide resistance among populations through a combination of putative selective loci (the target-site mutations Vgsc-1014F and Ace1-119S) and 26 neutral microsatellite markers. Taken together, the results yielded by these markers provide evidence that Ugandan Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes are under heterogeneous selection pressure imposed by insecticides from distinct classes.
