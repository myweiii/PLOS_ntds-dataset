This study presents an updated view of the P. vivax populations along the Thai-Myanmar and the Thai-Cambodian borders. Genotyping of parasite samples collected after intensified malaria control demonstrated that despite the decline in overall transmission intensity, the genetic diversity of the P. vivax parasites remained high. Parasite populations from three border provinces showed clear genetic separation. This indicates successful interruption of parasite gene flow within Thailand, but suggests frequent parasite migration across international borders. From the analysis of 10 microsatellite markers, we further refined a set of four that are sufficient for distinguishing the provincial origins of these parasites, which should allow tracking of parasite introduction among these provinces.
