    "Abstract": "The helminth Schistosoma mansoni modulates the infected host’s immune system to facilitate its own survival, by producing excretory/secretory molecules that interact with a variety of the host’s cell types including those of the immune system. Herein, we characterise the S. mansoni adult male worm secretome and identify 111 proteins, including 7 vaccine candidates and several molecules with potential immunomodulatory activity. Amongst the molecules present in the secretome, a 17-19kDa protein analogous to human cyclophilin A was identified. Given the ability of cyclophilin A to modulate the immune system by regulating antigen presenting cell activity, we sought to determine whether recombinant S. mansoni Cyclophilin A (rSmCypA) is capable of modulating bone-marrow derived dendritic cell (BMDC) and T cell responses under in vitro conditions. rSmCypA was enzymatically active and able to alter the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of LPS-activated dendritic cells. rSmCypA also modulated DC function in the induction of CD4+ T cell proliferation with a preferential expansion of Treg cells. This work demonstrates the unique protein composition of the S. mansoni male worm secretome and immunomodulatory activity of S. mansoni Cyclophilin A."
