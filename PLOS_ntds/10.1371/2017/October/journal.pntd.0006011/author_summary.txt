Leprosy reactions (Type 1 and 2) are important causes of nerve damage and illness. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) also called type 2 reactions is a severe multisystem immune-mediated complication of borderline and lepromatous leprosy. ENL causes high morbidity and mortality and usually requires urgent medical attention. ENL can occur before, during, or after completion of MDT. The diagnosis and treatment of ENL is largely based on clinical symptoms. However, the clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may vary from patient to patient. Although thalidomide is an effective drug for ENL treatment, it is not available in many leprosy endemic countries including Ethiopia. In spite of its adverse effects, in many endemic countries corticosteroid is the only available drug for ENL treatment, usually being used for prolonged periods. Therefore, alternative and effective drugs are required to reduce the burden of ENL. To establish which drugs will be effective in the treatment of ENL it is necessary to have a clear picture of the clinical and histological features of the disease. We systematically documented these features of ENL and compared them with matched non-reactional LL controls. Thus, the findings will help to develop better ENL diagnosis and treatment options.
