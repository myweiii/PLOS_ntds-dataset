Dengue represents a major worldwide concern for public health. Clinical complications rely on vascular leak of fluids and molecules from the bloodstream that leads to a potentially fatal hemodynamic compromise. Disease progression has been related to poor control of dengue virus (DENV) dissemination and excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators that affect the endothelial function. Vitamin D has been shown to modulate immune responses and to alleviate dengue disease. Here, we studied how addition of vitamin D during macrophage differentiation modulates the functional features of these cells in the context of DENV infection. We observed that vitamin D reduced susceptibility of these cells to DENV infection and down-regulated the virus-induced cytokine response. This phenotype was attributed to downregulation of MR, a molecule hijacked by the virus to gain entry into the cells and a key receptor of the MR/CLEC5A complex that links binding and immune activation during DENV infection. Our study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin D can restrict DENV dissemination and the cytokine response in macrophages, indicating the potential relevance of this hormone as a preventive and therapeutic candidate.
