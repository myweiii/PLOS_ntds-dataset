Dengue epidemics have posed a great burden expanding of disease, with areas expanding and incidence increasing in China recently. It has remained challenging to develop a robust and accurate forecast model and enhance predictability of dengue incidence. Several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression algorithm, step-down linear regression model, gradient boosted regression tree algorithm, negative binomial regression model, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator linear regression model and generalized additive model, were compared and evaluated to forecast dengue incidence in this study. The SVR model, based on selection by a cross-validation technique, was superior to other models assessed using weekly dengue surveillance data, Baidu search query data and meteorological data during 2011â€“2014 in Guangdong province. The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed SVR model to predict the occurrence of an outbreak was also validated using data from other provinces, including Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian and Zhejiang, spanning southern China. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to thoroughly evaluate different algorithms for dengue incidence prediction. Our identification of the optimal model will help to precisely track dengue dynamics in the country.
