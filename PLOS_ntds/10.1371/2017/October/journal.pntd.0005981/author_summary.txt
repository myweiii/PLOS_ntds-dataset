Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne disease worldwide and it is an increasing global concern for public health as its etiological agent, dengue virus (DENV), keeps spreading around the globe. Currently there are no specific antiviral therapies available to treat the disease. Macrophages are important target cells during natural DENV infection of humans. Here, we unraveled the importance of miRNAs in DENV replication in human primary macrophages. The expression profile of miRNAs was determined in truly DENV-infected cells and cells that were exposed but not productively infected by the virus by RNA sequencing. We revealed that only five miRNAs are regulated in primary macrophages challenged with DENV. These results show that miRNAs do not play a major role in DENV replication. Unexpectedly, we did identify a miRNA with moderate yet significant antiviral properties to DENV. Moreover, miRNA-3614-5p was found to not only decrease DENV but also West Nile virus infectivity. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis identified adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) as one of the targets. Moreover, ADAR1 was observed to promote the early stages of DENV replication. Collectively, our study broadens the knowledge of the contribution of human miRNAs in shaping the network of interactions between DENV and its human host cells.
