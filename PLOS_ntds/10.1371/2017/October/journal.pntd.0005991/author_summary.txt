Anopheles balabacensis has been incriminated as the primary vector of zoonotic simian malaria, P. knowlesi in Malaysian Borneo with a high prevalence recorded in the states of Sabah and Sarawak. In this study, Anopheles spp. were sampled using human landing catch (HLC) method at Paradason village in Kudat district of Sabah. Total DNA was extracted from these specimens, followed by sequencing the SSU rRNA gene of Plasmodium using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection and identification of Plasmodium. PCR results showed that only 1.61% (23/1,425) of the screened An. balabacensis had either single or double Plasmodium spp infections. The simian malaria parasites isolated from An. balabacensis were P. coatneyi, P. inui, P. fieldi, P. cynomologi and P. knowlesi. Sequence analysis of these Plasmodium isolates showed high percentage of identity within the same Plasmodium sp. group. Consensus sequences phylogenetic tree of P. knowlesi isolates from An. balabacensis, human patients and a long-tailed macaque from the same locality had 99.7%â€“100.0% nucleotide identity. This study suggests a close genetic relationship between the parasites isolated from these hosts.
