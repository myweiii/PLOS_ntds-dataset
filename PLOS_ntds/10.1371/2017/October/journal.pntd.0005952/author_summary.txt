Nerve damage is a common and severe consequence of leprosy, and it can lead to impairment of sensory (sensibility) or motor (muscle) function of hand, feet and eyes. To prevent that the nerve damage becomes permanent, it is essential that new damage is treated in an early stage. Prednisolone, an immune suppressor, is the drug of choice. However, the ideal treatment duration is unknown. In our study, we compared a prednisolone treatment of 20 weeks with a longer treatment of 32 weeks. After the follow up period of 1.5 years, the percentage of patients with an improved or completely restored nerve function was the same in the two treatment groups, namely 78%. We can conclude that the longer treatment duration was not more effective, and that 20 weeks of prednisolone is sufficient to treat early nerve damage in most patients. We also found that in 15% of the patients neither one of the treatments was effective. For this specific group, more research needs to be done to find if alternative medication or perhaps even longer prednisolone treatment can be helpful.
