Of the three diseases targeted for eradication by WHO, two are Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)â€“guinea worm disease and yaws. The decision to pursue eradication of these diseases was based, in part, on economic arguments made at a time when case numbers were high. There is, in fact, little published evidence of the cost and cost-effectiveness of an eradication programme in the end game, when the number of cases is lower and the cost per case is higher than at any other time. The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016. Ours is the first economic evaluation of the GWEP since a World Bank study in 1997. For the first time for any eradication programme, we document the full cost of certifying the absence of transmission in all countries with a history of the disease. We analyze the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP to find that it remains highly cost-effective in spite of high costs in the end game. These results will be of interest to funders of guinea worm disease and yaws eradication, but also to policy makers considering eradication of other NTDs.
