The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a roadmap for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis morbidity control and interruption of transmission with targets to be reached by 2025. Control efforts require reliable estimates of at-risk populations, number of infections, and disease burden estimates in population subgroups in terms of age and location. Intervention guidelines are based on insensitive diagnostic techniques, such as the Kato-Katz method and do not take into account the effect of sampling effort and infection intensity. Our proposed methodology estimates the infection intensity-dependent sensitivity and the ‘true’ age-prevalence of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm. We also provide recommendations on the number of stool samples required and the methodology to be used to reliably estimate the ‘true’ prevalence of parasitic worm infections.
