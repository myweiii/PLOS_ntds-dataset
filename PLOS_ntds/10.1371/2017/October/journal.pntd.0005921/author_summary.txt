Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite (Leishmania) and transmitted to humans through the bite of a sandfly. South Sudan is one of the highest endemic countries for VL, frequently affected by epidemics. In South Sudan are different treatment options for VL available: the standard therapy given on ambulatory bases by intramuscular injections for 17 days, and specialized treatment for patients with severe VL, administered intravenously in a hospital over 12 days. In the extremely resource limited context of South Sudan, the most optimal treatment to patients with severe VL should be provided, but a rational use of drugs maintained. In this study, we identified risk factors for death in VL patients of South Sudan, and based on these risk factors we developed a severity scoring system. This severity scoring system will be a clinical decision making tool for allocation of VL patients to the appropriate treatment and to minimise the mortality of the VL patients in South Sudan.
