The Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) recombinase polymerase amplification assay is a new, rapid and portable diagnostic method. It has been developed for the detection of infection with CCHF virus (CCHFV), the cause of a deadly haemorrhagic disease in humans and an emerging global health threat. As a rapid diagnostic suitable for use on a portable and lightweight detection device, this has the potential to be used for fast-turnaround diagnosis at the point of need, providing timely results to clinicians at the bedside and preventing the spread of virus in the hospital setting. As a portable diagnostic it would also enable the diagnosis of CCHFV to be taken out of the laboratory during an outbreak, enabling testing in field laboratories or community clinics.
