Mapping is used by lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs to determine if mass drug administration (MDA) is required. The current mapping approach, designed to be simple and practical, has worked well in high-prevalence settings but concerns about its reliability in low-prevalence settings have been raised. To address these concerns, a confirmatory mapping strategy was developed that utilizes probability-based sampling of school attending children to determine if the prevalence of LF antigenemia is below a 2% threshold. The confirmatory mapping strategy was implemented in 45 districts in Ethiopia and 10 in Tanzania where the need for MDA was uncertain. In 52 of the 55 districts, the number of LF antigen-positive children identified by the confirmatory mapping strategy was below the predetermined threshold and MDA was deemed unnecessary, while in three districts the number of positive children exceeded the threshold, suggesting that MDA is required. The use of this mapping strategy, to confirm whether MDA is required, is estimated to have saved the Ethiopian and Tanzanian programs $9,293,219 by avoiding unnecessary MDA in 52 districts.
