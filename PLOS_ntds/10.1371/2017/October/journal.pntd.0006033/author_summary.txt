The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel for control of schistosomiasis. The target group for and the frequency of treatment are based on infections levels in school age children at the initiation of the control program. However, these guidelines have not been rigorously evaluated. Through the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), we had the opportunity to compare the impact of school-based treatment in an area of western Kenya with moderate (10%-24%) initial prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infections. We found that providing MDA every year or every other year over a 4 year period provided similar benefits for reducing prevalence and intensity of infection in the final evaluation at year 5. Annual or biennial MDA moved villages from the “moderate risk” to the “low risk category” prescribed in the WHO guidelines. The results from this study and parallel SCORE studies in other African countries should provide the evidence base necessary for improved WHO guidelines for schistosomiasis.
