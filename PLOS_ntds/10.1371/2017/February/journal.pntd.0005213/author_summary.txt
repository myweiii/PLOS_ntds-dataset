Parasitic infections, such as worms and malaria, have potent effects on the human immune system. These effects include modification of immune responses in the fetus and infant if a mother has a parasitic infection during pregnancy. These immunological changes can influence the way a child responds to the same infection when exposed in later life. It has been suggested that the immunological changes might also influence how the child responds to the vaccines given in infancy, and that treating mothers for parasitic infections when they are pregnant might be helpful. In this study we compared responses to vaccines between infants of mothers who had, or had not, been treated for worms while they were pregnant. We found no overall differences. We also compared vaccine responses between groups of mothers with and without parasitic infections. We found no evidence that the parasitic infections were associated with reduced responses in the children. This means that, although treating worms during pregnancy may have some benefits, improvements in the childrenâ€™s responses to vaccines are not likely to be among them.
