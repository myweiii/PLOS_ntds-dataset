Methods to predict protein function based on sequences enable the rapid annotation of newly sequenced genomes. However, as most of these methods rely on homology-based approaches, non-conserved proteins in trypanosomatids remain elusive for annotation, rendering approximately half of the sequenced proteins uncharacterized. In this study, we developed a user friendly integrated database, TrypsNetDB, which fills multiple gaps in the field by depositing the current interactome knowledge on trypanosomatid proteins and combining this information with other available resources accompanied by related statistical analyses. The database allows automatic inter-species mapping of available data to better characterize the queried proteins in the species of interest. The database is built on fast and reliable ASP.Net framework and provides (i) a significant increase in the genome-wide functional annotation of trypanosomatid proteins, (ii) potential novel targets for therapeutics against trypanosomatids, and (iii) a robust methodology that can be adapted for the functional annotation of other non-model organisms.
