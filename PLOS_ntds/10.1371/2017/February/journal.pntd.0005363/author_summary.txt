Previously thought to produce a harmless bout of fever associated with skin rash and muscle, or joint pain, the Zika virus (ZIKV) is an important cause of morbidity/mortality to human embryos/fetuses. Different from other models, here we report data from wild-type immunocompetent mice, rather than transgenic animals with suppressed immune responses. We found that intravascular ZIKV produced infection of maternal tissues, placentas and conceptuses, but that embryos/fetuses were comparatively much more affected than pregnant females, which seemed to tolerate well the viral challenge with no signs of encephalopathy. Importantly, 10.5 days post-coitum (dpc) embryos exposed to ZIKV at embryonic day 5 (second week in humans) displayed dysraphia, which is a regional failure of neural tube closure, and hydrocephalus, which is a symptom recently shown to precede microcephaly in humans. Characteristic phenotypes in more developed embryos/fetuses included abnormal articular postures analogous to arthrogryposis, which are typical human congenital contractures, gross and generalized malformations and intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR), rather than isolated microcephaly. Some developmental abnormalities and IUGR correlated with placental damage, suggesting that loss of placental function may play an important role in the disease. We believe our model is an asset in the search for useful concepts and prospective therapies for ZIKV because it better reproduces the human condition.
