Ebola virus infected individuals may generate up to nine liters of potentially infectious liquid waste per day. Previous recommendations were to directly dispose of this waste into a sanitary sewer or latrine; however, release of infectious virus raised the concern of environmental transmission through unintentional contact with contaminated wastewater. One possibility to reduce or eliminate the release of infectious virus is disinfection of Ebola virus contaminated liquid waste. A hurdle to making recommendations for liquid waste disinfection is the lack of data on disinfection efficacy. Here we demonstrate that Ebola virus in municipal wastewater is highly sensitive to disinfection in the presence of free chlorine. In addition, elevating the pH to 11.2 significantly increased the rate of decay over neutral pH conditions. These results provide a basis to develop recommendations for the disinfection of Ebola virus contaminated wastewater.
