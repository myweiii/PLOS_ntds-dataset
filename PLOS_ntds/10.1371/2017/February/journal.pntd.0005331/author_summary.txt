Buruli ulcer (BU), currently endemic in more than 30 countries, particularly in West and Central Africa, causes chronic necrotising disease of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue. The task is twofold, specific therapy directed against the causative agent Mycobacterium ulcerans and general wound management to get the often very large skin defects closed. Irrespective of wound etiology, healing requires favorable systemic conditions such as balanced nutrition, protection from trauma and infection, moist wound environment, and pain control. The authors compared wound healing in BU patients and the infrastructure and wound care practices at two levels of the healthcare system in Ghana. Our results indicate that with the basic infrastructure at the primary health care level, equipment and supplies at appropriate quality standards, well-trained health staff and adherence to established Buruli ulcer treatment and wound management guidelines, most wounds can be adequately managed. We further determined the outcome of clinically BU suspicious but not laboratory confirmed wounds and found that careful follow-up is needed to not miss important diagnoses requiring specific therapy. Patient centered care needs a horizontal approach to wound management.
