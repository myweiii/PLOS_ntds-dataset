Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and parasitic worm infections are typical diseases of poverty. They often overlap geographically, and can occur in the same individual. Parasitic worm infections contribute to the down-regulation of the essential immune response against TB, and therefore can increase progression from latent M. tuberculosis infection to active TB. We conducted a case-control study in Dar es Salaam, the economic capital of Tanzania, where TB and helminths constitute a considerable burden. We found that infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni was associated with active TB, while none of the other parasitic worms showed such an association. Interestingly, TB patients infected with S. mansoni had significantly lower sputum bacterial load at diagnosis and tended to have fewer lung cavitations compared with TB patients without any parasitic worm infection. Diagnosis and treatment of parasitic worm infections, particularly schistosomiasis, should be considered during the management of TB patients and in the context of TB control programs. This could help to reduce the TB burden in settings where TB and parasitic worms co-exist.
