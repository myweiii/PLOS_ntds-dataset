Orientia tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of scrub typhus, one of the most common of the rickettsioses in Pacific Asia. Although the disease is an important public health issue in Vietnam, there is a lack of diagnostic tools in almost all health facilities and very little clinical research has been done. In particular, the genotypes of the bacterium were not well known, with only one previous study performed in Vietnamese patients. We conducted this study in Quang Nam province, an endemic area in central Vietnam, for the first time using an eschar swab to detect the DNA of O. tsutsugamushi using molecular techniques. We also examined the genetic diversity of the bacteria based on sequencing, using the 56 k-Da TSA gene.
