A total of 79 asymptomatic VL cases were detected from two kala-azar endemic blocks of Malda districts of West Bengal by active mass screening. Follow study of the asymptomatic cases revealed that 10.39% cases transformed into disease and 9.09% cases remained as sero-positive even after three years. So progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey. Therefore, in a given period if there are no cases of VL/PKDL for two or more years, it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years, if there are such asymptomatic cases. So, asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries.
