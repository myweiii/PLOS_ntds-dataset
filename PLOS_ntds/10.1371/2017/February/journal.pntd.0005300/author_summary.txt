Chagas disease is a parasitic disease caused by a protozoan parasite (Trypanosoma cruzi) which has a complex life cycle including insect vector and mammalians. In Latin America, 7â€“10 million people are infected, 100 million people are at risk of infection, and about 56,000 new infection cases and 12,000 deaths are registered annually. Migration spread the geographic distribution of the disease to North America and Europe. The infection in humans has an initial acute stage followed by a chronic stage where up to 30% of patients develop cardiac alterations and 10% develop digestive, neurological or mixed alterations. The acute infection is hardly detected and there is not drug to treat the chronic infection. Thus, there is an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines development. Several attempts to find a vaccine antigen has been made and the protein Tc52 is a good candidate. In a vaccine composition, as important as the antigen is the adjuvants, which are substances able to increase, improve or modified the immune response. This research provides information about the immune response and protection against Trypanosoma cruzi infection elicited by Tc52 or portions of this molecule using different adjuvants.
