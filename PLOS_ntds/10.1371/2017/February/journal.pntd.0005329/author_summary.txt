Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) commonly infects human beings in developing countries including those in Southeast Asia. While the majority of the infected people suffer from mild illness, a minority suffers from encephalitis which may lead to death. The virus is transmitted by mosquito bites and elimination of mosquitoes is not a practical answer to prevent the disease, therefore, prevention by vaccination is a desired goal. While various vaccines are clinically tried and some are marketed further improvement in vaccines is still possible. In a complex disease like JE many components of the immune system contribute to variable extent in protection. We show here that one subset of T cells called CD8 cells which are capable of killing infected cells are very critical for providing protection against JEV infection in mice. In the absence of T cells we also observed that virus reaches the brain early, unlike in the presence of T cells, and this possibly results in high virus load in the brain leading to worsening of the condition and death. Thus, our data help in identifying the role of CD8 T cells in protection from lethal JEV infection and the information may be useful for modifying and/or developing vaccine for prevention of JEV-mediated disease.
