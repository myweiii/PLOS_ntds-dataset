The microbial communities that reside in mosquito midguts can impact transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. We used high throughput next generation sequencing to characterize the midgut microbial communities of 12 mosquito species collected in urban residential areas in Champaign County, Illinois. A total of 181 OTUs from 11 phyla and 66 families were identified. Although several bacterial taxa were shared between two or more mosquito species, there was remarkable individual differences in gut microbiota and it was common for individuals of different mosquito species to harbor similar gut microbiota. The microbiota of Ae. albopictus was the least diverse and significantly less evenly distributed compared to 7 of 11 mosquito species. The microbial community of Cx. pipiens and Ae. albopictus differed significantly from other mosquito species and was primarily dominated by Wolbachia. These findings improve current knowledge on the composition and structure of mosquito gut microbiota and provide the framework for understanding their contribution to individual variation in vector competence and potential application in disease control.
