Hand washing with soap and water is an important public health tool for reducing transmission of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protists. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which are widely dispensed in hospitals and public places, kill many of these same pathogens. What is not known is how effectively the alcohol-based hand sanitizers kill protists, fungi, or bacteria that cause eye disease. Here we show ethanol and isopropanol penetrate the walls and kill a free-living protist (Acanthamoeba castellanii, A. byersi, and other Acanthamoeba spp.), and a fungus (Fusarium solani), each of which causes keratitis, as well as a bacterium (Chlamydia trachomatis) that causes trachoma. These results suggest the possible benefit of hand sanitizers in the prevention of these eye pathogens.
