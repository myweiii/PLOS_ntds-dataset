Leprosy is a debilitating dermato-neurologic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. One of the main difficulties in the clinical management of leprosy patients is the development of leprosy reactions which are immune inflammatory episodes that can cause irreversible handicaps, incapacities and deformities. There are two major types of leprosy reactions: reversal reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Currently, there is no laboratory test able to predict the emergence of leprosy reactions among recently diagnosed patients. In order to investigate laboratory markers for the occurrence of leprosy reactions, we investigated the prognostic value of serologic responses to M. leprae antigens (PGL-I, LID-1, ND-O-LID) in 452 leprosy patients enrolled at the Clinical Trial for Uniform Multidrug Therapy Regimen for Leprosy Patients in Brazil/U-MDT/CT-BR. At diagnosis higher anti-PGL-I, anti-LID-1 and anti-ND-O-LID seropositivity rates were seen in patients who developed ENL and RR compared to reaction-free patients. The anti-PGL-I serology at diagnosis show low sensitivity to predict RR and anti-LID-1 serology at diagnosis has shown prognostic value for ENL development.
