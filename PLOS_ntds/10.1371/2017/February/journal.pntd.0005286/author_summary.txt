Aedes albopictus is a disease vector and biting nuisance of major public health concern. Established populations of Ae. albopictus were first recognised in Australia in 2005 after they were discovered on islands in the Torres Strait. Consequently, a control program was established in the same year to eliminate Ae. albopictus populations in the Torres Strait in order to reduce the risk of disease, as well as to prevent the mosquito from spreading to the mainland of Australia. In 2009, the goal of the program changed from elimination to quarantine (cordon sanitaire) focusing mainly on the inner islands of Thursday Island and Horn Island, which are the major population, administrative and transport centres linking the Torres Strait region to the Australian mainland. The cordon sanitaire strategy involved an integrated approach composed of harborage spraying, source reduction, insecticide treatment of containers, lethal tire piles, mosquito population monitoring and public awareness campaigns. Strategic improvements in management techniques led to a 97% decline in Ae. albopictus numbers on the two islands between 2011 and 2012. By 2015, the program had successfully reduced Ae. albopictus populations on Thursday Island and Horn Island to levels where the species was frequently undetectable, and had largely removed the risk of mainland incursion via that route. In 2016 the improved management strategies were also adopted to successfully control a dengue outbreak in which Ae. albopictus was the implicated vector on two outer islands of the Torres Strait.
