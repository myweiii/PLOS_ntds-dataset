    "Background": "Buruli ulcer disease (BUD), caused by Mycobacterium (M.) ulcerans, is the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy. BUD causes necrotic skin lesions and is a significant problem for health care in the affected countries. As for other mycobacterial infections, T cell mediated immune responses are important for protection and recovery during treatment, but detailed studies investigating these immune responses in BUD patients are scarce. In this study, we aimed to characterise M. ulcerans-specific CD4+ T cell responses in BUD patients and to analyse specific cytokine-producing T cells in the context of disease severity and progression.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "For this case-control study, whole blood samples of BUD patients (N = 36, 1.5\u201317 years of age) and healthy contacts (N = 22, 3\u201315 years of age) were stimulated with antigen prepared from M. ulcerans and CD4+ T cells were analysed for the expression of TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and CD40L by flow cytometry. The proportions and profile of cytokine producing CD4+ T cells was compared between the two study groups and correlated with disease progression and severity. Proportions of cytokine double-positive IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+, TNF\u03b1+CD40L+, IFN\u03b3+CD40L+ (p = 0.014, p = 0.010, p = 0.002, respectively) and triple positive IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+CD40L+ (p = 0.010) producing CD4+ T cell subsets were increased in BUD patients. In addition, TNF\u03b1+CD40L-IFN\u03b3- CD4+ T cells differed between patients and controls (p = 0.034). TNF\u03b1+CD40L-IFN\u03b3- CD4+ T cells were correlated with lesion size (p = 0.010) and proportion were higher in \u2018slow\u2019 healers compared to \u2018fast healers\u2019 (p = 0.030).",
    "Conclusions": "We were able to identify M. ulcerans-specific CD4+ T cell subsets with specific cytokine profiles. In particular a CD4+ T cell subset, producing TNF\u03b1 but not IFN\u03b3 and CD40L, showed association with lesion size and healing progress. Further studies are required to investigate, if the identified CD4+ T cell subset has the potential to be used as biomarker for diagnosis, severity and/or progression of disease."
