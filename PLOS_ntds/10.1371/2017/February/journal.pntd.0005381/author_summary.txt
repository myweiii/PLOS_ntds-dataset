Brazil has still not achieved the goal of leprosy elimination established by the World Health Organization. The diagnosis and treatment of leprosy are available and the country is striving to fully integrate leprosy services into the existing general health services. Access to information, diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT) remain key elements in the strategy to eliminate the disease as a public health problem, defined as reaching a prevalence of less than 1 leprosy case per 10,000 inhabitants. Thus, this study aimed to identify spatial clustering of leprosy and to classify high-risk areas in a major leprosy cluster. A total of 434 cases were identified, with 188 (43.31%) being of borderline leprosy and 101 (23.28%) lepromatous leprosy. There was a predominance of males, with ages ranging from 15 to 59 years, and 51 patients (11.75%) presented G2D. Two significant spatial clusters and three significant spatial-temporal clusters were also observed. These results can assist health services and policy makers to improve the health conditions of the Brazilian population, advancing towards the goal of elimination in Brazil.
