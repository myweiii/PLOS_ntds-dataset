Typhoid fever is a bacterial enteric infection that continues to pose a considerable burden to the 5.5 billion people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We developed and validated a model incorporating widely available indicators of economic and social development and the environment to estimate the burden of typhoid fever across LMICs. Our analysis uses all available data to estimate the incidence of typhoid in key age groups, which is important for the design and implementation of optimal vaccination strategies, and it identifies regions of the world that have the most uncertainty in typhoid incidence. Across all LMICs, we estimated that the expected number of typhoid fever cases per year is 17.8 million (95% CI: 6.9â€“48.4 million). We also present the probability that incidence surpasses the criteria for low, medium, high, and very high incidence in each country, which could help guide policy in the face of uncertainty.
