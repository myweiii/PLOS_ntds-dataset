This study was completed only through the kind participation of volunteers and the unconditional support of all members involved and engaged in the fight against leprosy, especially the support of Ms. Marli Araújo from GAMAH and its volunteers. Additionally, we thank the SES-DF team (Diva Souza, Jandiara Cardoso Silva and Juliana S. Fontenele); Prof. Raimunda Nonato Sampaio for allowing the use of the laboratory of Dermatomycology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Brasília for sample processing; and Dr. John Spencer (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA, recipient of a Fulbright Scholar to Brazil award 2015–2016) for considerable help in conducting the laboratory tests.
