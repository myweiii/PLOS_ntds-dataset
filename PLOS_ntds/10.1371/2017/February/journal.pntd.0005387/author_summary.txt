Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are mosquito-borne parasitic infections that are endemic in Haiti. Soil-transmitted helminths are also present in Haiti, infecting large numbers of people every year. Since 2001, Haiti’s National Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (NPELF) has worked to reduce the transmission of LF through annual mass drug administration with the aim of reducing LF prevalence in the population below a threshold, such that transmission is assumed to be no longer sustainable. By treating the entire population of Haiti with a combination of drugs, the elimination program has made tremendous progress towards eliminating the disease. By 2014, Haiti’s NPELF had met the World Health Organization eligibility criteria to conduct LF transmission assessment surveys (TAS) and decided to use the LF TAS as a platform to collect information about STH and malaria. The WHO has called for the integration of program activities in the field, and the TAS is a platform that allows for such integration. In Haiti the integrated TAS reduced the burden of repeated surveys on communities by minimizing site visits and benefited all three disease programs by sharing the responsibilities of field data collection.
