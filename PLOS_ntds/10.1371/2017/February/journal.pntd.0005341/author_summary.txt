Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmitted by diverse species of mosquitoes broadly classified into primary vectors and secondary vectors. Primary vectors consist of floodwater Aedes (e.g Ae. mcintoshi, Ae. ochraceus, Ae. sudanensis, Ae. dentatus etc), known to maintain the virus in their drought resistant eggs which are deposited on wet soils on low lying depressions on land, remaining viable in dry soil for variable number of years during dry periods. Following heavy persistent rains with flooding, such eggs hatch with a proportion already infected. Emerging infected adult female mosquitoes initiate transmission to nearby animals which serve as amplifiers, infecting more mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. Another group of mosquito species, the secondary vectors, mainly from the Culex (Culex pipiens and Culex poicilipes), and other potential vectors including, Culex univittatus, Anopheles and Mansonia species may take over such breeding sites, breed in abundance and incidentally propagate RVFV transmission. Outbreaks of RFV occur at varying intensities among livestock in different counties in Kenya, and counties are classified into high, medium and low risk zones. We assessed the species composition, distribution and abundance of primary and secondary vectors in two counties; Isiolo (medium risk) and Tana-River (high risk). Striking difference in composition of primary vector species between Isiolo and Tana-River was observed suggesting that vector species composition in different regions could further be applied to assess risk of RVF outbreaks and intensity. We propose further evaluation of vector species surveillance as an additional risk assessment tool for RVFV and other mosquito borne viruses.
