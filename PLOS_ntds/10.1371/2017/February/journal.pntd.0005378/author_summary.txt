Trachoma is the worldâ€™s leading infectious cause of blindness. Mathematical models are used by researchers to examine the spread of infectious diseases and understand how they can be controlled. Such models are developed based on the natural history of infection. For trachoma we identify four different model structures which could all represent the natural history of trachoma infection. We fit each of the models to infection and disease prevalence data for 3 different age groups. We find that one of the models is able to fit the data better than others, however some factors about the model are difficult to identify due to limited data. The ease of eliminating disease within a community assuming the same interventions varied depending on the model structure assumed. Our results highlight that some models of trachoma fit to infection and disease data better than others, but that more data is needed to identify more specific aspects of the model structure. In addition we show that different model structures may give different results in terms of the effort required to control trachoma transmission.
