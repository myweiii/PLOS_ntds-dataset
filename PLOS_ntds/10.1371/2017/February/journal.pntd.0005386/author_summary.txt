Seven cholera pandemics have been recorded throughout history, and the sixth, and presumably earlier pandemics, emerged from the Bay of Bengal. The seventh pandemic strain also appeared and spread from this area to different area of the world. Thus, the Bay of Bengal has always been considered the epicenter of cholera pandemics. In this report, we characterized the V. cholerae strains isolated from patients with cholera in Kolkata as a representative area of the Bay of Bengal between 2007 and 2014. The analysis revealed that the cholera epidemics were caused by several distinct V. cholerae O1 strains and that the predominant strains have genetically changed several times in recent years.
