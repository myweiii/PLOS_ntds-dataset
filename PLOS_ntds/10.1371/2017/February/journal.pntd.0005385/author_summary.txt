As vaccines targeting NTDs advance into clinical trials, product development and vaccine maintenance become critical activities for the success of these vaccines. A key activity during this phase of vaccine development is the “relative potency” of a vaccine or the quality of the immune response that the vaccine elicits in an animal model during storage to ensure its immunogenicity is maintained. As with most NTD vaccines, the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine was not developed using traditional methods of attenuating the pathogen (Necator americanus), so traditional measures of relative potency, such as testing the vaccine’s ability to protect against lethal challenge, could not be used. For the first time, we describe the development of a relative potency testing program for an NTD vaccine during five years of storage at 2–8°C. We also describe the development of a complementary functional assay that measures the ability of IgG from animals or humans immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel to neutralize this important hookworm enzyme. The results described herein provide, for the first time in an open access format, critical tools for the development of future NTD vaccines.
