Leptospirosis is an important worldwide zoonotic disease, particularly in tropical and subtropical countries. The infection in humans is caused by either direct contact with products of infected animals, mainly urine, or by indirect contact via a contaminated environment. The animal hosts are thus considered reservoirs for human infection as livestock in Thailand usually live in close contact with householders in rural areas. However, the links of Leptospira serovars in humans and livestock in Thailand are poorly understood. Therefore, we illustrate the circulation of Leptospira serovars in humans and livestock during the past six years. The cross-correlations of the seroprevalence distribution were investigated to assess similarity between serovars across and within both, species and regions. The results suggest that livestock could be a potential source for human infection as sample analysis revealed a predominance of the same serovars. This information will increase public health awareness and may benefit especially high risk groups such as abattoir workers, livestock owners, farmers and other animal handling personal.
