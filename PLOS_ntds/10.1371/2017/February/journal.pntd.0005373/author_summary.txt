Diarrheal diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in the developing world. A recent multi-site study investigating diarrheal disease identified Cryptosporidium as one of the leading causes, responsible for upwards of 25% of cases in some regions. Currently approved therapy for cryptosporidiosis is limited to nitazoxanide, which is approved only for children ages 1â€“11 years. Nitazoxanide demonstrates moderate efficacy in immunocompetent patients and poor efficacy in immunodeficient patients. The limited treatment options underscore an opportunity to reduce the global burden of diarrheal disease by developing novel medicines with increased efficacy against Cryptosporidium spp. We report the largest high-throughput screen for anticryptosporidial compounds to date, leading to the identification of the FDA-approved drug clofazimine as a potential new treatment for cryptosporidiosis, and as a tool to probe the biology of this pathogen.
