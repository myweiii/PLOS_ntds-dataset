We would like to thank the University of Dundee Drug Discovery Unit for design and supply of the Global Health Chemical Diversity Set. Execution of the high-content screen was expertly enabled by Calibr’s HTS team and Compound Management Group. In addition, we thank the following for contributing to the development of the mouse cryptosporidiosis mouse model: Dr. Elizabeth Winzeler for providing initial access and support to a BSL2-level vivarium to establish this model, Dr. Jan Meade for guidance on the purification of C. parvum oocysts from mouse feces, and Dr. Wes Van Voorhis’ gift of BKI-1294 which proved to be invaluable for assay validation. We are also grateful to both the Sterling Laboratory (University of Arizona) and the Tzipori Laboratory (Tufts University) for providing Cryptosporidium oocysts for these studies.
