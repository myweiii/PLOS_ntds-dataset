As national programs are nearing elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, questions have been raised about the cost of collecting the data necessary for documenting validation of elimination. A series of standardized population-based surveys is necessary to determine prevalence of infection in endemic areas. The authors retrospectively collected data on the costs of these surveys from 13 countries to determine median cost per survey and per cluster sampled. Costs were found to be comparable with other neglected tropical disease surveys. The major cost drivers were personnel and travel for supporting collection of data in the field. National programs and donors can use these results to plan and advocate more effectively for sufficient resources to support validation of elimination.
