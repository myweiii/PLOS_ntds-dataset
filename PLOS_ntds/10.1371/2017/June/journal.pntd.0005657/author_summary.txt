Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a very debilitating illness that has no efficient treatment to date. Better knowledge of the mechanisms involved with host cell infection is important to change this scenario. T. cruzi enters host cells by subverting the mechanism by which cells repair small injuries in their plasma membrane. In this process, parasites interact with host cells causing membrane injuries. These injuries lead to secretion of lysosomal content to the extracellular media, which in turn causes the internalization of plasma membrane wounds via endocytosis. During this endocytic process the parasite is internalized by the host cell. We have previously shown that absence of two proteins located at the lysosomal membrane, LAMP-1 and 2, severely interferes with T. cruzi entry into host cells. In the present manuscript we show that absence of LAMP-2 alone is enough to compromise T. cruzi entry into host cells and it does so by compromising the endocytic events that follow lysosome secretion, which in turn is responsible for driving T. cruzi into the host cell interior.
