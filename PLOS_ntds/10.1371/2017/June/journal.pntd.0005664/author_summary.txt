Taenia solium is a parasite normally transmitted between humans and pigs in areas with poor sanitation. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) occurs when humans are infected with larvae of T. solium that are shed with human feces and the larvae establish in the brain. NCC is often accompanied by neurological symptoms such as epilepsy. In fact, NCC causes approximately one-third of epilepsy cases in areas where T. solium is common. Unfortunately, diagnosis of NCC requires brain computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, tools rarely accessible to people living where NCC is prevalent. This study tested whether genes expressed in blood monocytes, a type of white blood cell, could distinguish between people with epilepsy caused by NCC from those with epilepsy of unknown cause (idiopathic). We compared gene expression in people with NCC and epilepsy, people with idiopathic epilepsy, people cured of NCC and people without NCC or epilepsy but with headaches. We identified 15 genes which were expressed differently in the four different groups indicating that monocyte gene expression patterns in people with NCC and epilepsy are different than people with idiopathic epilepsy. These findings could lead to better understanding how humans respond to NCC and to diagnostic tests which would not require brain imaging.
