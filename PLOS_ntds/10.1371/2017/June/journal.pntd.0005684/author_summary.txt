Carrion’s disease is a neglected vector-borne disease limited to vulnerable population of Ecuador, Colombia and specially Peru. This illness consist in two distinct phases, the Oroya fever and Peruvian wart, but exist a high percentage of asymptomatic carriers in endemic areas that should be detected in order to perform correct surveillance and control. Moreover, information on immunity and immune responses to Bartonella bacilliformis, the causative agent, is very limited and represents a challenge. This study identified serum biomarkers associated with Carrion’s disease asymptomatic infections. In addition, it provides novel information on the complex host-immune interactions in these individuals, suggesting that the bacteria induces an immunosuppression in the acute phase that is maintained in later phases with low levels of bacteremia. This immunoppression would help the establishment and persistence of the infection.
