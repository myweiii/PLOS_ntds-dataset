Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a frequent parasitic infection of the human brain and the most common cause of adult onset epilepsy in developing countries. Acute inflammatory response in NCC plays an important role in the pathogenesis of symptoms by anthelminitic therapies. The anthelmintic recommended therapy for NCC has drawbacks as the exacerbation of inflammation around degenerating cysts provokes the appearance of symptoms at the first days of treatment. Radiological changes in the appearance of cysts usually are seen after months of therapy. To evaluate if significant radiological changes (enhancement and size) occur in the first days of therapy, we used a porcine NCC model and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast solution. The major radiological changes observed after treatment with albendazole and praziquantel were an increase in enhancement and the significant reduction in cyst size by day 2 and more evident on day 5. Cysts with greater changes also experienced exacerbated inflammation, loss of vesicular fluid and wrinkling of the cyst wall. These results show an early therapeutic effect and the possible utility of repeat MRI imaging within a few days after starting treatment. Finally, these findings contribute to our understanding of the treatment induced early exacerbation of symptoms.
