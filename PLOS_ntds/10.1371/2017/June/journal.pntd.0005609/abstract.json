    "Background": "Rabies is a fatal viral disease that continues to threaten both human and animal health in endemic countries. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a rabies-endemic country in which dogs are the main reservoir and continue to present health risks for both human and animals throughout the country.",
    "Methods": "Passive, laboratory–based rabies surveillance was performed for suspected cases of dog rabies in Vientiane Capital during 2010–2016 and eight additional provinces between 2015–2016 using the Direct Fluorescent Antibody Test (DFAT).",
    "Results": "There were 284 rabies positive cases from 415 dog samples submitted for diagnosis. 257 cases were from Vientiane Capital (2010–2016) and the remaining 27 cases were submitted during 2015–2016 from Champassak (16 cases), Vientiane Province (4 cases), Xieng Kuang (3 cases), Luang Prabang (2 cases), Saravan (1 case), Saisomboun (1 case) and Bokeo (1 case). There was a significant increase in rabies cases during the dry season (p = 0.004) (November to April; i.e., <100mm of rainfall per month). No significant differences were noted between age, sex, locality of rabies cases.",
    "Conclusion": "The use of laboratory-based rabies surveillance is a useful method of monitoring rabies in Lao PDR and should be expanded to other provincial centers, particularly where there are active rabies control programs."
