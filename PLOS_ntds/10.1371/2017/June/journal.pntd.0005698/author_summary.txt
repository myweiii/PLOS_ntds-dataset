Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne-viral disease of African origin that has spread in the Americas since its first detection in 2013. The vector of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Americas is the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Due to this vector domestic behavior, CHIKV transmission is limited between this mosquito species and humans in urban and suburban American areas. However, since 2015 the distribution of CHIKV has moved towards the inland and the forested areas in the tropical Americas. The recent reports of CHIKV epidemic waves in zones intimately linked to the wild exemplify the potential of CHIKV initiating a zoonotic cycle in the continent since local sylvatic mosquitoes can be infected and transmit the virus. We experimentally demonstrated that two widely distributed American sylvatic primatophilic mosquito species, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Aedes terrens, are highly susceptible and competent to transmit the two CHIKV lineages currently circulating in the continent, 7 days after an infectious blood meal, Hg. leucocelaenus mosquitoes presenting infectious viral particles in their saliva as rapidly as 3 days exposure. We concluded that there is a definite risk for CHIKV to establish a sylvatic cycle in the tropical Americas if local non-human primates can amplify the virus to infect wild primatophilic mosquitoes.
