Increasing rate of relapse against miltefosine (MIL) and decline in its efficacy prompted us to study the parasitic factors associated with MIL unresponsiveness in clinical isolates of Leishmania donovani. Studies to explore the mechanism of MIL resistance in L. donovani are largely restricted to experimentally induced resistant parasites. In the present study, parasites isolated from MIL treated patients that relapsed (LdRelapse) were found to exhibit increased metacyclogenesis and infectivity to macrophages, decreased miltefosine accumulation and increased tolerance towards MIL induced oxidative stress in comparison to isolates from pretreatment cases (LdPreTx). Reduction in drug accumulation and increase in intracellular thiol content as well as tolerance to MIL induced oxidative stress were the highest in experimentally induced MIL resistant parasites (LdM30). Both LdRelapse and LdM30 parasites showed differential expression of genes associated with oxidative stress, metabolic processes and transport activity in comparison with LdPreTx parasites. The present study revealed that the parasites isolated from the cases that relapsed exhibited high infectivity, increased metacyclogenesis, reduced drug accumulation and reconfigured metabolism to overcome the oxidative stress induced during MIL exposure. These factors may be contributing to the high relapse rate observed in MIL treated VL and PKDL patients.
