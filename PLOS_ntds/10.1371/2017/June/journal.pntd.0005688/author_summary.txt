Using human bait to collect blood-feeding insects is an ethically sensitive issue. Whereas researchers investigating insect-borne diseases such as sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and malaria have a range of traps at their disposal, those investigating blackflies and river blindness (onchocerciasis) still rely on this method. Alternatives to human bait are needed to monitor disease transmission as onchocerciasis control programmes approach their elimination phase. The recently developed Esperanza Window Trap provides one such possibility. We built these traps based on previously published methods while conducting blackfly research in Uganda and Tanzania in order to evaluate their efficacy and ease of use. Our results show that in Uganda the traps worked well for the collection of Simulium damnosum, the blackfly primarily responsible for onchocerciasis transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, but were less effective at collecting the same species in Tanzania. Blackfly behaviour and response to traps will probably vary from one country to another. Esperanza Window Traps show promise for blackfly collections, but further research and development are needed to determine how broadly they can be used.
