Mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue, are believed to cause over 100 million cases of human disease annually. Current mathematical models that aim to predict risk of virus transmission are generally either highly “mosquito-centric” or “virus-centric”. For virus transmission to occur, conditions need to be suitable for both mosquito and virus: hence, we propose a novel approach that considers the interplay between the different optimal conditions for the mosquito and the virus. Our findings indicate that warmer- or colder- adapted mosquitoes are significantly more efficient vectors in warmer or colder climates respectively. Consequently, we propose that there is currently an underestimation of risk to temperate regions from their native and cooler adapted mosquitoes.
