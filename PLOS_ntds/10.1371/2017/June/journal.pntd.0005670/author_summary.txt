Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, presents a major health burden in both the developed and developing world. Untreated congenital toxoplasmosis causes damage to the eye and brain, but early detection and treatment reduce transmission and disease. Fetal infection can be promptly diagnosed and treated and outcomes can be improved. Gestational screening for toxoplasmosis has international precedent. In this paper, we demonstrated that the new Toxoplasma ICT IgG-IgM test had 100% sensitivity and specificity in detecting Toxoplasma infection (N = 180 U.S. sera from uninfected persons and those with varying parasite serotypes). The use of an inexpensive, easy-to-use point-of-care test facilitates screening of pregnant women for T. gondii infection. In turn, this facilitates prompt treatment for the infection and thereby reduces the health burden caused by this disease. This provides an opportunity to improve maternal-fetal care by using approaches, diagnostic tools, and medicines already available.
