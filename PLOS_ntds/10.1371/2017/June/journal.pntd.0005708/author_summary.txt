It is estimated that now 2 billion people currently live with chronic parasitic worm infections. As the incidences of cancer increase worldwide, the importance of these chronic inflammatory conditions on the development of cancer becomes more important. Several bacterial, viral and parasitic infections are already known to influence cancer development but as colon cancer is particularly prevalent worldwide, we wanted to assess the effect of a large intestinal dwelling worm, Trichuris muris (T. muris) on its aetiology. This whipworm is a natural infection of mice and has significant homology to human whipworm. From our studies, we showed that chronic infection alone induced changes in the caecum of the mouse that were comparable to those seen with a well-known carcinogen. In addition to this, T. muris infection was also able to increase the development of adenomas in the small intestine of mutant mice that spontaneously develop tumours. This change was abrogated if a T regulatory cell type was blocked during infection. The T regulatory cell type that arises during infection has been shown to play an important role in protecting the host from damage caused by the parasite and the immune response to it. The present study using the mouse model however, suggests that regulatory T cells can have negative effects, at least in terms of the development of bowel cancer. As so many people live with chronic, regulated parasitic infections, the importance of the parasites in cancer development may therefore be significant.
