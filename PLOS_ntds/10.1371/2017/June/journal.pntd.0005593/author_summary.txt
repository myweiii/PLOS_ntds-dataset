Schistosomiasis is probably the most important of the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) caused by helminthes (worms). It is acquired bathing in freshwater in endemic areas. The life cycle is complex and involves freshwater snails. Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium and less frequently by other species, affects more than 200 million people, mostly in Africa, and may chronically cause irreversible damage of the liver (S. mansoni) or of the kidneys and the urinary tract, including cancer of the bladder (S. haematobium). As in chronic infections eggs of both species are often missed by microscopy of faeces and urine, with this retrospective study we evaluate the accuracy of different, alternative diagnostic tests, for the screening of schistosomiasis in African migrants and asylum seekers, of whom many thousands reach the Italian coast every year proceding from the most endemic areas. The most interesting finding of our study is that a rapid diagnostic test for antibody detection in blood, easy to use as a point-of-care tool, resulted the most sensitive of the five tests evaluated, and thus is very promising as a screening tool even when used without any additional test.
