We would like to acknowledge the efforts of all contact tracers, active case finders, and Zonal, District and County Surveillance Officers, without which the successful containment of this outbreak would not have been possible. We would also like to thank the WHO Field Epidemiologists and other partners for their mentorship and guidance to the contact tracers and the Montserrado County Data Team for undertaking data management for the response. In addition, we acknowledge the other pillars of the response in ensuring all contactâ€™s needs were met, particularly logistics and psychosocial teams.
