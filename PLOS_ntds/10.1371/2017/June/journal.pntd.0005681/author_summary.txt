Ticks are known for their negative impact on animal and human health through infestation and are capable of transmitting a wide range of pathogens including protozoan, viruses, and bacteria such as the spirochetes and rickettsiae. Ticks are widely distributed in different ecological, and geographical regions of Pakistan. Tick-borne diseases, such as bovine babesiosis and theileriosis have been reported in Pakistan. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne viral disease in Pakistan, affects individuals who have close contact with livestock, including those working in slaughterhouses, veterinary practices, and hospitals. In Pakistan, CCHF is vectored by Hyalomma tick species, and therefore a significant threat could be posed to human health. However, there is a paucity of data on tick-borne zoonoses in Pakistan. In the current study, tick species infesting livestock across the Pakistan were catalogued, and molecular approaches were utilized to gain an insight into the microbiome associated with tick species. The results of our study revealed 19 tick species infesting livestock, and rich diversity of microbial communities associated with the ticks. Spotted Fever Group rickettsia, and Theileria annulata specific quantitative PCR assay confirmed the infection in Hyalomma tick species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed molecular study on tick species infesting livestock in Pakistan, and in depth vector competence studies should be conducted.
