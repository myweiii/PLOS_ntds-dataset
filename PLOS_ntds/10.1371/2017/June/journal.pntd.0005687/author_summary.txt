Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that is caused by the obligate intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium leprae (M.leprae). Leprosy is the leading cause of all non-traumatic peripheral neuropathies worldwide. Both myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells are infected by M.leprae in lepromatous leprosy, but the non-myelinating Schwann cells show greater susceptibility to M.leprae invasion. However, the effect of M.leprae infection on non-myelinating Schwann cells has not been elucidated. Our results show that SW-10 cells are non-myelinating Schwann cells. Infection with M. leprae induces lipid droplet (LD) formation. Furthermore, inhibition of M. leprae-induced LD formation enhances the maturation of phagosomes containing live M.leprae and decreases the ATP content of M. leprae in SW-10 cells, suggesting that LD formation by M. leprae favors M. leprae survival in SW-10 cells. Based on these findings, it should be clear that M.leprae-infected SW-10 cells can serve as a new model for investigating the interaction of M.leprae with non-myelinating Schwann cells.
