More than 90 million pregnancies are exposed to P. vivax infection every year. While it is well known that pregnant women have an increased risk of P. falciparum infection and disease, much less is known on the epidemiology and the impact of P. vivax in pregnancy. A health-facility based observational study was conducted in pregnant women living in five vivax endemic countries aimed to determine the burden of the infection in pregnancy and its impact on the mother and the newborn health. We found that the prevalence of P. vivax malaria in pregnant women attending the routine antenatal clinic visits was overall low across all sites, however submicroscopic infections were unexpectedly high in some areas. Pregnant women with clinical malaria experienced an increased risk of anemia, which may have a deleterious impact on infant health. These findings may be useful for guiding maternal health programs in vivax endemic settings, as well as for malaria elimination activities.
