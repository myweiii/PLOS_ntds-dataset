Leptospirosis, a zoonosis caused by Leptospira spp. bacteria, is an important but neglected disease in the Pacific region. The bacteria can lead to human infections, either through direct contact with infected animals or through water and soil contaminated with urine. Although animals play a key role in the transmission of the disease, the relative importance of animal reservoirs for human leptospirosis infections in the Pacific have not been investigated. In French Polynesia, the animal species acting as sources for human infection are unknown. In our study, we isolated leptospires from rats, farm pigs and pet dogs from Tahiti, the most populated island of French Polynesia, and compared them to those isolated from human leptospirosis cases. The types of leptospires identified in human leptospirosis cases were also detected in rats and dogs, whereas leptospires found in pigs were genetically different. These results indicate that rats are a major potential source for human leptospirosis in Tahiti. Further investigations will be required to clarify the relative contribution of dogs and pigs to human leptospirosis in French Polynesia, to properly design or adapt interventions to reduce the burden of human leptospirosis.
