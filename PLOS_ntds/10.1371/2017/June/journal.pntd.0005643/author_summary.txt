Melioidosis is a life threatening infectious disease caused by a soil-associated gram-negative bacterium, B. pseudomallei. Melioidosis is endemic in southeast Asia and northern Australia; however, the global distribution of B. pseudomallei and the disease burden of melioidosis is still poorly understood. Melioidosis is severely under-reported in several tropical countries in which it is probably endemic and warrants a public health response. A recent research article predicts the global melioidosis burden to be 165 million cases with a predicted 73 million cases from the high risk zone of south Asia. Melioidosis is difficult to treat as B. pseudomallei is resistant to many antibiotics and requires a long course of treatment. Mortality rate remains high in endemic areas with reoccurrence being common. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose the disease at an early stage and provide vital clinical care to reduce the mortality rate. With limitations in treatment and lack of a vaccine, it is crucial to study the immune response mechanisms to this infection to get a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the gene expression levels of important immune response genes and epigenetic modifiers to establish useful correlation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
