Dengue virus (DENV) currently causes the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) re-emerged explosively in 2005â€“2006 afflicting millions of people in the Indian Ocean area and ever since continues its spread. The increasing co-circulation of these mosquito-borne viruses and the ability of the vector mosquitos to transmit both viruses at the same time have led to upsurge of DENV/CHIKV cases. Unfortunately, we have little understanding of their (immuno)pathogenesis. Well-balanced innate immune responses are crucial for early containment of infections with viruses, such as DENV and CHIKV. Therefore, in this study we focused on the effect of co-infection on viral replication and the innate immune responses of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed that CHIKV replication is inhibited during concomitant infection. In contrast, DENV replicated to higher titres during co-infection. Additionally, co-infections resulted in the significant increase in the production of immune-modulators that are implicated in DENV and/or CHIKV pathogenesis. Our study provides a basis for studying virus-host interactions during arbovirus co-infections and highlights the importance of investigating the innate immune response alongside the virus levels in the condition of natural co-infections.
