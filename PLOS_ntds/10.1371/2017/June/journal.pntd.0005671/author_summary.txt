Cholera is a deadly disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The ancestral home of cholera is around the Bay of Bengal, but recently cholera has moved to Africa. In Africa, cholera occurs in sporadic outbreaks. In order prevent cases of cholera, we want to understand the transmission of cholera in Africa, does it stay in one place or does it move around. To gain insight into these questions, we have examined the DNA of the bacteria. The DNA provides a identity for each isolate and we can infer how the isolates are related to each other based on the number and type of DNA changes. In our study, we examined the DNA of cholera isolates from southern Mozambique. We were surprised how similar all the Mozambique isolates were even though that were collected up to eight years apart. Based on previous work, we would have expected much more change in the DNA. Our data raises several important questions that relate to where these cholera isolates persist, possibly in local refuges, and how seemingly identical isolates can be collected years apart despite our understanding of the high rate of change of the molecular clock.
