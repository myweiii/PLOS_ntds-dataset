Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is a complex parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease that affects approximately 10 million people worldwide may be mother-to-child transmitted which is an important public health problem with great relevance in endemic and non-endemic areas and regions where the vector transmission has been controlled. During gestation, the maternal immune system must defend both the mother and the fetus from infections, while, at the same time, it must tolerate a semiallogenic fetus. This immune homeostasis is characterized by a natural process of immunosuppression that in T. cruzi-infected pregnant women can lead to an increase in the motherÂ´s parasite load that favors the risk of congenital transmission. In this study, it was determined the immunological modifications induced by gestation in an experimental model of T. cruzi chronic infection and their influence in the parasite congenital transmission. The results indicate that a T. cruzi infection induces a reversion of the pregnancy-associated homeostasis. Furthermore, it is shown that females who are not able to reverse the biological profile induced by pregnancy are those that transmit the parasite.
