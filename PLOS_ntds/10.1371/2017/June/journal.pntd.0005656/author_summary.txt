Insecticide resistance has emerged as a worrisome outlook for the implementation of insecticide-only approaches. Particularly for Aedes aegypti, it is generally argued that this rapid rise of insecticide resistance may compromise the effectiveness of control programs. Yet, empirical evidence of such negative operational impact is lacking. This article provides quantitative evidence of the impact of insecticide resistance, primarily to the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin, on the entomological effectiveness of interventions against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Within an area of high resistance to pyrethroids, performing high-quality insecticide applications using deltamethrin had no entomological impact in comparison to the application of an insecticide to which Ae. aegypti was susceptible. Deltamethrin did not protect against resistant Ae. aegypti, whereas the application of bendiocarb led to an average efficacy of 60% during a 3-month period. This study provides strong evidence of the dramatic operational treatment failure that can occur when the background insecticide resistance level of Ae. aegypti populations is not taken into consideration when performing vector control.
