Visceral leishmaniasis remains a worldwide public health concern with high mortality even when proper treatment is instituted. There is a need to develop efficacious, safer and shorter treatment alternatives as the current options suffer from high toxicity and long treatment duration. Combination therapies emerge as an alternative, and WHO has encouraged the conduct of studies to evaluate drug combinations where evidence for current treatment regimens is not available. In Brazil, there is no local evidence to support the current treatment recommendations. Therefore, a clinical trial was conducted in five hospitals in Brazil to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the current available treatments—meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B—and of a combination of liposomal amphotericin B, single dose, and meglumine antimoniate, in a shorter administration regimen. Preliminary safety results led to the discontinuation of the amphotericin B deoxycholate treatment arm and a planned interim analysis resulted in the trial interruption. The final results, comparing liposomal amphotericin B and liposomal amphotericin B plus meglumine antimoniate to the standard meglumine antimoniate treatment, did not show a statistically significant difference in cure rates, though cure rate was higher in the liposomal amphotericin B group. Liposomal amphotericin B treatment showed a better safety profile compared to meglumine antimoniate. These results will support future changes in treatment protocols in Brazil and potentially in Latin America.
