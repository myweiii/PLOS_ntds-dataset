    "Abstract": "There is currently no vaccine against parasitic nematodes and the knowledge on the mechanisms by which protective immunity against this class of parasites is achieved is continuously expanding. Nematode parasites trigger a host protective type 2 immune response via interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R\u03b1). Despite this central role, it is not known whether IL-4R\u03b1 has a role in maintaining host type 2 immune responses following polarization. To determine the role of IL-4R\u03b1 after polarization, we used a recently established strain of rosaCreERT2-/+IL-4R\u03b1-/Lox mice where il4r\u03b1 gene deletion can be temporally controlled. We show that sustained expression of IL-4R\u03b1 is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following interruption after polarization with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis primary infection. Moreover, we show by temporal deletion of IL-4R\u03b1 prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis that signaling via this receptor drives more efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites. Together, this study demonstrates that sustained IL-4R\u03b1 mediated signaling is required for the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, describing a novel function for IL-4R\u03b1 that is distinct from its role in immune polarization."
