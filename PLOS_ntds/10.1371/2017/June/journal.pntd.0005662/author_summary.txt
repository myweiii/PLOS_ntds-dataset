A better knowledge of snakebites incidence and mortality might improve their management. However, they are difficult to estimate, in particular because most of them are based on extrapolations from scientific and medical publications that are not representative of the epidemiological situation. This study, based on data available on-line at government sites in the Americas—reflecting notifications from health services—sustained by recent publications to provide useful information on snakebites treated in health centers of American countries. On average, nearly 60,000 snake bites are managed every year in health facilities in the Americas and approximately 370 deaths are reported officially. The development of snake populations results from environmental conditions favorable to their feeding and camouflage. Moreover, the activities of human—notably agricultural—explain encounters with the snakes. The literature underlines that the severity of the envenomation depend on the species responsible for the bite and quality of the management of the patient. Without excluding an underestimation of snakebite incidence, due to the frequent use of traditional medicine, this study should enable health authorities to better analyze the epidemiological situation of snakebites, including their frequency, distribution and severity, in order to improve the management of the envenomation.
