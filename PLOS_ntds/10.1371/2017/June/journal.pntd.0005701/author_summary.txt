An unprecedented dengue outbreak occurred in Guangzhou, 2014, with 38,036 reported cases in contrast to 73,179 cases in all of mainland China from 1990 to 2015. In an earlier analysis using a deterministic model, we concluded the early timing of local transmission to be the most important determinant of this outbreak. Here we use a stochastic model to explore the reasons why the outbreak happened earlier in 2014. Our results identified the higher number of imported cases in May and June to be the most probable explanation. Based on the investigation of the determinants of success rate and final epidemic size, this work provides suggestions for reducing dengue outbreak potential and epidemic size in the future. More attention should be paid to imported case detection and vector control measures in early summer, because this is the time when successful invasion can result in high incidence of infection and the success rate of each imported case begins to rise. Destroying mosquito breeding sites can reduce the maximum water level of the system and attenuate the role played by climate. In addition, interventions within 10 days after the introduction of imported cases is still effective in preventing further transmission.
