B. pseudomallei, the etiological agent of melioidosis, is an emerging pathogen with limited therapeutic options and no available vaccines. A better understanding of the role of biofilm formation during pathogenesis will aid in melioidosis diagnosis and the development of new therapeutics and vaccines. Melioidosis has both acute and chronic disease manifestations in addition to a highly variable period of latency, which contributes to complications in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Relapsing melioidosis is correlated with biofilm formation and the role of biofilm growth during chronic human infections has been widely accepted. We utilized a two-allele sequence defined transposon mutant library of B. pseudomallei 1026b to identify genes involved in biofilm formation. This study identified factors that contribute to biofilm formation and included a previously undescribed exopolysaccharide and the genes underlying its biosynthesis. Since antibiotic tolerance in B. pseudomallei has been associated with biofilm formation, the genes identified in this study that contribute to biofilm production are potential targets for therapeutic development. Additionally, the products of these biofilm genes could be used for the development of diagnostics and vaccines.
