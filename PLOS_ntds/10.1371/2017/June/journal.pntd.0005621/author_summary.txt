Indonesia reported to the WHO the worldâ€™s second highest average number of dengue cases and the highest in Asia from 2004 to 2010. These passive surveillance reports vary widely within the country and are likely to be a severe under-estimation of the full disease burden as frequently only dengue haemorrhagic fever is captured. Understanding the intensity of dengue virus transmission and associated risk factors nationwide is necessary to guide and prioritize appropriate prevention and control measures against dengue disease, especially considering the availability of the first dengue vaccine and recent recommendations for its use in areas of high endemicity, as measured by seroprevalence and other indicators. Age-stratified seroprevalence data provide robust estimates of past exposure and can inform on transmission intensity. Therefore, we conducted a seroprevalence study of anti-dengue IgG antibodies in a representative sample of urban-dwelling Indonesian children. We found an overall dengue seroprevalence of 69.4% with half of the children having been infected at least once by the age of 5 years. Age of the subject and the number of dengue cases diagnosed in the household were associated with serostatus. These results confirm the high dengue disease burden in Indonesia and the urgency of implementation of effective prevention and control measures.
