African sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted to humans by tsetse flies (Glossina genus). Treatment of the disease is complex and relies on limited pharmaceutical options. Understanding how T. brucei regulates cell cycle progression at a molecular level when alternating between the mammalian host and the insect vector could lead to better therapies. In this study, we examined different T. brucei proteins with homology to components of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex (SCFC), previously characterized in other eukaryotes as a regulator of cell cycle progression. We found that depletion of the homologues of a putative SCFC cause T. brucei to develop abnormally, generating different phenotypes of the mammalian and insect stages. Interestingly, depletion of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme TbCDC34 arrest cells in a pre-cytokinesis stage, indicating that this protein is essential for cytokinesis. In addition to improving our fundamental understanding of the molecular regulation underlying the sophisticated life cycle of T. brucei, this work pinpoints a potential target for drug development against trypanosomiasis.
