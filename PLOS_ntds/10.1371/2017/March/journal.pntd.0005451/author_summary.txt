Infection with Fasciola hepatica, a liver fluke, is one of the most significant veterinary problems due to the worldwide distribution of this parasite, a wide spectrum of host organisms and the resulting economic loss. Human fasciolosis caused by F. hepatica is recognised by the World Health Organization as an important emerging but neglected tropical disease. Development of an effective vaccine against this disease is becoming a priority, especially as the appearance of drug-resistant strains undermine the currently employed drug-based treatments. The two primary issues when developing a vaccine are the selection of an appropriate vaccine antigen and the route of antigen administration. In our studies, we use one of the F. hepatica cysteine proteinases, which are promising antigens for vaccine construction. We evaluate the immunogenicity and protective ability of various modifications of this cysteine proteinase produced in plants. We show that substantial protection can be obtained when plant-expressed hybrid proteins are administered orally.
