Similar to many other tropical regions of the world, dengue is a major public health problem in Bangladesh where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vector. Through this serological survey, we present data on the magnitude (measured in proportions) of seroprevalence and seroconversion within 12 selected wards in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. In 2012 the observed dengue seroprevalence was 93% among individuals tested during post-monsoon with a seroconversion rate between pre- and post-monsoon periods of 57.7%. This finding suggests that dengue virus (DENV) circulated in the city during the observation period. Past exposure to dengue virus was highly associated with age, possession of indoor potted plants, types of mosquito control measures used, and human movement and attendance in mass gatherings, while the extent of dengue seroprevalence were not associated with the socioeconomic status of the study participants. Our findings suggest that household utilities and water management or storage practices and recognition and elimination of mosquito development sites and participation in mass gatherings are important factors that affect exposure to dengue. Intervention strategies should therefore target these factors for effective prevention and control of dengue infection.
