Tsetse flies transmit the parasites that cause sleeping sickness. Tsetse control can contribute to disease control thanks to cheap and efficient ‘tiny targets’ that attract tsetse using a panel of blue fabric, a highly attractive colour for the flies. However, the modern blue polyesters employed are only about half as attractive as traditional phthalogen blue cottons. It will be possible to engineer more-attractive polyesters using techniques based on those already employed for fabric colour matching to the human eye. However, because fly photoreceptors differ to those of humans, these methods must be modified to evaluate colour from the fly’s eye view. This paper continues recent work attempting to explain tsetse attraction to differently coloured fabrics using the calculated responses of fly photoreceptors to those fabrics. In particular, this paper investigates several different assumptions about the sensitivities of tsetse photoreceptors and the ways in which their responses are processed. Regardless of these assumptions, common principles for the engineering of attractive fabrics were determined. The tools provided with this paper, along with fabric engineering methods already in use, will permit the engineering of more-attractively coloured polyesters for the increased efficiency of tsetse and sleeping sickness control.
