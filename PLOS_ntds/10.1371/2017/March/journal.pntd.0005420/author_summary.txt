Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar is a life-threatening neglected tropical disease that annually affects half a million people worldwide. In the Indian subcontinent (India, Nepal, Bangladesh), the disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, which is transmitted by female sand flies. Currently, the Kala-azar elimination program aims at reducing the number of VL cases in the region to less than 1 in 10.000 at upazila, sub-district and district level in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal respectively. In support of this program, tools for tracking L. donovani populations are essential, because these allow monitoring geographic spread over time. However, the parasite populations in the region are highly homogeneous, requiring sequencing of the entire genome to gather sufficient information for discriminating them. Because whole genome sequencing (WGS) is impractical for large-scale use, we designed a simple alternative to identify the WGS-genotypes. Our method is based on PCR amplification followed by sequencing of one particular locus, diagnostic of each population. We provide proof-of-principle that our method can be used to track parasite populations over time, and to correlate them with clinical parameters. We believe that our assay can support the Kala-azar control efforts in the Indian subcontinent.
