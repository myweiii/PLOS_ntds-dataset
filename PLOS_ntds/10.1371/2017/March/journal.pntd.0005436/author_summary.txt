Congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, remains a problem of global public health impact in endemic areas where vectorial and transfusional transmission have been controlled and in non-endemic countries due to migration movements. Little is known about how the parasiteÂ´s presence and genetic variability affect placental capacity to protect the fetus. This study explores, for the first time, the effects of placental environment infection by analyzing parasite persistence and gene expression using functional genomics and biological network analyses in mice infected by two strains of T. cruzi, with differential capacity of congenital transmission. The infection with the strain with a stronger placental tropism was associated to a higher degree of up-regulation in genes related to innate immunity and response to interferon-gamma. Our findings suggest that the placental environment exerts a strong immune response in detriment of cellular metabolism modulated by the parasite strain. These findings constitute a significant contribution to better understand the mechanisms causing congenital infection of T. cruzi.
