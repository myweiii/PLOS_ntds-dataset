Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses utilize artificial and natural containers as larval habitats. Adults do not usually disperse far (< 500 m) from these larval habitats in urban and peri-urban environments. Highly heterogeneous distributions raise significant logistic challenges to conduct informative surveillance. Public health imperatives require contemporaneous vector mosquito presence-absence data for highly urbanized regions that are both vulnerable to invasions and have frequent exposure to viremic travellers. We developed a promising tool to expedite presence-absence surveillance of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus by integrating molecular diagnostics with ovitraps and automated egg quantification software. The high sensitivity of the molecular assays enabled samples from multiple ovitraps to be pooled and processed for each diagnostic test. This innovation resolves the considerable logistic constraints inherent in traditional ovitrap surveillance programs. Proof of concept was evaluated in field trials in Queensland geographies where Ae. aegypti is considered either absent, present or at the margin of its range (Brisbane, Rockhampton and Goomeri, respectively). Aedes aegypti was detected in Goomeri and Rockhampton and not detected in Brisbane. Further investigation is required to address the inaccuracy of automated egg counting software whenever contaminants are present. RSVP can accommodate varied ovitrap designs and deployment configurations, improves efficiency in laboratory and labor costs for high volumes of samples, and enables a rapid turnaround of results. The RSVP system can innovate surveillance programs for early-warning of invasion, eradication, and quality assurance for vector control in disease response contexts.
