Since many outbreaks of infectious diseases last only six to eight weeks, there is a need for trial designs that can be implemented rapidly in the face of uncertainty. The Generic Ordinal Sequential Trial (GOST) is a flexible statistical design for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment for an emerging infectious disease with standard care. The details of the design are derived to satisfy a generic power requirement using large sample theory. The accuracy of the approach for moderate sample sizes is then checked using million-fold simulations, and found to be very reliable under a wide range of circumstances. Total sample sizes (across both treatments) of between 150 and 300 patients prove to be adequate in many cases, although more patients may be needed if the majority of patients die or if the majority experience complete recovery, as there is then less evidence available to distinguish between treatments. An advantage of the approach is that any erroneous assumptions made at the design stage about the proportion of patients falling into each outcome category have little effect on the error probabilities of the study, although they can lead to inaccurate forecasts of sample size.
