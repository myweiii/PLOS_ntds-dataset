Chagas disease remains a significant public health issue infecting 6â€“7 million people worldwide. The factors influencing the clinical heterogeneity of Chagas disease have not been elucidated, although it has been suggested that different clinical outcome may be associated with the genetic diversity of T. cruzi isolates. Moreover, differences in therapeutic response of distinct T. cruzi genotypes have been also reported. Typing strategies for genotype-specific diagnosis of Chagas disease to identify the T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTU) have already been developed, including biochemical and molecular methods, however the techniques have limitations. The majority of these methods can not directly be performed in biological and clinical samples. In addition, it has been proposed that parasite isolates from blood may not necessarily represent the full set of strains current in the individual as some strains can be confined to tissues. The improvement of genotype-specific serology to identify the T. cruzi DTU(s) present in a given host may provide a useful tool for clinical studies. In the present investigation, we developed an innovative TcI/TcVI/TcII Chagas Flow ATE-IgG2a technique with applicability for universal and genotype-specific diagnosis of T. cruzi infection that may contribute to add future insights for genotype-specific diagnosis of Chagas disease.
