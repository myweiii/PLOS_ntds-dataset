In this study, we compared measures of entomological risk collected through routine household entomological monitoring by estimating an association with human DENV infection. Longitudinal entomological and human serology data from Iquitos, Peru, were used to test associations between Ae. aegypti indices and the 6-month risk of DENV seroconversion. Our analysis found no association between cross-sectional measures of Ae. aegypti abundance and the risk of DENV seroconversion. Longitudinal measures of Ae. aegypti were better proxies for DENV risk, primarily among adult stage mosquito indicators. DENV transmission is complex and time-varying; the relationship between vector density and risk is not static nor adequately characterized through periodic entomological surveillance. While entomological monitoring will continue to serve a role in the evaluation of vector control interventions (e.g., comparing pre- and post-intervention abundance), our analysis challenges the validity of most Ae. aegypti indicators as adequate proxies for true DENV exposure risk.
