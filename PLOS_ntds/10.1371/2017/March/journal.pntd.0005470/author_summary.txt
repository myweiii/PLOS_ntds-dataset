The urgency, as well as the logistical and sometimes ethical challenges of clinical trials for interventions during epidemics of emerging diseases prompts the need for novel designs and analytic strategies. The successful use of a novel cluster-randomized ring-vaccination trial to test an Ebola vaccine in Guinea raises the general question of what circumstances would favour the use of trials of similar design and how the properties of the population, the vaccine and the trial would influence the necessary sample size and the expected results. We present a generalized transmission dynamic model for a ring vaccination trial to address these questions. This work is an example of the general phenomenon that mechanistic, transmission-dynamic simulations can aid in the design and interpretation of intervention trials for infectious diseases, when the trial itself can have non-obvious effects on transmission dynamics that may not be fully captured by effect- and sample-size calculations for noncommunicable diseases.
