Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a life-threatening infection endemic in tropical countries. Definitive diagnosis of melioidosis relies upon bacterial culture which requires suitable laboratory facilities and reliable antibody testing. To obtain an effective target antigen for use in a simple point-of-care (POC) test, rapid ELISAs using crude B. pseudomallei antigen preparations or purified O-polysaccharide (OPS) and hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp1) were compared using serum samples from three large collections obtained from melioidosis patients and patients with other bacterial infections. We detected high levels of antibodies to Hcp1 and OPS in serum from melioidosis patients upon admission and showed that anti-Hcp1 levels declined post-recovery. When serum samples from endemic areas were tested, the performance of the Hcp1-ELISA and combined Hcp1/OPS-ELISA were higher than the OPS-ELISA. When serum from non-endemic areas was tested, the combined Hcp1/OPS-ELISA gave the highest performance. Both the OPS- and Hcp1-based ELISAs were useful for detection of antibodies in various groups of patients including diabetics. Since anti-Hcp1 titers in melioidosis patient serum were higher than anti-OPS titers, Hcp1 is an attractive candidate for further development of a rapid POC test for use in endemic areas.
