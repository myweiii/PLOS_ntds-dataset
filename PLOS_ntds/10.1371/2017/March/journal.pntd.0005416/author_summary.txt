Due to socio-economical and meteorological changes, the geographical distribution of several tick species is changing. As ticks are the most important vectors of pathogens in northern latitudes, performing epidemiological studies is essential to assess the extent of tick activity as well as the risk of pathogens transmission. The detection of the bacteria Rickettsia helvetica in questing ticks in western France, for the first time, raises the possibility that bacteria other than those classically implicated may be involved in rickettsial diseases in this region.
