Pathogenic fungi often present two distinct forms, which are correlated to the host’s inflammatory response and eventual disease outcome. Chromoblastomycosis is a fungal disease occurring especially in tropical areas, and it is most often caused by the dimorphic fungus Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Although it is not a notifiable disease, it is estimated that this disease affects several million people worldwide. Treatment includes long-term antifungal chemotherapy and it is often combined with physical and surgical treatment, even so the relapse ratio is high. We were able to demonstrate the existence of two distinct fungal-host interactions. Muriform cells were responsible for inflammatory response and conidia were related to fungus persistence in the tissue, highlighting fungal dimorphism as an important element in understanding the bipolar nature of the inflammatory response in some fungal infections. These data open avenues to rethinking a better treatment schedule that takes into consideration the host’s immune response to fungal infections.
