Type 1 reactions affect leprosy patients and are due to increased inflammation in skin and nerves that can cause disfiguring skin lesions and loss of sensation and loss of power in the hands and the feet. These disabilities can lead to deformity and severe disability. It is important to improve the treatment for T1 reactions. T1R are currently treated with steroid tablets and about 50% patients will have improvement in their nerve function after treatment. Azathioprine is a cheap widely available immune-suppressant and we tested whether it could improve skin and nerve function in leprosy patients. We did a randomised double blind study in four leprosy hospitals in India giving 345 patients treatment with steroids plus either azathioprine or placebo. 78% of patients had improved skin, 35% had improved sensory and 50% had improved motor nerve function at the end of treatment. Treatment with azathioprine did not increase patient improvement and the improvements we found were associated with steroid treatment. There was a high rate of adverse effects from both steroids and azathioprine. These findings highlight the difficulty in switching off leprosy inflammation and the need for better treatments for reactions and nerve damage. The problems of steroids causing adverse effects in patients needs to be highlighted in leprosy programmes. Research is needed to identify patients who do not respond to steroid treatment and develop alternative treatments for them.
