Plague in China is shown to be in 12 kinds of natural foci with a large scale geographic and complex structure. Each plague focus has a unique ecological environment, specific geographic regions, landscape characteristics and specific hosts and vectors for the maintenance and transmission of Y. pestis. Once the environment alters, the amount and density of hosts and vectors change and so does the survival of Y. pestis. Consequently, a rest or slightly active foci can com alive, rapidly cause plague among animals and/or humans and then disappear for long periods of time. A plague outbreak among animals and humans caused by the construction of a large reservoir in southwest China is reported in this study. The reservoir was located on the border between Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Guangxi Hills on the Nanpan River, and the reservoir was not previously believed to contain the plague.
