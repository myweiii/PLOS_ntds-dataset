Intestinal parasitic infections are considered indicators of health and socio-environmental vulnerability, and are associated with precarious sanitation and water quality of a country. They continue to pose a serious public health problem, especially in developing countries where sanitation is not expanded in line with population growth, such that access to basic services becomes more difficult. Although Brazil is a country with a high prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections, the prevalence in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (the second largest metropolitan area in the country) has not been estimated. Based on the identification of social determinants (income, education and sanitation), our group was able to identify vulnerable areas for intestinal parasitic infection in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Infections caused by intestinal parasites are not included in the list of diseases compulsory notification in Brazil. However, special attention should be focused on this topic, and information on the geographic distribution and prevalence of intestinal parasites, as well as the recognition of vulnerable areas, are the first steps, and a prerequisite for development of appropriate control strategies by the government.
