Trypanosoma brucei is protected by an essential Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat in the mammalian bloodstream. The active VSG gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), which typically only transcribes rDNA. Pol I transcription inhibitors are under clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy. As T. brucei relies on Pol I for VSG transcription, we investigated its susceptibility to these drugs. We show that quarfloxin (CX-3543), CX-5461, and BMH-21 are effective against T. brucei at nanomolar concentrations. T. brucei death was due to rapid and specific inhibition of Pol I transcription. Incubation with Pol I transcription inhibitors also resulted in disappearance of Pol I subnuclear structures like the nucleolus and the VSG expression site body (ESB). Rapid ESB loss followed the Pol I transcription block, arguing that the ESB is nucleated by Pol I transcription. Pol I transcription inhibitors could therefore potentially function as novel drugs against trypanosomiasis.
