The Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite inflicts significant morbidity in endemic populations across the globe, but has been overshadowed by the more fatal P. falciparum parasite. In malaria-endemic regions outside of Africa, the declining prevalence of P. falciparum is coupled with a proportionate rise in P. vivax, reflecting the greater refractoriness of P. vivax to transmission interventions. This worrying trend emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the patterns of P. vivax transmission and spread within and across borders. Genotyping parasite population samples at short tandem repeat (STR) markers such as microsatellites informs on diversity, population structure and underlying transmission patterns. We have established vivaxGEN, an online platform providing a repository for P. vivax STR genotyping data, and tools for standard population genetic analyses. The platform currently holds publicly available data from 5 vivax-endemic countries that can be browsed on the website (http://vivaxgen.menzies.edu.au). VivaxGEN will support researchers to conduct local STR-based P. vivax studies with greater autonomy and foster collaborative studies enabling regional overviews of P. vivax diversity in different endemic settings and across borders. The system can be adapted for STR-based analyses in other microorganisms and the open access source code is provided to facilitate these developments.
