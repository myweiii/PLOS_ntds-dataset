Polyamines are polycationic compounds essential for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. In contrast with other protozoa, Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is auxotrophic for polyamines; therefore the intracellular availability of these molecules depends exclusively on transport processes. It was previously demonstrated that the lack of polyamines in T. cruzi leads to its death, making the polyamine transporter an excellent therapeutic target for Chagas disease. In this work, the polyamine permease TcPAT12 was selected as a target for drug screening using 3000 FDA-approved compounds and computational simulation techniques. Using two combined virtual screening methods, isotretinoin, a well-known and safe drug used for acne treatment, bound to substrate recognition residues of TcPAT12 and was chosen for further in vitro studies. Isotretinoin inhibited not only the polyamine transport but also all tested amino acid transporters from the same protein family as TcPAT12. Interestingly, isotretinoin showed a high trypanocidal effect on trypomastigotes, with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. Autophagy and apoptosis were proposed as mechanisms of parasites death induced by isotretinoin. These results suggest that isotretinoin is a promising trypanocidal drug, being a multi-target inhibitor of essential metabolites transporters.
