Burkholderia pseudomallei is endemic to the tropics and is responsible for the disease melioidosis. Exposure rarely evolves to significant disease in the absence of specific comorbidities. Conversely, in susceptible hosts, the disease can be rapidly fatal if unrecognised. Patients require an extended course of intravenous and oral antibiotic therapy to treat the disease and to prevent its recurrence. This retrospective, case series describes the epidemiology, presentation and outcomes of 197 cases of melioidosis in Far North Queensland (FNQ), Australia. The study confirms that melioidosis is predominantly a seasonal, opportunistic infection occurring among patients with specific comorbidities that include diabetes mellitus, hazardous alcohol use, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, malignancy and immunosuppressive therapy. Melioidosis is more common in the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) population, which has a higher prevalence of these comorbidities. Although overall case-fatality rates are declining, they are higher in the ATSI population, reflecting ongoing socioeconomic disadvantage. Disease recurrence is more likely in patients with inadequate source control and suboptimal adherence, factors that are not necessarily mitigated by extending the duration of intravenous therapy.
