The molecular mechanisms that underpin the link between scabies and bacterial pathogens were unknown. We proposed that scabies mites play a role in the establishment, proliferation and transmission of opportunistic pathogens. We investigated here the synergy between mites and one of the most recognised mite associated pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes. As part of the innate immune response mammals have a pre-programmed ability to recognise and immediately act against substances derived from fungal and bacterial microorganisms. This is mediated through a sequential biochemical cascade involving over 30 different proteins (complement system) which as a result of signal amplification triggers a rapid killing response. The complement cascade produces peptides that attract immune cells, increases vascular permeability, coats (opsonises) the surfaces of a pathogen, marking it for destruction, and directly disrupts foreign plasma membranes. To prevent complement mediated damage of their gut cells, scabies mites secrete several classes of complement inhibiting proteins into the mite gut and excrete them into the epidermal mite burrows. Furthermore, these inhibitors also provide protection for S. pyogenes. We verified here specifically the impact of the mite complement inhibitor SMSB4, to identify the molecular mechanisms behind the long recognised tendency of S. pyogenes to infect mite-induced skin lesions.
