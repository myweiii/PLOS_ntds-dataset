Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection whose natural domestic cycle develops between dogs and sheep (and other livestock). Human infection is endemic in pastoral communities, where close contact with the dog-sheep cycle occurs. In humans, as well as in livestock, the parasite develops as fluid-filled cyst mainly in the liver. CE is a neglected disease, as it is a disabler without high mortality, it affects mainly poor communities, and requires complex and expensive clinical management and long-term integrated public health control strategies. The prevalence of infection in an area is often unknown or largely underestimated, therefore the problem is perceived as not important. In Morocco, the Mid Atlas is the most prevalent area for human and animal infection. We performed an ultrasound survey on 5,367 people in Ifrane and El Hajeb provinces, and found an overall prevalence of 1.9%. CE cysts were predominantly inactive, however, active cysts were present also in adults. Our results show a high prevalence and on-going transmission of CE, encouraging the prompt strengthening and complete implementation of control activities envisaged by Moroccan health authorities in the area and the adoption of diagnosis and treatment algorithms based on imaging at both national and local level, to avoid a risk-associated and expensive treatment of inactive cysts.
