We thank Dr. Shinya Kawamura at Rakuno Gakuen University for GIS technical support. We also thank Ms. Atsuko Niki at Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health for the investigation on the existence of prefectural annual hygiene reports between 1913 and 1933, which confirmed the loss of these archives.
