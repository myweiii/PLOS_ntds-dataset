Onchocerciasis is a tropical parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease mainly occurs across tropical Africa and infection can result in blindness, debilitating itching and a variety of skin changes. Initial research concentrated mainly on the problem of blindness. A number of studies on onchocercal skin disease were performed but were difficult to interpret and compare because of the use of inconsistent terminology. Within the setting of one of the early trials of ivermectin in a savanna area of northern Nigeria, where there were known high rates of onchocercal blindness, we used a novel clinical classification of the skin changes in onchocerciasis. We identified significant levels of itching and various forms of onchocercal skin disease within these endemic communities. A positive skin-snip result proved to be a significant risk factor for the presence of chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD), depigmentation, hanging groin and onchocercal nodules. Comparable results were found when the presence of nodules was used as the marker for infection and similar, though weaker odds ratios were found with microfilarial load per se. The findings triggered a reassessment of the true burden of skin disease in onchocerciasis. It is the first detailed report of the association between onchocercal skin disease and markers of infection.
