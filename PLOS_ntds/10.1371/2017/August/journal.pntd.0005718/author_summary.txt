Infectious diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti, also known as the yellow fever mosquito, are of growing concern in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue and Zika incidences are increasing, and no vaccines are currently available. Here we investigate the origin of California A. aegypti and find that this mosquito likely entered California on multiple occasions, at least once from the South Central US region and once from the Southwest US/northern MX region. The evidence suggests that the first invasion event likely occurred some years before its initial detection in 2013, despite Californiaâ€™s extensive and active surveillance program, implying that this invasive mosquito can go undetected. Understanding the invasion dynamics, gene flow, and population structure of A. aegypti can improve the monitoring of mosquitoes and prevent outbreaks of vector-borne disease.
