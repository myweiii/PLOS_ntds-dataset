This paper examines the ecological underpinnings of the invasive mosquito Ae. albopictus and the associated risk of arboviral transmission in New York City. We aim to quantify the relationships between local environmental and meteorological conditions and Ae. albopctus abundance. Further, we explicitly determine risk of local arbovirus disease transmission by Ae. albopictus by overlaying imported chikungunya cases from the epidemic year of 2014. Our overarching objective is to determine the extent of Ae. albopictus infestation and the distribution of viremic human hosts to predict risk of localized chikungunya outbreaks in New York City, and use these predictions to focus vector control and community education interventions to localities at greatest risk. We develop a model incorporating both local environmental and meteorological conditions to predict Ae. albopictus populations at fine spatial scale. We find that peak imported chikungunya cases and Ae. albopictus populations are temporally synchronous but primarily spatially asynchronous. The areas that do have high arboviral importation and Ae. albopictus populations should be prioritized for vector control and education interventions.
