Sporotrichosis is polymorphic infection that is acquired after traumatic implantation of Sporothrix propagules into host tissues. In Brazil, large epizooties occur in domestic cats and consequently massive zoonotic transmission has been observed since the 2000s without signs of decreasing over time. In this study, we explored a subcutaneous murine model of sporotrichosis mimicking the alternative route of transmission considering animal horizontal transmission (cat-cat) and zoonotic transmission (cat-human) in which S. brasiliensis yeasts are inoculated. Surprisingly, we found that virulence in the clonal offshoot S. brasiliensis is strain-dependent where highly virulent isolates can disseminate from the site of inoculation (footpad) to vital organs of infected animals, inducing dramatic weight loss, which correlates with host death. Such variation may be regarded as a function of the host's immune response delivered against Sporothrix. Additionally, humoral immune responses produced IgG against isoforms of 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (gp60-gp70) and a 100-kDa molecule. Our study demonstrated that increased or attenuated virulence occurs in S. brasiliensis considering the route of infection, morphotype inoculated and the mammalian immune response. In addition to improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of the emerging animal-born S. brasiliensis, this study has key implications for future developments in serological diagnosis and vaccination efforts.
