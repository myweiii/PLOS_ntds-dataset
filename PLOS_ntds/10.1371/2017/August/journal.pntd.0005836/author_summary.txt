Thermotolerance is a pre-requisite for microbes to propagate successfully as human pathogens. In this study, we have investigated the role of Heat shock protein 90 in the pathogenesis and thermotolerance of C. neoformans, an environmental fungus that causes meningoencephalitis in humans. We show that thermotolerance of Cryptococcus critically depends on Hsp90 function as modest inhibition of Hsp90 function, robustly compromised growth of the fungus at 37째C with little effect at 25째C. This observation correlated with the fact that pharmacological inhibitor, 17-AAG also showed a more potent inhibition of ATPase activity of the protein at 37째C as indicated by a lower IC50 as compared to 25째C. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody specific to CnHsp90 revealed cell surface localization of Hsp90. BFA sensitivity of such surface localization indicated involvement of ER-Golgi classical secretory pathway for this localization. Furthermore, inhibition of Hsp90 function not only abrogated the natural resistance of C. neoformans to cell wall targeting inhibitors echinocandins but also led to decrease in capsular assembly which is one of the classical virulence determinants of the pathogen. In all, this study provides the first detailed biochemical as well as functional insights into the role of Hsp90 in governing thermotolerance and augmenting virulence factors in C. neoformans.
