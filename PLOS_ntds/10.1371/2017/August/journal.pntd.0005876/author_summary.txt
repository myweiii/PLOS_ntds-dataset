Colombia is one of the countries with the highest incidence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in the world and the army population is the most vulnerable population. Herein, we identified the infecting Leishmania species (L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis, L. mexicana and L. lainsoni). We also showed the high intra-specific genetic variability of L. braziliensis and L. panamensis and how these genotypes are distributed at the geographic level.
