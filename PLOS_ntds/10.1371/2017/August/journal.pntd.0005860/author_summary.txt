A chikungunya epidemic recently occurred in Mandera, Northern Kenya, with over 1,700 cases reported. The disease epidemics are linked to the urban vector, Aedes aegypti. This mosquito species is rapidly expanding its range and it is currently abundant in and around the major urban cities of Kenya. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of Ae. aegypti from three distinct cities of Kenya to transmit chikungunya virus (CHIKV) under laboratory conditions. Our findings showed that populations of Ae. aegypti from Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nairobi were competent vectors for CHIKV. Overall, about 60% of the Ae. aegypti that ingested â‰¥106.9 plaque-forming units of virus/ml became infected and about 10% of the virus-exposed mosquitoes transmitted virus to a capillary tube. Vector competence remains a prerequisite in disease risk assessment, while surveillance and control of Ae. aegypti should remain the main focus in many disease control programs and should be performed routinely.
