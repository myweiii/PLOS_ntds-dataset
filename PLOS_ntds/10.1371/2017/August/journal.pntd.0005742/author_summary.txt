The work on which the paper is based was conducted in two Ebola ‘hotspots’ in Sierra Leone (urban Freetown and rural Bombali district) between January and April 2015. Numerous misperceptions about Ebola had developed in the community over the course of 2014, and it was becoming increasingly clear that the largely top-down messaging strategy in use was not as effective as it could have been. Our project aimed to actively include the community in the development of a set of actionable Ebola messages that responded directly to their needs and concerns. While developing our messages on such topics as ambulances, burial teams, and the use of chlorine, we derived a set of recommendations that could also be applicable to control efforts relating to other infectious disease outbreaks. These include the importance of listening to community concerns during an outbreak, communicating on a two-way basis using trusted messengers, and engaging with relevant officials throughout the project in order to maximise the likelihood of the findings being utilised. While our work is based empirically on one disease in one setting, the messaging principles that emerged out of it are to a large degree generic.
