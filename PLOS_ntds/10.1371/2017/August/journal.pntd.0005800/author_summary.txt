Buruli ulcer is an emerging tropical disease that is also increasingly common in the temperate Australian state of Victoria. The mode of transmission of this geographically restricted infection remains elusive. We have accurately mapped the location of 649 PCR-confirmed Buruli lesions affecting 579 patients and displayed their position on front and back human body diagrams. Lesion distribution density was assessed with computer-generated heat-maps. Buruli lesion distribution was most common on exposed parts of the body (distal limbs). However, even on exposed areas, lesion distribution was highly unevenly distributed and focused towards ankles, backs of calves and elbows. The palmar and plantar surfaces of hands and feet were rarely affected. We propose that targeting behavior by biting insects rather than direct contact with a contaminated environment best explains the lesion distribution we observed.
