Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Naegleria fowleri pathogens are widespread throughout the world infecting and killing hundreds of thousands of people every year. They are also listed as category B bioterrorism agents by the NIH and the CDC. However, there is a serious unmet need to develop more effective therapies to treat these deadly pathogens. Herein we describe that lignans isolated from the creosote bush, common to the southwestern U.S.A. and throughout Mexico, display relatively potent antiparasitic activity against E. histolytica, G. lamblia, and N. fowleri.
