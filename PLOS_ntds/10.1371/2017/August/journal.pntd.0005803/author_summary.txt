East Coast fever, caused by the tick-borne protozoan parasite Theileria parva, is a disease that results in significant bovine morbidity, mortality, and production losses in regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Susceptible cattle develop clinical signs within a 7â€“14 days of exposure, which often progress to severe pulmonary edema and death. Control of East Coast fever in affected regions of Africa is largely prohibited by the lack of an affordable and efficacious vaccine. Furthermore, pastoralist farmers in affected regions of Africa often lack resources to prevent losses due to East Coast fever, so these production losses play a significant role in food security and protein availability. Experimental immunization of cattle with a recombinant T. parva-derived antigen, p67, has shown promise in preventing East Coast fever, but this antigen is extremely difficult to produce in full-length in sufficient quantities, and results of immunization studies using truncated recombinant p67 products are highly inconsistent. In this study, p67 antigen production was optimized and produced for use in future immunization studies. Optimization of p67-based immunization strategies is an important step forward in the development of a sustainable, next-generation vaccine against T. parva, which is urgently needed to minimize losses associated with East Coast fever.
