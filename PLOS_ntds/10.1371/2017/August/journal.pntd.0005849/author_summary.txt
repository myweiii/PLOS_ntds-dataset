Onchocerciasis control in Africa has boomed with the ‘Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin’ program. Successes of this program over many African countries prompted the international community to set it as main strategy for elimination of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. In Cameroon, onchocerciasis prevalence in some areas is still higher than what was predicted, despite more than 15 years of mass treatment. Therefore, in the frame of enlargement of the treatment zones, there is a need for enriching local literature on changeable factors that influence adherence to ivermectin. In this study, we assessed possible association between systematic ivermectin intake and people’s beliefs/perceptions of the disease and the program in three neighbouring regions of the country. Beliefs on onchocerciasis and their associations with adherence may differ from one community to another within the same area of the country. Furthermore, among all the factors related to disease and program representations that were studied, perceptions of ivermectin campaign’s organization and of community drug distributor’s commitment are the ones that were most determinant in adherence to ivermectin. Efforts should be done by health authorities in the program implementation inside the communities, with better population ownership and ensuring of good community drug distributors’ work.
