Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease which mainly affects the rural population in tropical countries. In Sri Lanka the disease burden is an important cause of hospital admission (> 40,000 recorded annually). Most of the previous epidemiological studies in the Island have been done in tertiary care hospitals. We studied the snakebite admissions in all inpatient health facilities (44 primary hospitals and a tertiary care teaching hospital) in an entire rural district where the one of the highest incidence of snakebites reported. The Peripheral hospitals received the majority of snakebites that would be missed in the previous surveys conducted in tertiary care Hospitals. Such an approach is likely to incorporate significant referral bias which may not provide accurate data for health planning. Antivenom is freely available to Sri Lankan government hospitals. All peripheral hospitals keep antivenom and national guidelines are available on management of snakebites. Our data shows that the majority of snakebites in the district are successfully cared for within the primary hospitals only a few needing antivenom therapy. Most of the transfers were not indicated when compared to the criteria described in the national guidelines. Further education and confidence building in management of snakebite is recommended among all categories of health staff in the primary hospitals.
