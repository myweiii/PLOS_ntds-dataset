Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi produces a chronic and debilitating infectious disease known as Chagas disease, of major significance in Latin America and an emergent threat to global public health. In the absence of vaccines and/or appropriate chemotherapies, the search for parasite effectors that support infection of mammalian cells is a focus of significant interest. One such candidate is the Trypomastigote Small Surface Antigen (TSSA), a polymorphic molecule expressed on the surface coat of infective trypomastigote forms. Previous data indicated that recombinant versions of two different TSSA variants (termed TSSA-CL and TSSA-Sy) encoded by parasite strains belonging to extant phylogenetic groups exhibited contrasting host cell binding and signaling abilities. Here, we generated genetically modified strains of T. cruzi over-expressing different TSSAs to address this issue. Trypomastigotes over-expressing TSSA-CL, the ‘adhesive variant’, displayed improved adhesion and infectivity towards non-macrophagic cell lines as compared to those over-expressing TSSA-Sy or parental lines. In addition, and irrespective of the protein variant, TSSA over-expression enhanced trypomastigote-to-amastigote conversion. Overall, our data strongly suggest that TSSA plays an important role not only on the infectivity and differentiation of T. cruzi trypomastigotes but also on the phenotypic variability displayed by different strains of this parasite. These data, together with the fact that TSSA recalls a strong and likely protective humoral response during human infections, support this molecule as an excellent candidate for molecular intervention and/or vaccine development in Chagas disease.
