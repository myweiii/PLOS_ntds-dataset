Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide in children younger than 5 years. Exposure to animals in homes may be a risk factor for diarrhea in children. To test this, we studied a subset of children in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in rural western Kenya, whose caretakers reported the presence of animals in the children’s homesteads. In GEMS, children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) were matched with children without MSD, who were of the same sex, similar age and who lived in the same area. We asked questions about the presence and management of animals in the children’s homesteads. We also collected fecal specimens from domestic animals present at homesteads and tested these for microbes that could cause diarrheal disease in children. We found that children who reportedly washed their hands after animal contact, and who lived in a homestead with adult sheep that were not confined to a pen overnight, had a lower risk of MSD. Children who lived in homesteads that owned more adult sheep, or in which fresh rodent droppings were observed frequently, had a higher risk of MSD, as did children who reportedly participated in providing water to chickens in the homestead. We did not find any association between the presence of particular pathogens in household animals, and MSD in children.
