The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex comprises a broadly distributed group of alphaviruses in the Americas that have the potential to emerge and cause severe disease. Historically, VEE complex viruses have caused recurring outbreaks of human and equine encephalitis in Central and South America as well as Mexico, with at least one outbreak resulting in movement of the virus to the southern United States. We present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of complete genomic sequences of the most prominent member of the VEE complex, VEE virus (VEEV). We were able to identify the major forces influencing VEEV evolution, and using the inferred phylogenies we determined that VEEV evolves in geographically segregated lineages with enzootic transmission between rodents and mosquitoes apparently limiting its spread.
