The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos) is a country in the Greater Mekong Subregion. In Laos, the numbers of reported cases of malaria and deaths due to malaria have been gradually decreasing. Recently, the Lao government adopted a goal of eliminating malaria by 2030. To achieve this goal, we must understand the precise situation in each endemic area. With this background, we conducted a field survey in Attapeu, one highly endemic province, in 2015. We collected blood samples from 719 villagers, and most (98.1%, 705/719) had no fever (<37.5°C) at the time of survey. The samples were examined using three diagnostic methods: microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR revealed parasitemia in 6.5% of the villagers (47/719), and only one showed a fever (≥37.5°C) at the time of survey. The dominant species was Plasmodium vivax (87.2%, 41/47). Males and soldiers tended to be infected with malaria parasites whereas those with a history of multiple malaria episodes (≥3 times) tended to be asymptomatic malaria carriers. These findings suggest the need to implement targeted elimination plans for vivax malaria that include measures to protect males and soldiers, who are at high risk of malaria infection.
