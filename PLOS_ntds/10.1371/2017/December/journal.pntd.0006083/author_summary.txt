Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, which causes skin and nerve damage. Despite worldwide efforts to eliminate leprosy, the number of infected individuals who develop leprosy, is still substantial. Household contacts of new leprosy patients are especially at risk. Early diagnosis of leprosy is key in preventing lifelong handicaps as well as transmission. This requires field-friendly tests that identify individuals at risk of developing the disease before they develop clinical symptoms so that they can receive (prophylactic) treatment. Measuring antibody levels directed against the M.leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) provides an indication of the bacterial load. To identify whether anti-PGL-I Ab levels correlate with the development of leprosy in contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy cases, we analyzed these levels in 25 contacts who developed leprosy during 6 years of follow-up and 199 contacts who were not diagnosed with leprosy at 3 time points in 6 years. This study showed that anti-PGL-I Ab levels at intake did not significantly differ between contacts who developed leprosy during the study and those who remained free of disease. Therefore, anti-PGL-I Ab levels alone do not represent a practical tool for prediction of which household contacts will develop leprosy in an endemic area such as Bangladesh, with high levels of patients with paucibacillary leprosy. This stresses the need for a diagnostic test composed of a biomarker signature consisting of multiple biomarkers.
