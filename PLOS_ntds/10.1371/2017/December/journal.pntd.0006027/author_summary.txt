Nontyphoidal Salmonellae are a major, yet often neglected, cause of fatal invasive disease among young African children, responsible for over 100,000 deaths a year. There is currently a lack of prospective studies to understand the clinical presentation and course of this disease. Diagnosis can be confusing, antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem and no vaccine is available. Studying 263 consecutive cases of invasive Salmonella disease over a one year period, we observed disparate clinical presentations, precluding the possibility of making a reliable clinical diagnosis in cases of this disease. We confirmed high mortality rates, finding that young age, dyspnea and HIV infection are independent risk factors for death. These findings support both the need for improved measures for prevention, diagnosis and management of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease and indicate which children with this disease are at most need of intensive clinical care.
