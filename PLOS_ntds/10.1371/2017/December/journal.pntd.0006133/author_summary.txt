Rabies is a preventable viral disease and yet human rabies is still prevalent in many less-developed parts of the world. In those regions, the majority of human rabies deaths has been attributed to the low availability and poor accessibility of human antibodies (human immunoglobulin, HRIG), which can only be obtained from healthy individuals who volunteer to receive rabies vaccination. Although a cheaper alternative of equine origin (equine immunoglobulin, ERIG) is more readily available, it is not without safety risks and complications. HRIG and ERIG are effective in treating human rabies because they contain highly diverse antibodies that block different strains of rabies viruses from entering their pathogenic life cycle. To provide a similar spectrum of protection, we identified two antibodies, CTB011 and CTB012, which target conserved regions of the rabies viral particle across a wide range of strains. The 1:1 mixture of the two antibodies, SYN023, was demonstrated to have similar potency to HRIG in animal models. SYN023 therefore shows promise as a safer and more sustainable replacement of HRIG that can be massively produced to save lives.
