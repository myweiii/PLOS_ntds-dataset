Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted among humans by mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti. Despite their potential as targets to interrupt DENV transmission, mosquito genes that modulate infection in Ae. aegypti remain largely unknown. Using a field-derived Ae. aegypti population, we observed substantial variation in DENV load in the mosquito midgut. We hypothesized that this inter-individual variation contained valuable information to identify host factors modulating viral infection. We analyzed single-midgut transcriptomes using an approach that takes advantage of inter-individual variation among infected mosquitoes. We demonstrated the added value of this method by identifying novel host factors during early DENV infection of Ae. aegypti that went undetected by conventional pairwise comparison between DENV-infected and control groups. We confirmed the agonist role of a candidate gene encoding a sterol regulatory element-binding protein, which underlines the importance of lipid metabolism during DENV infection of the mosquito midgut. Our method for transcriptomic analysis can enhance genome-wide screens for host factors by taking advantage of inter-individual variation. It is also applicable to a wide range of phenotypic traits displaying inter-individual variation.
