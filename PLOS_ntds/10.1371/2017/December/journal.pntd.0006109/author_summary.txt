RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for selectively silencing genes for the validation of potential targets for drug and vaccine development. The susceptibility of juvenile Fasciola hepatica to double stranded (ds) RNA induced RNAi has been established but in F. gigantica a single report of a preliminary study on knockdown of a single gene transcript exists. In the absence of other tools of reverse genetics, RNAi occupies a centre stage in the validation of gene functions in Fasciola species. This study focuses on F.gigantica, an economically important veterinary parasite with a zoonotic potential. Here in this study, we optimized a set of simple methods for triggering RNAi in the F. gigantica juvenile liver fluke, which shows that a robust transcriptional suppression can be readily achieved across all targets tested and with protein suppression confirmed in one of the targets. These studies also highlight the need for developing an in vitro maintenance system for the fluke for validation of the RNAi protocols. These findings are important for researchers aiming to employ RNAi in investigations of liver fluke biology and target validation.
