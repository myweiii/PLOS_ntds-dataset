Urogenital schistosomiasis is highly endemic in Mozambique. This study was part of a multi-country trial, including Mozambique, designed to understand the impact of different schistosomiasis treatment strategies involving community-wide treatment (CWT), school-based (SBT), and treatment holidays over a five-year period. Results from Mozambique showed that although preventive chemotherapy was successful in reducing the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium over five-years, the most intense treatment approach, annual CWT, did not have a significantly greater impact than less intense treatment strategies, such as bi-annual SBT. Infection rates were higher among males, but there was no difference in response to treatment by gender. Four rounds of treatment (regardless of whether it was given in the community or school) did result in a significantly greater reduction of S. haematobium prevalence than two rounds of treatment over a five-year period. There was, however, a resurgent increase in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection shown after two consecutive treatment-holiday years, implying a bounce back in infection after a two year pause in treatment. Interestingly and unexpectedly, there was a significant reduction in prevalence of schistosomiasis in adults even in communities that had received SBT implying the force of transmission in the community had been decreased, even where only school children had been treated. These findings provide an evidence-base with significant logistical and cost-saving implications for programmatic decisions on how best to gain control of Schistosoma haematobium.
