Yaws is a neglected treponemal infection that is often transmitted among children in developing countries. Eradication programs in the 1940–50’s significantly reduced the incidence of yaws, but the disease has resurged. The World Health Organization has proposed to eliminate yaws by 2020, and mass treatment trials are underway in a number of countries. To assist in investigating the molecular epidemiology of yaws, we propose a new method for differentiating strains of the causative agent, Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue. Using this typing method, we identified seven molecular types in yaws patients from a small island in Papua New Guinea. This method may prove useful in clarifying reinfection vs. relapse, in detecting cases newly imported into a village, in tracking the development of macrolide resistant strains, and in helping to define the transmission of yaws strains within a region.
