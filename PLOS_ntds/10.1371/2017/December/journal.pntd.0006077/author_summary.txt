Although genetic characterization of pathogenic organisms is a powerful tool for investigating outbreak origins and transmission, associated high upfront costs and demanding technological maintenance exclude this tool for many under-resourced laboratories. Paradoxically, resource constrained regions commonly suffer from high rates of infectious diseases and could benefit most from genetic tracking tools. One such country is Madagascar, which lacks resources to acquire high tech genetic typing equipment, yet suffers from seasonal human plague outbreaks. A serious disease, plague is caused by the clonal bacterium, Yersinia pestis, and is capable of causing human outbreaks. Using plague as a model organism, we developed a genetic typing method that requires only basic, widely used molecular machinery. Our tools target unique single mutations in the Y. pestis genome to assign isolates to distinct phylogenetic groups with known geographical distributions. Transfer of this technology to Madagascar permits genetic characterization of strains from current outbreaks. This eliminates the need for external genetic analysis and expands the research capacity of this resource-constrained laboratory by allowing rapid, in-house strain typing. Ultimately, our goal is to help improve the ability of local institutes to genetically characterize circulating strains, link outbreaks to originating sources, and improve our understanding of the ecology of tropical diseases in resource-limited regions of the world.
