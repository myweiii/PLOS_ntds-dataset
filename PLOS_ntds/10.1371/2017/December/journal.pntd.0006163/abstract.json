    "Objectives": "We determined the seroprevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the adult resident population in Singapore following local outbreaks of chikungunya fever (CHIKF) in 2008\u20132009.",
    "Methods": "Our cross-sectional study involved residual sera from 3,293 adults aged 18\u201379 years who had participated in the National Health Survey in 2010. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies against CHIKV and dengue virus (DENV) and neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV.",
    "Results": "The prevalence of CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies among Singapore residents aged 18\u201379 years was 1.9% (95% confidence interval: 1.4%\u2013 2.3%). The CHIKV seroprevalence was highest in the elderly aged 70\u201379 years at 11.5%, followed by those aged 30\u201339 years at 3.1%. Men had significantly higher CHIKV seroprevalence than women (2.5% versus 1.3%, p = 0.01). Among the three main ethnic groups, Indians had the highest seroprevalence (3.5%) compared to Chinese (1.6%) and Malays (0.7%) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression identified adults aged 30\u201339 years and 70\u201379 years, men, those of Indian ethnicity and ethnic minority groups, and residence on ground floor of public and private housing apartments as factors that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of exposure to CHIKV. The overall prevalence of anti-DENV IgG antibodies was 56.8% (95% CI: 55.1%\u2013 58.5%), while 1.5% (95% CI: 1.1%\u2013 2.0%) of adults possessed both neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV and IgG antibodies against DENV.",
    "Conclusions": "Singapore remains highly susceptible to CHIKV infection. There is a need to maintain a high degree of vigilance through disease surveillance and vector control. Findings from such serological study, when conducted on a regular periodic basis, could supplement surveillance to provide insights on CHIKV circulation in at-risk population."
