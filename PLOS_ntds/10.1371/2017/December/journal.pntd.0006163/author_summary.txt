The prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was low at 1.9% among resident adults in Singapore after local outbreaks in 2008–2009. Adults aged 30–39 years and 70–79 years, men, those of Indian ethnicity and ethnic minority groups, and residence on ground floor of public and private housing apartments were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of exposure to CHIKV.
