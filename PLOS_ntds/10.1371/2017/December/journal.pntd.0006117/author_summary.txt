Leprosy is a transmissible disease that is still endemic in several countries including in Brazil, a country with highly variable region associated incidence of disease. Fortaleza is a city in Northeast Brazil with high incidence and conventional epidemiology studies are suggestive for high levels of recent transmission. Genotyping of M. leprae allows the recognition of individuals that have been infected with the same strain (called a cluster) and therefore being suggestive for belonging to the same transmission network. In the present work, by analyzing genotypes of M. leprae in the skin lesion of multibacillary patients, we made observations that improve our knowledge on interpretation of genotypes and clusters and confirm the high levels of recent transmission in the city of Fortaleza. This is one of the few studies that used molecular epidemiology to look for risk factors for recent transmission of leprosy and to our knowledge, the first in Brazil. Our data support further investigation of the workplace as a source of infection, preferentially by a study designed on a larger number of patients and including analysis of M. leprae present in the nose.
