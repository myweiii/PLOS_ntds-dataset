Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) remains an ongoing serious socio-economic threat, and with a lack of widely available licensed vaccines and treatments it is increasingly important to understand the underlying biology behind RVFV viral replication. Re-analysis of RVFV nucleocapsid, a key protein within the RVFV replication cycle has led to the characterisation of previously unidentified conserved amino acids. This study increases our understanding of the nucleocapsid protein which may play an important role in the future development of vaccine and antiviral therapies.
