Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging viral disease that has the potential to negatively impact future generations by causing birth defects in infected pregnant mothers. While there have been many studies performed in animal models of ZIKV infection, there have only been a limited number of reports studying the immune responses in humans. Ricciardi et. al. analyzed the immune response of a primary ZIKV infection in a dengue virus (DENV) naïve individual during the 2016 outbreak in Miami, Florida. B- and T-cell responses were assessed over multiple time points. Cross-reactive antibodies against DENV, a virus that the patient was never infected with, were generated during the ZIKV infection, but these antibodies failed to neutralize any of the DENV serotypes. Furthermore, while these DENV-cross-reactive antibodies might be expected to cause antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection, they did not. Interestingly, ADE of ZIKV infection was seen at approximately 1 ½ months after infection. Together, these results establish the timing of the ontogeny of the immune response against a primary ZIKV infection in a DENV-naïve individual.
