The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank and WHO has been providing training grants to strengthen research capacity in low- and middle-income countries for over 40 years. In order to assess to what extent TDR’s grants made a difference on the career development of these grantees, a survey tool was developed and implemented in collaboration with the European Science Foundation. The survey was answered by 77 individual trainees who completed their degree (masters or PhD) with support from TDR between 2000 and 2012. The study provided valuable information on factors involved in the career development of the trainees and influencing the local retention of the capacity that has been built, to prevent “brain drain”. Encouraging aspects, such as a 96% of the capacity being retained locally, a 92% full-time employment rate at the time of the survey, or 89% of the respondents still working in research showed the positive influence of TDR’s capacity strengthening grants on researchers’ career development. This was in line with 80% of the respondents rating TDR’s support as “very important”. The challenges, lessons learnt and further opportunities identified may be helpful to donors and policy-makers when designing research capacity programmes, fostering south-south collaboration, and setting funding priorities.
