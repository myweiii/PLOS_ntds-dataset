Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a genetically complex protozoan parasite. T. cruzi strains have been classified into seven Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), TcI-TcVI and Tcbat, which have been associated with different geographic distribution and transmission cycles. Two major evolutionary models have been proposed to explain the origin of hybrid lineages, but the phylogenetic relationships between the different T. cruzi DTUs are not completely understood. On the other hand, the molecular markers usually used for DTU identification are found in a low copy number and do not allow the direct typing of biological samples with low parasite burden. However, this goal can be reached using molecular targets with highly repetitive sequences like T. cruzi satellite DNA (SatDNA), widely used for molecular diagnostics of Chagas disease. This study has been focused on the phylogenetic analysis of SatDNA sequences from DTUs TcI-TcVI aimed to clarifying the origin of T. cruzi lineages. In addition, our findings open the possibility of typing clinical samples with low parasitic loads and improving SatDNA real-time PCR sensitivity for molecular diagnostics of T. cruzi infection.
