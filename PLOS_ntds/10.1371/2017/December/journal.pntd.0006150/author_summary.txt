Dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses are transmitted to people primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. Diseases transmitted by the Ae. aegypti mosquito are a growing public health concern. Mosquito control is the principal means of preventing and controlling disease outbreaks. In this study, we compared the characteristics of households with and without DENV infections in the city of Machala, Ecuador. We found that risk factors for DENV infection included proximity to abandoned properties, interruptions in the piped water supply, and a highly shaded patio. Protective factors included the use of mosquito bed nets, fumigation inside the home, and piped water inside the home. These findings can be used to inform targeted interventions by the public health sector at the household and community levels.
