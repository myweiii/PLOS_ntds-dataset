Conventional prophylactic vaccines require transport and storage under controlled temperatures in an unbroken cold chain. Therefore, distribution of many vaccines is restricted to areas where the cold chain can be maintained which excludes especially rural areas in many countries from continues vaccine supply. Unfortunately, some diseases that can be prevented by vaccination, like the rabies virus infection, are still endemic in such areas. Therefore, logistic reasons often prevent delivery of life saving vaccines to areas in which they are most needed. Here, we describe an mRNA vaccine encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) that remains protective in a mouse challenge model upon storage at highly variable temperatures. These results suggest that such a vaccine allows storage outside the cold chain and can therefore reach all areas of the world where rabies virus is endemic. Since mRNA vaccines consist of the same biochemical components, irrespective of the encoded protein, it is reasonable to assume that the thermostability observed for the rabies vaccine is a general characteristic of mRNA based vaccines.
