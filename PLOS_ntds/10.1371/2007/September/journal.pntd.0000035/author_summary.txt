Because of its importance to public health, the hookworm parasite has become the focus of increased research over the past decade—research that will ultimately decipher its genetic code. We now report a gene from hookworm chromosomes known as a transposon. Transposons are genes that can move around in the genome and even between genomes of different species. We named the hookworm transposon bandit because hookworms are “thieves” that steal the blood of their hosts, leading to protein deficiency anemia. The bandit transposon is a close relative of a well studied assemblage of transposons, the mariner-like elements, known from the chromosomes of many other organisms. The founding member of this group—the mariner transposon—was isolated originally from a fruit fly; mariner has been harnessed in the laboratory as a valuable gene therapy tool. Likewise, it may be feasible to employ the bandit transposon for genetic manipulation of hookworms and functional genomics to investigate the importance of hookworm genes as new intervention targets. Finally, bandit may have transferred horizontally from primates to hookworm or vice versa in the relatively recent evolutionary history of the hookworm–human host–parasite relationship.
