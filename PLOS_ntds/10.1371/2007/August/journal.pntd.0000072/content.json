    "Introduction": "Onchocerca volvulus is the filarial nematode, transmitted by\n                    Simulium flies, that causes human onchocerciasis, or\n                \u201criver blindness\u201d. It is estimated that 37 million people,\n                mostly in Africa, are infected with this worm [1]. At present, ivermectin\n                (IVM, Mectizan) is the only safe drug available for mass treatment of\n                onchocerciasis. IVM, administered at the standard dose of 150 \u00b5g/kg, has a\n                rapid effect on the embryonic stage of the parasite, the microfilariae (mf), which\n                cause most of the ocular and cutaneous manifestations of the disease. As a result of\n                this microfilaricidal effect, the skin microfilarial loads decrease by\n                95\u201399% within one month after treatment. The drug also blocks\n                the production of new mf by the adult female worms, who only resume mf release\n                3\u20136 months after treatment. This \u201cembryostatic effect\u201d\n                of IVM explains why the mf loads remain at very low levels for up to one year.\n                Furthermore, IVM treatments repeated at 1- to 3-monthly intervals have some, though\n                moderate, effect on the longevity of the adult worms (\u201cmacrofilaricidal\n                effect\u201d) [2,3].\nThe drug, when given repeatedly, is therefore acting on at least three components of\n                parasite fitness: reproduction, microfilarial survival and adult parasite lifespan,\n                which together affect morbidity and the intensity of transmission. Due to the\n                limited macrofilaricidal effect of the drug, treatments must be repeated and\n                sustained. Endemic communities in Africa receive annual IVM treatment, while those\n                of Latin America receive semi-annual treatments. To date, more than 400 million\n                treatments have been distributed in Africa [4], with some individuals\n                having received up to 18 annual treatments.\nDue to this enormous drug pressure on the parasite, there is a risk of resistance of\n                    O. volvulus to the drug [5\u20137]. This concern is\n                justified by reports of suboptimal responses to IVM from Sudan [8] and Ghana [9,10], although in the\n                former report reduced immune responsiveness in some of the treated people has been\n                suggested as a possible explanation for the suboptimal responses to IVM. And in the\n                study in Ghana the poor responses have been attributed to the parasites, with adult\n                female worms resuming microfilarial production earlier after treatment than\n                classically described. More recently, another report in Ghana [11] shows the\n                first unequivocal parasitological and epidemiological evidence of ivermectin\n                resistance in O. volvulus populations.\nIn addition to this evidence of IVM resistance, changes in the genetic structure of\n                    O. volvulus populations, associated with IVM treatments, have\n                been observed in parasites from Ghana [12\u201316]. These changes occurred particularly\n                on the \u03b2-tubulin gene [16,17], which has been associated with IVM\n                resistance in the sheep intestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus\n[17].\n                However, in these previous studies, O. volvulus from\n                IVM-na\u00efve and -treated human populations were collected from different\n                individuals in different communities.\nIt is important to assess whether the genetic changes reported in O.\n                volvulus are associated with a reduced response to IVM in any of the three\n                effects of IVM on parasite fitness, described above. Furthermore, to eliminate the\n                possibility that differences in genotype frequencies between IVM-na\u00efve and\n                -treated populations could be due to geographical effects, due to separate\n                individuals and communities being sampled, it is important to assess whether changes\n                in genetic frequency could occur in parasites collected from the same individuals\n                before and after exposure to IVM. Genetic changes clearly associated with treatment,\n                which could not possibly be associated with other covariates, would provide\n                unequivocal evidence of genetic selection by IVM on O. volvulus.\n                Such treatment-induced selection would be heritable. Heritable genetic changes that\n                could reduce the susceptibility of O. volvulus to any of the\n                effects of IVM on the parasite could have long-term consequences for the control of\n                onchocerciasis because there is currently no alternative drug available for mass\n                treatment of this disease.\nIn a previous study [18], we reported that in an IVM-na\u00efve\n                    O. volvulus population from Cameroon, adult female worms\n                presenting a homozygous genotype for \u03b2-tubulin were more fertile than adult\n                worms that were heterozygous at this locus. In the present study, we have analyzed\n                genetic characteristics (\u03b2-tubulin gene and two control\n                genes, heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) and acidic ribosomal\n                    protein (ARP)) and phenotypic characteristics (female worm fertility)\n                of parasites collected, in the same individuals, before and after 4 or 13 IVM\n                treatments over a three-year period. These treatments were administered as part of a\n                clinical trial conducted in Central Cameroon. The main objective of this trial was\n                to assess the effects of different regimens of IVM treatment on the mortality of\n                    O. volvulus adult worms, and the results of this phase have\n                been published elsewhere [3]. In the second phase, results of which are\n                presented in this paper, we evaluated whether repeated treatment with IVM led to (a)\n                genetic changes in the adult worm population and (b) any modification of the\n                relationship between \u03b2-tubulin genotype of the female worms\n                and their reproductive status.",
    "Methods": "Study Area, Study Design and Selection of Patients\nThe study was carried out in the Mbam Valley, a region hyper-endemic for\n                    onchocerciasis, located in the Central province of Cameroon, where no IVM had\n                    been distributed at the beginning of the study and where no vector control\n                    activities have ever been performed. In this area, before the introduction of\n                    IVM, the intensity of infection in the population, as expressed by the Community\n                    Microfilarial Loads (CMFL) [19] ranged between 10 and 114 mf per skin snip\n                    (mf/ss) [3]. The full details of the clinical trial, which was\n                    approved by the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health and by Merck and Co., the\n                    manufacturer of IVM (Mectizan), have been published elsewhere [3]. The\n                    study also subsequently received approval from the institutional review board of\n                    McGill University. Briefly, 657 individuals were selected using the following\n                    inclusion criteria: men between 18 and 60 years old, with at least two palpable\n                    nodules during the preliminary examination but otherwise in good health, who had\n                    not received any filaricidal treatment within the five previous years, and who\n                    agreed to participate in the trial by signing an informed consent form. These\n                    patients were randomly allocated to one of the four following IVM treatment\n                    groups: 150 \u00b5g/kg body weight/year (standard group; group 1); 150\n                    \u00b5g/kg/three-monthly (group 2); 800 \u00b5g/kg/year (group 3); and\n                    800 \u00b5g/kg/three-monthly (group 4). Over the three-year study period,\n                    patients received either 4 or 13 IVM treatments.\n\n\nCollection of Nodules and Parasitological Examination\nIn order to assess the macrofilaricidal effect of IVM on O.\n                    volvulus, adult worms were collected, by nodulectomy, at the outset of\n                    the trial (before the first IVM dose was administered) and once again after\n                    three years of treatment in the four different treatment groups described above.\n                    The protocol used for parasite collection was identical for the two rounds of\n                    nodulectomy. Just before each round of nodulectomy, each person was carefully\n                    examined and all the sites on their body where a nodule or a group of nodules\n                    was palpable were recorded on a body chart. Subsequently, one of the sites was\n                    selected at random and all the nodules located at this site were removed from\n                    each person. The site selected for the second nodulectomy was one of those\n                    recorded at the outset of the study so that the worms collected at that time had\n                    probably been subjected to the IVM treatments administered over the previous\n                    three years. Just after the nodulectomy, all the nodules collected were immersed\n                    in fixative (70% ethanol, 20% water, 10%\n                    glycerol). One of the nodules was used for histological examination, as\n                    previously described [3], to evaluate the status of the worms. Any\n                    additional nodules (\u201cextra nodule\u201d) from the excision site\n                    were stored in the fixative at room temperature and available for genotyping and\n                    phenotyping.\n\n\nSelection of Nodules for Genotyping and Phenotyping\nOf the 657 individuals selected before treatment, 290 had more than one nodule at\n                    the first nodulectomy site, and thus at least one \u201cextra\n                    nodule\u201d available after the histological examination. Similarly, of\n                    the 541 patients present at the second round of nodulectomy (following three\n                    years of treatment), 156 had at least one extra nodule available. Patients\n                    included in the present study were selected taking into account our objectives,\n                    which were to assess the genotypes of three polymorphic genes, including\n                        \u03b2-tubulin, in the adult worms, and any relationship\n                    between the genotype of female parasites and their reproductive status, before\n                    and after IVM treatment. To make the comparison more sensitive, we performed the\n                    genotyping and the phenotyping only on parasites obtained from those people for\n                    whom \u201cextra nodules\u201d, containing at least one adult worm,\n                    had been collected at both nodulectomy rounds (pre-treatment and after three\n                    years of repeated treatments). The total numbers of individuals who met these\n                    inclusion criteria were 18 in group 1, 16 in group 2, 22 in group 3 and 17 in\n                    group 4. Thus, the analyses were performed on the nodules collected from 73\n                    individuals.\n\n\nProcedure for Phenotyping the Female Reproductive Status\nThis procedure has been described previously [18]. In 2002, the\n                    nodules were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h with regular\n                    changes of medium in order to remove all residues of fixative. The nodules were\n                    then digested in collagenase [20]. Worms were collected and stored individually\n                    in labelled Eppendorf tubes, which were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Each\n                    female worm was phenotyped by microscopical examination of its reproductive\n                    status in terms of the presence of mf and embryos. Three phenotypes were\n                    defined: (a) non-fertile females, i.e. worms with empty reproductive organs, (b)\n                    females with low fertility, in which the reproductive organs contained only a\n                    few embryos, but no mf, and (c) fully fertile females, in which the reproductive\n                    organs were full of mf and embryos.\n\n\nProcedure for Genotyping\nAfter the phenotyping, each worm was disrupted and its DNA was extracted using a\n                    Dneasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada). Heat shock protein\n                    60 (hsp60) (GenBank, AF121264), which is a molecular\n                    chaperone that participates in the folding of proteins, was chosen as a control\n                    gene. It was known to be polymorphic and previously found not to be selected by\n                    IVM treatment in O. volvulus\n[16]. Two\n                    polymorphs (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cG\u201d) were found in\n                    the hsp60 gene partial sequence analyzed. The region analyzed\n                    started at position 214 on the cDNA and included 100 bp in the exon, followed by\n                    276 bp in the intron. The A/G polymorphism was located in the intron region. The\n                    fragment of 376 bp was amplified by PCR from individual adult worms with the\n                    primers 5\u2032CAA TCA TGG GGA AGT CCA AAG 3\u2032 and 5\u2032CTC\n                    AAA ACC TTC CTT TGC AAT 3\u2032 at\n                    Tm\u200a=\u200a53\u00b0C. PCR products were sequenced\n                    with the hsp60 anti-sense primer using the 3730XL DNA Analyzer\n                    system (McGill University/Genome Quebec Innovation Centre). Platinum Taq DNA\n                    polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) was used in the PCR reaction to avoid\n                    introduction of error during amplification. Each individual chromatogram was\n                    analyzed with Sequencher 4.7 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI,\n                    USA), to detect the homozygotes AA and GG and the heterozygotes AG.\nThe acidic ribosomal protein (ARP) gene\n                    (GenBank, AI130565), which is involved in protein synthesis, was chosen as a\n                    second control because it was expected to be polymorphic [21] and not known\n                    to be sensitive to IVM treatment. Two polymorphs (\u201cC\u201d and\n                    \u201cT\u201d) were found in the acidic ribosomal protein gene partial\n                    sequence analyzed. The region of interest was from 1270 bp to 1488 bp of the\n                    complete gene. It was amplified by PCR from individual adult worms with the\n                    primers 5\u2032 TGA AAA ACT GCT ACC GCA TA 3\u2032 and 5\u2032\n                    AAA TTT TCG TTG GAA TTT GC 3\u2032 at\n                    Tm\u200a=\u200a54\u00b0C. PCR products were analyzed\n                    by restriction fragment length polymorphism, based on C/T polymorphism apparent\n                    in the EST database, using the restriction enzyme Mnl 1 for 2 hours, and\n                    subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel\n                    (39\u22361) for 2 hours at 130 V, stained with ethidium bromide and\n                    visualized using an ABI Imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\nTwo alleles (\u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d) have been\n                    described for \u03b2-tubulin\n[16].\n                    These two alleles have three single nucleotide polymorphisms in an exon region.\n                    These differences lead to changes in three amino acids in the putative protein\n                    sequence. The worms were genotyped individually for\n                    \u03b2-tubulin (GenBank, F019886) by PCR amplification\n                    followed by amplicon length analysis [17].\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe aim of the analysis was to assess whether a variety of covariates related to\n                    the worm, nodule or patient characteristics were associated with three different\n                    dependent variables: (a) the inability to genotype some of the worms from the\n                    preserved nodules; (b) the frequency of the various polymorphs analyzed; and (c)\n                    the degree of fertility of the worm. We considered the five following\n                    covariates: the age of the patient at the outset of the trial (continuous\n                    variable); the CMFL in the village of residence of the patient, defined in four\n                    categories: 10\u201340, 41\u201360, 61\u201370, and\n                    71\u2013114 mf/ss; the treatment group (for analysis of the worms collected\n                    post-treatment: 150 \u00b5g/kg/year, 150 \u00b5g/kg/three-monthly, 800\n                    \u00b5g/kg/year, and 800 \u00b5g/kg/three-monthly); the total number\n                    of females in the nodule; and the total number of palpable nodules on the\n                    patient at the outset of the trial. In addition, we also assessed the degree of\n                    fertility in relation to the genotype of the worms and to the total number of\n                    males in the nodule.\n\n\nStudy of Possible Bias in Female Worms That Could Not Be Genotyped\nThe procedure for genotyping the worms failed with a significant number of worms\n                    obtained from the nodules that had been preserved at room temperature for 5 to 8\n                    years. To test whether this inability to genotype some worms could be explained\n                    by sampling biases, we assessed, using multivariate logistic regression, whether\n                    the success in genotyping the worm (genotyped vs. non-genotyped status) was\n                    associated with one or the other of the possible covariates quoted above. All\n                    regressions analyses were performed using Stata v9.0 (Stata Corporation, TX,\n                    USA), where parameters were estimated using the cluster option [22]\n                    accounting for intra-nodular correlation.\n\n\nChanges in Genotypic Frequencies\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the \u03c72 test,\n                    unless the sample size was small. In this case, Fisher's exact test was\n                    used. The genotypic frequencies before and after treatment were compared using\n                    Fisher's exact test. To evaluate whether some host covariates or\n                    village characteristics may have influenced the heterozygosity of the worms, the\n                    association between heterozygous status and the five main possible covariates\n                    quoted above was assessed separately on pre- and post-treatment data, by\n                    multivariate logistic regressions. Potential intra-nodule clustering was\n                    accounted in the regression models.\n\n\nRelationship between Genotype and Fertility of Female Worms Before and After\n                    Treatment\nLogistic regression models were used to analyze the independent variables\n                    associated with the fertility of the female worms before and after treatment.\n                    The dependent variable \u201cfertility\u201d was defined, for this\n                    analysis, using two categories: no or low fertility versus high fertility [18]. This choice is based on the fact that only worms\n                    with mf have the possibility of having their progeny transmitted, at the time of\n                    sampling, and this may be relevant to the possible transmission of any\n                    \u201cresistant\u201d genotypes. However, any treatment group effect\n                    on fertility status could be due to either treatment frequency or to the fact\n                    that the worms were collected three months after the last treatment in the\n                    three-monthly treated groups (groups 2 and 4) and twelve months post-treatment\n                    in the annual groups (groups 1 and 3). The possible covariates in the model\n                    included the five host-related independent variables defined above, and two\n                    other independent variables: the genotype of the worm at the\n                        \u03b2-tubulin locus (homozygous versus heterozygous),\n                    and the total number of males present in the nodule. Here again, the\n                    intra-nodule clustering was considered in the logistic regressions. The\n                        \u03c72 and Fisher's exact test analyses were\n                    performed using VassarStats (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).",
    "Results": "A total of 73 patients provided one nodule at the outset of the trial and one nodule\n                after treatment. A total of 367 worms (248 females, 119 males) were isolated from\n                the 73 nodules collected before treatment, and 224 worms (153 females, 71 males)\n                were extracted from the 73 nodules provided by the same hosts after three years of\n                repeated treatment. Details on the numbers of worms analyzed in the different\n                treatment groups are given in Tables\n                    1 and 2.\n\n\nStudy of the Independent Variables That Could Be Associated with the\n                    Inability to Genotype the Worms for the \u03b2-tubulin Gene\nWe previously showed, in a sample of 320 female worms collected before treatment\n                    as part of the same trial, that the 90 worms that could not be genotyped for\n                        \u03b2-tubulin did not differ significantly, with regard\n                    to several host independent variables, from the 230 worms that could be\n                    genotyped [18]. Similar results were obtained when comparing\n                    the 65 non-genotyped females to the 183 genotyped ones, and the 63 non-genotyped\n                    males to the 56 genotyped males, collected before treatment, from the 73 people\n                    from whom nodules could be analyzed both before and after treatment.\nThe proportion of female worms that could not be genotyped for\n                        \u03b2-tubulin was significantly higher after treatment\n                    (respectively 26.2% and 35.9% before and after treatment;\n                        p\u200a=\u200a0.043). Among the 153\n                    female worms collected after treatment, 55 could not be genotyped. According to\n                    multivariate logistic regression, the \u201cgenotyped\u201d status was\n                    not associated with any of the five covariates included in the analysis. The\n                    proportion of non-genotyped male worms did not differ significantly before and\n                    after treatment (respectively 52.9% and 63.4%;\n                    p\u200a=\u200a0.17). After treatment, we\n                    observed that a significantly higher proportion of male worms could be genotyped\n                    in the 800 \u00b5g/kg/year treatment group\n                    (OR\u200a=\u200a3.97 (95% CI,\n                    1.05\u201315.08);\n                    p\u200a=\u200a0.043) compared to the\n                    standard group. None of the other independent variables differed significantly\n                    between the genotyped and the non-genotyped male worms. Taken together, these\n                    results do not provide evidence of bias between the 45 non-genotyped and 26\n                    genotyped male worms according to the tested covariates.\n\n\nGenotypic Frequencies for the Heat Shock Protein 60 Gene\nMale worms.Amongst the 56 pre-treatment male worms that could be genotyped for this\n                        gene, the proportions of worms showing AA, AG and GG genotypes were\n                        8.9%, 32.1% and 59.0%, respectively. This\n                        gene was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium before treatment. After treatment,\n                        among the 29 genotyped males, the corresponding proportions were\n                        6.9%, 34.5% and 58.6%. Fisher's\n                        exact test did not demonstrate any significant difference in genotypic\n                        frequencies between pre- and post-treatment male worms\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.99). It was not\n                        possible to determine whether treatment frequency affected male worm hsp60\n                        genotype after treatment because the sample size was too small.\n\nFemale worms.Amongst the 187 pre-treatment female worms that could be genotyped, the\n                        proportions of AA, AG and GG were, respectively, 9.1%,\n                        35.3% and 55.6%. This gene was in Hardy-Weinberg\n                        equilibrium before treatment. After treatment, among the 89 genotyped\n                        females, the corresponding proportions were 6.8%,\n                        43.8% and 49.4%. Fisher's exact test did not\n                        demonstrate any significant difference in genotypic frequencies between pre-\n                        and post-treatment female worms\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.37). It was\n                        possible to pool the female worms based on frequency of treatment because\n                        there were no significant differences between groups 1 and 3 before\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.96) and\n                        after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.12), and between\n                        the groups 2 and 4 before treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.055) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.40).\n                        There were no significant differences in the hsp60 genotype frequencies\n                        between the pooled annual treatment groups before and after treatment\n                            (p\u200a=\u200a0.11) and between\n                        the three-monthly treatment groups before and after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.23).\n\n\n\nGenotypic Frequencies for the Acidic Ribosomal Protein Gene\nMale worms.Amongst the 114 pre-treatment male worms that could be genotyped for this\n                        gene, the proportions of worms showing CC, CT and TT genotypes were\n                        4.4%, 27.2% and 68.4%, respectively. After\n                        treatment, among the 67 genotyped males, the corresponding proportions were\n                        0%, 28.4% and 71.6%. Fisher's\n                        exact test did not demonstrate any significant difference in genotypic\n                        frequencies between pre- and post-treatment male worms\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.27). Hardy-Weinberg\n                        analysis was not conducted on the acidic ribosomal protein gene because it\n                        has multiple copies in eukaryotes with copies occurring at different loci\n                            [21]. It was possible to pool the male worms,\n                        in frequency of treatment groups, because there were no significant\n                        differences between groups 1 and 3 before treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.47) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.09), and\n                        between groups 2 and 4 before treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a1) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.59).\n                        There were no significant differences in ARP genotypes frequencies between\n                        the pooled annual treatment groups before and after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.51) and between the\n                        three-monthly treatment groups before and after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.19).\n\nFemale worms.Amongst the 209 pre-treatment female worms that could be genotyped, the\n                        proportions of CC, CT and TT were, respectively, 0%,\n                        89.0% and 11.0%. After treatment, among the 124\n                        genotyped females, the corresponding proportions were 0.8%,\n                        90.3% and 8.9%. Fisher's exact test did not\n                        demonstrate any change in genotype frequencies between pre- and\n                        post-treatment female worms\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.38). It was\n                        possible to pool the female worms in frequency of treatment groups because\n                        there were no significant differences between groups 1 and 3 before\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.39) and\n                        after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.08), and between\n                        groups 2 and 4 before treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.50) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.61).\n                        There were no significant differences in ARP genotype frequencies between\n                        the pooled annual treatment groups before and after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.59) and between the\n                        three-monthly treatment groups before and after treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.77).\n\n\n\nGenotypic Frequencies for the \u03b2-tubulin Gene\nMale worms.Amongst the 56 pre-treatment male worms that could be genotyped, the\n                        proportions of homozygous allele a (aa), heterozygotes (ab) and homozygous\n                        allele b (bb) were, respectively, 92.9%, 5.4% and\n                        1.8%. After treatment, among the 26 genotyped males, the\n                        corresponding proportions were 96.2%, 3.8% and\n                        0%. No change in genotypic frequencies between pre- and\n                        post-treatment male worms was found, using Fisher's exact test.\n                        Before treatment, the 56 males were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n                        (Fisher's exact test,\n                        p\u200a=\u200a0.99).\n\nFemale worms.Before treatment, there was no difference in genotype frequency\n                            (\u03c72\u200a=\u200a0.036;\n                            p\u200a=\u200a0.98) between any\n                        of the groups. The 183 females analyzed before treatment were not in\n                        Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n                        (\u03c72\u200a=\u200a26.5;\n                        p<0.0001), with an excess of homozygotes. Amongst\n                        the female worms, the treatment led to an increase in the proportion of\n                        \u03b2-tubulin heterozygous worms (Figure 1). The reduction in the\n                        proportion of homozygous aa worms for \u03b2-tubulin was most marked in\n                        the 150 \u00b5g/kg three-monthly group (reduction rate in the\n                        proportion of aa worms: 73.6%). We also observed the same pattern\n                        of reduction in aa worms, though less dramatic, in the other treated groups\n                        (21.9%, 49.3% and 50.0%, respectively, in\n                        groups 1, 3 and 4). Conversely, the frequency of heterozygotes increased\n                        dramatically among the female worms collected in the group treated at 150\n                        \u00b5g/kg three-monthly and also markedly in the other groups\n                            (\u03c72 test,\n                            p<10\u221211). It was possible\n                        to pool the female worms in frequency of treatment groups because there were\n                        no significant differences between groups 1 and 3 before treatment\n                            (p\u200a=\u200a0.60) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.43), and\n                        between groups 2 and 4 before treatment\n                        (p\u200a=\u200a0.78) and after\n                        treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.72).\n                        After treatment, dose rate (150 or 800 \u00b5g/kg) per se did not have\n                        an effect on \u03b2-tubulin genotype frequency. However,\n                        there was a significant difference (Fisher's exact test,\n                        p\u200a=\u200a0.047) between the\n                        pooled annual treatment groups with respectively 44.1%,\n                        55.9% and 0% of aa, ab and bb and the three-monthly\n                        treatment groups with respectively 25.6%, 69.2% and\n                        5.1% of aa, ab and bb. Hence treatment frequency, or the total\n                        number of treatments given within the three years, did have a significant\n                        effect on the \u03b2-tubulin genotype frequencies in the\n                        female worms, recorded after treatment (Figure 1).\n\u03b2-tubulin genotype of female worms, that could be genotyped,\n                                before and after different doses of ivermectin.\n                                IVM\u200a=\u200aivermectin treatment.\n                                \u2020 Pooled by treatment frequency.\n\n\n\nCovariates Associated with Heterozygosity in\n                    \u03b2-tubulin among Female Worms\nBefore treatment, \u03b2-tubulin heterozygous status was not\n                    influenced by age of host, total number of females in the nodule, total number\n                    of palpable nodules or CMFL in the village of residence (Table 3). After treatment, none of the tested\n                    covariates was significantly associated with the\n                    \u03b2-tubulin heterozygous status, except the fact of\n                    living in a village with a CMFL between 41 and 60 mf/ss. This weak association\n                    (OR\u200a=\u200a6.24 (95% CI,\n                    1.09\u201335.59);\n                    p\u200a=\u200a0.039) might indicate that\n                    the probability of being heterozygous was higher in the villages where infection\n                    rates were rather high (Table\n                    4). The probability of being heterozygous tended to be higher in the\n                    groups treated three-monthly. Even if this was not significant in the analysis\n                    taking into account the various groups separately, this trend is consistent with\n                    the results presented above comparing the pooled annual treatment groups and the\n                    pooled three-monthly treatment groups.\n\n\nRelationship between \u03b2-tubulin Genotype and\n                    Fertility of Female Worms Before and After Treatment\nBefore treatment, the homozygote genotype was the only independent variable\n                    associated with a high fertility phenotype (p<0.002)\n                        (Table 5). After\n                    treatment, high fertility of the worms was still associated with the homozygous\n                    genotype (p\u200a=\u200a0.035). In\n                    addition, high fertility of the worms was more likely to be observed amongst\n                    younger patients (p\u200a=\u200a0.018).\n                    Finally, high fertility in the worms was more apparent in nodules containing\n                    higher numbers of male worms\n                    (p\u200a=\u200a0.030) (Table 6).\nAs the intervals between the last IVM treatment and nodulectomy in the\n                    three-monthly groups and the annual treatment groups were different, they have\n                    also been considered separately (Figure 2). Twelve months after the last IVM treatment, analysis of\n                    the fertility (non- and low fertility versus full fertility) in relation to\n                    genotype showed that the \u03b2-tubulin homozygous worms\n                    remained more fertile than the heterozygous worms\n                    (\u03c72\u200a=\u200a11.06,\n                    p<0.001; Figure 2). Because the sample size was small, we did not perform an\n                    analysis on the data collected on the three-monthly groups (samples collected\n                    three months after the last IVM treatment; groups 2 and 4). However, the figure\n                    shows that the proportion of fully fertile worms was higher in the homozygous\n                    worms (42% compared with 24%), but both genotype groups\n                    showed a similar proportion of non-fertile worms (50% and\n                    48%, respectively, for the homozygous and heterozygous parasites).\nRelationship between female worm fertility and \u03b2-tubulin genotype\n                            (homozygous or heterozygous) in relation to treatment group (annual\n                            versus three-monthly treatments, corresponding also to 4 versus 13\n                            treatment rounds within three years).\n                            IVM\u200a=\u200aivermectin treatment;\n                            FF\u200a=\u200afully fertile;\n                            F\u200a=\u200alow fertility;\n                            NF\u200a=\u200anot fertile.",
    "Discussion": "With the implementation of the onchocerciasis control programmes, an increasing\n                proportion of people in endemic areas have received community-directed treatment\n                with IVM on a regular basis. Even though children under 5 years of age and pregnant\n                women are excluded from mass treatment, a high proportion of the parasite\n                population, in control areas, is under treatment. As a consequence, and because most\n                of the parasite population is in the human hosts rather than in the vector, only a\n                relatively small proportion of the O. volvulus population is likely\n                to be in refugia (not exposed to the drug) at the time of\n                treatment. Thus, selection pressure for any IVM resistance alleles is expected to be\n                high in O. volvulus\n[7].\nParasitological and epidemiological evidence of ivermectin resistance in O.\n                    volvulus populations has been reported in Ghana [11]. Selection on\n                the \u03b2-tubulin gene following repeated IVM treatment of\n                people infected with O. volvulus, compared with parasites from\n                IVM-na\u00efve people has been found in Ghana [16,17]. Because gene selection is the first\n                step in the development of drug resistance, it is important to assess genetic change\n                in a population of parasites exposed to selection pressure.\nOur study of the possible effects of IVM on the genetic structure of an O.\n                    volvulus population is unique in several respects. We analyzed nodules\n                from the same patients before and after three years of IVM treatment at different\n                treatment frequencies, dose rates, and with complete knowledge of the number of IVM\n                treatments. To our knowledge, this has never been done in past investigations of the\n                effect of IVM on genetic selection in human parasitic nematodes. In the study area,\n                because there was no vector control and only a small proportion of the population\n                living in the area was treated during the trial, the force of infection probably did\n                not decrease during the trial [3].\nThe main finding, that IVM treatment selected for heterozygotes at the\n                \u03b2-tubulin locus and that this selection was dependent on the number of\n                doses, raises interesting questions in view of the fact that this gene has been\n                linked with IVM resistance in another parasitic nematode [17] and the recent evidence\n                that IVM resistance is occurring in O. volvulus\n[11]. The period over which the IVM treatment-associated\n                genetic change in \u03b2-tubulin occurred was short (1994 to\n                1997). It takes about 1 year from microfilarial birth until an adult worm commences\n                production of the next generation of microfilaria. The observed genetic changes are\n                dramatic, given the time period and the generation interval, and could result from\n                differential mortality of existing adult worms and possibly a differential\n                establishment of new worms, dependent on the worm genotype and tolerance to the drug\n                pressure. These possible selective events will require further investigation. IVM\n                might be more toxic to the more fertile female worms, which were previously found to\n                be homozygous at the \u03b2-tubulin locus [18], as a result of the\n                effect of IVM in preventing the release of microfilariae from the uterus and the\n                subsequent degeneration of these trapped microfilariae.\nThe main limitation of the present study was that some samples could not be\n                genotyped. As suggested in the previous paper [18] with samples from\n                the same trial [3], there are several explanations for the difficulty\n                in genotyping some of the adult worms. The nodules had been stored in a dessicating\n                fixative, at room temperature, for several years before they were digested and the\n                DNA extracted. It is likely that some of the worms that could not be genotyped were\n                dead or moribund at the time that the nodules were harvested. The DNA of dead or\n                moribund parasites may have been degraded or fragmented, and difficult to amplify.\n                Dead O. volvulus are not rapidly resorbed and can be readily found\n                in nodules [20,23]. In the study area before treatment, 15.2% of\n                adult female worms found in nodules were moribund or dead [24]. After treatment,\n                the proportion of non-genotyped parasites was higher\n                (p\u200a=\u200a0.024), which could be due to\n                the macrofilaricidal effect of IVM [3,25,26].\nVery similar numbers of worms were genotyped for \u03b2-tubulin\n                and for hsp60 before and after treatment. Most of the worms that\n                could not be genotyped for the acidic ribosomal protein gene could also not be\n                genotyped for \u03b2-tubulin. However, a higher proportion of\n                the acidic ribosomal protein gene was genotyped compared with the\n                    \u03b2-tubulin and the hsp60 genes. The\n                fact that acidic ribosomal protein has many gene copies in\n                eukaryotic genomes [21], whereas \u03b2-tubulin and\n                    hsp60 typically do not occur with multiple gene copies, could\n                explain the difference in the ease of genotyping the acidic ribosomal\n                    protein gene compared with the \u03b2-tubulin and\n                    hsp60 genes.\nNotwithstanding these likely reasons why some worms could not be genotyped, we have\n                performed several analyses to evaluate whether the population of those worms that\n                could not be genotyped was similar to the population of worms that were genotyped.\n                We showed that the two populations did not differ according to various external\n                covariates (host age, CMFL level, etc.).\nThe female worms were not dissected into different tissues, but each worm was\n                analyzed as a single entity. Any microfilarial DNA present within the female worm\n                would be included in the DNA analysis of the female worm, and so the\n                    \u03b2-tubulin genotype frequencies of the female worms\n                could have resulted from microfilarial/embryo DNA contamination within the female\n                worm. Such daughter microfilariae/embryos would have half of their DNA derived from\n                that mother worm and thus reflect the genome of the mother worm. Any contribution\n                from male worms to the assessed genotype of a female worm via the daughter\n                microfilaria/embryos contained within the female worm, would, if a significant\n                effect, tend to increase the probability that female worm genotypes would be seen as\n                heterozygotes. In fact, in the female worms before treatment there was an excess of\n                homozygotes, indicating that any contribution from male worms to the genotype\n                assessed in the female worms was not significant. Given the low frequency of the\n                \u201cb\u201d allele in the male worms before and after treatment, the\n                increase in the frequency of \u201cab\u201d heterozygotes in the female\n                worms, following treatment, could not be accounted for by male worm contamination\n                via microfilaria/embryos contained within the female worm.\nFinally, the frequency of \u201cab\u201d heterozygotes was greater in the\n                three-monthly treatment groups (69%) than in the annual treatment groups\n                (56%) and the pre-treatment sample (21%). IVM treatment\n                reduces fertility so that if microfilarial/embryonic DNA were contributing to the\n                assessment of DNA of the female worms, treatment should have decreased, rather than\n                increased, the proportion of female worms that appeared as heterozygotes. For these\n                reasons we do not believe that microfilarial/embryonic DNA within the female worms\n                had any significant influence on the observed genotype frequencies for\n                    \u03b2-tubulin observed in the female worms.\nOne possible explanation for the apparent IVM selection on\n                \u03b2-tubulin in the female worms is the existence of a null\n                allele (an allele that is not being detected by the method used) that could be\n                distorting the genotype frequencies determined. Previously, we have found that\n                freshly frozen O. volvulus samples always amplified readily with\n                the same \u03b2-tubulin primers as have been used in this study\n                    [17]\n                suggesting that no null allele exists, using the procedures followed, for\n                    \u03b2-tubulin in O. volvulus. We do not\n                believe that a null allele exists to affect the genotype frequencies. Furthermore,\n                even if it did exist, it could not account for the change in genotype frequencies\n                resulting from IVM treatment. We can conclude that the observed change in\n                    \u03b2-tubulin genotype frequency with treatment is genetic\n                selection as has been seen previously in O. volvulus that have been\n                obtained from people who have been repeatedly treated with IVM and also observed in\n                IVM-resistant H. contortus\n[16,17].\nOne of the main findings of the study is that female worms, homozygous for\n                    \u03b2-tubulin, were more fertile than heterozygote female\n                worms. A similar difference in fertility before treatment was reported previously\n                    [18]. Homozygous worms, in the patients treated annually\n                and collected twelve months after the last IVM treatment, also had higher fertility\n                than heterozygotes. However, this difference decreased if the worms were collected\n                three months after 13 three-monthly IVM treatments, at a time when the embryostatic\n                effect of IVM is normally still apparent. The results observed three months after\n                IVM (Figure 2) could be due to a\n                combination of innate differences in fertility between homozygous and heterozygous\n                worms and the relative effects of IVM on embryostasis in the different genotypes. If\n                the fertility disadvantage of heterozygotes tends to disappear when the parasite is\n                under strong IVM pressure, this could have implications for parasite transmission\n                and possible resistance selection. It would be interesting to study, perhaps in\n                    Caenorhabditis elegans, how polymorphism in\n                    \u03b2-tubulin may affect the fertility of nematodes.\nBefore treatment, hsp60 gene was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in\n                the female and male worm populations as well as for the\n                \u03b2-tubulin gene in the male worm population. The\n                    acidic ribosomal protein gene normally has multiple gene copies\n                    [21], which means that there are multiple loci in the\n                genome. For this reason, it is inappropriate to apply a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n                test, as used on a single locus. The \u03b2-tubulin gene was not\n                in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the female worms, as there was an excess of\n                homozygotes in this population. Various assumptions are required for Hardy-Weinberg\n                equilibrium including random mating. Non-random mating could occur in the O.\n                    volvulus population and be due to inbreeding, positive assortative\n                mating or a subpopulation structure [27]. The inbreeding coefficient F,\n                which represents the proportional loss of heterozygosity due to inbreeding, was\n                calculated for the population of 73 patients, based on the \u03b2-tubulin data,\n                to be 0.41. This index of inbreeding is moderately high and has implications not\n                only for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but also for the possible rate of selection of\n                a resistant population [28]. Inbreeding could be explained by the fact that\n                vectors transmitting to the study population were living in the local area and tend\n                to bite people from the same community.\nIt is of interest that the FIT (inbreeding coefficient\n                within a subpopulation) for Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae, a\n                closely related human filarial nematode, was calculated on the basis of\n                    \u03b2-tubulin genotype frequencies to be 0.44 [29].\n                However, other processes may be involved. An assortative mating coefficient R (which\n                could include inbreeding) was calculated [27] to be 0.54. The higher\n                fertility of the female \u03b2-tubulin homozygote\n                \u201caa\u201d worms, when compared with the female heterozygote\n                \u201cab\u201d worms, could be consistent with positive assortative mating\n                if the likelihood that a worm will mate is associated with the female\n                worm's fecundity. It is known that male O. volvulus\n                migrate between nodules and may be attracted by the fully fertile females\n                (predominantly homozygous). Subpopulation structure could also explain the\n                Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. Because the samples were collected in a\n                forest/savannah transition zone, the worms could belong either to a savannah, or to\n                forest or mixed forest/savannah strains. Subpopulations can result from\n                environmental segregation, inbreeding and/or positive assortative mating. Finally,\n                it is possible that in the absence of IVM treatment, the\n                \u03b2-tubulin heterozygote female worms die faster than the\n                homozygote female worms. Differential mortality between the genotypes could also\n                affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nThe selection for the \u03b2-tubulin heterozygote\n                \u201cab\u201d, found in female worms after IVM treatment, was more\n                important in the worms exposed to IVM every three months compared with the worms\n                exposed to IVM annually. This difference could be due to either the total number of\n                treatments or to the interval between treatments. These are important points for the\n                onchocerciasis control programmes because semi-annual or more frequent treatments\n                are ongoing in some areas and under consideration in other areas. An increase in\n                treatment frequency might increase the selection pressure.\nNo selection was demonstrated in the male worm population after treatment, during the\n                three-year study period. This result suggests that the female worms are more\n                susceptible to IVM pressure than the males and could reflect an increased\n                IVM-induced mortality in female worms that are homozygous at the\n                    \u03b2-tubulin locus. From the Gardon et al. trial in\n                Cameroon [3], it is possible to estimate the relative proportional\n                decrease in male and female parasites due to IVM treatment over the study period.\n                This amounts to 13.5% and 27.5%, respectively. If the male\n                parasites are less affected by the treatment, the genotype frequencies in the male\n                population would only change significantly following transmission and subsequent\n                infection by progeny of the parasites under selection. Given that it takes about one\n                year to complete the life cycle of O. volvulus, in this situation\n                it would take longer for IVM selection to influence male worm genotype frequencies.\n                It is interesting in this regard that in Brugia malayi,\n                sex-dependent expression in a possible IVM receptor has been demonstrated [30]. The\n                putative glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channel gene, AF118554,\n                was estimated to be expressed at a 24.3-fold higher level in female worms compared\n                with male worms. As GluCl is thought to be the main target of IVM [31], one\n                could speculate that the effect of IVM might be greater in female than male worms.\n                This might explain why O. volvulus male worms seem to be less\n                susceptible to IVM and thus less rapidly selected than female worms, so that in the\n                short three-year time interval of this study no significant change in\n                    \u03b2-tubulin genome frequency was seen in the male worms.\n                However, selection on \u03b2-tubulin in male O.\n                volvulus has been found when parasite populations were exposed over 6 or\n                more years to IVM [16,17].\nThere may also be an IVM-induced mortality of the incoming larvae or pre-adult stages\n                of the parasites, with the homozygous worms being more sensitive to repeated\n                treatment than the heterozygote parasites. An effect of IVM on the pre-adult stages\n                of O. volvulus has been suggested [32] and demonstrated in\n                results obtained on the bovine parasite Onchocerca ochengi\n[33].\nToday, intestinal trichostrongylid nematodes of livestock are commonly strongly\n                resistant to IVM, and the development of IVM resistance can occur rapidly in these\n                nematode parasites, sometimes in less than three years [34]. However,\n                trichostrongylid nematodes and filarial nematodes have different biology. As the\n                generation time is shorter in trichostrongylid nematodes than in filarial nematodes,\n                resistance selection would be expected to take longer to be manifested in filarial\n                worms. In contrast to soil transmitted nematodes, filariae have no free-living\n                stages and most of the population of the nematode occurs in the human host, so that\n                    refugia is likely to be low in a community under treatment. As\n                a result, selection pressure for resistance to develop could be high in human\n                filarial nematodes under intensive drug treatment [7].\n\nConclusion\nIVM has been used since the late 1980s, and more than 400 million doses have been\n                    distributed in Africa [4]. It remains the only safe drug for community\n                    treatment of onchocerciasis. Our results clearly show a genetic selection in\n                        O. volvulus caused by repeated IVM treatment. Since the\n                    parasites were collected before and after treatment from the same patients,\n                    these results cannot be explained as differences arising from different host\n                    populations being sampled. These results, together with other evidence of\n                    genetic selection and reports of sub-optimal responses to IVM, provide a warning\n                    that selection for IVM resistance could be occurring in some populations of\n                        O. volvulus.\nIn view of these results, it is imperative that field studies be undertaken to\n                    characterize all treatment responses to IVM in O. volvulus,\n                    coupled to further genetic analysis, in order to confirm or not the possible\n                    emergence of IVM resistance. Such longitudinal studies, which would look at the\n                    repopulation of the skin of treated people by mf, should be undertaken without\n                    delay if the benefits that have been achieved by the onchocerciasis control\n                    programmes are not to be lost as a result of the spread of IVM resistance in\n                        O. volvulus."
