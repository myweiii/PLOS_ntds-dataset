Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis, or
                    “river blindness”. Ivermectin has been used for mass
                    treatment of onchocerciasis for up to 18 years, and recently there have been
                    reports of poor parasitological responses to the drug and evidence of drug
                    resistance. Drug resistance has a genetic basis. In this study, genetic changes
                    in β-tubulin, a gene associated with ivermectin
                    resistance in nematodes, were seen in parasites obtained from the patients
                    exposed to repeated ivermectin treatment compared with parasites obtained from
                    the same patients before any exposure to ivermectin. Furthermore, the extent of
                    the genetic changes was dependent on the level of ivermectin treatment exposure.
                    This genetic selection was associated with a lower reproductive rate in the
                    female parasites. The data indicates that this genetic selection is for a
                    population of O. volvulus that is more tolerant to ivermectin.
                    This selection could have implications for the development of ivermectin
                    resistance in O. volvulus and for the ongoing onchocerciasis
                    control programmes. Monitoring for the possible development and spread of
                    ivermectin resistance, as part of the control programmes, should be implemented
                    so that any foci of resistant parasites can be treated by alternative control
                    measures.
