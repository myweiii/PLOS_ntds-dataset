    "Background": "Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of\n                        onchocerciasis, or “river blindness”. Ivermectin has\n                        been used for mass treatment of onchocerciasis for up to 18 years, and\n                        recently there have been reports of poor parasitological responses to the\n                        drug. Should ivermectin resistance be developing, it would have a genetic\n                        basis. We monitored genetic changes in parasites obtained from the same\n                        patients before use of ivermectin and following different levels of\n                        ivermectin exposure.",
    "Methods and Findings": "O. volvulus adult worms were obtained from 73 patients\n                        before exposure to ivermectin and in the same patients following three years\n                        of annual or three-monthly treatment at 150 µg/kg or 800\n                        µg/kg. Genotype frequencies were determined in\n                            β-tubulin, a gene previously found to be linked\n                        to ivermectin selection and resistance in parasitic nematodes. Such\n                        frequencies were also determined in two other genes, heat shock\n                            protein 60 and acidic ribosomal protein, not\n                        known to be linked to ivermectin effects. In addition, we investigated the\n                        relationship between β-tubulin genotype and female\n                        parasite fertility. We found a significant selection for\n                            β-tubulin heterozygotes in female worms. There\n                        was no significant selection for the two other genes. Quarterly ivermectin\n                        treatment over three years reduced the frequency of the\n                            β-tubulin “aa” homozygotes\n                        from 68.6% to 25.6%, while the\n                        “ab” heterozygotes increased from 20.9% to\n                        69.2% in the female parasites. The female worms that were\n                        homozygous at the β-tubulin locus were more fertile\n                        than the heterozygous female worms before treatment (67% versus\n                        37%; p = 0.003)\n                        and twelve months after the last dose of ivermectin in the groups treated\n                        annually (60% versus 17%;\n                        p<0.001). Differences in fertility between\n                        heterozygous and homozygous worms were less apparent three months after the\n                        last treatment in the groups treated three-monthly.",
    "Conclusions": "The results indicate that ivermectin is causing genetic selection on\n                            O. volvulus. This genetic selection is associated with\n                        a lower reproductive rate in the female parasites. We hypothesize that this\n                        genetic selection indicates that a population of O.\n                        volvulus, which is more tolerant to ivermectin, is being selected.\n                        This selection could have implications for the development of ivermectin\n                        resistance in O. volvulus and for the ongoing\n                        onchocerciasis control programmes."
