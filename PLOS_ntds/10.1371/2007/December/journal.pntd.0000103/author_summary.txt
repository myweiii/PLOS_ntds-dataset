Chagas disease kills more people than any other parasitic disease in the Americas. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a single-cell parasite which is transmitted between people and other mammals by triatomine insects. Chagas disease control programs in Latin America have focused mainly on stopping transmission of T. cruzi rather than active surveillance for infection among human populations at risk. These programs have been very successful in controlling triatomine insects by spraying households with insecticides. This article is the first to describe T. cruzi transmission in an urban environment and show evidence that transmission may be epidemic in the city of Arequipa, Peru. The article also demonstrates how data easily collected during an ongoing insecticide spraying campaign in Arequipa might be used to identify children at greatest risk of infection with T. cruzi. The results of the analysis might aid in the optimal use of limited diagnostic resources by targeting screening efforts to those children in greatest need of diagnosis. Such targeted screening could facilitate the integration of diagnosis and treatment of children into Chagas disease control programs currently focused primarily on insects.
