We thank the HTLV outpatient clinic of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, the “Emílio Ribas” staff, Dr. Augusto C. P. de Oliveira and Jerusa Smid for their helpful cooperation. We are also thankful for the patients' enthusiasm and cooperation. With this work, we hope to improve the visibility of people living with HTLV-1 and improve their care through public health policies.
