Control of the chronic form of sleeping sickness or gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) consists of accurate diagnosis followed by treatment. We aim to replace the native variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) parasite antigens that are presently used in most antibody detection tests with peptides that can be synthesised in vitro. Antibodies recognising VSG were purified from HAT patient sera and were used to select phage-expressed peptides that mimic VSG epitopes from a Ph.D.-12 phage display library. The diagnostic potential of the corresponding synthetic peptides was demonstrated in indirect ELISA with sera from HAT patients and endemic negative controls. We proved that diagnostic mimotopes for T.b. gambiense VSGs can be selected by phage display technology, using polyclonal human antibodies.
