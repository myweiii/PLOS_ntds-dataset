During infection, the agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), successfully evades the host immune defenses and establishes a persistent infection that can cause blindness, paralysis, or even death in some individuals that progress to the tertiary stage of the disease. The study of the Nichols strain of T. pallidum, isolated over a century ago and continually propagated in rabbits, has been paramount to deepen our knowledge on the biology of the agent of syphilis and the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Nonetheless, when the more recent Chicago isolate of T. pallidum is compared to the Nichols strain, significant differences in gene expression, gene conversion rates, and antibody responses against virulence factor candidates are detected during experimental infection. To investigate whether differences at the genomic level between Nichols and Chicago might explain such phenotypic differences, we sequenced the Chicago strain genome and compared it to the previously sequenced T. pallidum Nichols strain. Our findings indicate that the genomic differences between these T. pallidum strains emerge under positive selection, and are likely to be functional in nature, thereby being involved in shaping the phenotypic diversity between the Chicago and Nichols strains.
