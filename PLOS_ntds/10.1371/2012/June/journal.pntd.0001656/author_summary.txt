The manuscript is relevant because of the finding of a new risk factor for chemotherapy failure and the development of a prognosis score for cutaneous leishmaniasis. The proportion of patients that have multiple lesions in American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is considerable. Publications and our experience permit to estimate that they represent around 20% of the affected population from the Amazon basin with cutaneous lesions. In addition, about 1/3 of them would correspond to the concomitant distant lesions category, the novel risk factor identified with a very high odds ratio (20â€“30) associated. Such numbers merit study of concomitant distant ulcers category on its own, not only because of clinical management implications, but also to search for factors that are contributing to chemotherapy failure. Finally, the simple equation proposed in the manuscript can be easily adapted to smart phone technologies. Similar prognosis equations are scarce for other pathologies and do not exist for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis at all. The simplicity of this tool should be followed by subsequent epidemiologic studies in other ATL endemic regions.
