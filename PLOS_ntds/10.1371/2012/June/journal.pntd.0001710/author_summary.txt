Plasmodium vivax is responsible for approximately 60–80% of the malaria cases in the world, and contributes to significant social and economic instability in the developing countries of Latin America and Asia. The pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria is a consequence of host derived inflammatory mediators. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in induction of systemic inflammation during P. vivax malaria is critical for the clinical management and prevention of severe disease. The innate immune receptors recognize Plasmodium sp. and initiate a broad spectrum of host defense mechanisms that mediate resistance to infection. However, the innate immune response is the classic “two-edged sword”, and clinical malaria is associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our findings show that both monocytes and neutrophils are highly activated during malaria. Monocytes produced high levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α during acute malaria. On the other hand, neutrophils were a poor source of cytokines, but displayed an enhanced phagocytic activity and superoxide production. Unexpectedly, we noticed an impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils towards an IL-8 (CXCL8) gradient. We proposed that neutrophil paralysis is in part responsible for the enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection observed in malaria patients.
