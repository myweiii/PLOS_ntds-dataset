Giardia duodenalis is a protozoan parasite causing gastroenteritis. Although the parasite occurs worldwide, its regional prevalence varies considerably. Using PCR as a highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tool, we detected G. duodenalis in 60% of 583 children younger than five years in southern Rwanda. It was by far the most frequent intestinal parasite detected in this population. Importantly, two out of three infections would have been undetected if only the commonly used light microscopy had been applied. Genotyping revealed the presence of two distinct types of parasites, and only the infrequent subtype showed a weak association with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, G. duodenalis infection was associated with underweight and clinically assessed severe malnutrition. The data call for the establishment of more sensitive than light microscopy, yet simple diagnostic tools to identify infected children as well as for the consideration of abundant submicroscopic infections in evaluating the significance of G. duodenalis in high endemicity areas.
