Rickettsial diseases are serious human infections. Some spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial pathogens are bioterror agents. A major clinical hallmark of SFG rickettsial disease is the infection of endothelial cells leading to enhanced vascular permeability. Previous studies show that SFG rickettsiae cause dose-dependent hyperpermeability, which was associated with disruption of intercellular adherens junctions (AJs). The underlying molecular mechanism by which the junctional complexes are disrupted, ultimately causing changes in the endothelial paracellular milieu during rickettsial infection, remains largely unclear. The available evidence suggests that inflammatory stimuli can trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of various components of AJs, mainly the vascular endothelialâ€“cadherin (VE-cadherin). This causes gaps at AJs, partially due to phosphorylation-induced destabilization of VE-cadherins at the plasma membrane and increased endocytosis, greatly increasing paracellular leaks. Here, we hypothesize that infection by SFG rickettsiae induces endothelial cells to develop altered VE-cadherin in association with phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Utilizing nano-mechanical studies with atomic force microscopy and biochemical analysis of the major AJ protein VE-cadherin, we have implicated that phosphorylation of VE-cadherin directly attenuates homophilic interactions between VE-cadherins. The experimental approach advances a new way of studying rickettsial infection. This strategy should prove useful in uncovering novel therapeutic strategies for virulent arthropod-borne rickettsioses.
