The existence of a diversity of infection outcomes – ranging from self-cure to asymptomatic, severe or fatal cases – is now widely recognised for most parasitic and infectious diseases. The dogma concerning sleeping sickness, however, is still that infection is 100% fatal. Here we describe a 15-year follow-up of patients diagnosed with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Ivory Coast but who refused treatment. Our results, based on clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations, combining diagnostic tools for the field and highly specific and sensitive laboratory tests, constitute the most comprehensive study on the natural evolution of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in its human host. At least two alternative natural progressions of HAT to the “classic” fatal disease were identified: a progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection and a progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection. We believe that recognising that trypanotolerance exists in humans is a major step forward for future research aimed at identifying human-specific defence and immune mechanisms involved in the control of T.b. gambiense infection and thus new candidate therapeutic or prophylactic targets.
