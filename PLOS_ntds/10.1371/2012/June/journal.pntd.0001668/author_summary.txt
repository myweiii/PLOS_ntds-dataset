Microcalorimetry is a technology developed to record minute changes in temperature as a result of physical, chemical or biological reactions over time. The method has been applied to bacterial and eukaryotic cells and it was found that the metabolic activity of living cells in a culture medium produces enough heat flow to be measured. Protozoan parasites, some of which cause tropical diseases such as African sleeping sickness or malaria, are larger cells than bacteria and are metabolically very active. We explored the applicability of heat flow measurement to follow the growth of a parasite population and to study the effect of drugs. We first established optimal parameters for obtaining heat flow curves of a growing parasite culture. Then we added antiparasitic drugs at two concentrations and followed the heat flow curves over several days. Thus we could determine the time of onset of drug action and the time until all parasites stopped producing heat (time to kill). The microcalorimeter measurements once per second allowed a continuous monitoring of changes in the parasite population. This novel tool is accurate and simple to use, and will certainly prove to be of great value for the discovery and development of new drugs for protozoan parasites.
