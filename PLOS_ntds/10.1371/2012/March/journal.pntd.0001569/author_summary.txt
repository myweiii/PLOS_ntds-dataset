Early larval stages of the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni face many barriers in their attempt to establish successful infections within their snail host, Biomphalaria spp. The snail's internal defense system represents one such barrier, which includes lectin-like recognition receptors and circulating hemocytes capable of encapsulating and killing invading larvae. Since host lectins likely are involved in early immunorecognition events, the recent identification of specific carbohydrate structures (glycans) shared between larval stages of S. mansoni and its host Biomphalaria glabrata suggests that larvae may be avoiding immune recognition through a molecular mimicry mechanism mediated by lectin-reactive glycans. Results of the present study support previous findings of extensive host-parasite glycan sharing, and demonstrate that molecules released by S. mansoni miracidia during in vitro development (larval transformation products or LTPs) selectively bind to plasma proteins, altering their reactivity to various glycan-specific monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, some of the changes in recognized glycans following exposure of blotted plasma proteins to LTP were B. glabrata strain-specific. We hypothesize that the differential interaction of LTPs with plasma proteins from different B. glabrata strains may play an important role in influencing the efficacy of anti-larval immune reactivity within a given host strain.
