The World Health Organization advocates at least three mass drug administrations (MDAs) with antibiotics when the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is greater than 10% in children under age ten. Full child participation is necessary for maximizing the impact of trachoma control programs. The present paper identifies guardian, household, and program risk factors for households with a child who never participated in two annual rounds of MDAs with azithromycin. In comparison to households with full child participation, guardians with at least one child who never participated had a higher burden of familial responsibility, as represented by reporting ill family members, more children, and were younger in age. In addition, guardians of persistent non-participants seemed less well connected in the community, in terms of reliance on others and not knowing who their assigned community treatment assistants (CTAs) were. These guardians were assigned to CTAs who had a wide geographic dispersion of their assigned households. By developing programs with local groups to find and encourage participation in at-risk households, program managers may have the greatest impact on preventing persistent child non-participation. Increasing the number of distribution days and reducing CTAs' travel time may further prevent non-participation.
