Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection of humans, with half the world's population at risk for infection. Four different dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) can cause the disease, which can be either inapparent or present with flu-like symptoms (Dengue Fever), also known as “breakbone fever”. In a number of cases, the disease can be more severe and sometimes fatal, with signs of bleeding and vascular leakage leading to shock (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome). Severe disease has been associated with secondary sequential DENV infections, i.e., infection with a second DENV serotype different from the serotype causing the first infection. No specific treatment or vaccine is available. Understanding how the human immune response develops during a natural infection can be beneficial for future vaccine studies and trials. B cells are a subset of cells that produce antibodies and are thus essential in the response to natural infections and vaccines. We show here that during secondary DENV infections in humans, the B cell immune response to a previous infecting DENV serotype is stronger than the response against the current infecting serotype. In addition, this study allowed the development of research capacity and implementation of new immunological assays in Nicaragua.
