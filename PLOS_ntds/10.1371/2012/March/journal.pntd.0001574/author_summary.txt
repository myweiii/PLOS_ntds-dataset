Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of chronic infections that affect the poorest group of the populations in the world. There are currently five major NTDs targeted through mass drug treatment in the affected communities. The drug delivery can be integrated to deliver different drug packages as these NTDs often overlap in distribution. Mali is endemic with all five major NTDs. The integrated national NTD control program was implemented through the primary health care system using the community health center workers and the community drug distributors aiming at long-term sustainability. After a pilot start in three regions in 2007 without prior examples to follow on integrated mass drug administration, treatment for the five targeted NTDs was gradually scaled up and reached all endemic districts by 2009, and annual drug coverage in the targeted population has since been maintained at a high level for each of the five NTDs. Around 10 million people received one or more drug treatments each year since 2009. The country is on the way to meet the national objectives of elimination or control of these diseases. The successes and lessons learned in Mali are valuable assets to other countries looking to start similar programs.
