Dengue fever, transmitted by Aedes mosquito vectors, is a major public health problem in over 100 countries. Prevention of the disease relies heavily on the use of insecticides such as pyrethroids. Unfortunately, mosquitoes are becoming resistant to these insecticides so it is urgent to identify the genes involved to develop an effective monitoring tool. In insects, P450s are critically involved in the metabolism and detoxification of insecticides. Several P450s have been found over expressed in pyrethroid resistant Ae. aegypti, although their functions are unknown. Here, we have expressed these enzymes in bacteria and examined their ability to metabolise pyrethroids and other compounds. From this we have identified a set of four P450s (CYPs 9J24, 9J26, 9J28 and 9J32) that are involved in pyrethroid metabolism, thus they may be considered to be key markers of resistance. To try and track their expression in field populations, we have developed diagnostic assays to monitor their activity, which will aid the development of new tools to monitor resistance and aid disease control.
