G. intestinalis and H. pylori are known to infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans early in life and to be very prevalent in endemic areas throughout life. H. pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa and may give rise to peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis and gastric cancer whereas Giardia causes diarrhea, bloating, flatulence and malnutrition. The genetic variability within G. intestinalis is high with two genotypes or assemblages (A and B) infecting humans. These two different genetic types of humans have also been associated with differences in symptoms. Here we have studied these two infections in non-symptomatic children in Kampala, Uganda. H. pylori was found in 44% out of the 427 children and G. intestinalis was found in 20% with children age 3<6 years showing the highest rates of colonization. The children were primarily infected with Giardia assemblage B parasites and Giardia infected children had a 3-fold higher risk of also having H. pylori infection. However, this was independent of Giardia assemblage type. This information will be important in the development of new control measures of these prevalent pathogens in Uganda and other low-income countries.
