In the Southern Cone countries of South America, vectorborne transmission of Chagas disease persists in the Gran Chaco region of northern Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, where Triatoma infestans is the main vector. More than 50 years of vector control in this region demonstrate that vertically coordinated spraying campaigns aiming at full coverage are unsustainable in practice. Understaffed programmes are challenged by the number of households and vast extension of the endemic area, resulting in suboptimal insecticide coverage and limited and shortlived impacts on vector populations. Our rationale was to recognize this inherent limitation and provide a scientific base for the improvement of current interventions. We quantified the spatial distribution of T. infestans at the Department level and found that environmental and demographic factors can be used to predict the occurrence of areas with high risk of vector infestation that can then be targeted for control. In rural and dispersed areas such as the Gran Chaco, mapping surrogates of T. cruzi transmission risk and incorporating spatial heterogeneities in vector distribution into control and surveillance strategies can contribute to improved delivery of interventions and to the sustainable control and management of Chagas disease.
