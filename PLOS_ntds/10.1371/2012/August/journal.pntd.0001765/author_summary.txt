As Leishmania infantum was reported to be spreading in Europe, we conducted an exhaustive collection of visceral leishmaniasis cases in Provence-Alpes-Cô te d′Azur, the most active focus in France, from 1993 to 2009. The analysis of the 328 cases showed no spread inside the study area and a three-fold decrease of yearly incidence notably because cases associated with AIDS became less frequent. Distribution of the disease showed two distinct foci strongly associated with specific environments. One focus, close to the border with Italy, was associated with areas characterized by scattered habitation and mixed forest in the foothills as previously acknowledged. Oppositely, the other focus was centered in urban areas of Marseille. These results modify our view on the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in Europe by highlighting the ability of the parasite to spread into urban environments. These findings stress the need for continuation of monitoring and prevention efforts and demonstrate that control strategy should be locally defined.
