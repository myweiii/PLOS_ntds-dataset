Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a parasitic disease that occurs in a chronic form caused by T.b. gambiense in West and Central Africa and in an acute form caused by T.b. rhodesiense in East and South Africa. In the first stage of the disease parasites are detectable in blood and lymph. Once they enter the central nervous system, patients are in the so-called second stage, which is fatal if left untreated. Melarsoprol, an old and highly toxic drug, remains the only available treatment for second stage T.b. rhodesiense HAT. The empirically developed treatment regimens are a high burden to affected patients and health care providers due to very long hospitalization times and complicated dosing schemes. An improved 10-day melarsoprol treatment schedule was developed and tested in second stage T.b. gambiense patients from 1997–2004 and was approved for large-scale use by the International Scientific Committee for Trypanosomiasis Research and Control (ISCTRC) in 2003. To test its adequacy also in T.b. rhodesiense patients, a series of clinical trials were conducted from 2005–2009. Based on these results the ISCTRC has officially recommended the use of the 10-day melarsoprol schedule also for treatment of second stage Rhodesiense HAT in 2009.
