Buruli ulcer (BU) is a devastating skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an environmental bacterium that is probably linked to slow-running water. It is unlikely to occur free-living, but even though M. ulcerans DNA has been detected in quite a few different organisms (with most studies focusing on insects), it is still not clear what its real reservoir is. Amoeboid protozoa, inhabitants of biofilms in slow flowing water, are good candidates since all previously tested mycobacteria are resistant to the digestion by these macrophage-like organisms. In this paper we demonstrate that M. ulcerans can indeed infect Acanthamoeba polyphaga in the lab, and remain viable intracellularly. We also collected water, biofilm and detritus samples in BU endemic and non-endemic regions in Ghana. We found that several mycobacteria species commonly occur intracellularly in protozoa in these environments. Amoebae were isolated from almost all samples, and an M. ulcerans marker (IS2404) was detected in 4% of the amoeba cultures. We conclude that amoebae are potential hosts for M. ulcerans. However, because these IS2404 positive amoebae originated from both BU endemic and non-endemic areas, we remain sceptical about their implication in the transmission of M. ulcerans to humans.
