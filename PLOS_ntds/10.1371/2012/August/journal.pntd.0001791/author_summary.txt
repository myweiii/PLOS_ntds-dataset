To identify where to look for new strategies to limit the contact between tsetse and humans, and so reduce the transmission of sleeping sickness, we examined various factors influencing the numbers of tsetse caught from men. Catches were increased if the men walked, or travelled a little faster on a truck, and were reduced if an ox were nearby. There was no effect of making the men smell like an ox, or of spraying the men with deodorant. Intriguingly, while it is usually assumed tacitly that most            human/tsetse contact occurs when people enter the normal woodland habitat of the flies, we found that just as much contact occurred due to tsetse visiting human habitations. We also operated standard ox-like traps to assess whether their catches could be used as indices of the biting rate on humans, but found too many distinctions between catches from these traps and people.          Overall, it appeared that the search for means of restricting human/fly contact should focus on that occurring in buildings and vehicles, and that attempts should be made to design traps that are more man-like.
