Quinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics which bind to type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV)          and inhibit DNA re-ligation after enzyme cut, exerting a rapid bactericidal activity. They are widely used for the treatment of several community- and hospital-acquired infections and have become increasingly important also in resource-limited countries, following the availability of generics (which have drastically reduced drug costs) and the remarkable increase of resistance to the oldest and cheapest antibiotic classes. Resistance to quinolones is an increasing worldwide problem that challenges the efficacy      of these drugs against several bacterial pathogens and is known to be strongly associated with quinolone exposure. Restriction of quinolone consumption has been advocated as an important tool for the containment of quinolone resistance and has recently been proved to succeed in reducing resistance rates in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli in a community setting from an industrialized country. This study describes the dissemination of quinolone resistant E. coli in a very remote community in the Amazon forest, with a high level isolation and minimal antibiotic use, not including quinolones. These findings demonstrate that intervention strategies based only on quinolone restriction are unlikely to succeed in resource-limited           countries, unless accompanied by measures for reducing dissemination of resistant isolates by improving sanitation.
