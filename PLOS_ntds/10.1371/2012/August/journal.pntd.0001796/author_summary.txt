The vaccination of dogs against rabies is an effective method for the control of the disease and its transmission to humans in many locations, including in North America and Europe. However, vaccination coverage for only dogs might be insufficient in countries such as Tanzania, where wildlife has been shown to also carry and transmit rabies. To address this concern, we developed a model parameterized with field data on rabies in dogs and wildlife from two districts of Tanzania, Ngorongoro and Serengeti. Our study found significant variation in the patterns of rabies transmission between the two districts, with wildlife playing a more important part in rabies transmission in Ngorongoro. Based on these findings, a higher vaccination coverage level against rabies is necessary in Ngorongoro more than in Serengeti, although it is still possible to achieve the required level of vaccination coverage for Ngorongoro through dog vaccination alone. An annual dog vaccination campaign at the WHO-recommended target of 70% would control rabies in both districts.
