Lymphatic filariasis (LF) causes an enormous disease burden throughout the tropics and subtropics. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was begun in 2000 following the advent of large donations from drug companies for treating LF and the development of a rapid antigen assay for detection of infection. As more countries undergo mass drug administration (MDA), the driving need is for development of a highly sensitive and specific antibody assay for detecting ongoing exposure to vector-borne filaria following MDA. The target group for such surveillance is children born during or following MDA. Current assays, while sensitive, are not specific enough where non-LF filaria species are co-endemic. Recently, we developed an antibody assay based upon the highly specific larval antigen Wb123 using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). In the current study, we determined that the Wb123 LIPS assay detects a reduction in LF transmission on an endemic island following a one-time island wide MDA with diethylcarbamazine, with the most pronounced reduction in prevalence of antibody to Wb123 occurring in young children born just prior to and following this MDA. We propose that Wb123 can be an extremely useful surveillance tool following MDA and should be developed into a rapid test format.
