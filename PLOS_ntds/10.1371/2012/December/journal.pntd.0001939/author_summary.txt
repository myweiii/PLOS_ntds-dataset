Liver fluke infection is a fish borne disease that afflicts millions of residents in Thailand and Laos. Infection results from eating undercooked freshwater fish contaminated with larvae of the worm Opisthorchis viverrini. Infection can lead to cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma). Indeed, O. viverrini is designated as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization, i.e. a definitive cause for cancer. Proteins produced at the surface and/or released from this parasite play pivotal roles in maintaining the infection and disease. These proteins are valid targets for development of vaccines and new drugs. Tetraspanins are prominent in the tegument (the surface covering) of parasites closely related to O. viverrini where they are exposed to immune responses. Similar molecules on the surface of O. viverrini may be vital for the parasite's survival and may make effective vaccines. Here the gene coding for O. viverrini tetraspanin-1 (Ov-TSP-1) was investigated. We used electron microscopy to show that Ov-TSP-1 is expressed in the tegument. We then silenced expression of the gene encoding Ov-TSP-1 and showed that this resulted in malformation of the tegument, highlighting the importance of this molecule for parasite development and its potential as a vaccine target.
