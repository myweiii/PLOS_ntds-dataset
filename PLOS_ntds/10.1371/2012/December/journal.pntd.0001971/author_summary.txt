Chagas disease, resulting from infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of heart disease in Latin America. Treatment options are limited to a small number of drugs that were developed more than four decades ago and which have various drawbacks. Stem cell therapy with bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) has emerged as a novel therapeutic option for cell death-related heart diseases, but efficacy of MSCs has not been tested in Chagas disease therapy. Due to the established role of the immune system in the physiopathology of Chagas disease and the immune modulatory properties of MSC we hypothesized that MSC could be an optimal cell type for therapy in chagasic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, in this study we have used cell tracking strategies following labeling of MSCs with nanoparticles to investigate migration of transplanted MSCs in a murine model of Chagas disease, and have correlated MSCs migration with cardiac function in chagasic animals by small animal positron emission tomography imaging technique.
