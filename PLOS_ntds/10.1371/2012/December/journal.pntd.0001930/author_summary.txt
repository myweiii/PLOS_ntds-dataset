To address an unmet need for a surveillance tool to detect transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, following mass drug administration (MDA) control measures, we used a novel bioinformatic approach to identify Wb-specific antigens expressed primarily by the infective stage larvae of Wb that could be used as the basis for a rapid, high throughput antibody assay. From 19 potential candidates, we identified one, termed Wb123, that could be used as the basis for the rapid detection of IgG and IgG4 reactivity in a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay. These anti-Wb123 IgG and IgG4 antibodies were only present in those with Wb infection and not in those infected with closely related filarial parasites (e.g. Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Mansonella perstans) that share the same geographical niches with Wb. Our data suggest that this rapid Wb123 assay has the potential to be used in for large scale detection of recrudescent Wb infection and thereby may provide a new tool for the monitoring of transmission control measures.
