Leishmania parasites infect 10â€“12 million people worldwide, causing a spectrum of serious diseases. Among the species that infect human, Leishmania major is responsible for localized cutaneous disease in the Old World whereas Leishmania amazonensis is associated with both localized and diffuse cutaneous diseases in the Amazon region. For L. major, sphingolipid degradation is crucial for parasite proliferation and disease progression in mouse models. In this study, we investigated whether the function of sphingolipid degradation is conserved in L. amazonensis. Similar to L. major, L. amazonensis possesses a single enzyme (LaISCL) which is responsible for the turnover of sphingolipids; LaISCL is mainly associated with the mitochondrion and preferentially expressed in the infective forms of L. amazonensis; and deletion of LaISCL leads to poor survival under acidic conditions. While wild type L. amazonensis parasites are pathogenic towards all common lab mouse strains, LaISCL-null mutants show significantly lower virulence towards C57BL6 mice but are fully infective towards BALB/c mice. Therefore, although the biochemistry of sphingolipid degradation is largely conserved in L. amazonensis, this pathway can have drastically different effects on parasite proliferation and disease development in the mammalian host.
