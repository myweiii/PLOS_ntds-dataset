Until the 1990's accurate Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) diagnosis necessitated parasitological confirmation by microscopy or culture of the blood, bone-marrow, lymph nodes or spleen. These techniques are invasive and splenic aspirates are associated with a risk of serious bleeding. This has led to the development of non-invasive serological tests such as the direct agglutination test (DAT). During infection with VL, circulating antibodies are produced against the surface antigens of the invading parasites. The DAT detects antibodies to L. donovani s.l. in the blood or serum of those infected by means of direct agglutination. In the absence of antibodies to Leishmania the DAT antigen accumulates at the bottom of the plate to form a dark blue spot. If antibodies to Leishmania are present then the antigen forms a pale blue film over the well constituting a positive result. Here, we report on shared experiences of six endemic countries using DAT to characterize performance panel samples. There was considerable inter-reader variability and in order to standardize the reading of DAT we developed and implemented pictorial training aids. After refresher training, agreement between readers increased; the pictorial aids and recommendations for using DAT are available in this article.
