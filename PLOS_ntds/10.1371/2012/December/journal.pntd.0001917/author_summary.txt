Schistosomiasis is a parasitic worm infection that plagues more than 200 million people in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The current strategy to control schistosomiasis is to regularly administer the deworming drug praziquantel to school-aged children. Younger children before reaching school-age are not included in these deworming campaigns, because they are considered at low risk of schistosomiasis, and because the amount of available data to evaluate the safety of praziquantel in young children is insufficient. We conducted a study in two villages in southern CÃ´te d'Ivoire and examined the stool and urine of more than 250 children (<6 years) for schistosome eggs and antigens. Children were treated with crushed praziquantel tablets (40 mg/kg) and the efficacy of this treatment was determined 3 weeks after treatment. The safety of the treatment was assessed by interviewing mothers of treated children for adverse events (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headache). Complete data records were available for 160 children. Praziquantel cleared most of the infections. The treatment was generally well tolerated, but we observed four children who were not infected at the baseline survey who developed face and body inflammation that required close supervision by the study physician.
