Severe anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and it is relatively common in developing countries. To establish the causes of severe anemia in a part of the world in which infection (especially malaria), malnutrition and genetic predisposition are prevalent, we studied children from Papua New Guinea who were hospitalized with severe anemia and healthy non-anemic community-based controls. Factors associated with severe anemia were parvovirus B19 infection, falciparum malaria, vitamin A deficiency, low body mass index for age and incomplete vaccination. Vivax malaria was inversely associated reflecting early acquisition of immunity or perhaps lack of circulating red blood cells for parasite invasion. Iron deficiency was only a weak positive predictor. These data show that severe anemia is multifactorial in Papua New Guinean children, strongly associated with under-nutrition and certain infections, and potentially preventable through vitamin A supplementation and improved nutrition, completion of vaccination schedules, and prevention or active treatment of malaria.
