    "Background": "There are few detailed etiologic studies of severe anemia in children from malaria-endemic areas and none in those countries with holoendemic transmission of multiple Plasmodium species.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "We examined associates of severe anemia in 143 well-characterized Papua New Guinean (PNG) children aged 0.5\u201310 years with hemoglobin concentration <50 g/L (median [inter-quartile range] 39 [33]\u2013[44] g/L) and 120 matched healthy children (113 [107\u2013119] g/L) in a case-control cross-sectional study. A range of socio-demographic, behavioural, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory (including genetic) variables were incorporated in multivariate models with severe anemia as dependent variable. Consistent with a likely trophic effect of chloroquine or amodiaquine on parvovirus B19 (B19V) replication, B19V PCR/IgM positivity had the highest odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 75.8 (15.4\u2013526), followed by P. falciparum infection (19.4 (6.7\u201362.6)), vitamin A deficiency (13.5 (5.4\u201337.7)), body mass index-for-age z-score <2.0 (8.4 (2.7\u201327.0)) and incomplete vaccination (2.94 (1.3\u20137.2)). P. vivax infection was inversely associated (0.12 (0.02\u20130.47), reflecting early acquisition of immunity and/or a lack of reticulocytes for parasite invasion. After imputation of missing data, iron deficiency was a weak positive predictor (6.4% of population attributable risk).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "These data show that severe anemia is multifactorial in PNG children, strongly associated with under-nutrition and certain common infections, and potentially preventable through vitamin A supplementation and improved nutrition, completion of vaccination schedules, and intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment using non-chloroquine/amodiaquine-based regimens."
