Chagas disease is an endemic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Benznidazole (BZL) is the only antichagasic drug available in most endemic countries. The liver plays a major role in disposition of endogenous and exogenous compounds and their excretion is mainly mediated by transporter proteins (such as P-gp and MRP2) that act coordinately with biotransformation enzymes (such as CYP3A4 and GST). At present there is no information on whether BZL may modulate major biotransformation systems and transporters, with potential impact on its disposition or on disposition of other therapeutic agents co-administered with BZL. BZL (200 µM) altered the expression (protein and mRNA) and activity of P-gp, MRP2, CYP3A4, and GSTπ in HepG2 cells (a cell model that retains many biochemical, morphological and functional properties of the human hepatocytes), being the nuclear receptor PXR a key mediator. Additional studies demonstrated that P-gp is involved in BZL extrusion. Alterations in the pharmacokinetics and efficiency of drugs that are substrates of these systems, including BZL itself, would be expected.
