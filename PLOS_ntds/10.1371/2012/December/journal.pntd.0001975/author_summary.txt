Our study has addressed objectively the rarefaction of cutaneous thin nerve fibers density and its correlation with quantitative thermal sensory test in leprosy patients. Thermal sensitivity evaluation is crucial to the early diagnosis of leprosy, since it is the first type of cutaneous sensitivity lost in the lesions. However, some patients are unable to perform thermal tests, like children and patients with cognitive impairment. The pathological study of those lesions is also fundamental and it is the gold standard method to diagnose and classify leprosy patients. However, it may also be unspecific, especially in the indeterminate form of leprosy. Our findings show that even in lesions with slight thermal sensitivity impairment, there is a homogeneously intense denervation, specifically in the superficial skin layers. We believe that our findings pave the way to future studies focused on the diagnostic applicability of the cutaneous thin nerve fibers density quantification in leprosy suspected lesions.
