The disease Kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis is still a big problem in the Indian subcontinent. The antimonials were used for the chemotherapy of Kala-azar but with time its efficacy has reduced dramatically. The newer version of orally active drug miltefosine has been introduced, but its efficacy has decreased considerably as relapse cases are on the rise. Other drugs like liposomal form of amphotericin B is expensive and the patients require hospitalization. Thus there is a genuine need for an orally active antileishmanial drug. There are reports that the cationic amphiphilic molecule, imipramine, a drug used for the treatment of depression in humans, kills the promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. We tested the efficacy of imipramine in experimental infection in hamster and mouse model. Our study showed that the drug is highly effective against antimony sensitive and antimony resistant Leishmania donovani infected hamsters as well as mouse and offered almost sterile cure.
