As many as 12 million people suffer from Leishmania (L.) infection worldwide with about one to two million newly infected people every year. Due to the lack of vaccine strategies, the only option is chemotherapeutic intervention which can cause serious side effects. Therefore, new prevention or treatment strategies are urgently needed in addition to an appropriate animal model for testing. We infected humanized mice in the footpad with stationary phase promastigote L. major and analyzed the human innate and adaptive immune response by flow cytometry, histology, and quantitative PCR. Infected macrophages were detectable at the site of infection and in lymphoid organs. Additionally, we were able to measure Leishmania-specific T cell priming in humanized mice. However, these human immune defense mechanisms were not sufficient to prevent systemic spreading and lethality. By the inclusion of Miltefosine, we tested this novel model for its versatility in conducting drug studies. The oral treatment was able to reduce parasitic load but also revealed side effects which are described in humans but not in mice. Therefore, we propose humanized mice as a novel model, which offers the opportunity to study new therapy strategies in chronic leishmaniasis in the context of a human immune system.
