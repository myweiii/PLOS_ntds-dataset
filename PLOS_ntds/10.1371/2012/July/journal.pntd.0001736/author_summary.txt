Chagas Disease is the leading cause of heart disease in Latin America and an emerging infection in Europe and North America. The clinical presentation of Chagas Disease arises from infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which leads to progressive cardiomyopathy. No vaccine is available and chemotherapeutic options are limited to the drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox, which are used during the acute phase but may cause severe gastrointestinal and neurological side effects and are not commonly used in the chronic phase. Neither drug is approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The need for effective new therapy is urgent. A validated therapeutic target in T. cruzi is CYP51, an essential enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. We report results of high-throughput screening of small molecules directly against CYP51, confirmed by in vitro medium-throughput screening of the hits against T. cruzi-infected mammalian cells. We have identified a potent T. cruzi inhibitor as well as a diverse collection of low molecular weight hits with high affinity to CYP51. We have applied computational chemistry to relate CYP51 to other pharmacologic targets. This analysis allowed us to identify molecules already produced by pharmaceutical companies for future experimental testing against T. cruzi.
