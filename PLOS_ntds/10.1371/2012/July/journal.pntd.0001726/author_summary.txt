Parasitic worm infections are of public health importance in Southeast Asia. Particularly, the blood-dwelling Schistosoma mekongi worm, which is acquired by skin contact with the infectious cercariae in freshwater, can lead to liver enlargement. An infection with Opisthorchis viverrini is obtained by consumption of undercooked freshwater fish, and this infection increases the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. A single oral dose of 40 mg/kg praziquantel is recommended for mass treatment of schistosomiasis and opisthorchiasis, while at the individual level, a total dose of 75 mg/kg divided into three doses, is currently common practice to treat O. viverrini infection. Diagnosis is based on stool examination under a microscope for detection of worm eggs, but is limited by the low sensitivity of the widely used Kato-Katz technique. In this study, we showed that a 75 mg/kg total dose of praziquantel (50 mg/kg+25 mg/kg given 4 hours apart) cleared significantly more O. viverrini infections than a single 40 mg/kg dose, but no difference was observed for S. mekongi. Solicited adverse event profiles were mainly mild and similar in both groups. Repeated stool examination before and after treatment was essential for an accurate assessment of drug efficacy in terms of cure rate, but showed no effect on assessing egg reduction rates.
