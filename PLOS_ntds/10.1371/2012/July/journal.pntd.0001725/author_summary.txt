Sand flies are small blood sucking flies that transmit Leishmania, the etiologic agent of leishmaniasis - a prevalent disease over large areas of the World. Unlike mosquitoes, sand flies do not breed in water. Their larvae develop in humid habitats containing decaying organic matter (e.g. habitats such as burrows, tree holes and caves). However, in most cases, larval breeding habitats are unknown and larvae remain inaccessible to control efforts. In this paper we identified the breeding sites of an important sand fly vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis by using emergence traps to collect adult sand flies exiting caves and cracks. We identified young male sand flies (less than 24 hours old) by examining their external sex organs. The data collected enabled us to determine that sand flies were breeding primarily inside caves and in adjacent cracks but also in man-made support walls constructed with large boulders. These findings will be useful for applying more effective sand fly and leishmaniasis control measures.
