Scrub typhus is a potentially life-threatening infectious disease that is a major cause of acute undifferentiated fever in Asia-Pacific region. It is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT), an obligatory intracellular gram-negative bacterium in family rickettsiaceae. Earlier studies have shown that IFN-γ is essential in protection against OT infection in animals and cell-based models, but molecular mechanisms underlying such phenomenon remain largely unclear. In the present study, we are the first to demonstrate that activation of IDO1, a key enzyme in tryptophan-degrading pathway, is a mechanism downstream to IFN-γ in control of OT infection. IDO1 was found active in patients with acute scrub typhus. Subsequent in vitro experiments suggested that IDO1 restrains OT growth via deprivation of tryptophan, an important material for proliferation of OT, rather than via production of its downstream anti-microbial metabolites. Since IDO1 is a multifaceted gene that also plays a part in several processes of the immune system, including induction of tolerogenic responses; other possible consequences of IDO1 activation deserve further investigation in a more complex experimental model as well as in naturally infected human before subsequent clinical implication of this basic knowledge can be ultimately applied.
