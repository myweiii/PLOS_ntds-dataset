The irreversible crippling diseases konzo and neurolathyrism with identical clinical symptoms occur among poor subsistence farmers in Africa and Asia. The victims are mostly illiterate and among the poorest section of the population who can only afford the cheapest food in a monotonous diet: bitter cassava roots (Manihot esculenta) in the case of konzo, or the seeds of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) in the case of neurolathyrism. These neurodegenerations are blamed on the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in cassava and a neuro-excitatory amino acid in grass pea. Both are linked to the deficiency of methionine and cysteine in the diet. These amino acids are needed for the protection of motor neurons against oxidative stress. Both cassava and grass pea are tolerant to adverse environments and become survival foods for the poor during drought-triggered famines and during wartime. The dependency on these crops may increase with global warming. The scientific interest in these neglected diseases is low and little change has been noted over the last two decades. This is especially obvious when compared with the scientific interest in HTLV-1/TSP, a viral disease with similar clinical symptoms which occurs mainly among poor people in Latin America in similar socio-economic settings.
