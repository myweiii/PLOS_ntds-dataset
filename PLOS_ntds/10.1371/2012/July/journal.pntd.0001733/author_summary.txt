Taenia solium causes taeniasis in humans and cysticercosis in humans and pigs. In humans the parasite may infect the central nervous system and cause neurocysticercosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that over 50,000 deaths per year are due to neurocysticercosis and the disease is also the main cause of acquired epilepsy. Pigs act as intermediate hosts for the parasite's transmission. Porcine cysticercosis causes economic losses to farmers of developing countries, because infected pork has reduced value or may be condemned. Previous studies have identified risk factors for T. solium infection in pigs in various parts of the world; however, findings are contradictory or not consistent. In this study, particular areas in which pigs lived and age (older pigs were at higher risk) increased the risk of being seropositive; whereas the use of latrines decreased their risk of being seropositive. The results of this study contribute to epidemiology of porcine cysticercosis in rural areas, which is relevant for establishing effective control programs in rural locations with similar characteristics.
