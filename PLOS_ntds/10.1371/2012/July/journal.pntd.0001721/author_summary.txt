Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Effective vaccination strategies are urgently needed because of the emergence of drug-resistant parasites and severe side effects of chemotherapy. We previously established a DC-based vaccination strategy to induce complete and long-lasting immunity to experimental leishmaniasis using Leishmania major antigen-loaded and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide-activated DC as a vaccine carrier. In the present study we investigated the role of IL-4Rα-mediated instruction of the vaccinating DC and the host DC during induction of protection against leishmaniasis. The results demonstrate that IL-4Rα signaling in DC used as vaccine carrier plays an important role in induction of protective immunity against L. major infection, as only mice vaccinated with IL-4 responder DC are able to trigger effective Th1-mediated immunity. The immunity is hallmarked by high levels of L. major-induced bioactive IL-12 production in the lymph nodes of vaccinated mice. Together, these findings suggest that IL-4 is a strong adjuvant to induce Th1-biased immunity against leishmaniasis and possibly other infections with intracellular pathogens, indicating that IL-4 needs to be considered in the development of efficient cell-mediated vaccination strategies.
