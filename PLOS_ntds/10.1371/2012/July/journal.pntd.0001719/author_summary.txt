Leishmania major is the causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis and Phlebotomus papatasi serve as the major vector. In endemic foci, rodents are the natural reservoirs of this disease. Thus, we studied anti-P. papatasi saliva antibody response in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice that are commonly used as model organisms sensitive and resistant to cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. We followed the kinetics and persistence of specific antibody response in both mice strains and we characterized the main P. papatasi salivary antigens. We demonstrated that sand fly bites elicit production of specific IgG that reflect the intensity of sand fly exposure. In endemic areas, this could provide useful information about the effectiveness of anti-vector control programs. We also examined the reaction of mice sera with four P. papatasi recombinant proteins. Our data indicate that a combination of these proteins could be used instead of crude salivary gland homogenate for the monitoring of anti-sand fly saliva antibodies in natural hosts in endemic foci.
