Parasitic diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis account for a large proportion of global morbidity and mortality by contributing to malnutrition, developmental delays, loss of productivity, negative birth outcomes, disfigurement, physical handicap and social stigma. We studied these two infections in a community-wide, household-based study among residents of a coastal Kenyan village. With the use of newer PCR methods to detect sub-clinical malaria infections, and with the aid of statistical methods that could adjust for the household-level clustering of exposure factors, we found evidence that people of low socio-economic position are more likely to experience co-infection by these parasites. In addition, among children, we found that heavy infections clustered within a subset of individuals independent of their water contact, night activity, bednets use, and household distance to water, thus providing indirect evidence for biological interaction between these parasites in human hosts. If confirmed, these findings indicate that interventions focused on prevention and control of such co-infections could be concentrated on the most vulnerable groups of people in order to maximize benefits where resources are limited. Further studies of immunological and behavioral risk are warranted.
