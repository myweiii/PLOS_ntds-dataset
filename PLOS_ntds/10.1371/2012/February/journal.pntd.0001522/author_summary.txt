Parasitic zoonoses pose a continuing public health problem, especially in endemic developing countries where the majority of populations live in poor, overcrowded conditions, lack education, and practice poor standards of hygiene and improper sanitary disposal of feces. Close contact with domestic animals such as dogs and cats coupled with a lack of proper veterinary care and sanitation expose these communities to high risk of acquiring zoonotic infections. Our study combined the application of conventional and molecular epidemiological tools to determine the probable role of domestic animals, in particular dogs and cats, in the transmission of hookworms in parasite-endemic communities in Malaysia. Epidemiological observation such as univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with hookworm infection in humans, while molecular tools provided the ability to discriminate the different hookworm species, which cannot be achieved by conventional microscopic examination of feces alone. The application of these tools in this present study allowed the accurate determination of parasite species prevalence, hence confirming that Ancylostoma ceylanicum infection is common among human population in Malaysia and the close contact of human and domestic animals (i.e., dogs and cats) contributed to the propagation of this hookworm species.
