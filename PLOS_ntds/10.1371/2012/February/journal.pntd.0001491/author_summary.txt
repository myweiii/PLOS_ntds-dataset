Tsetse flies transmit trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness in humans and ngana in animals in sub-Saharan Africa. These diseases remain an intractable burden on human health and livestock production on the continent. Visual devices made of fabrics and impregnated with insecticide have the potential for controlling tsetse and preventing disease transmission as regular removal of a small percentage of the vector population can provide effective control. A variety of devices, notably biconical and monoconical traps and targets, have been used in previous control programmes against tsetse in West Africa. In this study we set out to determine which is the optimal device for control of three tsetse fly species, Glossina tachinoides, G. palpalis gambiensis and G. morsitans submorsitans, in the region. Using the same colourfast fabrics in all devices we show that there is no significant difference between biconical traps and targets in their ability to induce landings by the three species. We conclude that the simpler target would appear to be the most cost-effective insecticide-impregnated device to use in control programmes against these tsetse species. We also provide an estimate of the efficiency of the biconical and monoconical traps for the three species.
