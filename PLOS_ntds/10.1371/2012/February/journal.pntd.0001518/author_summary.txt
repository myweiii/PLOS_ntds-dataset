Leishmania parasites lodge in host cells within phagolysosome-like structures called parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs). Depending on the species, amastigote forms can be individually hosted within small, tight-fitting PVs or grouped within loose, spacious PVs. Using multidimensional live cell imaging, we examined the biogenesis of the two PV phenotypes in macrophages exposed to L. major (a representative of the tight PV phenotype) or L. amazonensis (an example of the loose PV phenotype) amastigotes. L. major PVs undergo fission as parasites divide; we demonstrate that in the course of fission there are transients of the lysosomotropic fluorescent probe Lysotracker. In contrast, during the course of amastigote population size expansion, L. amazonensis PVs do accumulate Lysotracker while increasing in diameter and volume. The large PVs fuse together, and the products of fusion undergo size and shape remodeling. The biogenesis/remodeling of the two types of Leishmania PVs is accompanied by a reduction in the number of macrophage acidic vesicles. The present imaging study adds new morphometric information to the cell biology of Leishmania amastigote intracellular parasitism.
