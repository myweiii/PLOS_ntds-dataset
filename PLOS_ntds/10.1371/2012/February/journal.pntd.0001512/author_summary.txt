Leishmania spp. are parasitic protozoa responsible for a spectrum of diseases known as leishmaniasis. There are few drugs available for the treatment of these diseases, and miltefosine is the first oral drug used in treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, a form of the disease that can be lethal if not treated. In this study, we seek to understand the mechanism of action and identify targets of the drug by generating promastigote mutants highly resistant to miltefosine. Two independent mutants were submitted to short read whole genome sequencing. Genome analysis of these mutants has permitted us to identify point mutations in three genes (P-type ATPase, pyridoxal kinase and Î±-adaptin like protein) that were also present in other independent miltefosine resistant mutants. Some of the new genes identified here could be useful as potential markers for miltefosine resistance in Leishmania. Moreover, our approach has permitted us to highlight that resistance can be highly heterogeneous at the population level with individual clones derived from this population differing both in terms of genotypes but also susceptibility phenotypes. This may have practical applications while studying resistance.
