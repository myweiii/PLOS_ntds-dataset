Every year, hundreds of thousands of people in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world are bitten by poisonous snakes and may develop permanent damages. This is a major tropical disease which is largely neglected by scientific and clinical investigators. Snakes of Bothrops and Crotalus genus are responsible of most cases in Latin America. Here for the first time, we have shown that these venoms cause the release of both mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c, two well known alarmins. Moreover, the kinetic of these processes are in agreement with the different pathophysiological profiles exhibited by Bothrops and Crotalus envenomations. These elements suggest a correlation between snake evenomations and sterile inflammatory syndrome. Alarmins are reported to have a fundamental role in innate immune response and inflammation; they might contribute to the local and systemic inflammatory events characteristic of these envenomations opening a new prospective in the study of these complex pathologies.
