Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi) and L. braziliensis are the causative agents of VL and CL, respectively, in the New World. A vital part of the parasite's life cycle involves the circumvention of the host immune system and the infection of macrophages. This work focused on an important class of surface glycoconjugates, the glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), and their role in the interaction with murine macrophages. GIPLs are expressed on every stage of the parasite life cycle and are the most abundant molecules on its surface. Here we show that these molecules modulate many macrophage functions such as cytokine production, release of nitric oxide and differentially activate MAPK. Although the GIPLs of both New World species are capable of modulating the same mechanisms, they do so to different degrees requiring an examination of their glycan composition. We show that L. infantum synthesize mannose rich GIPLs whereas L. braziliensis express galactose rich GIPLs.
