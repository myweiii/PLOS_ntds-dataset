Bloodflukes of the genus Schistosoma are the causative agents of human schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease that afflicts over 200 million people worldwide. There is no vaccine for schistosomiasis and treatment relies heavily on a single drug, praziquantel. Recent reports of praziquantel resistance raise concerns about future control of the disease and show the importance of developing new anti-schistosomal drugs. The focus of this research is on the nervous system of the model fluke, Schistosoma mansoni. Many pesticides and antiparasitic drugs act by interacting with neuronal proteins and therefore the nervous system is a particularly attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention. Here we describe a novel receptor of S. mansoni that is activated by dopamine, an important neurotransmitter of the schistosome nervous system. The study provides a first in-depth analysis of this receptor and suggests that it plays an important role in the control of muscle function and movement. We also show that the schistosome receptor is substantially different from dopamine receptors of the mammalian host, both in terms of structure and functional properties. We propose that this novel protein could be used to develop new, schistosome-specific drugs aimed at disrupting parasite motility within the host.
