E. histolytica genome sequence divulged the existence of ornithine decarboxylase enzyme that performs the first-rate limiting catalytic step of polyamine biosynthetic pathway. ODC enzyme is a potent therapeutic target in many eukaryotic disease causing pathogens. DFMO, a potent substrate analogue inhibitor, is widely used for the treatment of various diseases including Trypanosoma brucei infections. However, DFMO does not inhibit E. histolytica ODC. As ODC is a validated drug target for protozoan disease, an alternate strategy to inhibit the EhODC enzyme may be developed. In our study, we have evidently proved that the purified recombinant EhODC is functional as an active homodimer. Molecular modeling and simulation studies indicate that two independent active sites are present at the dimer interface. Our mutational studies indicate that the enzyme activity can be abolished by targeting the dimer interface and this in turn suggests the alternative inhibitory mechanism for the enzyme. Our investigation yields that disruption of dimer disrupts the active site pocket and renders the enzyme inactive. As EhODC crystal structure is unavailable, the 3D structure model of EhODC homodimer may assist in designing structure based anti-amoebiasis peptides or agents that disrupt the active site by destabilizing the dimer.
