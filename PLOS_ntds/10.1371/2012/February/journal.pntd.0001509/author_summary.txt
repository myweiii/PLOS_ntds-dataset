Schistosomes are parasitic trematode worms that infect more that 200 million people in 76 countries of the tropics and subtropics. These parasites are unusual amongst trematodes in having separate sexes. Mating of male and female schistosome involves the female residing within a specialized canal on the ventral surface of the male. Full sexual maturation of the female is dependent upon her residence within this niche. Sexual maturation involves the development of the vitellarium, a tissue that contributes critical cells to the egg. Remarkably, the vitellarium never grows in virgin females and regresses in mated female parasites once they are removed from males. Our study aimed to understand the basis for vitellarial growth and regression. We have found that the vitelline cells within the organ proliferate independently of males but are dependent on male parasites for their survival. Both cellular proliferation and death within this organ are negatively affected by removal from the host regardless of whether male worms are present or not, suggesting the presence within the host of a key factor that is not represented in standard tissue culture medium.
