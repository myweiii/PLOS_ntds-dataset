American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) is a parasitic disease which remains a public health problem in Latin America, but studies investigating the dynamics in populations under risk are scarce. We conducted a nation-wide study based on about 9 million Brazilian death certificates from 1999–2007. Epidemiological characteristics of Chagas-related deaths, temporal trends and associated factors were investigated. Chagas' disease was mentioned in about 54,000 (0.6%) death certificates, resulting in a mean standardized mortality rate of 3.36/100,000 inhabitants/year. Nationwide mortality rates reduced gradually, from 3.78 (1999) to 2.78 (2007) deaths/year/100,000 inhabitants (−26.4%). The vast majority of deaths (97.2%) were caused by chronic form of the disease. There were marked regional differences: mortality rates were highest in the Central-West region. In contrast to the rest of the country, there was a significant increase in the Northeast (38.5%). Risk factors independently associated with Chagas mortality were age >30 years (adjusted OR = 10.60; 9.90–11.33, p<0.001) and residing in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás or Federal District (adjusted OR = 4.89, 4.81–4.98, p<0.001). We performed the first nationwide population-based study on Chagas mortality, considering multiple causes of death in Brazil. A comprehensive overview of mortality associated with Chagas' disease is provided. Chagas' disease is still a major public health problem in the country.
