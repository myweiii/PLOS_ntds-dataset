We thank Klaus Brehm for granting us access to E. multilocularis EST data for the purposes of domain and SimiTri analyses; and Ana M Ferreira and Alvaro J DÃ­az for their advice and encouragement. The unpublished E. granulosus genome sequence data were produced by the Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and can be obtained from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Echinococcus/granulosus/.
