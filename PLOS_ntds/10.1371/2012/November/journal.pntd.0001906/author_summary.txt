Infection with the liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which is highly prevalent in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. Within this Province, there is considerable variation in the epidemiology of opisthorchiasis among districts. Preliminary allozyme and mitochondrial DNA data indicate that genetic variation in O. viverrini occurs even over a small endemic area within the province. Here, we used microsatellite DNA analyses to examine the population genetic structure of O. viverrini from four geographically close localities. Analyses of adult worms based on 12 microsatellite loci revealed varying levels of genetic diversity and population substructuring between the four localities. Worms originating from one locality (Phu Wiang) had significantly higher genetic diversity than the other three localities. Data on the population genetic structure observed in these localities are similar to those found at a larger geographic scale. This provides background data to further investigate the biological and epidemiological significance of these genetic variants.
