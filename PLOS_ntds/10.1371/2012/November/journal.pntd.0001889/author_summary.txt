In sub-Saharan Africa, parasitic worms (helminths) are among the most common chronic infections, malaria among the most deadly, and coinfection is the norm rather than the exception. Infections with hookworm and Plasmodium can decrease the level of hemoglobin and are therefore associated with anemia. Previous studies have investigated the consequences of coinfection in different age groups and settings, but results are conflicting. Indeed, there is no consensus about detrimental or beneficial effects of a coinfection for the host. We designed a cross-sectional study to determine risk factors for anemia and investigated interactions and discuss potential implications of P. falciparum and hookworm coinfection in three groups of people. Overall, 324 individuals were diagnosed for helminths and Plasmodium infections, anemia, subclinical inflammation, and micronutrient deficiencies, and householdâ€™s socioeconomic status was determined based on an asset-index. We found significant associations between hookworm and P. falciparum infections, depending on the age group. Interestingly, 6- to 8-year-old children harboring a coinfection showed significantly lower odds of anemia and iron deficiency than children infected with P. falciparum alone. This observation warrants follow-up studies, as there are important implications when implementing integrated control measures against malaria and helminthiases.
