Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is far from eradication. The lack of an efficacious vaccine and treatment failures are major factors in its intractable worldwide prevalence. A non-invasive imaging technique using genetically engineered parasites that expressed fluorescent proteins could give to researchers a quantitative and visual tool to characterize the parasite burden in experimental infections. In addition, it can be useful for determining the efficacy of candidate vaccines or drugs using High Throughput Screening methods that allow the testing of libraries of compounds in an automated 96-well plate format. Herein, we demonstrate that there is a good correlation between fluorescence emission and the parasite load, thus permitting the use of this output to monitor the progression of the disease. In order to validate this tool we have immunized mice prior the parasite challenge with a red-emitting parasite strain, confirming the scientific suitability of this approach as a valuable alternative model.
