Echinococcus granulosus is the causative agent of hydatidosis, a zoonotic infection that affects humans and livestock, representing a public health and economic burden in many countries. Since the parasites are unable to synthesise most of their lipids de novo, they must acquire them from the host and then deliver them by carrier proteins to specific destinations. E. granulosus produces in abundance proteins of the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family, one of which, EgFABP1 has been characterised at the structural and ligand binding levels, but it has not been studied in terms of the mechanism of its interaction with membranes. We have investigated the lipid transport properties and protein-membrane interaction characteristics of EgFABP1 by applying biophysical techniques. We found that EgFABP1 interacts with membranes by a mechanism which involves direct contact with them to exchange their cargo. Given that the protein has been found in the secretions of the parasite, the implications of its direct interactions with host membranes should be considered.
