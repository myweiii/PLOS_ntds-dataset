Toxocara canis and T. cati are roundworms found in dogs and cats, respectively, that can also infect humans and cause several clinical features, including asthma-like symptoms. Human infections with T. canis have been associated with an increased prevalence of atopy and asthma. In the present study, we investigated the associations between Toxocara seropositivity with eosinophilia, total IgE, specific IgE and skin prick test reactivity to aeroallergens, as well as atopic and non-atopic wheezing. Toxocara seropositivity was associated with elevated eosinophil counts and total and aeroallergen-specific IgE but was also associated with a decreased prevalence of skin prick test. Toxocara seropositivity was not associated with atopic wheezing. In conclusion, our data show that human toxocariasis, although associated with eosinophilia and raised levels of total and allergen-specific IgE, may play a role in the modulation of allergic effector responses in the skin.
