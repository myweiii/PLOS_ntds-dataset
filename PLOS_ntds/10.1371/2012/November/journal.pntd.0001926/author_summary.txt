Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by filarial worms. Over 120 million people are infected and 43 million have chronic disease. Since 2000, most of the endemic countries launched mass drug administration (MDA) programme with a goal to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020. MDA impact is monitored by assessing microfilaraemia (Mf) prevalence from a few sites and when it drops to <1% after 5 rounds of MDA each with >65% coverage, transmission assessment surveys (TAS) are carried out to decide on stopping further MDA. We used a mass blood survey in two primary health centres to assess the epidemiological situation after 8 rounds of MDA and evaluated the soundness of conclusions drawn from monitoring a few sites for initiating TAS. Mf-prevalence was 0.2%, both in the survey and monitoring sites, justifying the need for TAS, although data on MDA coverage was not available. The antigenaemia-prevalence in children born during the MDA period was 0.8%, well below the level (<1%), required for stopping MDA. However, we identified a few sites with ongoing transmission (‘hotspots’) and spatial clustering of infection which indicate the need for good sampling/surveillance strategies to detect such ‘hotspots’.
