This work required the collaboration of numerous parties. Renan Rosa, Amy Dang, Claudia Quinn, and Martha Cavallos participated in the laboratory evaluation. Nivison Nery, Jaqueline Silva, Andréia Santos, Ubiratan Rios, Francisco Alves, and Mayara Carvalho confirmed case-patient sera, blinded selected specimens, and managed the data. Control samples were provided by the Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública of Bahia and the Fundação Hemoba of Bahia. We also thank all research participants, especially the leptospirosis patients and the residents of the community of Pau da Lima in Salvador, Brazil.
