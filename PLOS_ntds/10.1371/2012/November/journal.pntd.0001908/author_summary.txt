Without effective drugs or a vaccine, vector control remains the only method of controlling dengue fever outbreaks in Singapore. Based on our previous findings on the effects of weather on dengue cases and optimal timing for issuing dengue early warning in Singapore, the purpose of this study was to develop a dengue forecasting model that would provide early warning of a dengue outbreak several months in advance to allow sufficient time for effective control to be implemented. We constructed a statistical model using weekly mean temperature and rainfall. This involved 1) identifying the optimal lag period for forecasting dengue cases; 2) developing the model that described past dengue distribution patterns; 3) performing sensitivity tests to analyze whether the selected model could detect actual outbreaks. Finally, we used the selected model to forecast dengue cases from 2011â€“2012 week16 using weather data alone. Our model forecasted for a period of 16 weeks with high sensitivity in distinguishing between an outbreak and a non-outbreak. We conclude that weather can be an important factor for providing early warning of dengue epidemics, long term sustainability of forecast precision is challenging considering the complex dynamics of disease transmission.
