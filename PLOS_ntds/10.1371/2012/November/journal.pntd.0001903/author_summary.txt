Debate persists about how best to prevent disease caused by Schistosoma parasites. Current guidelines focus on suppressing morbidity by limiting average intensity of infection during childhood. However, this may not be sufficient to cure infection or prevent reinfection, leaving risk for sub-clinical morbidities such as growth stunting and anemia. More intensive programs involving broader coverage and/or more frequent treatments could potentially cure most infections and even prevent their return. Because such programs' effectiveness is not currently known, we used computer simulation (grounded by past treatment program results) to project short- and long-term impact in communities where Schistosoma are common. We estimated that 4 annual treatments (delivered community-wide or only to school-age children and high-risk adults) could effectively reduce local prevalence below 10%. Programs with gap years were less effective, particularly in high-risk communities. If a program was successful, infection stayed <10% for 7–10 years in low risk communities. However, rapid resurgence (within 1–5 years) was projected for high risk villages. We conclude that, given the networked transmission of Schistosoma, annual treatment programs of sufficient duration can have secondary benefits, i.e., long-term suppression in some areas. However, high risk areas will need continuing surveillance and frequent retreatment to truly minimize their risk for disease.
