Parasitic Schistosoma haematobium worms cause urogenital schistosomiasis in 112 million people worldwide. These worms lay eggs in the bladder wall, resulting in inflammation, fibrosis (internal scarring), bladder cancer, and passage of eggs into the urine. Indeed, the International Agency for Research on Cancer within the World Health Organization has classified S. haematobium as a “Class I” agent (“Carcinogenic to humans”). Moreover, S. haematobium-induced fibrosis and resulting obstructive kidney failure leads to 150,000 deaths annually. As a result, S. haematobium infection is one of the most important causes of worm-related death globally. In spite of this, research on this parasite is sparse due to a lack of suitable animal models. We have used our recently developed mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis to understand the global bladder gene response to this infection. Large numbers of genes featured differential transcription after experimental infection, including specific immune response-, fibrosis-, cancer-, and bladder function-related genes. The relevance of these gene-based findings was verified through microscopic examination of egg-exposed bladders. Our data will improve our comprehension of urogenital schistosomiasis, and may help identify new targets for diagnosis and treatment of this disease, and possibly bladder cancer and bladder-based inflammatory disorders as well.
