Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) has been responsible for hundreds of thousands of human and equine cases of severe disease in the Americas. In 1969, an outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) spread rapidly from Guatemala and through the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, reaching Texas in 1971. Since this outbreak, there has been very little done to understand the ecology of VEEV in this region. Here, we present that the results of recent field studies that focus on confirming the continued existence of enzootic VEEV in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico. We performed serological analyses of sera collected between 2003 and 2010 from humans, cattle, horses, and dogs in various regions along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and these data were complemented by wildcaught rodent serosurveys. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were performed on VEEV isolates from this region to determine whether there have been substantial genetic changes in these viruses since the 1960s.
