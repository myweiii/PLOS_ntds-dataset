Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and is a major health problem especially in developing countries. Vaccines against typhoid are commonly used by travelers but less so by residents of endemic areas. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing to investigate the population structure of 372 S. Typhi bacteria isolated from typhoid patients during a typhoid disease burden study and Vi anti-typhoid vaccine trial in Kolkata, India. Approximately sixty thousand people were enrolled for fever surveillance for 19 months prior to, and 24 months following, vaccination of one third of the study population against typhoid (May 2003â€“December 2006, vaccinations given December 2004). We detected a diverse population of S. Typhi, including 21 different genetic forms (haplotypes) of the bacteria. The most common (69%) were of a haplogroup known as H58, which included all multidrug resistant isolates (bacteria resistant to the antibiotics chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole). Resistance to quinolones, a class of antibiotics commonly used to treat typhoid fever, was particularly high among a subgroup of H58 (H58-G). Vi vaccination did not obviously impact on the haplotype distribution of the S. Typhi circulating during the study period.
