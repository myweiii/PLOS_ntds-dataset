Mosquitoes and other arthropods transmit important disease-causing agents affecting human health worldwide. There is an urgent need to discover new chemistries to control these pests in order to reduce or eliminate arthropod-borne diseases. We describe an approach to identify and evaluate potential insecticide targets using publicly available genome (DNA) sequence information for arthropod disease vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by first determining the molecular and pharmacological properties of two different dopamine (neurotransmitter) receptors of the yellow fever- and dengue-transmitting mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Next, we tested 1,280 different chemistries for their ability to interact with one of these dopamine receptors in a chemical screen, and 51 “hit” compounds were identified. Finally, we show that two of these chemistries, amitriptyline and doxepin, are selective for the mosquito over the human dopamine receptor and that both chemistries caused significant mortality in mosquito larvae 24 hours after exposure, identifying them as possible “leads” for insecticide development. Our methodology is adaptable for chemical screening of related targets in mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors of disease. This research demonstrates the potential of target-specific approaches that could complement traditional phenotypic screening, and ultimately may accelerate discovery of new mode-of-action insecticides for vector control.
