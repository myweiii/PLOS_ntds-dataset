A range of molecular amplification techniques has been developed for the diagnosis of HAT, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the forefront. As laboratory strengthening in endemic areas increases, it is expected that the applicability of molecular tests will increase. However, careful evaluation of these tests against the current reference standard, microscopy, must precede implementation. Therefore, we have investigated the published diagnostic accuracy of molecular amplification tests for HAT compared to microscopy for both initial diagnosis as well as for disease staging.
Here, PCR tests seem to have an acceptably high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis of stage I HAT. This conclusion is, however, based on multiple-microscopy based techniques as reference standards, which may have low sensitivity, and a patient population that was not always representative. Future studies should, therefore, first and foremost include those patients for which PCR may become the test of choice. More certainty about the practical value of PCR tests for HAT diagnosis should come from non-accuracy design studies, like feasibility or cost-effectiveness studies.
