Schistosomiasis continues to be a major public health problem in the developing world. Parasite egg-induced liver fibrosis is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in human infected with schistosoma. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms that restrict tissue fibrosis may lead to more effective strategies for immunological intervention in this and a variety of chronic diseases. NK cells have been demonstrated to play an important role in suppressing carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. However, little is known about the role of NK cells in an infection-based model of fibrosis. In the current study, we determined, for the first time, the role of NK cells in S. japonicum egg-induced liver fibrosis. Our findings suggest that the activated NK cells in the liver after S. japonicum infection negatively regulate egg-induced liver fibrosis via producing IFN-Î³, and killing activated stellate cells. These results further our understanding of the innate immune cells that regulate the development of S. japonicum-induced fibrosis and aid in the development of potential strategies to enhance immunity against this and other chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver where fibrosis is a common feature.
