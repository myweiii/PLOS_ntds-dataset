Schistosome parasites infect more than 200 million people worldwide and cause human schistosomiasis. Free-swimming schistosome larvae are highly mobile and invade and penetrate the host's skin to perpetuate their lifecycle in their human host, growing from 90–215 micrometers in length as a schistosomulum to a 7–20 millimeter long adult worm. Few molecular pathways have been identified in schistosome worms that are important for parasite early development. The myocyte enhancer factor protein 2 is a major regulator of muscle and nerve development in mammals and insects and is highly conserved from bread yeast to vertebrates. Here we identify and characterize the Mef2 activator from parasitic schistosome worms, the first described in any parasitic worm, and delineation of its function may be important to further understanding the basic biology of schistosome early development. Additionally, since schistosomes developed early evolutionarily, an investigation of schistosome Mef2 regulatory mechanisms could lead to a greater understanding of the development of early muscle and neurogenic development in animals.
