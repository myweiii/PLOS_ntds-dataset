Scrub typhus is an infectious disease common in Southeast Asia, caused by the intracellular bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi. These microorgansims infect humans through chigger mite bites, after which O. tsutsugamushi invades cells in the dermis, causing an inflammatory lesion called an eschar. Other rickettsia causing different forms of typhus preferentially invade and grow within endothelial cells lining blood vessels, before spreading systemically. In scrub typhus, unambigous endothelial infection with the bacterium O. tsutsugamushi has been described in autopsy samples. In this study, we examined ex vivo skin biopsies from eschars of scrub typhus patients admitting to hospital and defined the phenotypes of host cells that O. tsutsugamushi invades using specialized immunofluorescence microscopy. In this early phase of disease, we found that endothelial cell infection was rare, but infection of host monocytes and specialist antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, was common. This represents a novel cellular tropism for O. tsutsugamushi, which provides a potential route for bacterial spread to the rest of the body and may affect its interaction with the host immune response.
