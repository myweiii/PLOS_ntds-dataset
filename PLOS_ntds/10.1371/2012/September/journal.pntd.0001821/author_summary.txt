Dengue is a tropical infectious disease that is of emerging global importance. As a dengue vaccine is still a distant prospect, descriptive epidemiological studies are a vital tool for developing a surveillance system capable of preventing dengue outbreaks. In the current work, the investigators describe epidemiology of dengue in Port Sudan on the Red Sea. There, the disease has distinctive spatial and temporal patterns. Households use water storage containers to supplement Port Sudanâ€™s poor public water supply. These containers provide breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes. Differences in water consumption patterns across neighborhoods result in differences in disease incidence. Our results suggest that Lower class neighborhoods may suffer dengue more than upper class ones. In addition, two transmission peaks are observed during the winter and summer seasons. These spatial and temporal patterns of dengue may describe dengue epidemiology along similarly affected coastlines of the Red Sea.
