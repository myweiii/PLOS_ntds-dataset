Visceral leishmaniasis is a vector borne disease that can be fatal if left untreated. Its prevalence is steadily rising in northern Ethiopia posing a public health challenge in the region. We conducted a study on the factors associated to asymptomatic infection in Libo Kemkem and Fogera, Amhara regional state, where little is known about Leishmania transmission. Sleeping outside was identified as a risk activity so measures towards it are recommended. Our results also showed a geographical clustering and a household focalization of the infection although the reasons behind it are not clearly understood. More entomological studies are needed in order to clarify the vecto's behaviour in the area. Individuals living in houses that owned sheep were more likely to be infected but no association was found with other domestic animals like cattle chicken or dogs. These results add up to the debate found in the literature regarding the role of domestic animals in the transmission of Leishmania in different regions of the world. No specific recommendation should be given until the exact role of the domestic animal in the transmission cycle is clearly understood.
