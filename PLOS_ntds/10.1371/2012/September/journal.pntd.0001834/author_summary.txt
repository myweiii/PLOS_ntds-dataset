Genotype I (GI) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) that replaced GIII virus has become the dominant circulating virus in Asia; however, all available JEV vaccines are derived from genotype III viruses, and no study has been conducted on the cross-neutralization and protection elicited by GIII JEV vaccines against GI viruses using vaccinated childrenâ€™s serum specimens collected from the general population. Genotype I virus was first detected in Taiwan in 2008, and became the dominant circulating JEV, and was island-wide within a year. In the present study, the small panel of GIII virus vaccinated-children serum specimens were not only showed lower strain-specific neutralization against GI virus as compared to the GIII vaccine and human isolates but also observed the enhancement of GI virus infection in K562 cells in some low or non-neutralizing serum specimens. These preliminary results indicated the reduced neutralization potency due to genotype replacement should be closely monitored in the JE epidemic/endemic regions in the future.
