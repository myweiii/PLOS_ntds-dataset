In the developing world, over 207 million people are infected with parasitic Schistosoma worms. Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni are the most abundant species in Africa and many people carry both. Yet, little is known about the consequences of such mixed infections. In general, S. haematobium affects the urinary tract of the host and S. mansoni the liver. Here, we investigated the effect of mixed Schistosoma infection on these health problems. We examined 403 people from northern Senegal for Schistosoma infections as well as for abnormalities of the urinary bladder and liver. Recently, we observed that people with mixed Schistosoma infections had generally higher infection intensities than those with single infections. The present study showed that abnormalities of the urinary bladder were more common in heavy than in light S. haematobium infections. Also, they were more common in single S. haematobium than in mixed infections. So far, only two studies have looked into the relationship between mixed Schistosoma infection and abnormalities of the bladder and liver, but only investigated children. Our findings suggest a possible protective effect of S. mansoni on bladder disease, in children as well as in adults. This may have important consequences for schistosomiasis control in co-endemic areas.
