We thank the many ASP clinical investigators and in particular those who recruited patients to the study: Adam Coulson (Bunbury/Bussleton Hospital), Peter Garrett (Nambour Hospital), Kate Porges (Gosford and Wyong Hospitals), Ovidu Pascui (Sir Charles Gardner Hospital), Naren Gunja (Westmead Hospital). We also acknowledge the many referrals from the poison information centres and clinical toxicologists and help of the many other nurses, doctors and laboratory staff in recruiting patients and collecting samples.
