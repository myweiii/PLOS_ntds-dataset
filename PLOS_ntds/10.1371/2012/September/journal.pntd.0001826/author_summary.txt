Giardiasis is a kind of zoonotic disease with global distribution. Due to the great number of asymptomatic giardiasis cases, human giardiasis is often underreported. The sources of infection of giardiasis are feces of humans and mammals with the pathogen being transmitted by the fecal-oral route. In this study, we described the occurrence of sheep and goat giardiasis and genetic charaterizations of G. duodenalis isolates in Heilongjiang Province, China. The average infection rate was 5.0% (34/678), with 5.6% (30/539) for the sheep versus 2.9% (4/139) for the goats. G. duodenalis assemblages and subtypes were genetically diagnosed by sequence analysis. Three assemblages were successfully identified out of 29 tpi gene sequences, with the percentages 13.8% (4/29), 6.9% (2/29), 79.3% (23/29) for assemblages A, B and E, respectively. Five novel subtypes were found out of seven subtypes of assemblage E. Two subtypes of assemblage A were detected, with one belonging to a novel subtype and the other belonging to assemblage AI. Two assemblage B isolates were identical to each other at the tpi locus. Prevalence, distribution and genetic characteristics of subtypes of G. duodenalis in sheep and goats appear to be unique in the areas examined. The sheep and goats infected with assemblages A and B have important public heath significance.
