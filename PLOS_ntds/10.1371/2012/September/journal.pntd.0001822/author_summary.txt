Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Chagas disease in southern South America. Dwelling-infesting populations are controlled through insecticide-spraying campaigns; however, dwellings are often re-infested when insecticide effects wane, and this leads to the re-establishment of disease transmission. Detecting and eliminating re-infestation foci is therefore crucial to prevent new cases. Unfortunately, available vector detection methods all have low sensitivity. Here, we show that simple sticky traps baited with widely available chemicals are significantly more sensitive than either unbaited traps or active manual searches by trained staff — the standard method used in control programs. Increased trap sensitivity (about 500% higher), together with an analytical approach that takes detection failures into account, allows us to estimate dwelling infestation rates at about 20–26%; in contrast, just 0–1.4% of dwellings were identified as infested by manual searches. This large difference highlights the importance of enhancing surveillance systems, and reveals how crude infestation indices may mislead decision-makers. We conclude that chemically baited sticky traps can help improve T. infestans surveillance systems and thus strengthen vector control program management.
