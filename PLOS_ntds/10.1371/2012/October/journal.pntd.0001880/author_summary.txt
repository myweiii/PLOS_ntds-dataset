Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected parasitic disease of global distribution. The highest prevalence rates are recorded in South America, Northern and Eastern Africa, Eurasia and Australia. In non-endemic and largely high income countries CE is a disease of immigrants. Imaging plays the key role in diagnosing and staging of CE. Ultrasound (US) remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, staging and follow up of CE cysts. Translation of the ultrasound-based classification of CE into magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)-imaging deserves attention since there are pitfalls of great significance for the diagnosis and management of patients with CE. With an increasing use of MRI and CT-imaging also in middle income countries of which many are endemic for CE the advantages and disadvantages of these imaging modalities deserve greater attention. We present a data set of US-, MRI- and CT-investigations of patients with CE where we can demonstrate that compared to US MRI is superior to CT in diagnosing and staging CE cysts. MRI reproduces the ultrasound-defined features of CE better than CT. If US cannot be performed due to cyst location or patient-specific reasons MRI is preferable to CT.
