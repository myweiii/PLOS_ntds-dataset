Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is among the leading causes of disability among tropical diseases and is caused by a mosquito-transmitted parasite but can be prevented using mass drug therapy and vector-control. In recent years, an international effort has been mounted to eliminate LF. In order to focus limited resources on areas with the highest disease burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that mass drug treatment programs be focused in areas with >1% prevalence of the infection, working under the assumption that areas with <1% prevalence are equivalent to areas of limited or no transmission. We carried out an additional assessment in low-prevalence areas and observed evidence of active transmission and clustering of antigen-positive persons. Our results imply that a 1% infection threshold may not be sufficient to capture all remaining reservoirs of transmission.
