Penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing respiratory, skin and systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. Its genome possesses a large number of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, which should be responsible for synthesis of secondary metabolites such as pigments, antibiotics and mycotoxins. Using state-of-the-art gene knockdown and ultra high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector/electrospray ionization-quadruple time of flight-mass spectrometry technologies, we discovered that the yellow pigment of P. marneffei was composed of mitorubrinol and mitorubrinic acid and was synthesized by two PKS genes, named pks12 and pks11. This represents the first discovery of PKS genes responsible for mitorubrinol and mitorubrinic acid biosynthesis, in which pks12 and pks11 are probably responsible for sequential use in the biosynthesis of mitorubrinol and mitorubrinic acid. Using a mouse model and human and mouse macrophage cell line models for P. marneffei infection, we also discovered that mitorubrinol and mitorubrinic acid are virulence factors of P. marneffei by improving its intracellular survival in macrophages.
