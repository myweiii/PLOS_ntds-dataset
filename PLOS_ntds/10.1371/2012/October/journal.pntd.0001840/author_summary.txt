Hantaviruses can evoke a severe, acute disease in humans known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with case fatalities up to 70%. Pathogenic hantaviruses are carried by rodents, with each virus species usually carried by a specific species of rodent. Hantavirus-host reservoir pairs continue to be discovered and details of the epidemiology and risk of hantaviruses to humans continue to emerge. We report the results of an investigation of a small outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 2002 in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where the disease had not previously been reported. Two cases were initially noted, with four additional persons shown to be recently infected with hantaviruses through thorough field investigation and antibody evidence. An antibody prevalence study conducted as part of the outbreak investigation showed over 9% of the population studied to have previous exposure to hantaviruses. Precipitation in the months preceding the outbreak was particularly heavy in comparison to other years, suggesting a possible climatic influence on rodent populations and risk of hantavirus transmission to humans. Hantavirus infection appears to be common in the Santa Cruz Department, but more comprehensive surveillance and field studies are needed to fully understand the epidemiology and risk to humans.
