Leishmania parasites cause a spectrum of diseases (cutaneous, visceral and the deforming forms—chronic cutaneous and mucocutaneous) known as leishmaniasis. The macrophage, a key cell in the immune system, is the cellular target of Leishmania parasites in the mammalian host. Previous studies showed the responses of monocytederived macrophages from naturally infected humans to infection with Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis were key to adaptive immune responses and clinical outcome. Consequently, an mRNA microarray approach was employed to assess the changes in macrophage gene expression over time (0.5 to 24 hours) induced by L. panamensis. The highest level of gene expression induction occurred early (0.5–4 hours); the early pathways (groups of genes) activated included those involved in the innate immune response (signaling, phagocytosis, TLR activation, and inflammatory). Early gene activation is presumed to be important for the developing cellular milieu at the site of infection. By 24 hours post-infection the dominant pathways involved metabolic functions. However, a comparison of the macrophage response to L. (V.) panamensis to that of L. (L.) chagasi (causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis) at 24 hours revealed a differential up-regulation of genes (cell adhesion, signaling, and inflammation) in response to these species. These observations underscore the distinct biology of different Leishmania species from the outset of infection.
