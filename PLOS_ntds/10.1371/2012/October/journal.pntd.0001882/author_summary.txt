Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Species that infect humans are prevalent in developing countries, having a major impact on public health and well-being as well as an impediment to socioeconomic development. More people are infected with Schistosoma haematobium than with all the other schistosome species combined, however mainly due to the inability to maintain S. haematobium in the laboratory system empirical studies on this parasite are minimal. The genetic variation of this Schistosoma species on a wide geographical scale has never been investigated. In this study, we have used a DNA ?barcoding? approach to document the genetic variation and population structure of S. haematobium sampled from 18 countries across Africa and the Indian ocean Islands. The study revealed a distinct genetic separation of S. haematobium from the Indian Ocean Islands and the closely neighbouring coastal regions from S. haematobium found throughout the African mainland, the latter of which exhibited extremely low levels of mitochondrial diversity within and between populations of parasites sampled. The data from this study provides a novel insight into the population genetics of S. haematobium and will have an impact on future research strategies.
