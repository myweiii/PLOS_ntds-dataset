Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system and a common cause of epilepsy in Taenia solium cysticercosis endemic countries. According to the current diagnostic criteria proposed by Del Brutto and colleagues, the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is mainly based on neuroimaging and detection of specific antibodies. Unfortunately, especially neuroimaging is rarely available in endemic countries. The authors analyzed the value of a test that detects antigens that are excreted by living cysts in people with epilepsy. Different diagnostic scenarios and cut-off values are discussed with the respective sensitivity and specificity of the test. When using the antigen-detecting test, considerably more people with epilepsy were diagnosed correctly with neurocysticercosis. There are some concerns about possible false positive results in other cases. The test was useful for the detection of people with living cysts (active neurocysticercosis), who need further diagnostic evaluation and specific treatment. The authors recommend the addition of this test in the diagnostic criteria for neurocysticercosis.
