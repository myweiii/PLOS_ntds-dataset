Leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus, Leishmania, exhibits clinical symptoms ranging from mild cutaneous lesions to more severe cutaneous or visceral disease. Here, we focus on L. major and L. mexicana, two species that lead to self-resolving and chronic cutaneous lesions, respectively. A strong Th1 response is necessary for resolution of disease following L. major infection. However, L. mexicana infection induces a limited Th1 response resulting in chronic disease. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells are believed to be important in priming the Th1 response during L. major infection, and therefore in this study we evaluated whether there are quantitative and/or qualitative differences in monocyte-derived dendritic cells following L. mexicana infection. We found that fewer monocytes were recruited to the lesions of L. mexicana infected mice as compared to mice infected with L. major. In addition, there were fewer iNOS producing monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the lesions of L. mexicana infected mice and less migration of monocyte-derived dendritic cells to the draining lymph node. Manipulations that allow for increased monocytes in the lesions of L. mexicana infected mice also resulted in a more robust Th1 response. Thus, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for the limited Th1 response observed during L. mexicana infection and also offer a better understanding of the important role that monocytes play during infection with Leishmania.
