In public health, "burden" estimates should capture the human suffering caused by certain health states, and the           estimates are often used for priority setting. However, such "burden" estimates need to assess not only the number of           affected people by certain conditions, but also the disability incurred by the average patient, and the determination of the degree of disability remains a widely debated issue. In order to provide new, population-based evidence on the disability caused by infections with parasitic worms, we administered a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire to 187 adults in rural Côte d'Ivoire and concurrently examined them for parasitic worm infections. We also considered sociodemographic characteristics in our analysis. In comparison with their non-infected counterparts, infected people reported a 13–16 points lower QoL on a scale from 0 (worst QoL) to 100 points (best QoL). At the same time, a one unit increase in a calculated wealth index revealed a 1-point increase in the        participants' QoL. The results are consistent and warrant further investigation on the disability induced by parasitic worm infections and the usefulness of QoL questionnaires in this endeavor.
