Leishmaniasis is an important public health problem with an estimated annual incidence of 1.5 million of new human cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 500,000 of visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment of the diseases is limited by toxicity and parasite resistance to the drugs currently in use, validating the need to develop new leishmanicidal compounds. We evaluated the killing by the palladacycle complex DPPE 1.2 of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, an agent of human cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon region, Brazil. DPPE 1.2 destroyed promastigotes of L. (L.) amazonensis in vitro at nanomolar concentrations, whereas intracellular amastigotes were killed at drug concentrations 10-fold less toxic than those displayed to macrophages. L. (L.) amazonensis-infected BALB/c mice treated by intralesional injection of DPPE 1.2 exhibited a significant decrease of foot lesion sizes and a 97% reduction of parasite burdens when compared to untreated controls. Additional experiments indicated the inhibition of the cathepsin B activity of L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes by DPPE 1.2. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of DPPE 1.2 as an additional option for the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis.
