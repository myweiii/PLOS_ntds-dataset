    "Abstract": "There are few animal models of dengue infection, especially in immunocompetent mice. Here, we describe alterations found in adult immunocompetent mice inoculated with an adapted Dengue virus (DENV-3) strain. Infection of mice with the adapted DENV-3 caused inoculum-dependent lethality that was preceded by several hematological and biochemical changes and increased virus dissemination, features consistent with severe disease manifestation in humans. IFN-\u03b3 expression increased after DENV-3 infection of WT mice and this was preceded by increase in expression of IL-12 and IL-18. In DENV-3-inoculated IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice, there was enhanced lethality, which was preceded by severe disease manifestation and virus replication. Lack of IFN-\u03b3 production was associated with diminished NO-synthase 2 (NOS2) expression and higher susceptibility of NOS2\u2212/\u2212 mice to DENV-3 infection. Therefore, mechanisms of protection to DENV-3 infection rely on IFN-\u03b3-NOS2-NO-dependent control of viral replication and of disease severity, a pathway showed to be relevant for resistance to DENV infection in other experimental and clinical settings. Thus, the model of DENV-3 infection in immunocompetent mice described here represents a significant advance in animal models of severe dengue disease and may provide an important tool to the elucidation of immunopathogenesis of disease and of protective mechanisms associated with infection."
