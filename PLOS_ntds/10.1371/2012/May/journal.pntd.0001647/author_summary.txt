The classical methodology of mapping works with discrete units and sharp boundaries does not consider gradient transition areas. Spatial analysis by the interpolation method, followed by map algebra, is able to model the spatial distribution of biological phenomena and their distribution and eventual association with other parameters or variables, with a focus on enhancing the decision power of responsible authorities. Acute Chagas Disease outbreaks are increasing in the Amazon Basin as result of oral transmission. This scenario requires a new approach to identify hotspot transmission areas and implement control measures. We applied a geospatial approach using interpolation and map algebra methods to evaluate mammalian fauna variables related to these outbreaks. We constructed maps with mammalian fauna variables including the infection rates by Trypanosoma cruzi, in dogs and small wild mammals. The results obtained by visual examination of the maps were validated by statistical analysis. We observed that high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in dogs and small wild mammals was associated with mammal lower richness. Monitoring of T. cruzi infection in dogs may be a valuable tool for detecting the fauna lower richness of small wild mammals and elucidating the transmission cycle of T. cruzi in the wild.
