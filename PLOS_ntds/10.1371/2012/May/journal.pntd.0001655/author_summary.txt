Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected disease still prominent in low-resource settings and is very disabling when it progresses to chronic pathology caused by lymphedema. Until now, studies on the contribution of Tregs to lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness in human filariasis have focused on frequency and phenotypic characteristics of these cells. We have looked at the functional consequence of the presence of Tregs in filaria-specific immune responses during different stages of human lymphatic filariasis. Proliferation of not only T cells, but also B cells, was decreased in patients with microfilaremia compared to uninfected individuals and chronic pathology (lymphedema) patients. The suppressed lymphocyte proliferative responses were increased after in vitro removal of Tregs in the microfilaria-positive group only, indicating the presence of filaria-specific functional Tregs in microfilaremic patients which are not as active in subjects with chronic pathology or without infection. Th2 cytokine responses were specifically enhanced in microfilaremics as well after Treg depletion, suggesting Treg-associated suppression of filaria-specific Th2 responses. Taken together, filaria-specific Treg contribute to immune modulation during microfilaremia and might need to be considered in therapeutic strategies to prevent chronic pathology induced by filarial infection.
