Dengue is a major vector borne disease in the tropical and subtropical regions. An estimated 50 million infections occur per annum in over 100 countries. A severe form of dengue, characterized by bleeding and plasma leakage, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is estimated to occur in 1â€“5% of hospitalized cases. It can be fatal if unrecognized and not treated in a timely manner. Previous studies had found a number of risk factors for DHF. However, screening and clinical management strategies based on these risk factors may not be applicable to all populations and epidemics of different serotypes. In this study, we found significant association between DHF and diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus with hypertension during the epidemic of predominantly serotype 2 (year 2007 and 2008), but not during the epidemic of predominantly serotype 1 (year 2006). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are prevalent in Singapore and most parts of South-East Asia, where dengue is endemic. Therefore, it is important to address the risk effect of these co-morbidities on the development of DHF so as to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our findings may have impact on screening and clinical management of dengue patients, when confirmed in more studies.
