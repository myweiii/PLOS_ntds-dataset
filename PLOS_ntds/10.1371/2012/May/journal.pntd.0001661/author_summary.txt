Efforts to control human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) would be strengthened by the development and application of more cost-effective methods of controlling the various species of tsetse fly vector. Among the most promising approaches is the use of insecticide-treated targets which use various olfactory and visual stimuli to attract and kill tsetse. Following on from previous studies of the responses of tsetse to odours and target size and shape, we compared the numbers of G. f. fuscipes attracted to different coloured targets. Our results show that the attraction of tsetse is correlated positively with reflectance in the blue region of the spectrum but negatively with the UV- and green regions. The best blue targets attract and kill three times more tsetse than the worst because of different UV reflectance levels in the different blue cloths. Hence selecting fabrics for use in targets must be based on spectral analysis of the fabrics' reflectance across the spectrum visible to tsetse, which includes UV, and not simply on the ‘rule of thumb’ that targets to control tsetse should be blue.
