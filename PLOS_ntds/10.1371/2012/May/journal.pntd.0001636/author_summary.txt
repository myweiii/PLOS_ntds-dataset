Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a serious health threat despite the availability of supportive care in modern medicine. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of DENV would be powerful research tools for antiviral development, diagnosis and pathological investigations. Here we described generation and characterization of seventeen mAbs with high reactivity for E protein of DENV. Four of these mAbs showed high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection in mice. The monoclonal antibody mAb DB32-6 showed the strongest neutralizing activity against diverse DENV-2 and protected DENV-2-infected mice against mortality in therapeutic models. We identified neutralizing epitopes of DENV located at residues K310 and E311 of viral envelope protein domain III (E-DIII) through the combination of biological and molecular strategies. Comparing the strong neutralizing activity of mAbs targeting A-strand with mAbs targeting lateral ridge, we found that epitopes located in A-strand induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge. DB32-6 humanized version was successfully developed. Humanized DB32-6 variant retained neutralizing activity and prevented DENV infection. Understanding the epitope-based antibody-mediated neutralization is crucial to controlling dengue infection. Additionally, this study also introduces a novel humanized mAb as a candidate for therapy of dengue patients.
