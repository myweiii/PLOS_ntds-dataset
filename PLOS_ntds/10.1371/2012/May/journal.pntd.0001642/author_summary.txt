The larva of the cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus affects a wide range of livestock mammals and humans, causing cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease), a zoonosis with significant economic and public health impact. The disease is characterised by the growth of a fluid-filled cyst in the host's viscera (mainly liver and lung). The most relevant antigen for hydatid disease diagnosis is antigen B (EgAgB), a highly abundant lipoprotein present in the cyst fluid. There is overwhelming literature regarding EgAgB antigenicity and molecular characterisation at the protein and gene levels, but the knowledge of the lipids physiologically bound to EgAgB protein subunits is very scarce. Indeed, there is only one report showing that delipidated EgAgB binds fatty acids in vitro. This work describes the physiological lipids of EgAgB, an important piece of information to complete our knowledge on EgAgB molecular composition. In contrast to what was thought, EgAgB consists of a variety of neutral and polar lipid classes, associated to protein subunits, forming a plasma lipoprotein-like particle of 229 kDa in size. Taken into account that E. granulosus cannot synthesise fatty acids and sterols, these data suggest that EgAgB plays a role in the uptake and transportation of these essential lipids across parasite structures.
