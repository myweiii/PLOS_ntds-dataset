Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease. Infection of dengue virus can cause clinical manifestations ranging from self-limiting dengue fever to potentially life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. In recent years, dengue has spread to most tropical and subtropical areas, making it a global health concern. Specific approaches for dengue therapy do not exist; the development of a dengue vaccine would represent a major advance in the control of the disease. Currently, no licensed dengue vaccine is available. Subunit vaccines provide a great safety strategy for developing dengue vaccine. However, the major weaknesses of subunit vaccines are low immunogenicity and poor efficacy. Here we employed dengue-1 envelope protein domain III as a model vaccine candidate and described a newly developed water-in-oil-in water multiphase emulsion system to overcome the inherent defect of subunit vaccines. We showed that emulsification of dengue-1 envelope protein domain III and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides synergistically broadened immune responses and potentiated the protective capacity of dengue-1 envelope protein domain III. These results provide valuable information for development of recombinant protein based vaccination against dengue virus and future clinical studies.
