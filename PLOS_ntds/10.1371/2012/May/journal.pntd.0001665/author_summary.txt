Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a potentially fatal disease, has emerged as an important opportunistic condition in HIV infected patients. In immunocompromised patients, serological investigation is considered not an accurate diagnostic method for VL diagnosis and molecular techniques seem especially promising. Demonstration of Leishmania parasites in bone marrow aspirate or in other biologic specimen, either by visualization or culture, remains the most reliable diagnostic technique in the setting of HIV co-infection. However, these tests are difficult to perform in rural areas and some of them are invasive and carry a risk of complication. This work is a systematic review to evaluate the accuracy of serologic and molecular tests for VL diagnosis in HIV-infected patients. Two reviewers searched the literature, evaluating quality of studies and comparing performance of diagnostic tests. Thirty three studies were included. Most studies were carried out in Europe. Serological tests varied in performance, but with overall limited sensitivity. Based on the evidence, serological tests should not be used to rule out a diagnosis of VL among HIV-patients, but a positive test at even low titers has diagnostic value when combined with the clinical case definition. Tests based on DNA detection are highly sensitive and may contribute to a diagnostic workup.
