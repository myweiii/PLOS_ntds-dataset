This study demonstrated an idea that mosquito cells can survive dengue virus (or other arboviruses) infection through antioxidant defense and an additional effect by induction of IAP expression for protection of infection. It makes mosquito eligible to support virus replication efficiently, leading to a goal which is important to explain how mosquitoes can be a vector even when they have been seriously infected by the virus. Our findings opened an avenue for studies on virus/vector co-evolution that benefits for both virus replication and its transmission to humans or susceptible hosts.
