The tropical helminth infection lymphatic filariasis affects more than 120 million people worldwide and is considered a major public health concern. Over 90% of infections are elicited by Wucheria bancrofti and adult worms reside in the lymphatic system releasing millions of microfilariae (MF), which periodically circulate in the blood. New diagnostic tools have provided a method to determine asymptomatic patients that are amicrofilaremic: a subset of individuals that have so far been neglected but are of special interest since these patients represent a dead end in terms of parasite transmission. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether the absence of MF was associated with distinct immunological profiles and observed that indeed responses in MF+ patients were dampened. From the viewpoint of the helminth such overall suppression of immune responses may facilitate MF transmission. Latent individuals however, presented elevated filarial specific responses and extrapolating these findings to the host provides novel insight into possible protective mechanisms which either actively hinders the release of MF from worms or their travel to the periphery. Further research into these aspects may broaden the range of strategies currently employed to reduce transmission and in turn eliminate bancroftian filariasis.
