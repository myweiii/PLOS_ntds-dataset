Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is transmitted to humans and horses by mosquitoes in Mexico, Central and South America. These infections can lead to fatal encephalitis in humans as well as horses, donkeys and mules, and there are no licensed vaccines or treatments available for humans. VEEV circulates in two distinct transmission cycles (epizootic and enzootic), which are differentiated by the ecological niche that each virus inhabits. Epizootic strains, those that cause major outbreaks in humans and equids, have been studied extensively and have been used primarily to develop and test several vaccine candidates. In this study, we demonstrate some important differences in the roles of different viral genes between enzootic/endemic versus epizootic VEEV strains that affect mosquito infection as well as differences in the way that enzootic VEEV more efficiently infects the mosquito initially. Our findings have important implications for designing vaccines and for understanding the evolution of VEEV-mosquito interactions.
