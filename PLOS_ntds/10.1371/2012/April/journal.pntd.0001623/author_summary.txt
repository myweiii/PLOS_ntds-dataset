Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-transmitted disease of ruminants and man, which occurs in Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen but could spread to other areas. There isn't much information on some aspects of the immune response to this disease and how it affects cells of the immune system in the natural animal hosts. To fill in some of this knowledge gap, we studied RVF in goats experimentally infected with the RVF virus. We also compared RVF virus grown in an insect cell-line and that grown in a mammalian cell-line for differences in the course of infection. Virus was present in the blood of the goats one day after infection. Some goats had fever coinciding with the time when the virus level in the blood was highest. Some cells in the blood dropped in number possibly as a direct effect of virus. Infected goats secreted cytokines (interferon gamma and interleukin-12), which possibly contributed to protection against RVF. Virus from an insect cell-line appeared to have more obvious effects in infected goats suggesting that differences may exist in infections of ruminants acquired from mosquito bites compared to those due to contact with infectious material from other animals.
