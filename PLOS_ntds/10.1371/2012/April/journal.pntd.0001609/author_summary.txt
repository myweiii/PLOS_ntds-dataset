Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a public health problem in Tbilisi, capital of the Republic of Georgia. VL is caused by Leishmania parasites and dogs represent the main infection reservoirs. VL is transmitted among humans and dogs by sand fly bites. Here, we carried out a three-year survey to assess the sand fly species in two communities within the VL focus of Tbilisi in the districts of Vake and Mtatsminda. We collected five sand fly species, and the most abundant was Phlebotomus kandelakii. We found live parasites in the midgut of P. kandelakii and another species, P. balcanicus. Using molecular techniques we identified the parasites as Leishmania infantum. We also found that these sand fly isolates shared a high identity to parasites isolated from dogs and humans in the same focus. This incriminates P. kandelakii and P. balcanicus as vectors of VL in this focus. The source of the blood meals in fed flies revealed that P. kandelakii preferentially feeds on dogs but also feeds on humans. The abundance, infection rate and feeding behavior of P. kandelakii and the consistently higher infection rate of P. balcanicus compared to P. kandelakii incriminate these species as primary vectors in the Tbilisi VL focus.
