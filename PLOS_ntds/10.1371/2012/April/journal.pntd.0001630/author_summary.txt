Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the clinical forms of Chagas' disease (CD) after the infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Even though strategies adopted in most Latin-American countries in the last decades towards vector control have been effective in reducing the incidence of CD, active transmission is maintained in some regions, and secondary prevention approaches are still required for the infected patients, mostly because the specific anti-parasitic medications are toxic and perhaps of limited efficacy in chronically infected individuals. Moreover, there are no markers to predict the risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy in asymptomatic, chronically infected patients, although the failure in the mechanisms that control the immune response can be involved in the development of Chagas' heart disease. In this study we show that preserved activity of regulatory T cells and the production of the cytokine IL-17 are connected with a more benign evolution of the disease, which brings a new understanding on the mechanisms associated with progression of CD.
