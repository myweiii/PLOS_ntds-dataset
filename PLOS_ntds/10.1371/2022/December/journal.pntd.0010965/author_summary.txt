Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus are globally-distributed and important vector mosquito species that transmit a variety of pathogens. The two mosquito species have different circadian patterns, with Ae. albopictus being diurnal and Cx. quinquefasciatus being nocturnal. Mating is an important activity of mosquitoes, however, the mating rhythms and their regulatory mechanisms in Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus have yet to be described. Here, we compared the diel mating activities of these two mosquito species and discovered that Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus have distinct mating rhythms, which can be entrained by daily LD cycles. CRISPR/Cas9 technologies were used to knock out the core clock gene clock (clk) in the two mosquito species and found that Aalclk and Cxqclk have significant roles in the mating activity rhythms in both Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus by regulating the temporal expression of the desaturase desat1 gene, which can affect sex pheromone synthesis and mating. These findings establish the basis for an in-depth understanding of the mating rhythms for mosquito vectors, which may provide insights in the development of novel and precise mosquito control.
