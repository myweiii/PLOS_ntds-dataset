    "Background": "Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) sergenti is a widespread proven vector of Leishmania pathogens causing anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), due to L. tropica, in the old world. The activity of P. (Par.) sergenti is seasonal and sensitive to general variations in climate. Phenological data sets can thus provide a baseline for continuing investigations on P. (Par.) sergenti population dynamics that may impact future leishmaniasis transmission and control scenarios.",
    "Methods/Principal finding": "A systematic review of the seasonality of P. (Par.) sergenti was undertaken globally. Six hundred eight scientific papers were identified, and data were extracted from 35 ones, with informative data on sand fly seasonal dynamics on trapping performed from 1992 to December 2021 on 63 sites from 12 countries. Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Palestine, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Cyprus, and Georgia. The data extracted from the literature survey were further normalized. Our analysis recorded that the highest P.(Par.) sergenti activity occurs during the hot and dry seasons, primarily in July and August, whatever the location studied. We noticed a relationship between the latitude of sites and sand fly presence (from early April to June) and the type of density trend, varying from a single peak to multiple peaks. On a geographical scale, P. (Par.) sergenti concentrates between 32–37° in latitude in a large interval following the longitude and the highest number of sites with high P. (Par.) sergenti activity is located at the latitude 32°. We also quoted a similar seasonal dynamic and geographic distribution with Phlebotomus (Phlebotomus) papatasi, a proven vector of L. major that causes cutaneous infection. No apparent risk for ACL occurred from December to March, at least in the years and geographic areas considered in this survey. Altogether, knowing that high P. (Par.) sergenti activity would be linked with an increased risk of leishmaniasis transmission, and our study provides information that can be used for control programs on ACL transmission.",
    "Conclusions": "Despite variations, we found a relatively homogeneous pattern of P. (Par.) sergenti potential behavior in sites whose data are published. A higher risk for L. tropica transmission was identified in the June-October period. Still, such risk was not equally distributed throughout the area since density waves of adults occurred earlier and were more frequent in some territories, like Saudi Arabia."
