RT-LAMP, a rapid and sensitive method for detecting pathogens, can be used in resource-limited settings. Although several RT-LAMP assays have been developed for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, reports on the long-term validation of these assays are limited. To demonstrate the applicability of the assay and to verify the usability of the method against various SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is important to conduct long-term validation studies using clinical samples collected in the region where the assay may be introduced for diagnoses. This study revealed the high sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting viral RNAs of 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Omicron variant. Moreover, more than 292 copies of the viral genome were detected with 100% probability within 15 min using clinical samples collected between March 2020 and October 2021 in Gabon. The results demonstrate the suitability of the assay for use in rural areas of Africa where it is difficult for residents to access official COVID-19 diagnosis facilities.
