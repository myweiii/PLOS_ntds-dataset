Leishmania infantum is a parasite of dogs and humans that causes a life-threatening disease called visceral leishmaniasis. Detecting dog infections is critical for disease management and prevention, yet error-free diagnostics are unavailable. Here, we illustrate a statistical-modeling approach that can be used to account for the false-negative and false-positive test results that inevitably arise when attempting to detect Leishmania in dogs. We used parasitological and molecular testing to study 294 field-sampled dogs from central Brazil. Results from replicate tests and site-occupancy models suggest that molecular testing was ~49–53% sensitive; specificity was high (95–96%) only when very stringent criteria were used to detect and handle possible sample contamination. The sensitivity of parasitological testing was low (~12–13%), but reached ~33% for some samples and dogs. These testing-performance estimates suggest that Leishmania-infection frequency was lower than observed–and, in particular, that about 30 seemingly positive dogs were most likely infection-free. Our results show, in sum, how a statistical approach based on hierarchical models can help us better understand the process of detecting elusive microbial pathogens such as Leishmania.
