Despite elimination efforts, malaria continues to be a public health burden world-wide. Partially due to its ability to remain dormant in the liver for weeks or months, the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax has not responded well to elimination efforts. These dormant parasites may reactivate and thereby cause disease and contribute to further transmission of the disease. Though it is often assumed that reactivations of dormant P vivax parasites occur at a constant rate, it has also been proposed that there is a time of increased risk of reactivation (‘temporal heterogeneity’) and there may be differences in individual’s reactivation risks (‘population heterogeneity’). We created models for constant reactivations, temporal heterogeneity, and population heterogeneity which we use to analyse data of P vivax malaria events from the Thailand-Myanmar border region and Papua New Guinea. We find strong evidence for population heterogeneity as a major determinant of reactivation patterns. Further analysis of the data suggests that spatial heterogeneity in exposure to infectious mosquito bites is a potential contributor to this heterogeneity. Thus, we find that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the overall epidemiology of P vivax recurrences.
