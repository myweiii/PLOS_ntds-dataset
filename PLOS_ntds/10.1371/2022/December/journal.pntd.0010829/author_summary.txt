CHIKV reemerged and caused millions of human infections since 2004. The disease could be established, when the virus has been introduced to areas where the appropriate vectors are endemic. Early detection, active response and followed epidemiological evaluation will provide opportunity to prevent CHIKV dissemination. The differential diagnosis of CHIKV infection varies based on place of residence, travel history, and exposures. Serological tests are commonly used to diagnose CHIKV infection, but their availability and assessments of the performance of the diagnostics have been limited. This study reports the development, standardization, and clinical evaluation of a Mac-ELISAs and a Das-ELISA for the diagnosis and surveillance of chikungunya. Comparing the detection results of 225 serum samples (45 positive; 180 negative) with a real-time RT-PCR assay and an IFA commercial tests manufactured by Euroimmun, confirming the usefulness of these ELISA methods. But a limitation of this study is the lack of a gold standard detection method as a reference and the lack of enough clinically confirmed CHIKV infection samples for evaluation. Serological testing for CHIKV needs to be further explored.
