    "Background": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) reemerged and caused millions of human infections since 2004. The disease could be established, when the virus has been introduced to areas where the appropriate vectors are endemic. The differential diagnosis of CHIKV infection varies based on place of residence, travel history, and exposures. Serological tests are commonly used to diagnose CHIKV infection, but their availability and assessments of the performance of the diagnostics have been limited.",
    "Objectives": "To develop and evaluate antibodies detection methods for chikungunya diagnosis and serological investigation.",
    "Methods": "Recombinant E2 protein based IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mac-ELISA) and double antigen sandwich ELISA (Das-ELISA) for detection of antibodies to Chikungunya virus were developed and evaluated. The repeatability was evaluated by testing of three reference sera at single dilutions in triplicated for 5 times. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and agreement of the MAC-ELISA and Das-ELISA were obtained by comparing the detection results of 225 serum samples (45 positive; 180 negative) with a real-time RT-PCR assay and an IFA commercial tests manufactured by Euroimmun.",
    "Results": "The established ELISA assays were standardized by determining the optimal concentrations of the key reagents. The coefficient values of repeat testing were within 10% and 20% for intraassay and interassay precision, respectively. A sensitivity of 60.0% and 52.5%, a specificity of 96.2% and 96.8%, and an accuracy of 89.8% and 88.9% were obtained for the Mac-ELISA and Das-ELISA, respectively, when compared to a CHIKV qRT-PCR method. And a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 97.5% and 99.5%, and an accuracy of 97.8% and 99.6% were yielded respectively when using the IIFT as a reference method, which showed a highly consistence to the commercial IIFT assay with a Kappa value greater than 0.90.",
    "Conclusions": "The Mac-ELISA and Das-ELISA based on recombinant E2 protein of CHIKV were developed and standardized, which could detect IgM or total antibodies against CHIKV in 2\u20133 hours with acceptable sensitivities and specificities. These assays can be used for laboratory diagnosis and serological investigation of CHIKV infections to evaluate the risk of CHIKV transmission."
