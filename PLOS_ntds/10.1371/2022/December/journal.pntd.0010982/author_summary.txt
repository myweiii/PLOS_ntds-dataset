Invasive Salmonella infections cause the loss of millions of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) every year globally. The two main types of invasive Salmonella infections in Africa are i) typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, and ii) invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease, primarily caused in our setting by Salmonella Typhimurium. Despite the high disease burden, and the observed differences between the epidemiology of typhoid and iNTS disease, we lack an understanding of the reservoirs and transmission routes of iNTS. Therefore, we carried out extensive microbiological sampling of the household members, domestic animals, and living environments of patients with invasive Salmonella infections, and of geographically-matched control households, and investigated the genetic relationships between household Salmonella and index-case blood-stream isolates by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We identified a wide range of NTS serovars / sequence types across all households and sample-types, but only identified Salmonella that matched iNTS that matched invasive cases strains in the stool of healthy people from the same households. Our findings support, but cannot prove, the hypothesis that iNTS-associated strains are transmitted from person-to-person. Boot-sock sampling of the household environment gave the highest yield of Salmonella of any of our sampling strategies. None of the 41 environmental Salmonella isolates from non-human sources, including 4 domestic animal-associated isolates, matched the disease-causing sequence types. Our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the reservoir of Typhimurium iNTS infections is the human gastrointestinal tract, and transmission occurs within households. Longitudinal studies are required, however, to confirm this hypothesis.
