Snakebite envenomations (SBEs) are a health problem in tropical and subtropical countries. In endemic areas, this health problem more frequently involves men engaged in agricultural activities. However, in many areas of the world, women of childbearing age are also very affected by snakebites, as they also actively participate in activities that put them at risk of encountering snakes. In this context, SBEs can occur during pregnancy, with deleterious consequences for both the mother and the fetus or neonate. However, the little that is known about the consequences of SBEs in pregnancy comes from case reports. In this study, we linked the surveillance databases Snakebites Reporting Information System (SINAN), Mortality Information System (SIM) and Live Birth Information System (SINASC) of the state of Amazonas, Western Brazilian Amazon, to gain a more integrative view of the problem in the region. Although severity and case-fatality rates of SBEs were similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women, pregnant women who suffered SBEs were at higher risk for fetal and neonatal deaths.
