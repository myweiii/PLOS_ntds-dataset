Use of 8-aminoquinolines, which are an anti-relapse therapy for P. vivax, is limited because of the risk of life-threatening hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency. Impaired CYP2D6 affecting primaquine biotransformation is another challenge for effective radical cure of vivax malaria. G6PD and CYP2D6 are highly polymorphic genes that vary geographically and ethnically. Therefore, information on G6PD and CYP2D6 genetic variations should be assessed. Class B G6PD variants were discovered in Yala province, suggesting that anti-relapse medications may result in a moderate to severe hemolytic crisis in the absence of screening for G6PD deficiency. Up to 51.1% of vivax patients in this region were intermediate metabolizers with decreased CYP2D6 activity, putting them at risk of therapeutic failure. On the basis of the populationâ€™s genetic profiles, we recommend ensuring robust screening for G6PD deficiency and monitoring effectiveness of current 8-aminoquinoline regimens.
