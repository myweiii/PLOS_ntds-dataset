Trypanosoma cruzi is divided into seven distinct genetic groups (TcI-TcVI) and TcBat. They may be related to several biological parameters, however, the correlation with the clinical forms is not well established. Thus, the work has the important function of identifying the genetic variability of T. cruzi circulating in different regions of Brazil, and trying to correlate the genetics of the parasite with the clinical manifestations presented by the patients. In this work, we showed differences in the prevalence between infectious DTUâ€™s (genetic groups), and we were able to identify and describe the correlation between TcII DTU and severe chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (LVEF < 40%). The information generated in this study should impact the planning of more effective public health interventions to improve the health of chagasic patients, control vertical transmission and the treatment of CD in endemic countries.
