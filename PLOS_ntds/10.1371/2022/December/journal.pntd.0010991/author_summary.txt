Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a valuable tool for identifying gene expression differences among cells present in one sample. However, scRNA-seq data is usually generated by sequencing the 3â€™ end of mRNA molecules after poly-A capture, which complicates assigning reads to specific genes for organisms with poorly annotated UTRs, and prevents identifying differences in isoform expression. Here, we utilize a modified version of 10X scRNA-seq technology to characterize full-length transcripts using PacBio sequencing from both sporozoite and blood stages of Plasmodium vivax. These data allow us to predict full-length, stage-specific, transcripts for P. vivax, as well as to identify variations in UTR usage throughout the P. vivax life cycle.
