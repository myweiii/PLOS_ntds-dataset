    "Abstract": "Splenomegaly, an enlargement of the spleen, is a known clinical sign of the parasitic disease, human African trypanosomiasis. This study follows the development of splenomegaly in a group of mice over multiple infection points, using a non-invasive imaging modality, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CD-1 mice infected with GVR35 T.b. brucei demonstrated a significant increase in spleen size from day 7 post-infection, with changes in the spleen tracked in individual animals over five time points. At the final time point, the mean spleen weight calculated using the spleen volume from the MR images was compared with the post-mortem gross spleen weight. No significant difference was detected between the two methods (1.62 \u00b1 0.06g using MRI and 1.51 \u00b1 0.04g gross weight, p = 0.554). Haematology and histological analysis were also performed, giving additional insight into splenomegaly for the GVR35 strain of infection. The study demonstrates that MRI is a useful tool when examining changes in organ volume throughout HAT infection and may be applicable in the investigation of a range of conditions where changes in organ volume occur and MRI has not been used previously."
