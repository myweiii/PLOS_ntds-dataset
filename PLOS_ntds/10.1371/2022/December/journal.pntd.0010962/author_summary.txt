Although splenomegaly (the enlargement of the spleen) has been explored previously in mice infected with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a parasitic disease originating in Africa, it has never been examined in individual mice over time. This study is the first to do this using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By scanning mice infected with trypanosomes, we were able to examine how the spleen size and shape changed over the course of the infection. We were also able to show the enlargement in spleen size before the clinical signs became apparent, demonstrating that MRI could be useful for examining changes in the organs in the body following the onset of disease.
