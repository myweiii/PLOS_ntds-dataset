Chinese cobra bites often cause local tissue necrosis and lead to physical disability, which is the difficulty of treatment. Considering that the cytotoxin in cobra is the main pathogenic factor causing local tissue necrosis, we proposed injecting anti-snake venom locally to increase its concentration in the wound, so as to neutralize the cytolytic activity of snake venom. In order to verify the clinical efficacy of the therapy, a randomized controlled trial were conducted: the experimental group was treated with anti-snake venom blocking therapy, while the control group was treated with chymotrypsin blocking therapy. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by comparing the local wound necrosis, wound healing time, etc. as the indicators. Then, the results showed that the experimental group had smaller wound necrosis area and also much shorter healing time than the control group, which clearly indicated that the local blocking treatment with anti-snake venom serum has much better clinical efficacy. Meanwhile, theoretically, the anti-snake venom blocking therapy is also suitable for the treatment against other snake bites. So, in future we expect to conduct more clinical studies on this, which will provide information on new treatments with much better clinical efficacy for patients.
