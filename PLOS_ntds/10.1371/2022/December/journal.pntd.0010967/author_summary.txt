Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by a novel phlebovirus (SFTS virus, SFTSV), which has a wide range of clinical manifestations, from hyperthermia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms to hemorrhage, altered consciousness, and multiple organ dysfunction. It has a high mortality rate of about 11â€“30%. There is no specific treatment for SFTS, thus it is urgent to concentrate on patients infected with SFTSV and to identify the associated risk factors to reduce the number of critically ill and fatal cases. In the present study, EOS% and BAS% were for the first time used as variables to predict clinical outcomes of early-stage SFTS patients. The combination of EOS% and BAS% exhibited a satisfactory predictive performance compared with previously reported measures related to clinical outcomes. We also found that EOS% and BAS% were associated with neurological symptoms and signs. This study contributed to the risk factors findings on SFTS, which will be useful as guidelines for identifying the critical patients with SFTS.
