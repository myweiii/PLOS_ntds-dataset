The World Health Organization classifies yaws as a neglected tropical disease. It has been estimated that 100,000 children in 14 yaws-endemic countries develop cutaneous ulcers annually. The overall burden of infectious skin ulcers has not been determined and is likely to be much higher. Two-thirds of these ulcers are associated with Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue and/or Haemophilus ducreyi, while the cause(s) of the remaining one-third are unknown. An ulcer eradication campaign on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, utilized mass drug administration of azithromycin and failed to fully eradicate ulcers in part due to the persistence of ulcers of unknown cause. By 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which only detects a subset of bacteria, we previously showed S. pyogenes was associated with skin ulcers of unknown origin. Here we applied direct DNA sequencing to identify other microorganisms present in these specimens. Confirming and extending our previous data, we found that Streptococcus pyogenes and several anaerobic bacteria were enriched in ulcers of unknown cause. We did not find enrichment of any viral or fungal microbes. Testing for S. pyogenes and selected anaerobes will help strengthen eradication efforts by improving diagnostic testing and treatment of this painful and debilitating syndrome.
