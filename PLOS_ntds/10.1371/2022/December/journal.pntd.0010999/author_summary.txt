African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or Nagana and Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) agents, are transmitted by a blood feeding vector called tsetse flies. In Animals, the disease is arguably the main constraint to an integrated livestock and crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. In humans, the disease is highly neglected. Vector control is considered to be one of the strategies to control the AAT and HAT. These interventions, however, need sampling and monitoring of vector distribution in disease endemic areas. This will be done using different tsetse traps. In Ethiopia, especially in southern and south-western regions, NGU (Nguruman), Biconical and Sticky traps are commonly used, but no evidences on the effectiveness of these traps in catching flies have been generated. Therefore, the measurement of traps efficiency and identification of the most effective one based on the type of vegetation in Nech Sar and Maze National Parks was the aim of this study. Our findings indicated that the NGU trap was the most effective model and the best-identified trap in most vegetation types in the region. This will help in monitoring the impact of interventions and for effective control of trypanosomiasis.
