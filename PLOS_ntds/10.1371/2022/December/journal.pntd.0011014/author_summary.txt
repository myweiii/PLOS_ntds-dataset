“Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem” is defined in part by the presence of very low proportions of the population demonstrating the clinical sign “trachomatous trichiasis”. Trichiasis is the condition in which eyelashes touch the eyeball. But determining whether trichiasis is trachomatous in origin requires expertise that most graders who contribute to field-based surveys do not have; the right approach has therefore been debated. We undertook a twenty-month prospective study of trichiasis in a tertiary eye care hospital in New Delhi, using expert examiners. The setting is important here because India is very close to having each district demonstrate a prevalence of upper eyelid trichiasis lower than the agreed elimination threshold prevalence for trachomatous trichiasis. Our data suggest that only 26% of upper eyelid trichiasis in this setting was attributable to trachoma. Trachoma was not identified as the cause of trichiasis in any eye with lower eyelid-only disease, supporting the recent change in definition of trachomatous trichiasis to include only disease affecting the upper eyelid. However, better ways to routinely distinguish trachomatous from non-trachomatous trichiasis are still needed.
