Leprosy is chronic infectious disease characterized by skin and peripheral nerve lesions. Despite the efforts to eliminate leprosy, around 210,000 new cases are still found annually of which 60% is reported by India alone. To reduce the incidence significantly, new active case finding approaches in combination with preventive treatment to at-risk populations are needed in high-endemic areas in India. Geospatial methods can support program managers and policy makers to identify clusters of leprosy patients and target at-risk populations for preventive interventions. However, often standard spatial methods do not account sufficiently for the local context (i.e., local barriers and social determinants). In this study, we describe a contextualized spatial approach that includes expert consultation to identify context specific clusters and compared it with a standard approach. Overall, our results show that the contextualized approach is able to identify more clusters precisely and covers a larger proportion of the population in clusters that would need to be targeted for preventive interventions. For program managers and policy makers, the contextualized approach can be useful to target at-risk populations in high-endemic areas while ensuring efficient use of public health resources. Further research is needed to test the scalability in different endemic settings and to apply to other Neglected Tropical Diseases.
