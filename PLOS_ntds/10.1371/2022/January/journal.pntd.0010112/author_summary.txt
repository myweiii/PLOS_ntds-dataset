Clinical signs and symptoms of leptospirosis are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as dengue, sepsis, and malaria, making it difficult to diagnose. In this study, we developed an RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a -based detection platform to identify the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. The results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) was approximately 102 cells/mL without cross-reactivity against other infectious diseases. The platform was validated using 110 patients from 15 hospitals in Sisaket province, Thailand. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was found to be 85.2%, 100% and 92.7%, respectively, for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Assay sensitivity increased at 4â€“6 d post-onset of fever, with a consistent specificity every day after the onset of fever. We also developed a lateral flow detection assay combined with RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a, which also had a LOD of 102 cells/mL and could correctly distinguish known positive and negative clinical samples in a pilot study. Findings from this study demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform in improving speed and accuracy of leptospirosis diagnosis especially in limited-resource settings.
