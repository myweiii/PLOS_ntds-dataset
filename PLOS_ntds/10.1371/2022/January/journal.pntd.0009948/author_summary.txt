Rabies is a fatal disease primarily transmitted by rabid dogs. It is estimated that 59 000 human deaths occur worldwide annually because of rabies. Prevention is possible using pre-exposure prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Despite this, rabies remains a neglected disease and a burden, particularly in developing countries. In this study, we found that the current estimated dog to human ratio of 1:10 may be incorrect. Our data show that the ratio of 1:3.7 may more closely reflect real-world figures. This finding is supported by previous studies on dog populations. We provide compelling evidence that there is a need to revise the current guidelines for estimating the dog population to provide adequate vaccine coverage. Our findings on community knowledge about rabies show that there is relatively good understanding regarding rabies; however, awareness of the concept of rabies as a disease and how animals and humans can acquire it is lacking. This should be a point of focus for future education campaigns.
