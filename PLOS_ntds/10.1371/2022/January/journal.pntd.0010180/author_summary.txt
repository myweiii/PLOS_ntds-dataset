Enterotoxigenic E. coli and Shigella are the leading causes of moderate to severe diarrhea in the low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). A critical constraint to determine the ETEC and Shigella disease burden at the country or sub-national level, is the complex diagnostic methods currently required for detecting these pathogens. These methods are neither sufficiently sensitive nor standardized and are not feasible in the resource poor settings where these infections occur most commonly. We developed a simple and rapid diagnostic assay called "Rapid Loop-mediated isothermal amplification based Diagnostic Test (RLDT)" for the detection of these pathogens in low-resource settings. Using RLDT, ETEC and Shigella were detected directly from the stool, in less than 1 hour with minimal hands-on time. The assay does not require maintaining a cold chain and is electricity-free. Being rapid, simple, and sensitive, RLDT can be scaled up and is appropriate to apply in the LMICs where ETEC and Shigella diarrhea are endemic.
