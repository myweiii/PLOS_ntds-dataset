West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease caused by flavivirus infection that dispersed circumglobally by the end of the 20th century. There is the long-existing endemic area in southern Russia (Volgograd region) that remains affected by West Nile virus (WNV) with the maximum number of reported cases in the country. The natural features of the region formed favorable conditions for long-term WNV circulation. At the same time, the urban environment could pose greater hazards for WNV infection in humans. Road density, distance from water bodies, land surface temperature and altitude were identified as the most significant spatial determinants of WNV distribution. The private building sector with low-storey houses and garden plots located in the city suburban area provided connections between urban and rural transmission cycles. Climate change also may favor WNV transmission as increased temperatures affect the sum of effective temperatures necessary for virus extrinsic replication. A statistically significant correlation between WNV human cases and the sum of effective temperatures was found during the last 20 years.
