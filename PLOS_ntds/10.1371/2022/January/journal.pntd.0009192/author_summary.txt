Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic disease, characterized by chronic progressive hepatic damage caused by the continuous tumor-like proliferation of the larval stage (metacestode) of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to surgical intervention, preferably radical curative surgery if possible, and the use of parasitostatic benzimidazoles. It is not yet fully understood how the parasite can remain in the host’s tissue for prolonged periods, complicating the development of therapeutic applications. This work investigated an involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection and upon treatment with either albendazole (ABZ) or anti-programmed death ligand-1 (αPD-L1) in mice. The results revealed increased expression levels of the ERS sensor ATF6 and of downstream target genes in liver tissue of E. multilocularis- compared to mock-infected mice. Additionally, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD), generating NADPH within the endoplasmic reticulum, and the lectin-chaperone calreticulin were increased in E. multilocularis infected liver tissue while the expression of the ERS associated genes ATF4 and IRE1α were decreased. The observed gene expression changes were at least partially reversed by ABZ treatment, which also reduced the AE-induced increase of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ. PD-L1 blockade reversed the AE-induced changes of UPR and ERS associated proteins CHOP, ATF4 and IRE1α. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation and ERS in human patients with AE and whether modulation of these pathways may lead to improved therapy.
