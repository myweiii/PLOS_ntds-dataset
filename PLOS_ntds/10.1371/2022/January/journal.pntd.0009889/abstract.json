    "Abstract": "Schistosoma japonicum is prevalent in Asia with a wide mammalian host range, which leads to highly harmful zoonotic parasitic diseases. Most previous transcriptomic studies have been performed on this parasite, but mainly focus on stages inside the mammalian host. Moreover, few larval transcriptomic data are available in public databases. Here we mapped the detailed transcriptome profiles of four S. japonicum larval stages including eggs, miracidia, sporocysts and cercariae, providing a comprehensive development picture outside of the mammalian host. By analyzing the stage-specific/enriched genes, we identified functional genes associated with the biological characteristic at each stage: e.g. we observed enrichment of genes necessary for DNA replication only in sporocysts, while those involved in proteolysis were upregulated in sporocysts and/or cercariae. This data indicated that miracidia might use leishmanolysin and neprilysin to penetrate the snail, while elastase (SjCE2b) and leishmanolysin might contribute to the cercariae invasion. The expression profile of stem cell markers revealed potential germinal cell conversion during larval development. Additionally, our analysis indicated that tandem duplications had driven the expansion of the papain family in S. japonicum. Notably, all the duplicated cathepsin B-like proteases were highly expressed in cercariae. Utilizing our 3rd version of S. japonicum genome, we further characterized the alternative splicing profiles throughout these four stages. Taken together, the present study provides compressive gene expression profiles of S. japonicum larval stages and identifies a set of genes that might be involved in intermediate and definitive host invasion."
