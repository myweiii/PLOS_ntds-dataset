Leptospirosis is a disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira serovars. Leptospira can infect both humans and animals depending on the species and serovar, with disease resulting from direct or indirect exposure to infected urine. In Australia, the highest number of human cases recorded annually occur in the state of Queensland. Feral pig hunting is a popular recreational activity in this state and hunters often use dogs to ‘flush out’ pigs. This study investigated whether dogs used to hunt feral pigs were exposed to Leptospira serovars, the geographic distribution of human leptospirosis cases and canine exposure to Leptospira serovars in Queensland, and the knowledge of this disease amongst owners of pig-hunting dogs. We found that roughly one quarter of unvaccinated pig-hunting dogs had been exposed to Leptospira spp. The wet tropics region of Far North Queensland was found to be the location of highest risk for exposure to Leptospira for humans. There was little overlap between the serovars dogs had been exposed to and those reported to have caused disease in humans, except for the serovars Topaz, Australis, Grippotyphosa, and Pomona. Finally, pig hunters were found to be at increased risk of being diagnosed with leptospirosis compared to the Queensland public and engaged in risky hunting practices such as not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Our findings reinforce the emerging significance of leptospirosis for physicians and veterinarians in Australia.
