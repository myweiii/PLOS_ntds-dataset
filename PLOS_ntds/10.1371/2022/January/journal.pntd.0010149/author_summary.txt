CHIKV infection has caused several outbreaks and affected millions of people in epidemic areas since the virus was originally isolated in 1952. CHIKV is transmitted by mosquitoes, resulting in acute diseases typically characterized by severe and debilitating arthritis, myalgia and fever, followed by persistent or recurrent joint and muscle pain that may last for months to years. The persistence of CHIKV in patients has been validated by clinical evidence, but it remains unclear how chronic and recurrent tissue injury are correlated with persistent viral infection. In this study, we established acute and chronic CHIKV infections in mice with different viral inoculation doses and identified the correlation of infection dose with outcomes resulting from CHIKV infection. We found that a high inoculation dose not only resulted in persistent viral infection but also led to a typical acute-recovery-relapse model of myositis and joint injury in mice. We also found that CHIKV RNA replication was interrupted after the acute phase, which might be related to the low antiviral T cell responses and relapse of histopathological injuries. Our study highlights the key factors involved in the clinical outcomes after CHIKV infection and provides new insights into the interaction between viral persistence and recurrent arthritis.
