Dengue is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes which causes unpleasant flu-like symptoms and has no specific treatment. In Cambodia, mosquitoes which can carry dengue virus breed in fresh water collected in containers such as the large clay jars used for domestic water storage in the many rural parts of the country which lack piped household water supply. This study examined a package of interventions including putting mosquito larvae-eating guppy fish in household water containers, trapping adult mosquitoes, removing mosquito breeding sites from around houses and providing community education about dengue, particularly to school children. The study found that implementing this package of interventions significantly reduced the number of household water containers which contained mosquito immature stages, the average number of mosquito pupae per house and the average number of adult mosquitoes per house when compared with a control group which did not implement the package. Though these results are promising, it is not certain that these reductions will directly translate to a reduction in the number of people in the study areas becoming infected with dengue and more studies are needed to investigate this link.
