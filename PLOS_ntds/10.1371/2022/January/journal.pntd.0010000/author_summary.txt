Lymphatic filariasis is caused by a nematode worm Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The vector Culex quinquefasciatus is a nuisance due to its biting habit and involvement in transmission of many deadly diseases in the tropics and sub tropics. Therefore, to control disease transmission by mosquito vectors, humans have been relying on the use of chemical insecticides since many decades. However, the over and unplanned application of insecticides has led to insecticide resistance in the mosquito population. As such, the insecticides have failed to produce 100 percent mortality in the mosquito vectors. This scenario is an important and urgent issue of concern because apart from medical treatment, major reliance for the control of vector-borne diseases still lies on the use of chemical insecticides targeted against the mosquito vectors. Moreover, there is a need to survey and evaluate insecticide susceptibility/resistance status of mosquito vectors along with the underlying mechanisms of resistance in national and regional level to draw an idea about the existing insecticide resistance pattern. This will further help in designing efficient vector control strategies in the near future on both national and regional basis.
