Hookworms are bloodfeeding intestinal parasites that represent an important cause of anemia and growth delay in children from Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). The study of hookworm is limited by the limited availability of animal models that accurately reproduce the clinical features of human infection. We report here a detailed description of hookworm infection in the hamster, with comparison of two routes of infection: oral vs percutaneous. The results demonstrate differences in the time course of infection and primary immune responses based on whether infection occurs orally or via skin penetration. These results build on the current understanding of hookworm pathogenesis and extend the utility of this important animal model of human disease.
