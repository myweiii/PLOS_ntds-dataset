Mansonella perstans and Loa loa are filarial nematodes that infect millions of people living in less developed areas, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Both parasites are neglected among other filarial nematodes because both are regarded as causing mainly asymptomatic infections. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) deployed during malaria surveys as a convenient sampling strategy for molecular surveillance of blood-dwelling filarial nematode infections. Our findings demonstrate the potential of mRDTs as a source of parasite DNA beyond malaria, providing an opportunity to expand current knowledge on the distribution and populations mostly affected by M. perstans and L. loa infections to Equatorial Guinea, located in Central-West Africa.
