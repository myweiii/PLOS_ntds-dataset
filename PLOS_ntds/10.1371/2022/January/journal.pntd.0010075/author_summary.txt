Since its discovery in the African continent in 1937, West Nile virus expansion and invasion into new regions represent a serious concern today for an increasing number of countries worldwide. Although about 80% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, this zoonotic virus is pathogenic for humans other than for some animal species, displaying a range of clinical manifestation spanning from influenza-like symptoms to severe neurological complication and death.
This study provides an updated overview on the current knowledge of WNV epidemiology in each African country, summarizing available data on incidence of the infection in humans and animals, the circulating lineages and clades, other than an updated list of the principal arthropod vectors found naturally infected and the availability of vector competence studies. However, this review highlights also the lack of knowledge regarding the occurrence and intensity of circulation of WNV in many African countries. Therefore, considering the sensitivity of WNV transmission system to climate and other environmental changes, along with the increasing level of interconnections among continents due to globalization, the intensification of the research activities on WNV and a promotion of a coordinated surveillance actions across African and European countries would provide the information of utility for a better evaluation of the actual risk of WNV and disease burden at trans-continental scale.
