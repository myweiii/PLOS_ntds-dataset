Alveolar echinococcosis (AE), one of the most deadly zoonoses in both developing and developed Northern Hemisphere countries, is caused by the larval stages (metacestode) of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis). This disease is characterized by the development of severe fibrosis around the lesion, which gradually replaces normal liver parenchyma and affects liver function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been evaluated as an alternative therapeutic option for tissue repair (including fibrosis). Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which are one of MSCs subsets, can easily obtained from adipose tissues through liposuction, implying that a large number of cells can be obtained with less traumatic surgery. In multiple tissues, including pulmonary, dermal, renal, and especially liver tissues, ADSCs have been shown to be effective in fibrosis treatment. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of ADSCs on Echinococcus multilocularis infections. Briefly, E. multilocularis-infected mice that were transplanted with ADSCs were found to have less liver fibrosis, indicating the potential of ADSCs as novel therapeutic approaches for E. multilocularis-induced liver fibrosis. Although these findings are promising, studies using long-term AE infection models should be performed to confirm the therapeutic effects of ADSCs on AE.
