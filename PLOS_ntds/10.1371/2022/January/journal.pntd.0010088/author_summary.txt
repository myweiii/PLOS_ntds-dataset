Current global anthropogenic changes have contributed to the increased transmission of infectious diseases. One of the direct consequences of these changes is the geographical distribution of schistosomiasis, resulting in the natural formation of hybrid populations. Hybridisation between S. guineensis and S. haematobium in particular has led to epidemiological variability where they exist sympatrically, changing the region endemicity from predominantly intestinal to urogenital schistosomiasis. This has occurred in part due to the replacement of S. guineensis through the invasive presence of S. haematobium. The underlying genomics behind hybrid viability and adaptation has yet to be explored within the species group. This study addresses this need through the analysis of genome-wide datasets, to highlight adaptive loci that could be beneficial to hybrid viability and increased fitness of Schistosoma hybrids.
