The Leishmania RNA virus-1 (LRV1) has been implicated as a possible modulator agent in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis. In-vivo and in-vitro studies have depicted specific mechanisms of how LRV1 could lead to metastasis. Clinical studies and epidemiological evidence have both supported and rejected the hypothesis that LRV1 is a relevant determinant of progression, treatment failure and clinical severity of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL). This lack of consistency between preclinical and clinical reports requires further longitudinal studies to clarify the role of LRV1 in ATL. Due to the complex nature of ATL, as other frequent human diseases, these studies should tackle multiple determinants of pathogenicity, including LRV1 status, parasite features, immune status, and prevalent comorbidities affecting individuals in endemic settings. Also, critical methodological aspects allowing for the reliable identification and quantification of LRV1 should be guaranteed.
