World-wide large-scale deworming programs are being implemented to control the morbidity attributable to intestinal worms. Our group has recently shown that diagnostic tools that detect anti-parasite antibodies hold promise as an alternative to the current diagnostic standard (detecting worm eggs in stool using microscopy) to monitor and evaluate the progress of these programs towards the set targets. In the present study, we further explored the potential of antibody-based assays by monitoring the exposure of Ethiopian school children during a 17-month period to worm infections. Our results indicated that children in this area are exposed to intestinal worms from an early age onwards and that, based on serological results, more children are exposed to worm infections than measured by the current diagnostic standard. In addition, we demonstrated that test results of the antibody assay at the start of the study were positively associated with mean egg counts averaged over the study period, the rate of egg-appearance and the number of positive stool tests, highlighting that such assay holds promise as a tool to identify individuals at higher high risk for continued exposure to worms, and ultimately improve control programs.
