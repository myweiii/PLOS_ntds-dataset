Traditional medicine is commonly used worldwide for a variety of ailments and diseases, including animal bite wound care and pre-clinical rabies prevention. Traditional healers often use herbal-based remedies containing local plants. Other traditional remedies include animal-based or spiritual-based methods. This literature review included plant surveys, controlled mice experiments, and community-based studies concerning rabies prevention provided by traditional healers in multiple countries. There was no consistent remedy used across the published literature, and most importantly, there were no published studies supporting effective traditional medicine methods for use in the prevention or treatment of human rabies. Our review of rabies virus transmission rates show that traditional healers have a high apparent success rate of preventing rabies deaths from dog bites, but there is no scientific or medical basis for this perception. Educating communities about proven, effective rabies prevention through post-exposure prophylaxis while understanding the cultural importance of traditional medicine is needed for promoting effective rabies prevention.
