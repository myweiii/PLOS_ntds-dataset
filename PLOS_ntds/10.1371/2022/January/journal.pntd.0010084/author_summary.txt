Prior to open field release, new genetic approaches that interfere with mosquito abilities and reduce mosquito population density require progressive evaluation both in the laboratory and contained field trials. Trials in contained outdoor systems are thus an important step and allow for evaluation of the effectiveness and reliability of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti (wAlbB-Tw) in settings that incorporate natural environmental variations. We describe a semi-field system designed to study the ability of wAlbB-Tw mosquitoes to suppress local mosquito populations. We provide a protocol for establishing, maintaining, and monitoring Ae. aegypti population densities inside field cages. These results pave the way for the open release of wAlbB-Tw-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the field.
