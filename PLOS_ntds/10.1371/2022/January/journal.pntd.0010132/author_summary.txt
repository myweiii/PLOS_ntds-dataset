Lower limb disorders including lymphoedema are prevalent in Ethiopia as a common endpoint of varying causes such as podoconiosis, leprosy and lymphatic filariasis. This study involved the development of a comprehensive integrated and holistic care package for lower limb disorders into routine health care services. It used interviews and focus groups to assess feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of the draft care package. We found that persons affected by lower limb disorders had many negative experiences due to their condition, especially related to stigma, that included physical, financial and psychological sequelae. Neglect was paramount, with financial neglect in central budgets, a lack of knowledge by care givers and a lack of awareness among affected persons and their communities, all contributing to inadequate care provision and access. Affected persons, communities and caregivers may benefit from provision of learning opportunities about the prevention and treatment of lower limb disorders; and resources are crucial in engendering change, including material goods, time to provide care, and collaborative work to create a culture shift and address stigma.
