    "Background": "Lower limb disorders including lymphoedema create a huge burden for affected persons in their physical and mental health, as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial consequences for them, their families and communities. As routine health services for the integrated management and prevention of lower limb disorders are still lacking, the \u2018Excellence in Disability Prevention Integrated across Neglected Tropical Diseases\u2019 (EnDPoINT) study was implemented to assess the development and delivery of an integrated package of holistic care\u2013including physical health, mental health and psychosocial care\u2013within routine health services for persons with lower limb disorders caused by podoconiosis, lymphatic filariasis and leprosy.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This study was part of the first of three phases within EnDPoINT, involving the development of the integrated care package. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were undertaken with 34 participants between January\u2013February 2019 in Awi zone, Ethiopia, in order to assess the draft care package\u2019s feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study highlighted the need for the EnDPoINT integrated care package and provided suggestions for solutions according to its three aspects of integrated care (integration into routine care; integration of mental health and psychosocial care; and integration of care across the three diseases), thereby giving support for its feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness."
