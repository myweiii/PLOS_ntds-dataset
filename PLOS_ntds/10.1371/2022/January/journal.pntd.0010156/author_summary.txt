Cache Valley virus is a mosquito-borne virus found throughout the Americas. It causes fetal death and severe malformations in livestock, and only a few cases of human viral disease have been identified. Currently, we do not fully understand the spectrum of disease in humans including its potential to cause fetal malformations. The only serological diagnostic assay available to detect recent viral infection is plaque reduction neutralization test which requires the use of live virus in biocontainment. In order to develop faster and safer serodiagnostics we generated 12 monoclonal antibodies for incorporation into new assays. These antibodies are specific to the nucleoprotein of the virus and cross-react with other closely related mosquito-borne viruses. Four of these antibodies were incorporated into an immunoassay for the detection of IgM from human sera demonstrating their utility in serodiagnosis. Rapid and higher throughput assays utilizing these antibodies will expand diagnostic capacity and facilitate research to increase our understanding of Cache Valley disease prevalence and the virusâ€™s impact on at-risk populations.
