TB and helminthic infections co-occur exists, particularly in areas where poverty persists. Both diseases can affect the same individual and exacerbate the course of diseases. There are a few reports about prevalence of intestinal parasites, TB and TB co-infection, which varies from place to place due to geographical distribution and life style. Hence, we tried to reveal intestinal parasitosis-tuberculosis co-infection among PTB suspected patients. We also tried to address associated factors for intestinal parasitosis and tuberculosis. Since the burden of co-infection causes a major public health threat, health care providers should screen and request all necessary tests used to diagnose in order to identify the co-infection, treat TB patients for co-infection.
