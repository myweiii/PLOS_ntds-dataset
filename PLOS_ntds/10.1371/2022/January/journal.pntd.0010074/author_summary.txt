Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is now considered a global health threat in all industrialized regions of the world. About 30% of infected individuals will develop cardiac pathology. The molecular mechanisms by which the parasite signals and infect host cells to cause pathology remain to be elucidated. We showed that host thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is essential for T. cruzi infection since cells deficient in TSP1 are poorly infected by the parasite. In this study, we challenged mouse heart endothelial cells from wild type and TSP1 KO mice and evaluated the importance of TSP1 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, β-catenin/YAP colocalization and how it can be exploited to regulate parasite infectivity. The parasite activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and nuclear β-catenin/YAP colocalization. In TSP1 KO MHEC (absence of TSP1), the parasite induced a continuous increase in nuclear translocation and colocalization of β-catenin/YAP. These results suggest that during the early phase of T. cruzi infection, TSP1 regulates β-catenin/YAP interaction. Inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in WT MHEC led to a significant reduction of parasite infectivity. The level of parasite infection of the pretreated WT cells was as low as that of TSP1 KO MHEC. Our studies show that the β-catenin pathway is an important therapeutic target for T. cruzi infection.
