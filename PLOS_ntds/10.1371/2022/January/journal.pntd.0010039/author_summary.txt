Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Dengue patients can have low platelet counts and might have acute gastrointestinal bleeding (tarry stool, bloody stool or bloody vomiting). Most dengue patients will fully recover and return to their previous health levels. Previous studies have indicated that some dengue patients have persistent low platelet counts and high inflammatory responses. The medium-term and long-term upper gastrointestinal bleeding risks remain unknown. Our study suggested that dengue was significantly associated with an increased risk of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding within 30 days after infection but was not associated with increased medium-term (31â€“365 days) and long-term risks (>365 days) of upper GI bleeding. Therefore, the risk of acute gastroenterology bleeding returned to baseline levels after 30 days. Recovered dengue patients with acute GI bleeding can resume antiplatelet, antithrombotic, and oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatments.
