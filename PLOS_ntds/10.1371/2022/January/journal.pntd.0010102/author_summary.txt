In Bangladesh, very little is known about disease characteristics and serological responses in different spectrum of COVID-19 disease in patients. The risk factors responsible for causing severe COVID-19 illness, as well as data on clinical, biochemical and immunological parameters is still lacking or insufficient across different geographical regions for the prediction of the disease outcomes. This is the first longitudinal study in Bangladesh to evaluate the data on clinical, hematological parameters, viral load and antibody responses in COVID-19 infected asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe patients. Our study showed that older age, male gender, multiple co-morbid conditions and elevated NLR, D-dimer, ferritin and CRP levels can help clinicians to predict progression to more severe outcomes. Patients with moderate and severe disease developed higher levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to patients suffering from mild disease or those with asymptomatic infections. However, all infected individuals developed antibody responses that were higher than that seen in healthy controls.
