Schistosoma japonicum is a parasite that can cause serious intestinal schistosomiasis. The infection is mainly diagnosed by parasitological and immunological methods, such as Kato-Katz test and indirect hemagglutination assay. However, both of these are not sensitive enough to accurately assess schistosomiasis elimination/eradication. PCR assays, detecting parasite DNA, are theoretically a highly suitable, sensitive and specific, alternative. However, reported performance varies greatly among studies. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis (PROSPERO, registered No. CRD42021233165) to analyze and summarize the data from relevant studies of variable-temperature PCR for the diagnosis of S. japonicum infections, using stool or blood samples from humans in endemic areas. We retrieved a total of 13 eligible articles including data from 4268 participants across 16 studies. There was high heterogeneity among studies, but no publication bias was found. Analyses revealed that PCR techniques had a satisfactory performance for diagnosing S. japonicum infections in humans in endemic areas, with both high sensitivity and specificity. Further research on S. japonicum diagnostic techniques, especially in low endemicity areas and for detection of dual-sex and single-sex infections are required. These may be best using highly sensitive gene targets in nested PCR reactions.
