Lymphatic filariasis is a disease caused by roundworms that may lead to disability, psychological problems, stigma, and lowered quality of life. One of the key strategies to control and eliminate lymphatic filariasis is mass drug administration (MDA), or repeated treatment of all at-risk people living in affected areas with an annual dose of medicine. To determine whether MDA can be stopped in a particular area, a transmission assessment survey (TAS) is conducted whereby a sample of children are tested for filarial antigen and proportion with a positive result is compared against a target threshold. Existing guidelines for delimiting the geographic areas to conduct TAS permit large evaluation units. In 2015, TASs were conducted in Haiti using more stringent criteria for forming evaluation units, resulting in much smaller geographic areas for evaluation. Using simulations, the authors found that, had Haiti followed the existing guidelines and assessed larger geographic areas, many of the areas might have been misclassified and MDA stopped prematurely in some settings. This research suggests that caution is needed when forming evaluation units for TAS, especially if the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis is not uniform.
