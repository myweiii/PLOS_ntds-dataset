On 11 May 2021, the WHO reclassified the B.1.617.2 variant as a “variant of concern” (VOC) from being a “variant of interest”, considering its global public health significance. On 21 May 2021, the first local case infected with the Delta variant (i.e. lineage B.1.617.2) in Guangzhou, China, was reported. In response to the resurgence of COVID-19, the local government implemented a series of containment measures. This provides a valuable opportunity to understand the characteristics of the Delta variant and to evaluate the performance of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac) and other interventions. We estimated that the median incubation period was 6.02 days and the means of serial intervals decreased from 5.19 to 3.78 days. The incubation period increased with age. The vaccination coverage in the COVID-19 cases was 15.3%. Clinical symptoms were milder in cases with partial or full vaccination than in those who were unvaccinated (odds ratio [OR] = 0.26). We found that the effective reproductive number decreased from 6.83 for the 7-day time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter. Our findings have important implications for the containment of COVID-19.
