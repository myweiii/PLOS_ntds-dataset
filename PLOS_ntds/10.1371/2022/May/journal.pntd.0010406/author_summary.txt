Plasmodium vivax forms dormant liver stages in the human host that reactivate weeks to months after the first infection and cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected populations. The group of 8-aminoquinolines are the only class of licensed drugs that remove these liver stages from the human host but are contra-indicated in patients with low activities of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (G6PD). The WHO therefore recommends testing G6PD activity prior to treatment to exclude individuals with low activities from standard treatment. We enrolled 335 patients with malaria in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Ethiopia and measured G6PD activity in all participants. All participants were followed up and a second G6PD measurement was collected between 6 and 33 months after enrolment if participants were free of malaria. When comparing both measurements, G6PD activity was 10% higher during malaria. The increase in G6PD activity during malaria is probably triggered by the Plasmodium infection, the observed change in G6PD activity may alter the risk profile of standard malaria treatment with 8-aminoquinolines.
