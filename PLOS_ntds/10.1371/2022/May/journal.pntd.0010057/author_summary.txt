Podoconiosis is a skin Neglected Tropical Disease (skin NTD) that causes swelling of the lower extremities. The disease affects barefooted subsistence farmers in some tropical countries. It is caused by destruction of the lymphatic system in the legs, which is critical for the transportation of body fluids. Podoconiosis is physically disabling with significant psycho-social impact.
In Ethiopia alone more than 1.5 million people are affected by podoconiosis. The past 50 to 60 years generated substantial evidence on the disease distribution, genetic influence, psycho-social impact and clinical management. Yet, systematic information about the various clinical manifestations and histopathologic features of podoconiosis is sparse. We therefore recorded in 289 podoconiosis patients their history, and disease-related findings of the lower extremities. We also took blood and tissue samples for laboratory examination. In summary, this study provides a description of the different clinical manifestations and microscopic tissue findings of various podoconiosis stages from mild to advance. Our observations are a guide to classifying patients with podoconiosis, based on clinical and microscopic tissue definitions. Classification can help in patient management, therapeutic follow-up, prioritisation of resources, epidemiological surveillance and future research to improve the quality of life of patients with podoconiosis.
