Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease of public health concern. The majority of cases occur in tropical rural regions where access to adequate medical interventions is limited. The outcome of these bites may cause a range of manifestations, varying from local lesions to life threatening effects and death. Available estimates of snakebite burden are often based on severe complications such as death and amputations and are limited to health facility-based evaluations. We conducted a community-based study to identify the long-term consequences of snakebite by comparing participants with or without a history of snakebite in two regions in Ghana. A history of snakebite was associated with the chance of having disabilities. Combining community estimates of mild to moderate complications with data on severe complications from the health system level provides a more comprehensive overview of the overall snakebite burden. The incorporation of mental health and rehabilitation interventions into integrated neglected tropical diseases (NTD) programmes can reduce the risk of disabilities and improve the wellbeing of snakebite and other NTD patients.
