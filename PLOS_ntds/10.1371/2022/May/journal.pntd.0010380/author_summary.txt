The elimination of onchocerciasis places high demands on monitoring and evaluation. The current WHOâ€™s guidelines recommend the use of serological test (ELISA) to determine the presence of IgG4 antibodies to the O. volvulus specific antigen Ov16 among children aged <10 years old, thought with low evidence of certainty. In this paper, we explored the relationship between anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies and microfilaridermia counts, and assessed their variation according to age, gender and history of ivermectin intake. Our findings revealed no variation of Mf count and IgG4 with ivermectin intake. However, we observed that anti-Ov16 IgG4 decrease with microfilaridermia counts, but an increasing trend was observed with age. This brings evidence sustaining the use of Ov16 serology testing as exposition marker in children younger than 10 years. However, children age 2 to 4 years seem to have a very low anti-Ov16 IgG4 concentration, this finding should be considered when defining the age class for seroprevalence evaluation.
