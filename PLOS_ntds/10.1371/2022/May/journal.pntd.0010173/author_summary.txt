Yaws, caused by infection with the spirochete, Treponema pallidum pertenue, causes a chronic debilitating condition of skin, cartilage, and bone, and is transmitted during childhood through skin-to-skin contact. Yaws has been targeted for eradication as part of the WHO roadmap for control of neglected tropical diseases, requiring certification of elimination in all endemic and formerly endemic regions. Yaws in Ecuador has been restricted to a geographically isolated focus in a rainforest region of Esmeraldas Province in northern coastal Ecuador. Following a strategy of repeated 5-yearly clinical and serological surveys with mass-treatment and surveillance between surveys, yaws was assumed to have been eliminated by 1998. To provide the evidence base to certify the elimination of transmission in Ecuador, this study presents an analysis of stored sera collected from 4,432 children between 2005 and 2017 from formerly endemic and non-endemic communities. Screening and confirmation of seroreactors was done using two validated rapid tests for T. pallidum. Seroreactivity was observed in 6 samples (0.14%) and was similar in formerly endemic (0.11%) and non-endemic (0.14%) communities, possibly explained by background rates of congenital or venereal syphilis. Only 1 active infection was detected in formerly endemic communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study of yaws from the Americas to evaluate the elimination of transmission. Our data indicate that active yaws transmission is unlikely to be occurring in formerly endemic communities. Additional surveys of young children may be required to confirm interruption of transmission.
