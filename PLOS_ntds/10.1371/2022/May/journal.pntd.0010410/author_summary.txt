Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis affect the nutrition and development of children and pregnant women around the world and are controlled through administration of anthelminthic medication, good personal hygiene practices, and improvement of sanitation. Globally, current infection control programming provides anthelminthic medication to school age children using a school-based delivery platform. Monitoring activities for these programs also focus on school children, but global treatment recommendations also include women of reproductive age as an at-risk population. In order to assess the prevalence among this group and the community as a whole, we conducted a prevalence study of these two diseases among all age groups in Sierra Leone. We found that the STH prevalence in children warrants annual treatment in Kenema district and once every two years in Bo district, and that there is a case to consider targeting women of reproductive age for STH treatment based on the prevalence in both districts. We also found that prevalence of all species of worms was significantly lower among those who with access to toilets compared to those who did not in both districts. This highlights the need to improve sanitation at community and household levels to achieve and maintain control of these diseases.
