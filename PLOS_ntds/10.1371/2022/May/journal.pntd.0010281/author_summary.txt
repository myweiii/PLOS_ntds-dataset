Dengue fever is highly endemic in Vietnam, while scrub typhus is recognized as a re-emerging neglected disease. Both diseases are likely to account for more than half of the acute undifferentiated fever burden in Vietnam. However, scrub typhus is a bacterial disease requiring antimicrobial treatment, while dengue fever—of viral etiology—does not. Misdiagnosis and treatment delays cause potentially severe or fatal complications among scrub typhus patients, even though it is easily treatable. In this study, we used simple clinical and laboratory markers, which were identified upon admission of 221 PCR-confirmed scrub typhus cases and 387 NS1-positive dengue fever patients from Khanh Hoa province to identify the differences between scrub typhus and dengue. We found seven predictors that served to construct a simple clinical decision tree, holding great potential to distinguish scrub typhus from dengue using readily available clinical or laboratory findings. These predictors can strongly support medical staff in identifying scrub typhus cases from dengue, without using sophisticated diagnostic tests, and could improve the quality of diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies at the primary health care level–especially in areas where scrub typhus and dengue fever are co-endemic in Vietnam and many parts of Asia and where diagnostic tests are not readily available.
