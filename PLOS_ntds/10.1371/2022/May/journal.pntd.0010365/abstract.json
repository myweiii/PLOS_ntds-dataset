    "Background": "Characterising dengue virus (DENV) infection history at the point of care is challenging as it relies on intensive laboratory techniques. We investigated how combining different rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be used to accurately determine the primary and post-primary DENV immune status of reporting patients during diagnosis.",
    "Methods and findings": "Serum from cross-sectional surveys of acute suspected dengue patients in Indonesia (N:200) and Vietnam (N: 1,217) were assayed using dengue laboratory assays and RDTs. Using logistic regression modelling, we determined the probability of being DENV NS1, IgM and IgG RDT positive according to corresponding laboratory viremia, IgM and IgG ELISA metrics. Laboratory test thresholds for RDT positivity/negativity were calculated using Youden\u2019s J index and were utilized to estimate the RDT outcomes in patients from the Philippines, where only data for viremia, IgM and IgG were available (N:28,326). Lastly, the probabilities of being primary or post-primary according to every outcome using all RDTs, by day of fever, were calculated. Combining NS1, IgM and IgG RDTs captured 94.6% (52/55) and 95.4% (104/109) of laboratory-confirmed primary and post-primary DENV cases, respectively, during the first 5 days of fever. Laboratory test predicted, and actual, RDT outcomes had high agreement (79.5% (159/200)). Among patients from the Philippines, different combinations of estimated RDT outcomes were indicative of post-primary and primary immune status. Overall, IgG RDT positive results were confirmatory of post-primary infections. In contrast, IgG RDT negative results were suggestive of both primary and post-primary infections on days 1\u20132 of fever, yet were confirmatory of primary infections on days 3\u20135 of fever.",
    "Conclusion": "We demonstrate how the primary and post-primary DENV immune status of reporting patients can be estimated at the point of care by combining NS1, IgM and IgG RDTs and considering the days since symptoms onset. This framework has the potential to strengthen surveillance operations and dengue prognosis, particularly in low resource settings."
