Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease, and a major cause of debilitating skin disease and ocular damage that can lead to irreversible blindness. Annual mass drug administrations (MDA) of ivermectin strongly reduces the load of Onchocerca volvulus microfilaria (mf) in the skin and in the patientsâ€™ eyes. Evolution of onchocerciasis as a disease is prevented by MDA, but recent studies have shown that O. volvulus transmission has not been completely interrupted.
Repeated MDA with ivermectin affects immune responses, such that activated immune defenses may enhance clearance of mf of O. volvulus. Longitudinal surveys are required to determine the impact of ivermectin on the status of immunity, notably in risk zones where parasite transmission and active O. volvulus infections persist. We examined the changes of O. volvulus parasite-specific antibody and cellular immune responsiveness in patients treated annually with ivermectin for 30 years. Treatment prevented patent O. volvulus infections, whilst parasite antigen-specific cytokine and chemokine responses increased but O.volvulus-specific antibody responses declined. Such decreased antibody levels could weaken antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic responses to infective and tissue-dwelling O. volvulus larvae. Strengthened monocyte attracting and activation regulated chemokine responses could enhance effector cell migration and activation against larval stages of O.volvulus, possibly also eliciting resistance to further parasite infections.
