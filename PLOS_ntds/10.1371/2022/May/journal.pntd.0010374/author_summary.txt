L. (V.) braziliensis is widespread in the Peruvian jungle region. In this region, the departments of Cusco and Madre de Dios account for a large number of patients that get infected while working in the virgin forest. For the first time, we described ample genetic diversity among Peruvian L. (V.) braziliensis isolates with new alleles that were not previously reported in South America. In addition, two different genetic clusters or subpopulations of L. (V.) braziliensis in the Amazon Rainforest of Peru were described. This finding reveals the important distribution of parasite populations and suggests a possible colonization event between ecoregions of the highland and lowland Peruvian jungle independently of recent human migration.
