Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T cells with characteristics of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The role of MAIT cells during gut infections is not well known. In this study, we looked at MAIT cells in cholera patients, both in the blood and in tissue biopsies from a special section of the gut called the “duodenum”. We used both microscope-(n = 5, median age 32 years, 1 female) and flow cytometry-(n = 10, median age 31 years, 1 female) based methods to demonstrate the presence of MAIT cells in the gut. We found primarily that MAIT cells in the gut are more activated that those in the blood, and found an association between loss of gut MAIT cells and stool markers of gut inflammation. We also showed that the MAIT cells in the gut have a different fingerprint than those in the blood. In this preliminary report limited by a small sample size, we show the presence of MAIT cells in the gut, and that they are more activated than the ones in the blood during cholera infection.
