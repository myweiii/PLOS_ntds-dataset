Helminth infections are known to modulate the immune system being responsible for protecting the host from developing allergic and autoimmune disorders (Hygiene Hypothesis). We hypothesized that the same immunomodulatory effect could have an impact on immunometabolic diseases, such as obesity and its linked diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Weight disorders have reached epidemic levels, nearly tripling since 1975 and being responsible for almost 5 million premature deaths each year, but have been spared in areas of high helminth prevalence. To test our hypothesis C57BL/6 male mice were fed control or high fat diet, for five weeks, in the presence or not of infection with the worm Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Weight gain, development of metabolic disorders, inflammation and cellular migration to the adipose tissue were evaluated. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the presence of infection prevented the exacerbated weight gain and also improved metabolic parameters in animals fed a high fat diet. This was associated with the infectionâ€™s ability to modulate parameters of a cell responsible for regulatory functions: Tregs. In the light of these findings, helminth infection could be protective against weight gain and metabolic disturbances.
