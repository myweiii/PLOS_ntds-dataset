Rickettsia typhi is an obligately intracellular bacterium which is most commonly transmitted by rat fleas to humans and can cause the disease murine (endemic) typhus wherever both humans and infected rats are present. However, this agent is also present in a variety of other arthropod species associated with other vertebrate animals. Its closest relative is Rickettsia prowazekii, the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus (human louse-borne) and sylvatic typhus (associated with flying squirrels and its ectoparasites in the Eastern United States). Both classic louse-borne and flea-borne typhus rickettsiae can cause fatal infections and have the potential for use as biothreat agents as they can be grown in large quantities. We investigated the genetic differences that can be found in different stocks of R. typhi. Our work is important for two reasons. We have developed robust and sensitive methods for distinguishing isolates of R. typhi originating from different continents; these new assays require only simple instrumentation which is available in nearly all biology laboratories. Our results also provided new insights confirming the probable origin of R. typhi in Asia and its likely cosmopolitan spread by rats on ships around the world.
