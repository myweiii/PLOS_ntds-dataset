    "Background": "Schistosomiasis, an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by human pathogenic Schistosoma species, is a neglected tropical disease affecting more than 220 million people worldwide.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Frozen banked serum samples from patients with confirmed schistosomiasis, patients with other helminth infections, patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and healthy blood donors were used to assess the sensitivity and the specificity of the Schistosoma ICT IgG-IgM rapid diagnostic test.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "With its high sensitivity, the Schistosoma ICT IgG-IgM rapid diagnostic test is a suitable screening test for detection of Schistosoma specific antibodies, including S. mekongi. However, in populations with a high prevalence of co-infection with other tissue invasive helminths, positive results should be confirmed with other diagnostic assays due to the test\u2019s imperfect specificity."
