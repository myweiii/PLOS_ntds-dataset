Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, affecting more than 220 million people worldwide. Stool and urine microscopy are still the recommended diagnostic methods of choice, despite their limited sensitivity. Immunological diagnosis of schistosomiasis is gaining more attention due to higher sensitivity. This study investigated the sensitivity and the specificity of a rapid diagnostic test based on immunochromatography (Schistosoma ICT IgG-IgM, LD Bio, Lyon, France) designed to detect antibodies against Schistosoma specific antigens. We found a sensitivity of 100% in patients with proven schistosomiasis, regardless of species. In healthy blood donors, as well as in patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, we found a specificity of 100%. In patients with other helminth infections, the Schistosoma ICT IgG-IgM showed some cross-reactivity, resulting in a specificity of 85%. In conclusion, the Schistosoma ICT IgG-IgM appears to be a suitable screening tool for Schistosoma specific antibodies. Confirmatory testing should be performed in patients at risk of co-infection with other tissue invasive parasites
