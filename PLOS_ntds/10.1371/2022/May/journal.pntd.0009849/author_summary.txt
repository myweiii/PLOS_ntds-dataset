About 2 million children under the age of 5 suffer from stunted growth in Madagascar. Although deficient diet is the major cause of undernutrition, impaired absorption or assimilation caused by Environmental Enteric dysfunction (EED) has been proposed to play an important role in stunting. EED is widespread among children and adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and is also associated with undernutrition, poor sanitation, certain gut infections resulting in an abnormal gut microbiota and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) although the role of SIBO in EED remains unclear. The current study highlights the presence at high concentrations of bacterial taxa usually found in the oro-pharyngeal sphere in a high number of duodenal fluids of stunted children. This uncommon presence suggests a decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract and a possible pro-inflammatory effect due to the ectopic presence of some of these bacteria in the duodenum.
The study also points to a high prevalence of enteropathogens (especially Shigella spp.) in the feces of both stunted and control children, hence preventing from proposing a direct association with stunting. This suggests that, beside combatting poverty and improving diet, environmental sanitation, quality of water sources, hygiene promotion and health education are key points to mitigate stunting and restore nutritional benefits.
