Brazil is a tropical country with a warm climate and large animal herds that favor many zoonotic agents that circulate in the territory. Due to the high prevalence of some tropical diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya, important zoonoses have been neglected during the clinical evaluation of patients, resulting in misdiagnosis. Examples include Q fever and brucellosis, zoonoses that occur in animals in Brazil and are easily transmitted to humans through contaminated air and food products. There is not much data on these diseases in humans in the country representing their actual health situation. The current knowledge is supported by a few serological surveys developed by research groups and case reports. In this study, sera from patients with fever of unknown origin were positive for Q fever and brucellosis. The authors found that, contrary to brucellosis, Q fever has affected many people in SÃ£o Paulo, the most populous state in the country. In addition, other findings regarding patient profile and disease behavior have been established. This research highlights the need for surveillance and control of Q fever in humans and animals to prevent acute cases and treat chronic patients.
