Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Niger, in West Africa. Niger has an emerging problem with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Whole genome sequencing was used to understand the epidemiology of tuberculosis and genetics of multi-drug resistance among patients from the regions in Niger. In this study, most isolates of M. tuberculosis from this dataset belonged to the L4.6.2.2 sub-lineage and L4.1.3 sub-lineage within the Euro-American lineage. Thirty-four out of 42 (81%) isolates were detected as resistant isolates. Our study highlights the need for epidemiological surveillance and more concerted efforts to ensure that patients are put through treatment.
