The growth, proliferation and survival of Echinococcus multilocularis (Em) metacestode within the intermediate host’s liver depend on the complex regulation of host immune responses. Transcriptomic studies will likely help us to shed light on the possible function of regulatory RNA molecules in modulating the host immune response to benefit the parasite survival. As a newly discovered class of regulatory molecules, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a role in regulating host-pathogen interactions during viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Here, we reported the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the liver of mice after Em infection at different time points. The results of KEGG analysis showed that up-regulated mRNAs at 30 dpi were enriched in Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. Differentially expressed lncRNAs during the whole Em infection period may affect the differentiation of Th17 cells and TGF-β/Smad pathway of the host by regulating SMAD3, STAT1, and early growth response (EGR). These results provide a new dimension to better understand the immunomodulatory effects of Em on the intermediate host’s innate and adaptive immune responses and will aid in the design of new anti-parasitic strategies targeting the host’s non-protein-coding genome.
