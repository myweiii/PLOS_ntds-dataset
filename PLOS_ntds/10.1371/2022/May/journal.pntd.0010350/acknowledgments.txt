We are indebted to all the villages and their leaders for allowing for the study to take place, and to all residents who participated in the study. We would like to express our gratitude to the local staff in Solomon Islands for contributing to fieldwork procedures and data collection. We are especially thankful to Erica Lazu, Salote Wickham, Deanne Seppy, and Sharmillah Jack for their support in completing the STH component of the fieldwork reported here.
