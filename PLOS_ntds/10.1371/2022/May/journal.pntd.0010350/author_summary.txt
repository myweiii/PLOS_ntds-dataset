Routine assessments of the burden of intestinal worm infections rely on microscopy-based diagnostic methods, such as the Kato-Katz technique. However major limitations include its poor sensitivity, requirement for rapid sample processing, and inability to differentiate individual hookworm species and detect Strongyloides spp. infections. It is important to assess the burden of each of these infections to design control approaches beyond the current core strategy of albendazole preventive chemotherapy. Use of qPCR for diagnosis could address these gaps because it can distinguish all relevant intestinal worm species. We completed a province-wide intestinal worm infections prevalence survey using qPCR in Western Province, Solomon Islands. Overall prevalence was extremely high (62.5%). We identified a high burden of Necator americanus (54.5%) and detected Ancylostoma ceylanicum (15.5%), Trichuris trichiura (9.1%), and Strongyloides spp. (3.2%) infections. Increased age and precipitation were associated with higher prevalence of infection, while owning a household latrine was associated with lower odds of N. americanus infection. Our findings support the need to incorporate ivermectin into deworming programmes for Strongyloides spp. and T. trichiura control as these species are poorly responsive to albendazole, implement One Health strategies to address the zoonotic A. ceylanicum and Strongyloides spp., and expand control efforts to reach entire communities. WASH access should also be improved to complement deworming programmes.
