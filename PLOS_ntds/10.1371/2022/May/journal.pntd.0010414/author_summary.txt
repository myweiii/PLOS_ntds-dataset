Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been increasing among some bacterial pathogens in the community settings in Southeast Asia. Community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Data on the casual bacterial pathogens and the antimicrobial resistance patterns is limited in Metro Manila, the Philippines, which is the most densely populated area in the world and highly endemic for dengue. We performed a 4-year prospective study in one tertiary hospital in Metro Manila. Community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections were confirmed in 77 (5.9%) of 1315 clinically suspected patients. Staphylococcus. aureus, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA), Salmonella enterica Typhi, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis and leptospirosis were common pathogens. B. pseudomallei was an additional important pathogen observed. Although antimicrobial-susceptibility was well preserved in S. enterica Typhi, the emergence of a highly virulent type of MRSA was observed among some patients. The USA1100 clone was the dominant sequence type of MRSA isolates. Our findings may help to inform physicians in selecting empirical antimicrobial treatment among patients with severe febrile illness.
