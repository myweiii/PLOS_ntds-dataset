The diagnosis of schistosome infection in non-human hosts is important for control and elimination of human schistosomiasis. This study aimed to summarize effectiveness of available diagnostic techniques through a systematic review of the literature and reports comparing two or more diagnostic tests in non-human animals. Overall, 4,909 articles and reports were screened. Nineteen articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed in greater detail. A total of 14 techniques (parasitologic, immunologic, and molecular) and nine types of non-human animals were involved in the studies. Four studies comparing parasitologic tests (miracidium hatching test (MHT), Kato-Katz (KK), the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique (DBL), and formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD)) with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were included in the meta-analyses. The findings suggest that the parasitologic technique FEA-SD and molecular techniques, especially qPCR, are the most promising techniques. However, further validation and standardization of the techniques under field conditions are needed.
