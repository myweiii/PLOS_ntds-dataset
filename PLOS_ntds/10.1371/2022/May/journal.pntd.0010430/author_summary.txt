Leptospirosis is a neglected tropical disease poorly characterized in Latin American countries like Ecuador. Although this zoonotic disease is considered by the Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Public Health to be of mandatory notification, an updated document on the patterns of morbidity and mortality or a control strategy do not yet exist. In the present study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of Ecuadorian national data (INEC) on hospitalized cases and deaths from 2000 through 2020 to estimate the trends of morbidity and mortality, and the spatial distribution of this disease throughout its four geoclimatic regions (Pacific coastal, Andes, Amazon, and the Galapagos Islands). The INEC recorded only hospitalized cases, meaning those with severe illness. The spatial distribution was estimated at the ecoregion, province, and canton levels. With a total number of 2,584 hospitalizations, an annual incidence ranging from 0.27 to 2.45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and a fatality rate of 3.06% during the period of study. Our findings evidence the endemicity of leptospirosis, particularly within the neglected tropical settings in the Ecuadorian Coast and Amazon regions. Despite the wide geographic distribution of leptospirosis and its severity in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality, leptospirosis is not yet considered a “tool-ready” disease for control/elimination and research initiatives.
