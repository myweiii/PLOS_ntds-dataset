Snakebite envenoming occurs after contact between two vertebrates, which makes it similar to some transmissible diseases. Based on such similarity, we used estimates of snakebite incidence, snake abundance and biology, and surrogates of human occupational risks to derive a mathematical expression that represents snakebite envenoming as human-snake contacts. Our model explained risk variability very well. We found that snake and human abundance explain incidence estimates and that agriculture-linked occupations tend to have more frequent contacts with snakes; and that snake abundance decreases with increasing human population. Because snake abundance estimates and contact rates are based on climate or land cover, we identify a pathway for land use change, global warming and population growth to affect the epidemiology of snakebites.
