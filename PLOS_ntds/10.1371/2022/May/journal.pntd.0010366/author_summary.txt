The birth of microcephaly infants due to ZIKV infection in pregnant women is related to ZIKV persistent infection. However, it is unclear how ZIKV maintains its persistent infection. In this work, we observed the delayed appearance of ZIKV NS4A protein in neuroglia including microglia and astrocytes compared with other non-structural proteins. Subsequently, we revealed that ZIKV NS4A inhibited viral RNA replication by activating the ISGF3 signaling pathway and inducing the production of ISGs. Aborting NS4A protein expression totally rescued ZIKV viral replication. Our study, combined with the previous findings, suggests that viral non-structural proteins may regulate viral replication, thus perpetuating ZIKV infection. Our hypothesis provides a mechanism for ZIKV to maintain its status of a persistent infection during viral infection in fetus, which can shed lights on our further understanding of viral neuropathogenesis in ZIKV infection.
