We conducted a study of household behaviour in rural Oromia, Ethiopia. The study aimed to document facial hygiene practices and any seasonal variation in practices that could be relevant for trachoma control. We observed 61 household members in 9 households with one or more child aged 1â€“9 years-of-age over two days in three seasons in 2018: the dry season (January), the rainy season (July) and during the harvest period (October). Householders washed their faces more frequently and more often with soap during the dry season than at other times of year. Seasonal differences in behaviour should be considered in the design of interventions to increase face washing with soap in this setting. However as household water availability was limited in all seasons (3.1 to 4.2 litres), genuine water scarcity in this area is likely to limit the impact of face washing interventions for trachoma control in the absence of water supply interventions.
