We present here a study showing the exceptional nature of the incidence of Q fever in French Guiana. Indeed, this zoonosis due to the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, is a real public health problem in French Guiana, a French ultra-marine territory located in the North East of South America. The study found an endemic state with a stable incidence between 2010 and 2017 around 25–30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. More than 90% of cases are concentrated in the territory’s capital, Cayenne, and its surroundings. The risk factors for Q fever are being male, being between 30 and 59 years old, which are risk factors found elsewhere, but also living in Cayenne and its surroundings and being born in mainland France or Europe.
