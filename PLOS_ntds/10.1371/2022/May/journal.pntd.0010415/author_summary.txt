A challenge for eliminating Plasmodium vivax is its relapsing nature that can contribute up to 80% of the P. vivax cases. The detection of this source of transmission remains crucial for focused interventions in settings attempting to achieve elimination. Antibody responses to serological exposure markers to P. vivax have been validated to detect recent exposure and likely hypnozoite carriers in low transmission settings. To evaluate the benefits of adding serology to the detection of infection in areas where malaria transmission is rapidly reduced, we measured the prevalence of P. vivax by qPCR and serology in two sites of the Peruvian Amazon. This study shows that antibody responses to P. vivax antigens can detect more recently exposed people than molecular testing, providing more statistical power for surveillance and critical additional epidemiological knowledge for regions attempting to eliminate malaria transmission.
