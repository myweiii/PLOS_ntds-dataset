Burkholderia pseudomallei causes the life-threatening disease melioidosis and is considered a biological threat and select agent by the United States government. This soil-dwelling bacterium is commonly found in regions of southeast Asia and northern Australia, but it is also detected in other tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world. With a predicted global burden of 165,000 annual cases and mortality rate that can exceed 40% without prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment, understanding the epidemiology of melioidosis and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in B. pseudomallei can benefit public health and safety. Recently, we identified ten conserved genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in B. pseudomallei. Here, we examined B. pseudomallei PBP sequences for amino acid mutations that may contribute to Î²-lactam resistance. We also uncovered nucleotide mutations with utility to predict the geographical origin of B. pseudomallei strains and to differentiate closely related Burkholderia species. Based on 11 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes each encoding a PBP-3, we developed a simple, targeted dual-locus typing approach.
