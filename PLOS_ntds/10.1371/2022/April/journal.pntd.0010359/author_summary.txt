Zika virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause severe birth defects such as microcephaly when the infection occurs during pregnancy. Understanding how Zika virus crosses the placenta during pregnancy is important for future prevention strategies for vertical Zika virus transmission. Despite significant efforts to study this, to date it remains incompletely understood how Zika virus can cross the placenta and which risk factors contribute to this form of transmission. In this study we use an ex vivo placental perfusion model to study transplacental Zika virus transmission. The ex vivo placental perfusion model is a highly physiological and animal friendly model that mimics the in vivo conditions during pregnancy. We found that antibodies against the closely related dengue virus can significantly enhance placental uptake of Zika virus and Zika virus infection of human placental explants and fetal macrophages. These findings indicate that presence of cross-reactive dengue virus antibodies could contribute to transplacental Zika virus transmission.
