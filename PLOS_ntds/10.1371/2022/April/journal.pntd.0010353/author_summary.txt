Periodic follow-up surveys for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are an important aspect of large-scale neglected tropical diseases (NTD) programs. They are critical to measure progress and determine whether continuing or scaling down interventions is justified. In absence of better alternatives, imperfect diagnostic tests are often deployed in these surveys. Yet, little is known how this affects the population-based program decision-making. We expanded an existing survey design framework that allows for imperfect diagnostic tests and applied it to M&E of intestinal worms. It is a synonymous of soil-transmitted helminths control programs as a case study. In addition, we assessed the trade-off between cost per test, sample throughput and diagnostic performance of tests. We demonstrated that the current M&E guidelines may lead to incorrect program decisions, even when perfect diagnostic methods are deployed. To reduce the risk of incorrect decisions, including more disease-clusters and deploying highly specific diagnostic methods revealed to be the most cost-saving strategies. On the other hand, the higher cost and lower throughput of improved diagnostic tests can be compensated by lower required sample sizes. In conclusion, our framework can contribute to developing more evidence-based guidelines and choices in diagnostic product development for M&E of NTD control programs.
