The recent strategies to control the morbidity caused by intestinal worms have mainly been focusing on large scale deworming programs during which drugs are administered to at-risk populations. Although these large-scale deworming programs have been successful in reducing the disease burden, re-infection in the absence of other intervention measures is unavoidable. Although there is a consensus on how infections with intestinal worms are transmitted, it remains unclear where hot spots of infectious life stages can be found in endemic communities, which in turn impedes both the design and the validation of interventions that prevent (re-)infection. We optimized a laboratory method to detect life stages in soil samples and applied this method to examine soil contamination at school compounds, households and open markets in Jimma Town (Ethiopia). Finally, we assessed the household characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards intestinal worms among school children. Generally, our results indicated (i) a moderate performance of our laboratory method, (ii) the ubiquitous presence of life stages in the environment, (iii) a poor level of sanitary facilities at both the schools and the households and (iv) a poor level of knowledge, attitude and practices towards intestinal worms.
