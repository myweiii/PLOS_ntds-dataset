Cattle are of economic importance in sub-Saharan Africa as they fulfil multiple roles, ranging from draught power, to providing manure, milk, and meat. However, Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) diseases in cattle affect productivity and food security in most African countries. In Ghana, bovine trypanosomiasis has been detected in few cross-sectional studies by molecular methods. To get a better understanding of the disease, a longitudinal study showing natural trypanosome infection over the life of cattle will be applicable. To explore this issue, the study determined the nature of trypanosome infection in cattle in farm settings in Ghana over two years, a period similar to that used in beef production, by massively parallel amplicon sequencing. The study provided a description of the prevalence over two years and showed that the cattle were infected with multiply species most of the time and the level of infection varied but was low most of the time. The longitudinal study allowed the identification of one individual able to supress infection far more effectively than other members of the herd and this is crucial in implementing control measures in the infected area.
