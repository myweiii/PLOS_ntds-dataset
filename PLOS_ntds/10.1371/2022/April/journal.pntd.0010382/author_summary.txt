According to WHO, more than 290.8 million people required preventive treatment against schistosomiasis in 2018. The pathology caused by the tissue-embolized eggs laid by adult worms is associated with symptoms such as anemia, tissue injuries, and severe fibrosis. Despite efforts to control this disease, it remains a public health problem in many tropical countries. One of the main challenges for managing this disease is to set up an efficient treatment at the early stage of the infection. Unfortunately, there is no appropriate therapeutic regimen for this purpose to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we propose an efficient praziquantel-based regimen that prevents the installation of the pathology in a mouse model of schistosomiasis. We found that praziquantel administration at the early stage of the infection prevents Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice from liver and intestine injuries, anemia, chronic inflammation, and severe fibrosis by reducing parasitic burden. Firstly, this study offers a reference treatment for further experimental investigations. Secondly, it could be a starting point for developing new protocols for preventive chemotherapy in endemic areas.
