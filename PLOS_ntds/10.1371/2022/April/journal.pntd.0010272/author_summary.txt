The ambitious target to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem has led to impressive strides in reducing the disease burden worldwide, with the implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement (SAFE) strategy. However, some areas have struggled to reach the elimination threshold after the prescribed number of antibiotic mass drug administration rounds, and some areas have had evidence of trachoma recrudescence after previously having reached the elimination threshold. This systematic review assessed climatic, demographic, environmental, infrastructural, and socioeconomic factors associated with trachoma to reveal which covariates are associated with ongoing or renewed trachoma transmission. We also explored how geospatial analysis, which could help identify areas with ongoing trachoma transmission or heightened risk of recrudescence, has been used in previous trachoma studies. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Results indicated that researchers and decision-makers should consider the inclusion and potential influence of precipitation, temperature, and altitude along with variables related to ruralness, accessibility, access to medical services and schools, and community-level water and sanitation coverage, as part of both research activities and programmatic priorities for trachoma elimination.
