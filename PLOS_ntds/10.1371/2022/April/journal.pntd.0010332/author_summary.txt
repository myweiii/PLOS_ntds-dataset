Control of schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm infection affecting more than 200 million people worldwide, relies mainly on mass drug administration of praziquantel to school-age children as well as adults in areas where the disease is particularly rampant. The World Health Organization has set thresholds of observed prevalence that require intervention to reach the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2025. Intervention thresholds are defined based on parasitologic methods, which is urine filtration for Schistosoma haematobium. There are alternative diagnostic methods to detect S. haematobium, such as the detection of blood in urine that is a common symptom of urogenital schistosomiasis. We determined the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a reagent strip to detect microhematuria using data from two villages in Tanzania at multiple time points (once before and several times after treatment with the deworming drug praziquantel) and translate the urine filtration intervention thresholds to reagent strip equivalents. We show that the reagent strip including trace results is almost perfectly sensitive for infections above 15 eggs of S. haematobium per 10 ml of urine and that a 10% observed prevalence by urine filtration corresponds to 17.6% observed prevalence by reagent strip including traces.
