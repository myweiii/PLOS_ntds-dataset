Prevalence of S. stercoralis is under-reported in many resource-poor countries including Ethiopia. We carried out a school-based cross-sectional study among 844 schoolchildren across highlands, semi-highlands and lowland areas of Amhara Region. We used an approach made of five diagnostic methods, namely, FECT, STST, BCT, APC, and RT-PCR. The total prevalence of S. stercoralis was 39.0%. The highest S. stercoralis prevalence (41.8%) was observed in the semi-highland areas of the region. Strongyloidiasis was significantly higher among 12â€“14 years age groups, males, and rural dweller children. Clinical symptoms such as presence of abdominal pain, cough, skin rash and malnourishment were significantly associated with strongyloidiasis. We recommend that preventive strategies against strongyloidiasis in Amhara Region should be implemented.
