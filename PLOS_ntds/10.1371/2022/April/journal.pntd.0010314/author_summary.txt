Mosquito-borne viruses contribute significantly to the global burden of diseases. Understanding infection rates in human populations is important for informing management of disease burden and public health policy. Serosurveys measure population exposure and immunity after arbovirus infections. We systematically reviewed serosurveys conducted for dengue virus (DENV), Ross River virus (RRV), and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) in Australia and the PICTs. We identified 41 studies reporting 78 serosurveys published between 1966 and 2020. For DENV we found the highest seroprevalence, greater than 95.0%, was reported in American Samoa. For RRV we found early evidence (1960â€“1969) of circulation outside Australia. There were three studies of BFV reporting 16 serosurveys within Australia and reporting low seroprevalence (<13%). Researchers used different serological methods so study comparisons must be nuanced.
