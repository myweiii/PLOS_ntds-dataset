In Mauritania, various mosquito-borne viruses responsible for devastating diseases in livestock and/or humans occur, threatening both human and animal health. One of these viruses is the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), which is widespread throughout the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The first outbreak in Mauritania occurred in 1987, and epidemics have recurred since then. However, little is known about the maintenance of RVFV during inter-epidemic periods, in the absence of reported outbreaks, and although there is evidence of an active circulation of the virus during these times, only limited data are available on the abundance of RVFV and its vectors in Mauritania. Therefore, this study aimed to collect and examine mosquitoes in different areas where outbreaks have already occurred. Additionally, blood of collected blood-fed mosquitoes was analyzed to identify feeding patterns and thus wildlife potentially acting as RVFV reservoir hosts. Furthermore, the collected mosquitoes were analyzed for the presence of other neglected viruses in order to participate in an elucidation of the circulation of different viruses within the mosquito population in Mauritania and to be able to better prevent disease outbreaks.
