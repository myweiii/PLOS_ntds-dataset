Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease and the most common rickettsial disease in the regions including Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and South America. Taiwan is located at the center of the endemic area of scrub typhus, and surveillance of scrub typhus and monitoring of genetic sequences of O. tsutsugamushi are important for disease control and prevention. In this study, we present the results of laboratory-based scrub typhus surveillance in Taiwan during 2006â€“2016. A total of 4,857 laboratory-confirmed scrub typhus cases were identified. Most of the cases occurred on offshore islands and in eastern Taiwan, including Penghu Island (778 cases, 16.0%), Kinmen Island (716 cases, 14.7%), Taitung County (628 cases, 12.9%) and Hualien County (508 cases, 10.5%). Phylogenetic analyses of the 56-kDa type-specific antigen gene sequence of 545 O. tsutsugamushi strains isolated from scrub typhus patients were conducted. Most isolates belonged to the Karp (49.9%; 272/545) genotype, followed by the TW-22 (17.8%; 97/454) sequence type and Kawasaki (14.7%; 80/545) genotype. Most strains were closely related to strains from Southeast and East Asia, whereas unique isolates were also found in Taiwan.
