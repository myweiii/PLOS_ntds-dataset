    "Background and objectives": "This study reports knowledge of residents of Alabameta community, Osun State, Nigeria on the bioecology and socio-economic burden of black flies and onchocerciasis.",
    "Methods": "Using structured questionnaires and Focus Group Discussion (FGD), a total of 150 community respondents participated in the study.",
    "Results": "The knowledge of the residents on the existence of black flies in the community was significant (p<0.05) as all the 150 respondents confirmed the presence of black flies with the local name ‘Amukuru’ i.e causing itching. However, their lack of knowledge of the flies breeding site (104) (69%), prevention (134) (89%), cause (132) (88%), and treatment (133) (89%) of onchocerciasis was profound. Majority 147(98%) of the respondents reported that flies bite more in the wet season as against dry season 3(2%) and have a higher affinity (124) (82%) for biting the leg than any other part of the body. A larger percentage (89%) of the respondents are unaware of any medication for the treatment of onchocerciasis while 11% are aware. There had been no sensitization on onchocerciasis according to 89% of the respondents.",
    "Conclusion": "Due to lack of resident’s knowledge on black flies bioecology which may continuously expose them to the bite of the flies and ultimately infection, it is paramount that the Osun State government and the NTD implementing partner map out new public health education strategies during routine Mass Administration of Medicines with Ivermectin with a view to preventing onchocerciasis infection as well as man-vector contact."
