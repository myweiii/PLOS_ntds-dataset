Urogenital schistosomiasis caused by S. haematobium has been highly endemic in Lindi-Tanzania for more than three decades. Due to the burden of the disease, preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel was put in place to control the infection. However, this intervention has focused merely on school-aged children, excluding preschool-age children, despite the evidence of early exposure to the infested water. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the current burden and the risk factors of urogenital schistosomiasis among the under-fives of Mtama district, Lindi region. The prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in under-fives was 16.9% with approximately a quarter (24.6%) being heavily infected. The factors responsible for the ongoing transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis in under-fives were the parental/guardians’ inadequate knowledge (31.1%), coupled with negative attitudes (40.5%), and inappropriate practices (34.3%) regarding the disease transmission, treatment, and prevention. Also, inadequate supply of safe water and sanitation facilities, unhygienic practices, and intense parental/guardian water contact activities. The parents/guardians’ practices of visiting the water bodies, especially the river, with the under-fives were significantly associated with the early acquisition of the disease. Hence, there is a need for regular monitoring of under-fives, provision of health education to parents/guardians, and adequate provision of safe water.
