Dengue, a mosquito transmitted febrile viral disease, is a serious public health concern in Bangladesh. Despite soaring occurrence of the disease and associated deaths reported over the years, there are not adequate studies demonstrating the effect of the socio-demographic and clinical parameters on the clinical course of the disease. Hence, the objective of this study is to correlate these factors with the disease severity and recovery of the in-patients during the 2019 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. We reached the medical records of 336 confirmed hospitalized dengue patients of a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka city and gathered their socio-demographic and clinical information. Majority of the dengue patients were male, urban resident, 18â€“40 years of age and the number of symptoms had a positive correlation with age. Patients with lower platelet count and blood pressure stayed longer in the hospital. Male patients as well as patients with delayed hospitalization also had a longer recovery period. Finally, we constructed a statistical model that predicted that hospital stay could be positively associated with an increasing trend of temperature, systolic blood pressure and reduced platelets count. Information from this study may be beneficial to better understand the clinical course of dengue, identify the potential risk factors and ensure improved patient management during future dengue outbreaks.
