Tsetse flies feed exclusively on vertebrate blood. This nutrient source contains large quantities of heme, which can be toxic to the fly’s associated microorganisms. We investigated the genetic mechanisms that underlie the ability of the bacterial endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius (Sgm), to successfully reside within tsetse’s heme-rich midgut. Exposure of cultured Sgm to high levels of heme induced changes in the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in transcription, replication and repair of DNA, inorganic ion transport, and carbohydrate transport and metabolism processes. Changes in the expression of several of these same Sgm genes also occurred within tsetse’s midgut following exposure to a blood meal. Sgm genetically engineered to present mutations in several of these heme regulated genes were unable to successfully colonize tsetse’s gut. Our results provide insight into how bacteria that live in the gut of blood feeding arthropods mitigate the toxic effects of excessive heme. This information is of epidemiological relevance, as many of these bacteria influence their host’s ability to transmit disease pathogens that cause disease in humans and domesticated animals.
