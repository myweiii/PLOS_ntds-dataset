    "Abstract": "Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) feed exclusively on vertebrate blood. After a blood meal, the enteric endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius is exposed to various environmental stressors including high levels of heme. To investigate how S. glossinidius morsitans (Sgm), the Sodalis subspecies that resides within the gut of G. morsitans, tolerates the heme-induced oxidative environment of tsetse\u2019s midgut, we used RNAseq to identify bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in cells cultured in high versus lower heme environments. Our analysis identified 436 genes that were significantly differentially expressed (> or < 2-fold) in the presence of high heme [219 heme-induced genes (HIGs) and 217 heme-repressed genes (HRGs)]. HIGs were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to regulation of a variety of biological functions, including gene expression and metabolic processes. We observed that 11 out of 13 Sgm genes that were heme regulated in vitro were similarly regulated in bacteria that resided within tsetse\u2019s midgut 24 hr (high heme environment) and 96 hr (low heme environment) after the flies had consumed a blood meal. We used intron mutagenesis to make insertion mutations in 12 Sgm HIGs and observed no significant change in growth in vitro in any of the mutant strains in high versus low heme conditions. However, Sgm strains that carried mutations in genes encoding a putative undefined phosphotransferase sugar (PTS) system component (SG2427), fucose transporter (SG0182), bacterioferritin (SG2280), and a DNA-binding protein (SGP1-0002), presented growth and/or survival defects in tsetse midguts as compared to normal Sgm. These findings suggest that the uptake up of sugars and storage of iron represent strategies that Sgm employs to successfully reside within the high heme environment of its tsetse host\u2019s midgut. Our results are of epidemiological relevance, as many hematophagous arthropods house gut-associated bacteria that mediate their host\u2019s competency as a vector of disease-causing pathogens."
