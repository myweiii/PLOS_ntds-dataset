What proportion of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is severe is currently not known. Because this proportion influences treatment needs, we aimed to estimate this in a cohort of 416 patients in French Guiana. We used the definition in the recent PAHO/WHO guidelines for severity. In a territory where treatment cost is not a limiting factor and where histoplasmosis awareness is high, we assumed that cliniciansâ€™ initial treatment reflected their perception of severity and therefore, the needs for different treatments. Using these definitions, since the beginning, there were 274 (65.9%) severe/moderately severe cases and 142 (34.1%) mild cases. In practice 186 cases were treated with deoxycholate or liposomal amphotericin B (44.7%) and 230 (55.3%) cases treated with itraconazole as first line treatment. The Kappa concordance measure between guidelines and treatment was 0.22. There was a 9% risk difference for death within 30 days of antifungal treatment initiation between severe/moderately severe and mild cases. Over threequarters (77%) of early deaths were attributed to severe/moderately severe cases. This is the only rigorous estimate of the proportion of severe/moderately severe cases of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in symptomatic HIV patients on the largest published cohort. These numbers may help defend budget needs for rapid diagnostic tests and liposomal amphotericin B.
