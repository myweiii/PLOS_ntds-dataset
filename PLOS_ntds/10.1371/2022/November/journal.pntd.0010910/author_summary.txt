The incidence of dengue, a serious mosquito-borne disease, has escalated globally in recent decades. Prevention is critical for reducing the incidence of dengue, and one way of doing so is by controlling the vector population. Singapore has been piloting the use of field releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes mosquitoes to suppress the vector Aedes mosquito population (Project Wolbachia–Singapore), but the public’s perception and social impact of this community-based method is not well understood. To address this gap, this study sought to identify and explain the drivers and outcomes of the public’s perceptions towards Project Wolbachia–Singapore. Findings reveal that different combinations of individual characteristics predict for receptivity towards Project Wolbachia–Singapore, hesitancy towards Project Wolbachia–Singapore, and the tendency to behave reactively to the release of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes mosquitoes. These findings also suggest ways of increasing receptivity and reducing hesitancy towards such community-based prevention efforts, which can in turn help to ensure the success of such projects.
