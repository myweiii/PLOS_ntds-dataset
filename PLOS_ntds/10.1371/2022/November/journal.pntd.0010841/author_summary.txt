Knowledge about management of snakebite envenoming and the availability of effective antivenom against the relevant venomous snake species are a “sine qua non” for a favorable outcome. There is no published literature addressing snakebite incidence and knowledge of health care workers in management of snakebite patients in Malawi. The present study investigated the number of snakebite cases managed at health facilities in Neno District in Southern Malawi between 2018 and 2021 and evaluated knowledge of health care workers about management of snakebite envenoming and the local snake fauna. Although the majority of interviewees considered snakebite a major problem, their knowledge in management of snakebite cases was not sufficient. Incidence of healthcare encounters due to snakebites in Neno District was calculated at 36 per 100,000 population. This is most likely a significant underestimation as treatment of victims by traditional healers in their village seems to be common. The study shows that further training of health care workers and more data on the epidemiology and clinical consequences of snakebites in Malawi are urgently needed.
