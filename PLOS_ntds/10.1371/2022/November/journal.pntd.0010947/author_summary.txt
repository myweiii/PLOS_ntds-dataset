Cryptosporidiosis is a major infectious diarrheal disease and death in children in developing countries. Cryptosporidium parvum can cause severe watery diarrhea in infants and immunocompromised individuals. As a result, finding new anti-Cryptosporidium medications is a priority. In order to find anti-Cryptosporidium compounds, we screened a natural product library containing Traditional Chinese Medicines. We performed a Cryptosporidium growth inhibition assay (GIA), and a cytotoxicity assay to reveal the anti-Cryptosporidium ability and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of the natural products. A host cell viability assay and an in vivo experiment were used to determine the compounds toxicity to host cells. Four natural compounds (alisol-A, alisol-B, atropine sulfate, and bufotalin) showed strong anti-Cryptosporidium effects and low cytotoxicity (cell viability > 95%) using C. parvum HNJ-1 strain. Furthermore, atropine sulfate (200 mg/kg) and bufotalin (0.1 mg/kg) reduced oocyst shedding by 67.8% and 78.1%, respectively. The current study discovered that atropine sulfate and bufotalin had inhibitory effects against C. parvum infection in vitro and in vivo, which had never been previously described. As a result, the chemotherapeutic potential of these compounds are discussed for future anti-Cryptosporidium drugs to treat Cryptosporidiosis.
