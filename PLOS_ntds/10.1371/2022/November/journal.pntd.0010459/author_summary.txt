Scrub typhus is a severely neglected and potentially fatal disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, a genetically intractable, obligately intracellular bacterium that annually infects at least one million people worldwide. There is no vaccine available, and our current understanding of the host immunological response and mechanisms remains very limited. Appropriate animal models of infection that recapitulate the disease are essential to the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. In this study, we characterized the immunologic responses by transcriptomics and Bio-plex assays in outbred CD-1 mice with lethal O. tsutsugamushi infection. We found that CD-1 mice were highly susceptible to infection and that the high mortality correlated with a Th1/CD8-skewed, but Th2 repressed, immune profile during the acute phase of disease. This proinflammatory state was further confirmed by elevated cytokine and chemokine levels in the sera. Collectively, this study established CD-1 mice as a practical, preclinical model to define pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe scrub typhus and for future immunologic and translational studies during O. tsutsugamushi infection.
