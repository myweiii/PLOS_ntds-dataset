In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, it was estimated that annually there were 242,648 snakebite victims in ASEAN of which 15,909 victims were dead. Despite domestic production of antivenoms in ASEAN countries, not all victims with snakebite envenomings indicated for antivenom received the appropriate or adequate effective dose of antivenom due to insufficient supply and inadequate access to antivenoms. Especially in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, where 4â€“64% of victims who needed antivenoms were treated with antivenoms. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to project the potential economic and clinical impact of improving access to antivenoms when all victims with snakebite envenomings in the five most impacted ASEAN countries were hypothetically treated with geographically appropriate antivenoms. Improving access to snake antivenom to the full level of access compared to the current level in the five ASEAN countries resulted in a total of 9,362 deaths averted (-59%), 230,075 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted (-59%), and cost savings of 1.3 billion USD (-53%). Our study demonstrated improving access to snake antivenom from the current to the full level of access in ASEAN countries is a cost-saving strategy. Our findings emphasized the importance of further strengthening regional cooperation, investment, and funding to improve the situation of snakebite victims in ASEAN countries to reach the ultimate goal where all victims with snakebite envenoming needing antivenom adequately received the geographically appropriate antivenoms.
