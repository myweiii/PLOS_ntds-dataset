Bovine tuberculosis affects many mammals worldwide, including the African buffalo. Within the African buffalo population in Kruger National Park, South Africa, bovine tuberculosis is endemic, thus buffalo within this area are regularly infected and act as a reservoir for infection of other wildlife, livestock, and humans in the area. Due to the risk to humans and other mammals, bovine tuberculosis is considered a disease of global importance; cattle are used to model the disease progression in humans. This study seeks to compare the progression of bovine tuberculosis in free-ranging buffalo to the progression in experimental cattle models. Free-ranging buffalo encounter more variables than experimental cattle, including variations in feed, co-morbidities, and birthrate, similar to humans. Overall, the progression of disease, both grossly and microscopically, in African buffalo mirrors the progression in cattle models despite the increase in variables, providing support that free-ranging models can be used for disease progression studies, with the added benefit of representing the variation in lifestyles present outside of controlled studies. Lastly, we looked at the genetic basis of disease within the herd and found a genetic marker that marginally correlated to disease progression, indicating a need for further work understanding the genetic basis of bovine tuberculosis.
