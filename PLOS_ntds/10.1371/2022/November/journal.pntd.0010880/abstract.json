    "Background": "The first documented human leptospirosis cases in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) occurred following 2017 Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We conducted a representative serosurvey in USVI to estimate the seroprevalence and distribution of human leptospirosis and evaluate local risk factors associated with seropositivity.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used and consisted of three island strata and random selection of census blocks and then households. All eligible members of selected households were invited to participate (≥5 years old, resided in USVI ≥6 months and ≥6 months/year). Household and individual-level questionnaires were completed, and serum collected from each enrolled individual. Microscopic agglutination test serology was conducted, and bivariate and logistic regression analyses completed to identify risk factors for seropositivity.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Leptospirosis seropositivity of 4% across USVI demonstrates an important human disease that was previously unrecognized and emphasizes the importance of continued leptospirosis surveillance and investigation. Local risk factors identified may help guide future human and animal leptospirosis studies in USVI, strengthen leptospirosis public health surveillance and treatment timeliness, and inform targeted education, prevention, and control efforts."
