We established that in 2019, four percent of the population in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) had evidence of previous exposure to Leptospira bacteria. There were no human cases of leptospirosis documented in USVI before the 2017 hurricanes, however due to the prevalence of the disease in other Caribbean localities, the post-hurricane cases, and the evidence of exposure demonstrated in this investigation, it is likely that leptospirosis has been a previously unrecognized problem in the territory. We demonstrated that contact with rodents or their body fluids or seeing rodents/evidence of rodents, contact with cows, increasing age, and not being part or full Caucasian/White race are independently associated with previous exposure to Leptospira spp. in USVI. These findings highlight the importance of continuing leptospirosis surveillance in USVI, considering leptospirosis as a diagnosis in patients with acute febrile illness and/or compatible exposures, and further investigating the epidemiology, ecology, and clinical features of leptospirosis in USVI. Our investigation also supports the need to investigate leptospirosis, and consider it a potential diagnosis, in locations with environmental conditions the bacteria favor (tropical and subtropical areas), even if leptospirosis has not been previously documented in those areas, and especially if it has not been previously investigated.
