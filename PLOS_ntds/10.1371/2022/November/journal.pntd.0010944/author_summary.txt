Chagas disease is a neglected infection that occurs mainly in Latin American countries. Infection occurs in several ways, the most common being vector infection by kissing bugs (family Triatominae). The disease progresses in two phases: acute and chronic. Since there is no reliable test that could serve as a gold standard, WHO recommends the parallel use of two tests. Conflicting results lead to an inconclusive diagnosis. In these cases, a confirmatory test is required, such as a Western blot (WB). However, few confirmatory tests based on the WB method are commercially available worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of four chimeric T. cruzi proteins (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3, and IBMP-8.4) developed by our group to distinguish T. cruzi positive and negative samples. Forty T. cruzi-positive samples, 24-negative, and three additional positive samples for visceral leishmaniasis were evaluated. All IBMP antigens achieved 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, with the exception of IBMP-8.3, which had 100% specificity, but lower sensitivity (95%) and accuracy (96.9%). No cross-reactivity was observed in positive samples for leishmaniasis. The present phase I (proof-of-concept) study demonstrated the high diagnostic potential of these four IBMP antigens to discriminate between T. cruzi-positive and -negative samples, making them candidates for phase II and confirmatory testing with WB.
