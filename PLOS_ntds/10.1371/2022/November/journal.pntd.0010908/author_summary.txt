Buruli ulcer is one of the ten skin neglected tropical diseases, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, and has been reported in over 33 countries worldwide, with Africa bearing about 98% of the disease burden. Prior to antibiotic treatment, the World Health Organization has set a target of at least 70% polymerase chain reaction confirmation rate as target for countries to achieve, yet instead of attaining this target, the confirmation rate has been on a decline in most of these African countries. Procedure ambiguity and low external quality assessment participation were identified as some of the reasons for this drawback. It is against this background that the WHO brought together the efforts of 11 laboratories to form a network termed the “BU-LABNET” in 2019. This manuscript describes the steps taken to harmonize these ambiguous procedures and the provision of reagents to the network laboratories. It also presents the implementation of the new EQA scheme, which is coordinated by one of the African country’s laboratories. The results obtained so far by implementing this strategy is positive and we look forward to extending to other skin NTDs.
