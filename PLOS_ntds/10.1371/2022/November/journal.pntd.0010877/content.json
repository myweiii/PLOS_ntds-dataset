    "Introduction": "Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue viruses 1\u20134 which are endemic in more than 125 countries throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions [1,2]. Due to international travel, urbanisation and climate change, global incidence has increased rapidly during the last 50 years [3]. Half the world\u2019s population are at risk of dengue, with 100\u2013400 million infections occurring annually [1,4]. Timor-Leste is an island nation in Southeast Asia where dengue causes seasonal outbreaks across all 13 municipalities and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children [5].\nThe live attenuated tetravalent CYD-TDV vaccine (Dengvaxia) is licensed in several dengue-endemic countries for individuals 9\u201345 years of age. In 2017, long-term safety data showed a 1.75-fold increased risk of hospitalisation due to dengue and severe dengue among seronegative participants who received vaccination (compared with those who were seronegative but unvaccinated) [6]. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore recommends vaccination after individuals are screened for prior infection in most settings [7]. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which can accurately determine individual dengue serostatus are needed [8,9].\nExisting RDTs which detect IgG have been designed for the diagnosis of dengue in patients with acute febrile illness and/or for differentiation of primary vs. post-primary dengue. Performance is therefore likely to have been optimised based on high concentrations of IgG associated with acute infection. The potential for these devices to be repurposed for detecting previous dengue infection in healthy individuals (where typically IgG concentrations have waned over time and are lower) has been explored in previous studies. Devices have generally been shown to have high specificity but lower sensitivity when compared to traditional serological techniques, with performance varying between assays. So far, studies of commercially available RDTs have occurred in laboratories and have exclusively analysed serum samples (and not whole blood). Table 1 summarises previously published studies which have assessed the performance of various RDTs in determining dengue serostatus in healthy individuals [10\u201317].\nThe primary aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two RDTs when repurposed to determine dengue seropositivity in healthy individuals. Secondary aims were to compare performance of devices when used under field conditions (i.e. whole blood tested by research nurses in the community, in the presence of participants) to performance when used under laboratory conditions (i.e. serum samples tested by laboratory scientists in a diagnostic laboratory setting), explore whether any deficiencies are likely to be in-part due to assay limits-of-detection, and explore whether performance could be enhanced by allowing assays to run beyond manufacturer recommendations and read at a delayed time-point.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThis study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics and Technical Committee of the Instituto Nacional da Saude, Timor-Leste (Reference: 875 MS-INS/DGE/IX/2021) and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research, Australia (Reference: 2021\u20134064)\n\n\nParticipants\nA population-representative sample of individuals aged one year or older living in Dili was identified as part of a three-stage cluster sampling design for a national seroprevalence study of vaccine-preventable diseases (including dengue) in Timor-Leste. Potential participants were visited at their homes. The first 200 adults and first 200 children (aged < 16 years) who were recruited within Dili municipality were also included in this sub-study, evaluating the performance of dengue RDTs. This sample size was considered adequate to estimate 70% sensitivity and 95% specificity of RDTs with 5% precision (alpha = 0.05) [18]. Since there has been no previous population serological surveillance of dengue in Dili, seroprevalence was assumed to be 80% (i.e. similar to other urban Southeast Asian settings with high burden of dengue) [19].\n\n\nSample collection\nResearch nurses collected blood from participants by phlebotomy using either a standard hypodermic or a winged butterfly needle with a syringe attached. A small volume of whole blood was applied to the index test RDTs (methods below), while most of the sample was injected into a gel serum (SST) tube, which underwent centrifugation in the field (1,500 RCF, 10 minutes). Separated serum samples were transported to the National Health Laboratory (NHL) in Dili within a portable refrigerator and then stored at 4 degrees Celsius until analysis.\n\n\nReference test\nSerum samples were analysed using the Panbio indirect IgG ELISA (product code 01PE30). This assay was chosen because it has been has been designed for detection of previous dengue (as opposed to diagnosis of acute dengue infection), it has been used in serosurveillance studies previously [20,21], it has acceptable performance when compared to virus neutralisation testing (considered most accurate in determining dengue serostatus and correlates best with outcomes after Dengvaxia) [12,22], and because laboratory equipment and expertise for its use were available at the NHL. Testing was performed in accordance with manufacturers\u2019 instructions: A cut-off value was calculated for each run by multiplying the calibration factor (batch-specific) by the mean optical densities (ODs) of calibrator material (run in triplicate). An index value (IV) was then calculated by dividing the sample OD by the cut-off value. Samples with IV < 0.9 were assigned \u2018dengue IgG negative\u2019. Samples with index value > 1.1 were assigned dengue IgG positive. Samples with IV 0.9\u20131.1 were repeat-tested with the second result being used. If IV remained 0.9\u20131.1 on repeat testing then the sample was assigned \u2018dengue IgG positive\u2019. The appropriateness of these commercial serological cut-offs was assessed visually by plotting a histogram showing ELISA IVs from all serum samples in the study, which was assessed visually (see S1 Fig). The cut-off values appeared to adequately distinguish two populations of antibody responses and were therefore adopted into the study.\n\n\nTesting with RDTs\nParticipants were tested for the presence of dengue antibodies using two different commercially available dengue RDTs (Bioline Dengue IgG/IgM, Abbott and Standard Q Dengue IgM/IgG, SD Biosensor). These were chosen based their positive performance in previous studies (Bioline sensitivity 53.7\u201371.1%, specificity 96.0\u201399.6%) [10,12], and their availability and low cost in Timor-Leste (Standard Q). Initially, RDTs were used under field conditions (i.e. whole blood was tested by research nurses in the community, in the presence of participants). This was intended to mimic a potential pre-vaccination screening setting. Subsequently, RDTs were used under laboratory conditions (i.e. serum samples from the same individuals were tested by laboratory scientists at NHL, which is a diagnostic laboratory).\nIn both test settings RDTs were operated in accordance with manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Each device was labelled with the participant ID number and placed on a flat surface. In the field they were inoculated with two drops of whole blood from the syringe. In the laboratory, they were inoculated with two drops of serum from the SST tube. A timer was set for 15 minutes, after which the IgG and IgM lines were interpreted visually by a single researcher and reported in real-time. For the laboratory (serum) experiment, the assays were also read at 60 minutes, to assess whether this would affect test performance. Research nurses and laboratory scientists attended classroom teaching sessions on the safe and appropriate use the RDTs which included practicing operating each device and being observed, which was delivered by PA.\n\n\nParticipant management and ethical considerations\nWritten consent was obtained from the participants and also from the parent/guardian (in the case of children). Participants were informed of their RDT results in the field. If dengue IgG was detected by either assay (but IgM was not detected), participants were informed that they had likely been infected with dengue at some time in their lives, but likely not recently. If IgM (+/- IgG) was detected by either assay, participants were informed that there was evidence of current or recent dengue infection. These individuals were advised to seek medical attention if they experienced fever or other acute illness during the subsequent two weeks. These interpretations were agreed by members of the research team who have backgrounds in medical microbiology, adult, and paediatric infectious disease (PA, JY and JF). They are consistent with interpretations suggested by the RDT instructions for use, with the exception of isolated IgG seropositivity which was considered significantly more likely to represent previous infection than acute dengue in this group of asymptomatic participants.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe sensitivity and specificity of each RDT for determining IgG seropositivity under each set of operating conditions was assessed against the reference test. To explore whether RDT insensitivity was likely to be in-part due to an assay limit-of-detection (LOD), ELISA IVs from reference testing were analysed as a proxy for antibody concentrations. RDT true positive samples were compared to RDT false negative samples and unpaired Students T-tests were used to determine whether there was a significant difference. Results were considered significant where p < 0.05.",
    "Results": "Four-hundred-and-six individuals were included in this study. This included 217 children whose median (interquartile range, IQR) age in years was 10 (6\u201313) and 189 adults whose median (IQR) age in years was 33 (24\u201342). Reference testing determined that 186/217 (85.7%) children and 184/189 (97.4%) adults were dengue IgG seropositive (overall seropositivity = 91.1%).\n\nPerformance of RDTs when testing blood samples under field conditions\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the Bioline assay when testing blood under field conditions (interpreted after 15 minutes, as per manufacturers\u2019 instructions) were 21.1% and 100.0%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the Standard Q under similar conditions were 4.6% and 100.0%, respectively.\n\n\nPerformance of RDTs when testing serum under laboratory conditions\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the Bioline assay when testing serum under laboratory conditions (interpreted after 15 minutes, as per manufacturers\u2019 instructions) were 42.7% and 97.2%, respectively. When tests were allowed to run for 60 minutes (i.e. beyond manufacturer recommendations) sensitivity was improved to 80.3% but specificity reduced to 94.4%.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the Standard Q assay when testing serum under laboratory conditions (interpreted after 15 minutes, as per manufacturers\u2019 instructions) were 10.5% and 97.2%, respectively. When tests were allowed to run for 60 minutes (i.e. beyond manufacturer recommendations) sensitivity was improved to 38.4% and specificity remained 97.2%. Table 2 summarises the performance of each RDT under different test conditions.\n\n\nAnalysis of ELISA IVs as a proxy for antibody concentration\nAmong participants whose Bioline RDT was true positive when used under field conditions the mean (standard deviation, SD) IV of the reference ELISA test was 3.808 (0.535), compared to 3.300 (0.779) in participants whose Bioline RDT was false negative (p < 0.001). Among participants whose Standard Q test was true positive when used under field conditions the mean (SD) ELISA IV of the reference ELISA test was 3.740 (0.441), compared to 3.392 (0.772) in participants whose Standard Q RDT was false negative (p = 0.007). This indicates the RDTs were more likely to accurately identify positive samples which have higher dengue IgG concentrations and hence RDT insensitivity is at least partially due to an assay limit-of-detection problem. Fig 1 shows ELISA IVs in each of these groups. Table 3 summarises similar comparisons of ELISA IVs across different test conditions. Study data are available in the supplementary information (S1 Data).\nComparison of reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) index values (as a proxy for antibody concentration) between individuals who were rapid diagnostic test (RDT) -true positive (TP) and RDT-false negative (FN) when Bioline Dengue IgG/IgM, Abbott (A) and Standard Q Dengue IgM/IgG, SD Biosensor (B) assays were used under field conditions.",
    "Discussion": "This study evaluated the performance of two RDTs in determining dengue IgG seropositivity among healthy individuals (using serum ELISA as the reference test). It is the first study in which commercially available RDTs have been evaluated for this purpose using blood samples, and the first such study conducted under field conditions intended to replicate a pre-vaccination screening setting. When operated according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions (i.e. read at 15 minutes), the Bioline and Standard Q assays were highly specific (both 100.0%) but had low sensitivity (21.1% and 4.6%, respectively). These results contrast with previous studies which have tested serum samples under laboratory conditions and found sensitivity of the Bioline assay to be 53.7\u201371.1%.[10,12] Indeed, when RDTs were operated under laboratory conditions using serum samples from the same individuals in this study, the sensitivity of both assays appeared improved (42.7% and 10.5%, respectively). When tests were allowed to run for 60 minutes (i.e. beyond manufacturer recommendations) sensitivity was further improved (80.3% and 38.4% respectively), but this appeared to be at the expense of specificity (which reduced to 97.2% and 94.4%, respectively). Similar observations were made in a recent study which aimed to optimise both commercially available and purpose-designed RDTs by varying run-time [15].\nThis study also found that mean IV of the reference ELISA test was consistently significantly higher in participants whose RDTs were true positive compared with those whose RDTs were false negative, indicating that RDT insensitivity is at least partially due to a limit-of-detection problem with these two RDTs. This is consistent with assays having been developed for the diagnosis of dengue in patients with acute febrile illness and differentiation of primary vs. post-primary dengue (where concentrations of IgG are usually higher compared to those seen long after convalescence). Previous studies have found that some ELISAs which detect dengue IgG can also be insensitive, particularly in individuals who have lower titres of neutralising antibodies and/or where there is a monotypic antibody profile [22,23]. Importantly, the latter group of individuals are most likely to benefit most from vaccination but would be denied this if pre-vaccination screening was falsely negative.\nAdditional potential sources of low RDT sensitivity include the following: First, RDTs may be interpreted too soon after inoculation. This is supported by data from the present study which showed a difference in sensitivity when time-to-interpretation was varied. Second, there may be difficulties in the visual interpretation of RDTs, particularly when operators are working under field conditions (where the level of lighting may be low). Fieldworkers in the present study received classroom training in the use of both RDTs and were observed to ensure proper technique, however there was no formal programme of quality assurance to ensure proficiency in visual interpretation. The use of lateral flow readers and/or mobile phone app readers [24], including those which verify run-time (or would not make a determination before the appropriate run-time has elapsed), may improve performance. Larger field studies which assess performance at fine temporal resolutions to determine the optimal run-time may be useful. Third, while the chosen reference test (Panbio indirect IgG ELISA) has been designed for detection of previous dengue (as opposed to diagnosis of acute infection), and has been used in serosurveillance studies previously [20,21], it may have mis-assigned some samples. This could have occurred because the commercial serological cut-off was used rather than any population-specific alternative derived from the observed antibody responses. While the appropriateness of cut-offs were assessed visually, the sample size for this study was not considered large enough to undertake mixture modelling [25,26]. Furthermore, virus neutralisation assays may have been more accurate in determining dengue serostatus (and could correlate better with outcomes after Dengvaxia) than ELISAs [12,22], however they were not available during this study which took place in Timor-Leste.\nAlthough this study found RDTs to have high specificity, false positive results were observed. These could have been due to antibodies against other flaviviruses which may be circulating in Timor-Leste including zika and Japanese encephalitis viruses, which commonly cross-react in serological assays [27]. If used in pre-vaccination screening, RDTs which give false positive results would give rise to inappropriate vaccine administration. As such, it would be important to further characterise any false positive samples from candidate assays and perform more extensive specificity testing using panels of samples which are known to have potentially cross-reacting antibodies.\nThis study identified high dengue seroprevalence among both adults and children which is consistent with other studies from the Southeast Asian region. A previous study from Timor-Leste identified lower seroprevalence, but that study tested dried blood spots from individuals in rural areas and used a less sensitive ELISA [28]. Results from the ongoing population-representative serosurvey (from which this study took a convenience sample) will therefore be crucial in determining the most appropriate disease control strategy. If seroprevalence in the vaccine candidate age-group is very high (>70%), universal administration of Dengvaxia without pre-vaccination screening may be appropriate, because the number of severe cases prevented in those who were seropositive would likely be substantially greater than the excess number that occurred in those who were seronegative [7].\nDengue is an emerging infection which causes significant morbidity and mortality across tropical and sub-tropical regions. However, the only effective vaccine has scarcely been used because of safety concerns among seronegative recipients. Efforts to develop an assay with high sensitivity and specificity for prior dengue infection which can be operationalised for pre-vaccination screening are ongoing. Performance of forthcoming candidate assays should be tested under field conditions with blood samples (as well as in the laboratory)."
