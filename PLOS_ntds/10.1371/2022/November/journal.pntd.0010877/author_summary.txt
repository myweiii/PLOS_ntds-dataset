Dengvaxia is effective but has scarcely been used due to safety concerns among seronegative recipients. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which can accurately determine individual dengue serostatus are therefore needed for pre-vaccination screening. This study evaluated two commercially available RDTs during a community seroprevalence survey in Timor-Leste. Field conditions were intended to replicate a pre-vaccination screening setting. Both assays were specific but had low sensitivity, which was lower than previous studies conducted in laboratories using stored serum samples. Future candidate assays should be evaluated under field conditions before they can safely be used in pre-vaccination screening.
