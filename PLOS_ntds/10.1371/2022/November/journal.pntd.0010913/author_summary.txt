Wolbachia bacteria reduce the transmission of dengue and other arboviruses transmitted by their mosquito hosts once they have invaded host populations. This invasion process is being undertaken in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations throughout the world but can be slowed by deleterious fitness costs that the Wolbachia bacteria have on their mosquito hosts. Here we investigate in detail a recently identified cost where one of the Wolbachia strains being used in invasions causes infertility in females when the females develop from eggs that have been stored for a period. We show that slowed larval development (through food reduction) can cause the same phenomenon and that the emerged females lack functional ovaries. These infertile females also take blood meals more often. The results have implications for the successful invasion of Wolbachia under ecological circumstances where the mosquito eggs have to persist in the absence of water for a period and where larval food is limiting.
