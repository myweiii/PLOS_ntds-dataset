This study constructed a two-stage multi-city time-series analysis to explore the heterogeneity of air pollutants-HFMD associations and identify significant socioeconomic effect modifiers, which may lead to heterogeneity. In the results, we found that PM10, NO2 and O3 concentrations were associated with HFMD. For each air pollutant-HFMD associations between cities, the heterogeneity was found. The proportion of primary school students, population density, urbanization rate, number of licensed physicians and number of hospital beds explained part of the heterogeneity. The results showed that demographic factors, economic factors, and health resource factors may influence the effect of air pollutants on HFMD, which could further the understanding of the associations between air pollutants and HFMD and could be as evidence for relevant public health decision-making.
