Better understanding of the Trypanosma cruzi parasite dynamics in the bloodstream of chronically infected individuals is critical to improving existing treatments against Chagas disease, as well as to support the development of new therapeutics. Here, we characterize the dynamics of parasitemia over time in two cohorts of individuals suffering from chronic Chagas disease based on quantitative molecular methods and using statistical modeling. We found evidence that parasitemia remains at a steady-state in untreated individuals for long periods of time. The steady-state can be quantified and predicted at an individual level. This novel analysis framework in chronically infected individuals allows improving the evaluation of outcomes in clinical trials, and provides a new background to further understanding the clinical impact of T. cruzi infection.
