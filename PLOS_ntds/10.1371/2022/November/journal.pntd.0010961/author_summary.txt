Since first being isolated in 1935, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has primarily been associated with encephalitis and has caused repeated outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia. In 2018, a Japanese encephalitis (JE) outbreak emerged in Ningxia province of China. Unlike previous outbreaks, in the 2019 outbreak, numerous patients presented with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Although the acute encephalitis syndrome caused by JEV has been studied extensively, GBS induced by JEV is an uncommon manifestation. No approved effective antiviral therapy directed against JEV is currently available. Therefore, we successfully constructed a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) induced by JEV that can be used to study the pathogenic mechanism of the virus and develop new therapeutic targets.
