Thank you to all women who are engaged in sharing and discussing their experiences with the research team. Our greatest respect for your openness and your strength in keeping on. Thank you as well to our interviewers, for creating safe environments for the women to express their feelings and fears and to our translators for accurate translation from Sakalava to French. Our gratitude goes also to Hannah McNeilly and Pauline Meurer for revising the manuscript.
