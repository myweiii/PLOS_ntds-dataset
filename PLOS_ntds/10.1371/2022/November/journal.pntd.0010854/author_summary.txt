Parasitic worms are notoriously difficult to study outside of a host organism. However, recent developments in culture methods for Fasciola hepatica liver fluke juveniles support growth and development of these parasites in the laboratory (in vitro) towards adult parasites. Having the ability to grow pathogenic juvenile stages in vitro enables functional studies to validate potential drug and vaccine targets. However, comparison of in vitro grown juveniles to juveniles retrieved from infected hosts (in vivo) shows considerable size differences suggesting at least some differences in biology that could undermine the relevance of data generated from in vitro maintained parasites. This study examines gene expression differences between in vitro and in vivo maintained F. hepatica juveniles via transcriptomic analysis to identify similarities and differences in their biology which may help explain differences in the rate of growth and development. 86% of genes were shown to be expressed at similar levels across treatment groups suggesting a high level of biological similarity between in vitro and in vivo juveniles. However, the genes that are expressed differently between these juveniles will help improve current culture methods and provide a new group of potential drug targets that impact on juvenile growth and development.
