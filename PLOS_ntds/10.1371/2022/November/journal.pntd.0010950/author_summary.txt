Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, caused by bacteria from Brucella genus. It is distributed worldwide. The disease affects male and female livestock fertility and causes abortions. Despite eradication programmes, brucellosis continues to be a big issue for public health and for economy policies. Hence, to design mitigation strategies and diminish economic burden, we need to understand the pathogenesis of this disease in humans and livestock. A vexing enigma of Brucella immunity resides in the long-term persistence of the infecting bacterium despite a vigorous and specific immune response. This manuscript shed light into a relevant aspect whereby Ba evades immune host surveillance: the interference with M1 macrophage polarization, phenomenon mediated by Ba RNA. Our findings demonstrate that Ba RNA constitute a novel virulence factor whereby this bacterium interferes with M1 polarization of human macrophages. These results provide new insights about how Ba can persist in the presence of Th1 responses, i.e., in the presence of IFN-Î³ establishing a chronic infection.
