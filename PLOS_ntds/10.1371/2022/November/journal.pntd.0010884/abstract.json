    "Background": "Duration of marriage (DoM) and age are important characteristics of married individuals, who are the critical population for eliminating mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis. A deep understanding of the preconception syphilis seroprevalence (PSS) and its distribution among this population may be able to help to eliminate MTCT. However, few population-based epidemiological studies have been focused on this group, and the association of DoM and age with PSS remains unclear.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This study used data from 4,826,214 married individuals aged 21â€“49 years who participated in the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project in Guangdong Province, China, between 2014 and 2019. Syphilis was screened using the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. The seroprevalence time series, seroprevalence map, and hot spot analysis (HSA) were employed to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) based on multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association of DoM and age with PSS. The interactions on the additive scale of DoM and age were also assessed.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our findings suggest that attention should be paid to preventing syphilis in underdeveloped areas and that syphilis screening in newly married individuals who are in their late 20s or older should be recommended. Additionally, early syphilis prevention strategies should be implemented among young people as early as possible."
