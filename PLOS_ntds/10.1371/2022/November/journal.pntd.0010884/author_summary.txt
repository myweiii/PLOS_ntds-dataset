Preconception screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to prevent the sexual transmission and subsequent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis. Duration of marriage (DoM) and age are important characteristics of married individuals, who are the critical population for eliminating MTCT. A deep understanding of the preconception syphilis seroprevalence (PSS) and its distribution among this population may be able to help to eliminate MTCT. Using data from about 4.8 million married individuals aged 21–49 years in Guangdong Province, we found that the burden of syphilis was relatively low among married individuals in Guangdong Province, and more attention should be paid to underdeveloped areas. There may be a J-shaped relationship between age and PSS, suggesting that after a certain age, PSS increases rapidly with age. DoM was negatively associated with PSS, and older newly married women were more likely to be seropositive. These results suggest that educating people in early adulthood about syphilis prevention may mitigate the increasing cost of syphilis to the health system. Screening for syphilis in newly married individuals who are in their late 20s or older should be recommended. Medical professionals could advise pregnant women’s male spouses to undergo syphilis testing as well.
