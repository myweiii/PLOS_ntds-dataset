Chagas disease (CD), an infection caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, affects between 8 and 10 million people worldwide. It is considered one of the main problems of public health in Latin America, and the international migration has caused infected subjects to scatter through the rest of the world, making CD a global health problem. Therefore, it is important to diagnose this infection using laboratory tests, which sometimes becomes a problem due to lack of reference tests and the existence of different types of tests with different sensitivity and specificity values, added to the difficulty in detecting the parasite in its chronic phase. This systematic review and meta-analysis determined the diagnostic validity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) among individuals with suspected chronic CD. It included 43 studies and concluded that both ELISA and RDTs had adequate diagnostic performance. It is necessary to better understand these two types of diagnostic tests to facilitate clinical decision making about the disease and improve access to treatment for the population at risk.
