Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by certain species of bacteria or fungi. The pathogens enter the body through a break in the skin and infect underlying soft tissues, leading to tissue destruction, loss of function, amputations and disability. Early diagnosis of mycetoma requires a clear understanding of disease prevalence, distribution and the contributing risk factors. In this study, we describe the results from a cross-sectional community-based study conducted in five administrative units with high mycetoma endemicity in the Eastern Sennar Locality, Sennar State, Sudan. 7,798 households in 60 villages were randomly selected across the entire locality. A household survey was administered and household members underwent clinical examination. In case of suspected mycetoma, geographical coordinates and photos of the lesions were taken, further demographic and clinical data were collected as was information on the use of health care and associated costs, and the individual was referred to the medical centre for confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to identify socioeconomic risk factors contributing to mycetoma. We compared the characteristics of the households with confirmed cases of mycetoma with those without cases and individuals with confirmed mycetoma with those in whom mycetoma was not confirmed.
Our results suggest that agricultural practices and reduced access to clean water and sanitation may be risk factors in developing mycetoma. Poor access to health care and substantial financial costs may be barriers to seeking treatment for mycetoma.
