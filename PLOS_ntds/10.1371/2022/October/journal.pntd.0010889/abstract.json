    "Background": "Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases, which can be endemo-epidemic in some areas of the world. Most of them are characterized by outbreaks, which occur irregularly and are hard to predict. Innovative medical countermeasures are to be evaluated but due to the field specificities of emerging VHF, challenges arise when implementing clinical studies. To assess the state of the art around VHFs, we conducted a systematic review for all reports and clinical studies that included specific results on number of cases, mortality and treatment of VHFs.",
    "Methods": "The search was conducted in January 2020 based on PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020167306). We searched reports on the WHO and CDC websites, and publications in three international databases (MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL). Following the study selection process, qualitative and quantitative data were extracted from each included study. A narrative synthesis approach by each VHF was used. Descriptive statistics were conducted including world maps of cases number and case fatality rates (CFR); summary tables by VHF, country, time period and treatment studies.",
    "Results": "We identified 141 WHO/CDC reports and 126 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were published after 2010 (n = 97 for WHO/CDC reports and n = 93 for publications) and reported number of cases and/or CFRs (n = 141 WHO/CDC reports and n = 88 publications). Results varied greatly depending on the outbreak or cluster and across countries within each VHF. A total of 90 studies focused on Ebola virus disease (EVD). EVD outbreaks were reported in Africa, where Sierra Leone (14,124 cases; CFR = 28%) and Liberia (10,678 cases; CFR = 45%) reported the highest cases numbers, mainly due to the 2014â€“2016 western Africa outbreak. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreaks were reported from 31 studies in Africa, Asia and Europe, where Turkey reported the highest cases number (6,538 cases; CFR = 5%) and Afghanistan the last outbreak in 2016/18 (293 cases; CFR = 43%).",
    "Conclusion": "We observed that number of cases and CFR varied greatly across VHFs as well as across countries within each VHF. The number of studies on VHF treatments was very limited with very few randomized trials and no strong proof of effectiveness of treatment against most of the VHFs. Therefore, there is a high need of methodologically strong clinical trials conducted in the context of VHF."
