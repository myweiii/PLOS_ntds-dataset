Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of febrile illnesses that constitutes a challenge to public health. Viral hemorrhagic fevers are endemic in some areas of the world and are often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to high mortality rates and outbreaks that are irregular and hard to predict, difficulties arise when undertaking clinical studies to assess new treatments against viral hemorrhagic fevers. To provide an extensive overview of viral hemorrhagic fevers, we conducted a systematic review to retrieve available information on number of cases, mortality and treatments of viral hemorrhagic fevers. We found that cases number and mortality varied greatly across outbreaks and across countries within each viral hemorrhagic fever. The number of studies on viral hemorrhagic fever treatments was very limited with very few methodologically strong studies. Moreover, for several viral hemorrhagic fevers we did not identify specific investigational therapeutic option with strong proof of effectiveness on mortality. Therefore, there is a high need to conduct methodologically strong studies to investigate treatments against viral hemorrhagic fevers.
