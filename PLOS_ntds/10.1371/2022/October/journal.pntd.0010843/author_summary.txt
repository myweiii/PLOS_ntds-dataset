The transfusion of blood and blood components entails some risks and potential complications, chief among them the transmission of infectious agents. Organizations like the American Association of Blood Banks have warned of the risks posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses for transfusion safety and have classified transmission of several arboviruses as a high or very high risk to the transfusion of blood and blood components. Following recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), this study aims to enable safe blood transfusion services, by making available the latest updated information of transfusion-transmitted arboviruses and comprehensive knowledge of the current epidemiology of reported cases.
Research revealed case reports of transfusion transmission of 10 arboviruses, with West Nile virus and dengue virus as the most prevalent. Main clinical characteristics of reported cases were collected, including the type of blood component transfused and the state of immunosuppression of the recipient. Research also revealed 18 additional arboviruses with potential risk of transmission through other direct transmission routes. This systematic review provides an updated overview of the clinical characteristics of reported cases of transfusion-transmitted arboviruses. It is the most complete record published to date that assesses the risk posed by arboviruses to blood transfusion.
