Although case fatality rates remain high, there are limited data on predicting mortality in children with Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Furthermore, challenges in predicting EVD outcomes using clinical and laboratory data highlight the need for the development and validation of pediatric predictive models. The novel EVD Prognosis in Children (EPiC) model uses clinical and biochemical information, such as AST and CK, to predict mortality in infected children. While few prognostic models or scoring systems have been developed to predict clinical outcomes of EVD, the majority of them were limited in geographical and temporal scope having been derived using data from one location. As such, the EPiC model is the first externally validated model for the prognosis of pediatric EVD using diverse datasets from geographically and temporally separate outbreaks. This model can be easily applied by bedside clinicians to assess pediatric patients at risk for death and help to allocate resources accordingly.
