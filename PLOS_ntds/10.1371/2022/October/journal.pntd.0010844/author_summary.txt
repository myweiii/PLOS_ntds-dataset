Orthohantaviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses found all over the world in association with small mammal reservoirs. When occasionally transmitted to humans by aerosol they can cause two main types of diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) mainly in Europe and Asia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in North and South America with a case fatality rate of up to 15% and 40% respectively. An increasing number of outbreaks are recorded in endemic areas and, with disturbance of rodent habitats, climate change and the risk of virus genome reassortment, the emergence of new orthohantaviruses is of concern. With no treatment, no vaccines and few molecular tools, little is known about the pathophysiology of these viruses. Our comparative study of the viral cycle and interaction of different pathogenic and low or non-pathogenic orthohantaviruses in cells derived from human or rodent hosts reveals differences in entry, RNA replication or release of infectious particles, concurrently to regulation of host genes. This study illustrates how the development of a rodent host cell model together with the availability of an annotated bank vole genome may contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms of the interactions between orthohantaviruses and their hosts.
