Currently, vaccines available for human Salmonellosis prevention are mostly against one serovar, i.e., S. Typhi, leaving a significant risk of Salmonella disease epidemiology change. Consequently, more efforts are needed to develop vaccine candidates against other medically important but somehow less concerned S. enterica serovars, such as S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Evidence reveals that S. Paratyphi A is taking the place of S. Typhi as the leading cause of “enteric fever” in South Asia, and S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the leading causing of “Invasive Non-typhoidal Salmonella disease” in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the solutions is to increase the cross-immunogenicity and cross-protections of potential S. enterica vaccine candidates. Salmonella outer membrane O-antigen polysaccharide is a well-known protective antigen, and its diverse structure is serotype specific. More precisely, S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are characterized by O2, O4 and O9 O-serotypes. In this study, we aimed to combine the immunodominant O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes into one S. enterica serovar and evaluated its cross-immune responses in a murine model. Our results indicated that the rational design of O-antigen structure in live attenuated Salmonella vaccines is a promising strategy to induce effective cross-protections against S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis.
