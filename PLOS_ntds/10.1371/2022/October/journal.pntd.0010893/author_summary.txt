Leishmaniasis caused by species of the trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania is an important widespread global health problem. Humans become infected by Leishmania following the bite of sand flies bearing the flagellated metacyclic promastigote stage, and the first 24â€“48 hours thereafter are critical to the outcome of infection. During this time, parasites are engulfed by several host cell types, where they differentiate into the rounded amastigote stage, adapted for intracellular survival and proliferation, with concomitant changes in metabolism and virulence factor expression. We developed a suite of markers that allowed us to monitor promastigote-to-amastigote differentiation (amastigogenesis) on a single-cell level. Two showed amastigote-specific expression and localized to the anterior or posterior regions. Our marker suite allowed us to chart the course of amastigogenesis in different host cell environments and to determine the timing of amastigote development relative to the initiation of parasite replication and the expression of the virulence factor lipophosphoglycan (LPG). We report that the amastigogenesis process follows a determined sequence of events that occurs prior to parasite replication. In contrast, parasites may respond to different host cell environments by prolonging LPG expression, thereby extending the duration of its pro-infectivity functions within or in transit between host cell destinations.
