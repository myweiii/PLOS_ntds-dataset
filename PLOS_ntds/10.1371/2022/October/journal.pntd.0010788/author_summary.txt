Host cell invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is critical for the establishment of infection. Metacyclic trypomastigote (MT) forms are responsible for the initial T. cruzi-host cell interaction. Mucin molecules expressed on MT surface have been implicated in target cell invasion process, but the underlying mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed at elucidating the mode of mucin-mediated MT internalization. We found that requirement of mucins for MT invasion is T. cruzi strain-dependent. Experiments with G strain MTs, which rely on mucins and on target cell actin for internalization, revealed that mucin molecules bind to annexin A2, a protein that plays a role in actin dynamic. Annexin A2-deficient cell lines were generated and found to be significantly more resistant than wild type controls to MT invasion. Both MT and purified mucins induced focal adhesion kinase activation in host cells. By confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, invading MT was found to colocalize with clathrin, a protein that plays a role in endocytosis. Inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle formation reduced parasite internalization. From these data we infer that mucin-mediated MT invasion is accomplished through interaction with host cell annexin A2 and clathrin-dependent endocytosis.
