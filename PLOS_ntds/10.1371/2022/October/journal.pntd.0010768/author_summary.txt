There are over 3,500 species of mosquitoes in the world, but only a small proportion are considered important vectors of arboviruses. Vector competence, the physiological ability of a mosquito to become infected with and transmit arboviruses, is used in combination with virus detection in field populations and analysis of vertebrate host feeding patterns to incriminate mosquito species in virus transmission cycles. Here, we quantified the vector competence of Australian mosquitoes for endemic and exotic viruses of public health concern by analyzing 68 laboratory studies of 111 mosquito-virus pairings. We found that Australia has species that could serve as efficient vectors for each virus tested and it is these species that should be targeted in control programs. We also corroborate previously identified virus-mosquito associations at the mosquito genus level but show that there is considerable variation in vector competence between species within a genus. We also confirmed that vector competence is influenced by infection barriers within the mosquito and the experimental protocols employed. The framework we developed could be used to synthesize vector competence experiments in other regions or expanded to a world-wide overview.
