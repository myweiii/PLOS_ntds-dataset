The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) may cause serious diseases, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which can manifest itself in different clinical forms. In this paper, we investigated the survival of 143 Brazilian ATLL patients, according to the clinical form and other clinicopathological characteristics using bivariate and multivariable analyses. The original clinical classification of ATLL was employed; however, we considered the primary cutaneous tumoral (PCT) ATLL and the smoldering type separately. We found statistically significant differences in the mortality rates by clinical types and highlighted the better prognosis of patients with the smoldering type (mortality rate: 0.6 per 100 person-years) compared to those with PCT (mortality rate: 5.3 per 100 person-years). This finding emphasizes the importance of considering the PCT/ATLL separately from the smoldering type when using the ATLL classification to determine prognosis and treatment. PCT/ATLL should be treated with more aggressive ATLL protocols than the smoldering type without skin nodules or tumors.
