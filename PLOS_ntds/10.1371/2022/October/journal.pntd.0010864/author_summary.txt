Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease that infects up to 400 million people a year. It is mostly self-resolving, but in some patients, severe outcomes such as dengue-associated cardiac impairment may occur. The lack of reliable biomarkers for severe dengue poses a challenge in managing febrile dengue patients. Suppressor of tumorigenicity (ST2) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, and its soluble form (sST2) has been a valuable biomarker in patients with heart failure. In a longitudinal cohort of dengue subjects, we investigated the potential utility of sST2 as a predictive biomarker for severe dengue and explored its associations with dengue-associated cardiac impairment. Our work demonstrated sST2 to be significantly raised in dengue participants and levels increase with worse dengue outcomes. We also showed that sST2 levels correlated with lower measurements of cardiac performance, and more importantly, sST2 was observed to be a possible prognostic biomarker of severe dengue. Together, this work provides novel evidence on the potential utility of sST2 to predict severe dengue and its associations in dengue-associated cardiac impairment.
