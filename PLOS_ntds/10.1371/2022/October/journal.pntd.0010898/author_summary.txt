Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infections cause human health and economical burdens given its ability to induce high rates of abortions in ruminants and possible contributions towards late-term miscarriages in women. In this study, we have identified important structures in the placenta targeted by this emerging bunyavirus. Inflammation was associated with more severe fetal outcomes such as death and fetal deformities. The striking similarities between the pathologies of the placenta in the rat model of congenital RVF and those observed in naturally infected ruminants highlight the utility of this rodent model. These findings may be further translated towards understanding the mechanisms involved in vertical transmission of RVFV in humans.
