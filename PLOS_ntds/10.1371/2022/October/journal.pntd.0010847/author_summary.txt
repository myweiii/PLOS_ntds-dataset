Bangladesh saw an increasing frequency of dengue outbreaks over the last two decades. Most of the time, it was confined to large cities endemic to the disease. However, in 2019 a massive dengue outbreak occurred in the country, which spread from endemic to non-endemic regions of the country. The present study documented clinical and hematological profiles of 123 children with dengue who got admitted between June 2019 to September 2019 to a 250-bed general hospital in Tangail, a non-endemic region. Patients had an average age of just over seven years, and nearly two-thirds were male. More than one-quarter of patients had dengue fever with bleeding manifestation (dengue hemorrhagic fever). Two of the children suffered from dengue shock syndrome. Fever, body ache, headache, and rash were predominant clinical features. Thrombocytopenia was present in two-fifth of the cases. The presence of dengue in a non-endemic zone warrants further epidemiological, entomological, and environmental research in the area.
