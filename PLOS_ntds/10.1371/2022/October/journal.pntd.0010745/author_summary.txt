Leishmaniasis is a disease due to a protozoan parasite and transmitted by sandfly. In France, this disease is endemic in the Mediterranean region, in French Guiana and to a lesser extent, in the French West Indies. We wanted to provide an updated picture of leishmaniasis epidemiology in metropolitan France and in its overseas territories. In metropolitan France, from 1998 to 2020, 517 autochthonous leishmaniasis cases, mostly visceral forms due to Leishmania infantum (79%), and 1725 imported cases (French Guiana excluded), mainly cutaneous leishmaniasis from Maghreb, were recorded. A slight decrease of autochthonous cases was observed during the survey period, from 0.48 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year in 1999 to 0.1 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year in 2017. Conversely, imported cases increased over time (from 59.7 in the 2000s to 94.5 in the 2010s). In French Guiana, 4126 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis cases were reported from 2003 to 2020. The mean incidence was 103.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants/year but varied in function of the year (from 198 in 2004 to 54 in 2006). In Guadeloupe and Martinique (French West Indies), only sporadic cases were reported. Because of concerns about disease expansion and outbreaks, leishmaniasis monitoring should be continued and associated with a more active surveillance.
