    "Abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses against Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) infection. However, the role of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in the mouse lung during S. japonicum infection and the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) affected by the absence of TLR7 are not clearly understood. In this study, the results indicated that the MDSCs were accumulated and the proportion and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were decreased in the lung of mice at 6\u20137 weeks after S. japonicum infection. Then, the expression of TLR7 was detected in isolated pulmonary MDSCs and the results showed that the expression of TLR7 in MDSCs was increased after infection. Furthermore, TLR7 agonist R848 could down-regulate the induction effect of the soluble egg antigen (SEA) on pulmonary MDSCs in vitro. Meanwhile, TLR7 deficiency could promote the pulmonary MDSCs expansion and function by up-regulating the expression of PD-L1/2 and secreting of IL-10 in the mice infected with S. japonicum. Mechanistic studies revealed that S. japonicum infection and the antigen effects are mediated by NF-\u03baB signaling. Moreover, TLR7 deficiency aggravates S. japonicum infection-induced damage in the lung, with more inflammatory cells infiltration, interstitial dilatation and granuloma in the tissue. In summary, this study indicated that TLR7 signaling inhibits the accumulation and function of MDSCs in S. japonicum infected mouse lung by down-regulating the expression of PD-L1/2 and secreting of IL-10, via NF-\u03baB signaling."
