Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting >250 million people worldwide. Causative agents are parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma, that inhabit the small blood vessels irrigating the gut and urinary bladder. Adult schistosomes lay their eggs that make their way to the environment by piercing the intestinal or urinary bladder wall to reach the host feces and urine, respectively. Schistosoma infections are associated with substantial alterations of gut bacterial communities of both naturally infected humans and experimentally infected mice. Intestinal bacteria are also hypothesized to contribute to the intestinal pathology caused by migrating parasite eggs. Here, we investigated the impact of schistosome infection on the composition and function of gut bacteria inhabiting wild type and microbiome-humanized laboratory rodents. Schistosome colonization was consistently associated with an increased (predicted) ability of gut bacteria to synthetize tryptophan and butyrate, both of which are known to promote intestinal barrier function by preventing translocation of potentially harmful bacteria into the circulation. Our findings suggest that intestinal bacteria may exert both harmful and protective roles during schistosomiasis, and provide a basis for the development of much needed novel and sustainable strategies for management and control of this neglected disease.
