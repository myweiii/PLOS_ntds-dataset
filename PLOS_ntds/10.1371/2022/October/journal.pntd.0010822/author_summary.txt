Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that has been prioritised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for prevention, control and elimination. Its long-term devastating health effects are widely documented, as are its significant impacts on vulnerable communities. There is a deficit of donor funding for many schistosomiasis-endemic countries, and this paucity of financing requires affected states to adopt schistosomiasis interventions that are the most cost-effective, in order to maximise health outcomes for their populations.
This systematic review aims to identify and assess existing economic evaluations concerned with interventions to prevent, control, and eliminate schistosomiasis. We synthesise the existing evidence on cost-effectiveness and evaluate whether such studies are of acceptable methodological quality, and whether they are sufficiently transparent and reproducible. We conclude by highlighting methodological shortcomings in the current economic evidence base relating to schistosomiasis and make recommendations for the improvement of such studies.
This study contributes to the expanding body of evidence on economic evaluations of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The findings of this study will provide additional information for health authorities and policymakers in affected countries in the context of the identification of optimal programmes and interventions to tackle schistosomiasis.
