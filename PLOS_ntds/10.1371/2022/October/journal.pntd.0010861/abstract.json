    "Background": "Congenital TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), rubella virus (RV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV)) infections are associated with a variety of adverse prenatal and neonatal events, including miscarriage, malformations and developmental abnormalities, and they remain an issue that cannot be neglected in China. However, the current research focuses more on the general screening of TORCH in women of childbearing age, and the medical information of children hospitalized due to congenital and perinatal TORCH infections has not been described in detail. This study summarized and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, length of stay (LOS), and the disease burden of hospitalized children diagnosed with congenital TORCH infections in 27 children’s hospitals in China.",
    "Methodology": "Based on the face sheet of discharge medical records (FSMRs) of hospitalized children in 27 tertiary children’s hospitals collected in the Futang Research Center of Pediatric Development and aggregated into FUTang Update medical REcords (FUTURE), we summarized and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, LOS, the disease burden (in US dollars, USD) and potential risk factors for hospitalized children diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis, congenital rubella syndrome, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, and congenital HSV in 27 children’s hospitals in China from 2015 to 2020.",
    "Results": "One hundred seventy-three patients aged 0–<1 year were hospitalized for congenital TORCH infections. Among infections with TORCH, hospitalization with congenital toxoplasmosis was the least common, with only five cases were reported (2.89%), while the LOS was the highest. The proportion of patients with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) was 15.61%, and 86% of children hospitalized with CRS had cardiovascular malformations, and the economic burden was the highest. Congenital CMV infection cases accounted for the largest proportion (76.30%). Overall, 5.20% of patients were infected with HSV, and the expense of hospitalization for congenital HSV infection was relatively low.",
    "Conclusion": "In the present study, the hospitalization proportion due to congenital TORCH infection was extremely low (17.56 per 100,000 neonates), indicating that China’s congenital TORCH infection prevention and control policies remain effective. The lowest proportion of patients was hospitalized with congenital toxoplasmosis, while the LOS was the longest. The economic burden of CRS was heavy, and infants are recommended be vaccinated against RV in a timely manner. Congenital CMV infections accounted for the largest proportion of patients, suggesting that the disease burden of congenital CMV infection cannot be ignored, and the prevention of congenital CMV infection during pregnancy is still an important issue that needs to pay attention. The expense of hospitalization for congenital HSV infection was relatively low, while the disease burden increases significantly when patients develop complications. These data illustrate the importance of improving screening for congenital TORCH infections in the early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal patients."
