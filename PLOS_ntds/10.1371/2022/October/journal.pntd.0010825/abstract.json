    "Background": "The AMBITION-cm trial for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis demonstrated that a single, high-dose of liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) plus 14-days of oral flucytosine and fluconazole was non-inferior in terms of all-cause mortality to 7-days of amphotericin B deoxycholate and flucytosine followed by 7-days of fluconazole (Control). The AmBisome regimen was associated with fewer adverse events. We explored the acceptability of the AmBisome regimen from the perspective of participants and providers.",
    "Methods": "We embedded a qualitative methods study within the AMBITION-cm sites in Botswana and Uganda. We conducted in-depth interviews with trial participants, surrogate decision makers, and researchers and combined these with direct observations. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and analysed thematically.",
    "Results": "We interviewed 38 trial participants, 20 surrogate decision makers, and 31 researchers. Participant understanding of the trial was limited; however, there was a preference for the AmBisome regimen due to the single intravenous dose and fewer side effects. More time was required to prepare the single AmBisome dose but this was felt to be acceptable given subsequent reductions in workload. The AmBisome regimen was reported to be associated with fewer episodes of rigors and thrombophlebitis and a reduction in the number of intravenous cannulae required. Less intensive monitoring and management was required for participants in the AmBisome arm.",
    "Conclusions": "The AmBisome regimen was highly acceptable, being simpler to administer despite the initial time investment required. The regimen was well tolerated and associated with less toxicity and resultant management. Widespread implementation would reduce the clinical workload of healthcare workers caring for patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis."
