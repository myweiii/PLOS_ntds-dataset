Leprosy is a chronic, granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and is a major cause of preventable disability. As a result of their disfigurements and deteriorating physical impairments, the leprosy-affected individuals experienced negative social attitudes, stigma, isolation, and discrimination, thus, impacting their lives and relationships with others. Due to the chronicity of leprosy, studying the lived experience of the affected individuals will allow us a deeper understanding of the effects of the disease, how they seek help and adhere to its treatment, and cope with the disease. We conducted a systematic literature review involving 49 articles, highlighting the four synthesised findings: biophysical impact, social impact, economic impact, and mental and emotional impact. These synthesised findings were not new, but they were consistent across the included studies from a patientâ€™s perspective. Our findings contributed to establishing the biopsychosocial and economic approach for understanding what leprosy-affected people experience by considering changes in their biophysical, sociocultural, psychological dynamics, and economics. It served as a guide for delivering care and treatment to these people. The information will be helpful to the researchers, health professionals, decision, and policymakers to plan and tailor their support for these individuals, their families, and the community.
