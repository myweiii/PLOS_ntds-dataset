Infections with the single-cell parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are life-long and cause Chagas disease. This can give rise to serious cardiac and/or digestive tract pathology. The current drugs are often non-curative, and patients frequently suffer severe side-effects. There is an international effort to develop improved therapeutic approaches. However, because T. cruzi persists at very low numbers in discrete tissue/organ foci, it is extremely difficult to unambiguously demonstrate parasitological cure. Even highly sensitive PCR methodologies require long-term follow-up to provide a curative diagnosis that is likely to be reliable. This is problematic for clinical trials and will complicate the roll-out of new drugs at a population level. Here, using experimental mouse models, we have exploited a combination of highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging and an antibody multiplex assay system to identify serological markers of infection and successful treatment. These biomarkers can now be adapted to provide a robust system for the diagnosis of Chagas disease and for confirming the parasitological cure of chronic infections.
