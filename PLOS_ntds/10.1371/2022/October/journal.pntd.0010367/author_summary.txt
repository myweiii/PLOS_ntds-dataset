Characterising the true extent of dengue circulation and the level of population immunity is essential to assess the burden of disease, evaluate epidemic risk and organise prevention strategies against future epidemics. However, this is difficult in a context where most people who are infected by dengue virus (DENV) only have mild symptoms which may not be reported to surveillance systems. In this article, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the fraction of unreported dengue infections from case data. The key idea is to introduce reporting probabilities that depend on the infecting serotype and the infection history of patients. These factors are known to contribute to variations in the severity of symptoms and hence the reporting probabilities, but have rarely been taken into account in model frameworks to study population immunity from the case data. Using the developed model, we study long-term dengue virus immunity in French Polynesia.
