    "Introduction": "Mycetoma is a unique neglected tropical disease which is found endemic in areas known as the “mycetoma belt”. Head and neck mycetoma is a rarity and it has many devastating impacts on patients and communities. In this study, we assessed clinical findings, investigations, and predictors for recurrence of head and neck mycetoma in Sudan.",
    "Methodology": "A retrospective study was conducted at Mycetoma Research Center in Khartoum between January 1999 and December 2020 for all patients with head and neck mycetoma. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.0.2.",
    "Results": "We included 107 patients with head and neck mycetoma. 65.4% were young adult males from mycetoma endemic areas in Sudan, and most of them were students (33.6%). Most of patients (64.4%) had actinomycetoma. Before presenting with head and neck mycetoma, majority (75.7%) had a long duration with mycetoma, and 30.8% had a history of trauma. The commonest invaded site was the parietal region (30.8%). The lesion started gradually in most of the patients (96.3%). 53.3% of the patients had large size lesions with no sweating, regional lymph nodes involvement, or distal vein involvement. CT scan was the most accurate diagnostic tool while 8.4% of patients were diagnosed by clinical examinations only. Laboratory investigations confirmed that 24/45 (44.4%) of actinomycetoma was caused by Streptomyces somaliensis while 13/28 (46.4%) of eumycetoma was caused by Madurella mycetomatis. All patients with recurrence of head and neck mycetoma underwent surgical excision of the lesion (n = 41/41 {100%}, p < 0.001).",
    "Conclusion": "In head and neck mycetoma, the most common type was actinomycetes in Sudan. Majority had a long course of mycetoma and the commonest causative organism was Streptomyces somaliensis. The treatment outcome was poor and characterized by a low cure rate."
