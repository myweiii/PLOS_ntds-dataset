    "Abstract": "Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) is one of the most common causes of posterior uveitis. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of OT have not been well elucidated. Here, we used C57BL/6 (B6) mice to establish OT by peroral infection with 20 cysts of the TgCtWh6 strain, and severe ocular damage was observed by histopathological analysis in the eyes of infected mice. RNA-sequencing results showed that infection with T. gondii increased the expression of the NK-mediated cytotoxicity gene pathway at Day 30 after ocular T. gondii infection. Both NK-cell and CD49a+ NK-cell subsets are increased in ocular tissues, and the expression levels of LFA-1 in NK cells and ICAM-1 in the OT murine model were upregulated upon infection. Furthermore, inhibition of the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 with lifitegrast, a novel small molecule integrin antagonist, inhibited the protein expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 in murine OT and NK cells, improved the pathology of murine OT and influenced the secretion of cytokines in the OT murine model. In conclusion, the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 plays a role in the early regulation of the CD49a+ NK-cell proportion in an OT murine model. LFA-1/ ICAM-1 may be a key molecule in the pathogenesis of OT, and may provide new insights for potential immunotherapy."
