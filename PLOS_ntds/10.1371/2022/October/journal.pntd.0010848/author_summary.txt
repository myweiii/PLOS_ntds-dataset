Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), despite its high prevalence and impact worldwide, is currently understudied. An immunological approach to the disease is relevant given the particular immunological milieu where it happens (the eye) and the known importance of innate immunity in the resolution of the disease. We revealed that LFA-1/ICAM-1 is essential for inflammatory NK cells at the ocular region with TgCtwh6, which is the predominant clonal lineage (ToxoDB#9) in China. A higher percentage of CD49a+ NK1.1+ CD3- cells and upregulated LFA-1/ICAM-1 expression in the OT murine model promoted inflammation and aggravated damage in OT. Moreover, lifitegrast is a novel small molecule integrin antagonist that blocks the binding of ICAM-1 to LFA-1. The amelioration of pathology and the diminished expression of inflammatory cytokines upon lifitegrast treatment could pave the way for more specific intervention in patients.
