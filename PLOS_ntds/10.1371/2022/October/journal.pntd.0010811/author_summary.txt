Fasciolosis caused by Fasciola hepatica poses a serious concern for animal and human health worldwide. Treatment and prevention of this disease is challenging due to the appearance of parasites that are resistant to the current treatment and the suboptimal efficacy of assayed vaccines. In this context, the importance of early interactions with the host for parasite migration and infection progression prompted us to develop and study new models of interaction between F. hepatica juveniles and their host. Here, an in vitro model coupled with a quantitative proteomics approach was developed to evaluate the changes in F. hepatica newly excysted juveniles right after their contact with intestinal epithelial cells, which represent the first line of host cells that the parasite encounters upon host infection. Additionally, this model has been used to decipher potential changes elicited by the parasite in the host intestine. A proteomic study of parasites and host cells upon co-incubation revealed specific changes in the repertoire of proteins from both host and parasite following their interaction. These proteins could be of importance for parasite migration and survival inside the host, and give new important insights to understand the host-parasite molecular crosstalk in early fasciolosis.
