Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), is a potentially disabling infectious disease. An understanding of the leprosy rate, prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and nerve characteristic trends are crucial for the implementation of leprosy control programs the identification of remaining challenges. The physical disability trends among newly detected leprosy cases were assessed over a 31-year period in Yunnan, a leprosy-endemic region in China. A total of 10758 newly diagnosed leprosy cases were reported, and 10.55% (1179) and 20.15% (2251) of patients were diagnosed with grade 1 (G1D) and grade 2 disability (G2D), respectively. Male sex, older age, Han ethnicity, urban employment, a longer diagnosis duration, a contact history, greater nerve involvement, and tuberculoid-related forms of leprosy were associated with increased prevalence rates of physical disability. Despite general progress in reducing the prevalence of leprosy-related physical disability, the proportion of those experiencing physical disability due to leprosy is still high. This implies that leprosy cases are being detected at a later stage and that transmission in the community remains. Further efforts focusing on early detection are crucial for leprosy control and the elimination of the disease burden.
