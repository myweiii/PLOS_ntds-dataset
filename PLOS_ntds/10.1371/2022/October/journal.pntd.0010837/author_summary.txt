Schistosoma mansoni is a tropical parasitic infection that causes intestinal schistosomiasis. In infected humans, the parasite worms shed eggs that migrate across the gut barrier, which damages intestinal structure and function. In children, intestinal schistosomiasis leads to anemia, undernutrition, and linear growth stunting. The mechanistic pathways between schistosomiasis and stunting are not fully understood, but this research explores the role of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in schistosomiasis-related morbidity. EED is an intestinal condition that affects children living in areas of poor water, sanitation, and hygiene and also leads to impaired growth and stunting. In a longitudinal cohort of Brazilian children infected with S. mansoni, we measured blood biomarkers of EED and linear growth at three time points over 12 months. All of the children were treated for schistosomiasis at baseline, and after 12 months, we observed a significant decrease in a marker of EED, suggesting improvement in gut integrity. We also found that children who had higher parasite egg burden at the baseline visit had lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, a hormone that drives growth in children. Our findings suggest that EED may play a role in schistosomiasis-related stunting and furthers our understanding for S. mansoni pathogenesis in children.
