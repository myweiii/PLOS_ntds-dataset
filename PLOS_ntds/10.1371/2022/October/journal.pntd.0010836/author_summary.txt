Dengue infection, a mosquito-borne disease, is an expanding global problem. It has a broad clinical spectrum that includes severe and non-severe clinical manifestations with a high risk of death. Identifying early prognostic markers of severe complications may improve case management and reduce dengue-related mortalities. The circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile has been widely used to identify potential biomarkers against viral infections. Our data revealed that the circulating miRNA expression pattern of severe dengue patients was significantly different from the non-severe group. In addition, circulating miRNAs, especially miR-574-5p and miR-1246, could be promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for severe dengue. These data have implications for developing biomarkers for clinical use and could improve risk prediction in dengue patients.
