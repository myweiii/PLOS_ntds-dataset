    "Background": "Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is the second important parasitic disease after malaria. The present study aimed to evaluate the molluscicidal effects of silver nanoparticles on Biomphalaria alexandrina, B. glabrata, Oncomelania hupensis, snail intermediate hosts of intestinal schistosomes (i.e. Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum), along with the changes their antioxidant enzymes.",
    "Methods": "Silver (Ag) nano powder (Ag-NPs) was selected to test the molluscicidal effects on three species of freshwater snails. Exposure to Ag-NPs induced snail mortality and the LC50 and LC90 values of Ag-NPs for each snail species were calculated by probit analysis. Control snails were maintained under the same experimental conditions in dechlorinated water. Snail hemolymph was collected to measure the levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as total antioxidants capacity (TCA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and nitric oxide (NO). In addition, the non-target organism, Daphnia magna, was exposed to a series of Ag-NPs concentration, similar to the group of experimental snails, in order to evaluate the LC50 and LC90 and compare these values to those obtained for the targeted snails.",
    "Results": "The results indicated that Ag-NPs had a molluscicidal effect on tested snails with the variation in lethal concentration. The LC50 values of Ag-NPs for B. alexandrina snails exposed for 24, 48, 72 hrs and 7 days were 7.91, 5.69, 3.83 and 1.91 parts per million (ppm), respectively. The LC50 values for B. glabrata snails exposed for 24, 48, 72 hrs and 7 days were 16.55, 10.44, 6.91 and 4.13 ppm, respectively, while the LC50 values for O. hupensis snails exposed for 24, 48, 72 hrs and 7 days were 46.5, 29.85, 24.49 and 9.62 ppm, respectively. Moreover, there is no mortality detected on D. magna when exposed to more than double and half concentration (50 ppm) of Ag-NPs during a continuous period of 3 hrs, whereas the LC90 value for B. alexandrina snails was 18 ppm. The molluscicidal effect of the synthesized Ag-NPs seems to be linked to a potential reduction of the antioxidant activity in the snailâ€™s hemolymph.",
    "Conclusions": "Synthesized Ag-NPs have a clear molluscicidal effect against various snail intermediate hosts of intestinal schistosome parasites and could potentially serve as next generation molluscicides."
