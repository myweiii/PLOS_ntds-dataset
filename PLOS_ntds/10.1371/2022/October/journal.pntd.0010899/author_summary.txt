This study aimed to evaluate the effects on schistosomiasis, of antimalarial drugs given to treat malaria in adults and children. The question is relevant as malaria and schistosomiasis co-infect patients in endemic areas. There is no systematic screening of schistosomiasis and some patients may hide it because of stigmatisation. On the other hand, malaria treatment is very frequently given in these areas sometimes even without any biological confirmation. This is a proof of concept study that shows some evidence of efficacy of antimalarial drugs, particularly artesunate-pyronaridine and to some lesser extent artemether-lumefantrine on schistosomiasis. These findings if confirmed in larger and well-designed prospective studies highlight the potential double benefit of controlling and managing both parasitic infections simultaneously.
