Regular administration of deworming drugs to whole at-risk populations is the recommended strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in humans. Repeated rounds of deworming drug administration could lead to emerging drug resistance.
In this study, we examined the efficacy of the deworming drug albendazole 400 mg (“Alzental”) against hookworm in Đắk Lắk province, Vietnam. Efficacy is measured by calculating cure rates and egg reduction rates after Alzental treatment. We also compared two different diagnostic methods for detecting and quantifying STH infections–a microscopy approach with sodium nitrate flotation, and a molecular approach with quantitative PCR.
We show the efficacy of Alzental is within the range previously reported for albendazole and we found no evidence of emerging drug resistance. SNF and qPCR may provide more convenient, and more sensitive alternatives to the current standard diagnostic tool (the Kato Katz thick smear).
