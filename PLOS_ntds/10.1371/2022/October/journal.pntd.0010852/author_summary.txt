Although some disparities in terms of prevalence and infection intensities have been acknowledged within and between schistosomiasis endemic areas, the current control measures did not take into consideration the disparities within endemic areas. To improve the control of schistosomiasis, a fine-scale mapping of schistosome infections and their intensities were undertaken using KK in comparison to POC-CCA to identify sub-districts with potential high transmission risk and where control operations must be boosted to achieve elimination. After the identification of schistosome infections by the point of care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) and Kato-Katz (KK) test, the geographical coordinates of each infected child’s house were recorded using a global position system device (GPS). QGIS software was used to create a map showing schistosome infections and their infection intensities. Our results showed that the majority of infected children and those bearing heavy infection intensities were clustering mostly in Baloua, Carrière and Mock-Sud sub-districts of Makenene while children with light and moderate infection intensity were widely distributed and far away from risky biotopes. The fine-scale mapping of schistosome infections and their infection intensities enable to identify hotspot transmission sites where control strategy must be boosted to achieve the elimination of intestinal schistosomiasis in Makenene.
