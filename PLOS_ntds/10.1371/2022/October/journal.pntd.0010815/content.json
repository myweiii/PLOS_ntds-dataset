    "Introduction": "Campylobacter is a Gram-negative fastidious organism that requires specific atmospheric and nutritional requirements for successful culture and isolation. In high income countries, campylobacteriosis is one of the most common forms of bacterial enteritis and it is often stated that more than 95% of infections are caused by either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli [1]. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where campylobacteriosis is an endemic disease associated with gastroenteritis, environmental enteropathy, and growth stunting in children, disease has been shown to be associated with other Campylobacter species besides just C. jejuni and C. coli [2–6]. Due to challenges that limit culturing of Campylobacter isolates these types of infections can often be overlooked, particularly in LMICs where they are most prevalent [7].\nTo overcome inadequate culturing of pathogens, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States has highlighted the importance of culture independent diagnostic technologies (CIDTs) for the detection and quantification of foodborne bacterial illnesses [8–10]. Several CIDTs for Campylobacter species have been developed that are either antigen-based or nucleic acid amplification-based [11]. Indeed, large-scale epidemiologic studies have relied on CIDTs including quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), either in stand-alone assays or associated with array card technologies (BioFire, BD Diagnostics/ Enteric Bacterial Panel, Applied Biosystems), to determine infection and colonization in human samples [7,12–14]. Yet, these CIDTs target C. jejuni and/or C. coli rather than all Campylobacter species.\nWith the rapid expansion, increasing portability, and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a potential sensitive alternative to PCR-based diagnostics is shotgun metagenomics. This CIDT enables the resolution of multiple Campylobacter species that are rarely cultured and for which specific probes have not been developed, as well as other pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal populations present in a sample [15]. Additionally, it has the potential to overcome the major CIDT issue of not providing a pathogen genome for source traceback or outbreak investigations for public health agencies without reflex culturing [16,17]. Determining the genetic complexity and polyclonality of Campylobacter species in fecal samples from children living in highly endemic settings is a requisite for understanding transmission dynamics and attaining accurate source attribution.\nPrevious studies occurring in Peru have identified stool samples positive for Campylobacter by 16S rRNA gene-based PCR probes, and further differentiated for C. jejuni and C. coli via qPCR using the cadF gene. In many cases C. jejuni and C. coli were also successfully cultured from these samples. However, culturing unidentified Campylobacter species from stool samples positive for Campylobacter by 16S rRNA PCR but negative for C. jejuni and C. coli by cadF qPCR has yet to be consistently successful [5,13]. Thus, in this study, we utilize whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing (WGMS), as a CIDT, to detect and identify the presence of other Campylobacter species besides C. jejuni and C. coli in fecal samples from children in Peru.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nSamples used in this study were collected as a study approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Asociacion Benefica Prisma (Lima, Peru) and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Baltimore, MD, USA). Consent to participate in the study was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of children. Participants of both studies consented for further use of biological specimens.\n\n\nBiological samples\nArchived fecal samples were derived from children enrolled in a community-based cohort study in Iquitos, Loreto, Peru. Between 2009 and 2018, 303 children were enrolled within 17 days of birth and followed for five years. Details of enrollment and surveillance procedures have been previously described [18]. Children were visited twice weekly to create a continuous daily record of early life childhood illness. Stool was collected monthly and in children experiencing diarrhea defined as >3 unformed stools in a 24-hour period. For this study we randomly chose 50 fecal samples for shotgun metagenomic sequencing out of 124 fecal samples that had previously shown to be positive for Campylobacter (16S rRNA gene PCR) but were negative for the cadF gene associated with the major thermotolerant species, C. jejuni and C. coli. These fecal samples were part of a pool of 439 symptomatic and asymptomatic fecal samples for which selection criteria has been published previously [5]. These archived samples had been stored at -80°C after initial collection.\n\n\nNucleic acid diagnostics\nFecal DNA was extracted from 0.2 grams of feces using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Carlsbald, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A negative control consisting of RNA and DNA free water was used for each extraction set. All samples were processed using a Taqman based multiplex qPCR assay to detect Campylobacter spp. (16S rRNA gene), Campylobacter jejuni and/or Campylobacter coli (cadF gene), and Shigella sp. (ipaH gene), using the primers and probes specified in S1 Table. The final assay consisted of a 25 μL final reaction mixture with 12.5 μL of Environmental Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.5 ul of forward and reverse primers (0.2 μM each), 0.25 μl of probes (0.1 uM each), 1 μL of DNA template and 6.75 μl of nuclease-free water (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The assays were performed on a QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minutes. DNA from previously confirmed C. coli and C. jejuni were used as positive controls. Template-free controls (nuclease-free water) were included as negative controls. A cut-off cycle threshold of 38 was used to determine positivity. A sample positive for both the 16S rRNA and cadF genes was interpreted as positive for either C. coli or C. jejuni.\n\n\nShotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing\nDepending on the sample, 20 to 1,500 ng of DNA extracted from fecal samples was sheared in a 50 μL screwcap microtube using a Covaris M220 instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA) at 50 peak power, 20 duty factor, 20°C, 200 cycles per burst and 25–31 seconds duration. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA High-Throughput Library Preparation Kit with Standard PCR Amplification Module (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA), following the manufacturer’s instructions except for the following changes: libraries were prepared using 1/4th volumes for all steps except size selected to ~500–1500 bp following double-sided size selection protocols with modified volumes of 41ul PEG/NaCL solution and 5ul AMPure XP beads. Indexing of each individual sample was done using standard desalted TruSeq HT dual index adapters from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) at 0.75 μM final concentration, and a total of 3–18 PCR cycles were used to minimize bias. Libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit, except with 10 μl volume and 90 s annealing/extension PCR, and then pooled and normalized to 4 nM. Pooled libraries were re-quantified by ddPCR on a QX200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), using the Illumina TruSeq ddPCR Library Quantification Kit and following the manufacturer’s protocols, except with an extended 2-min annealing/extension time. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (v2 500-cycle kit; Illumina, San Diego, CA) per the manufacturer’s protocols. Average sequence read lengths for each sample were >188 nucleotides. Short read data are available at NCBI SRA and are associated with BioProject PRJNA834762.\n\n\nDetection of Campylobacter species from shotgun metagenomics\nIdentification of Campylobacter species was performed using the Map to Reference command within Geneious Prime (v2021.2.2; Biomatters, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Illumina paired-end reads >80 nt generated from an individual fecal sample were simultaneously mapped to 28 Campylobacter chromosomes, including: [1] Candidatus Campylobacter infans str. 19S00001 (CP049075.1), [2] C. avium str. LMG 24591 (CP022347.1), C. canadensis str. LMG 24001 (CP035946.1), C. coli str. 14983A (CP017025.1), C. coli plasmid pCC14983A-1 (CP017026.1), C. concisus str. ATCC 33237 (CP012541.1), C. corcagiensis str. LMG 27932 (CP053842.1), C. curvus str. ATCC 35224 (CP053826.1), C. fetus str. NCTC 10354 (CP043435.1), C. gracilis str.

NCTC 13004 (CP015578.1), C. lari str. RM2100 (CP000932.1), C. mucosalis str. ATCC 43264 (CP053831.1), C. pinnipediorum str. RM17261 (CP012547.1), C. rectus str. ATCC 33238 (CP012543.1), C. showae str. ATCC 51146 (CP012544.1), C. sputorum str. LMG 7795 (CP043427.1), C. subantarcticus str. LMG 24377 (CP007773.1), C. upsaliensis str. NCTC 11541 (LR134372.1), C. ureolyticus str. RIGS 9880 (CP012195.1), C. volucrus str. LMG 24380 (CP043428.1), and C. vulpis str. 251/13 (CP041617). In total, 44 shotgun metagenomic samples with the number of reads ranging from 1,404 to 2,975,084 reads were mapped to each of the Campylobacter references using the low sensitivity settings (<10% mismatch between read and references), and the total number of reads mapped to each reference genome were determined. Reads mapping to genomic loci conserved between Campylobacter species (>90% sequence similarity between species; rRNA loci, antimicrobial genes, transposon genes, IS elements, and bacteriophage genes) were removed from the read mapping counts. These reads were determined to be non-confirmatory reads for only one species and could be mapped to multiple Campylobacter species or other bacterial genera. Reads were determined to be species confirmatory when BLASTn against the NCBI nucleotide (nr/nt) database resulted in the identification of a single Campylobacter species as the highest match, and the read was also mapped to the same Campylobacter species in Geneious. Additionally, the species confirmatory read should have a BLASTn >95% DNA identity across >85% of the read for a particular Campylobacter species. Metagenomic samples were scored as positive for a specific Campylobacter species when at least one species confirmatory read mapped to the genome. When <50 reads mapped to a particular genome in a sample, all reads were analyzed via BLASTn to determine if they were species confirmatory reads.\n\n\nShotgun metagenomic data analysis\nIllumina reads for an individual sample were run through the MetaWRAP pipeline [19] to characterize the entire microbial population of the sample. Initially the reads were quality trimmed and index removal using Trim Galore!(v0.6.5) and human DNA contamination was removed by mapping reads to the human GRCh37/hg19 reference genome using BMTagger [20]. Next, trimmed and cleaned reads were assembled using the metaSPAdes assembler (v3.12.0) [21], and the quality of the initial assemblies assessed using QUAST [22]. The taxonomic abundance of the initial assembled contigs and all the sequence reads were determined using Kraken2 (v2.0.8) [23,24] against the standard Kraken2 database and visualized using KronaTools [25]. Next, the metaSPAdes assembly and trimmed and cleaned reads were used to bin the contigs using both Metabat2 [26] and CONCOCT [27] programs. The initial bins were refined, screened for completeness and contamination using CheckM software (v1.0.12) [28], and consolidated into bins with at least 50% completeness and less than 10% contamination. The bins were then visualized using Blobology software [29], re-assembled using the initial refined and consolidated bins, and screened for completeness and contamination using CheckM again. Finally, the taxonomy of each contig in the different bins were assigned using Taxator-tk software [30] and annotated using Prokka [31]. Taxonomic reports generated by Kraken2 were exported as a biom file using Kraken-biom [32] and the alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomic profiles of the stool samples were determined using R software (v4.1.2) with the phyloseq [33], microbiome [34], and vegan [35] packages.",
    "Results": "Metagenomic detection of Campylobacter species\nFrom the 50 archived fecal samples analyzed, we were able to successfully sequence and obtain data from 44 samples. Total DNA recovery from the 44 samples was quite variable and resulted in total reads per sample between 1,410 and 2,975,084 paired-reads, while overall 84% of samples had more than 150,000 reads (Table 1). The variability of DNA from the samples might be due to DNA degradation following long-term storage of the fecal samples. Nevertheless, we decided to analyze all samples with reads since previous WGMS results of infant stool samples had identified a target organism (C. infans) at >80% of all reads [36]. Mapping the sample reads against the genomes from 28 different Campylobacter species identified 41 out of 44 samples (93%) that were positive for Campylobacter reads. There were three samples in which no Campylobacter species was detected (97077, 118488, 130169). Despite negative qPCR results for C. jejuni and C. coli in these 44 samples, reads that matched C. jejuni (28/44 (63.6%)) and C. coli (6/44 (13.6%)) were identified in a majority of samples. Other Campylobacter species reads were identified in 28 samples with C. infans (26/44 (59.1%)), C. upsaliensis (4/44 (9.1%)), C. concisus (3/44 (6.8%)), C. helveticus (1/44 (2.3%)), and C. curvus (1/44 (2.3%) (Table 1). C. concisus, C. curvus, C. helveticus and C. upsaliensis were only identified in diarrheal fecal samples from children that were 10 months or more in age (Fig 1).\nCampylobacter concisus, Campylobacter curvus, Campylobacter helveticus, and Campylobacter upsaliensis are only found in diarrheal fecal samples from children over 10 months of age.\n\n\nFactors affecting species specificity of metagenomic reads\nMetagenomic reads mapping to conserved genomic regions can affect specificity issues in the detection of Campylobacter species. The reads that mapped to the rRNA loci possessed >90% identity with multiple Campylobacter species due to sequence conservation of all rRNA genes. Upon BLASTn analysis, many of these mapped reads had higher scores to other genera including Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. Among the reference DNA sequences, the C. coli plasmid, pCC14983A-1 (CP017026) was included. This plasmid possesses transposon genes, a tetracycline resistance gene, and type VI secretion system genes that are common in plasmids and chromosomal loci from multiple Campylobacter species and other genera. There were 39 samples that had reads that mapped to the plasmid, and most reads mapped to the tetracycline resistance gene. Additionally, many of Campylobacter reference sequences possessed prophage, IS elements, and transposons that are shared among various Campylobacter species and other bacterial genera. These regions were often the only sites in certain Campylobacter reference sequences where reads mapped. For example, reads mapped to tet(M) gene and its associated mobile element of Campylobacter lanienae (CP015578) (S1A Fig). Reads that mapped to any of these regions in a Campylobacter genome were determined to be non-confirmatory reads for only one species and were eliminated from further analysis (S2 Table).\nBased on the high prevalence of C. infans in these samples and the previous findings of C. infans in stool samples from infants in various LMIC [36], the 26 C. infans positive samples were examined in detail. Fourteen of the 26 C. infans positive samples had between 1 and 32 reads mapped to the C. infans genome. BLASTn analysis of all 176 total reads from these 14 samples against the NCBI nr/nt nucleotide database resulted in identification of C. infans strain 19S00001 as the only BLASTn match, or the highest scoring match. Additionally, the reads from the 14 samples did not represent common sequence reads between these different samples. Twelve of the 26 C. infans positive samples had >50 paired-reads. Three samples 25500, 150687 (S1B Fig, as an example) and 19879 from diarrheal infants provided over 10,000 paired-reads mapping to the C. infans genome, resulting in approximately 1x, 5x and 9x coverages, respectively.\n\n\nCo-infection with multiple Campylobacter spp\nThe metagenomics analysis by reference assembly in Geneious detected 27 samples (65.9%) of analyzed stool with more than a single species of Campylobacter present in the same stool sample. Among these 27 infants that were co-infected with different Campylobacter species, five infants (12.2%) were co-infected with three Campylobacter species and one infant (3.0%) was co-infected with six Campylobacter species, including C. jejuni, C. infans, C. curvus, C. concisus, C. helveticus and C. upsaliensis. Three samples contained C. jejuni, C. infans and C. upsaliensis. Four samples were co-infected with C. concisus and C. infans (Table 1).\n\n\nDetection of C. infans using MetaWrap\nAnalysis of the shotgun metagenomic reads using the MetaWRAP pipeline resulted in the same identification of Campylobacter species reads for samples that had >500 reads mapped to a Campylobacter species. For samples 25500, 150687 and 19879, that possessed the most C. infans reads according to reference mapping, MetaWRAP binning modules binned (>50% completeness and <10% contamination) C. infans (Campylobacter sp. CGEMS) reads. According to Kraken2 module for sample 25500, 23% of all sequence reads and 68% of assembled reads were C. infans (Fig 2). For both samples 150687 and 19879, 6% of all reads were C. infans and 7% of assembled reads were C. infans, respectively (Fig 3). For other samples, MetaWRAP identified Campylobacter species specific reads from total reads in 36/37 (97.3%) of the samples, including C. infans as greater than 20% of the overall Campylobacter reads in samples 19879, 31204, 34891, 41480, 63792, 97770, 108338, 118291, 132208, 147585, and 150322, Overall, MetaWRAP analysis identified 11/37 (29.7%) of the samples had co-infections with multiple Campylobacter species based on two or more Campylobacter species associated with at least 10% of the Campylobacter reads each (Table 2).\nAdditionally, those sequence reads can be assembled into partial or complete genomes that can be used for source tracking or studying transmission dynamics unlike other molecular tools. A. Kronogram used to represent/display that 23% of total sequencing reads and 98% of the Campylobacter specific sequencing reads are matching C. infans, and provides a breakdown of the number of sequence reads generated for that sample the match Campylobacter species at the different taxonomic levels. B. Kronogram used to represent/display that when present in high enough concentrations as for this sample, identified Campylobacter species can be partially or completely genome assembled using a standard analysis pipeline and provides a breakdown of the number of assembled reads generated for that sample the match Campylobacter species at the different taxonomic levels. For this sample, 68% of all the assembled reads and 100% of the Campylobacter contigs for this sample were identified as C. infans. C. Shotgun metagenomic analysis pipelines can also rely on software to bin reads/contigs based on various parameters such as GC content of the data. Blobplot of all the assembled contigs that were binned from the sample based on percentage of GC content at the Order level of taxonomic identification, which demonstrates Campylobacterales as the dominate Order in the assembled contigs and that the binning process of the shotgun metagenomic analysis can also identify Campylobacter species from the stool samples. The Campylobacter bin contained 15 contigs that equals 20,789 bp or 1.2% of the genome.\nStandard pipeline analysis was still able use shotgun metagenomics to determine the presence of C. infans in the stool sample and identify multiple Campylobacter species present in the stool sample. A. Kronogram used to represent/display that 6% of total sequencing reads and 97% of the Campylobacter specific sequencing reads are matching C. infans, and provides a breakdown of the number of sequence reads generated for that sample the match Campylobacter species at the different taxonomic levels. B. Kronogram used to represent/display that when present in high enough concentrations as for this sample, identified Campylobacter species can be partially or completely genome assembled using a standard analysis pipeline and provides a breakdown of the number of assembled reads generated for that sample the match Campylobacter species at the different taxonomic levels. For this sample, 7% of all the assembled reads and 98% of the Campylobacter contigs for this sample were identified as C. infans. C. Shotgun metagenomic analysis pipelines can also rely on software to bin reads/contigs based on various parameters such as GC content of the data. Blobplot of all the assembled contigs that were binned from the sample based on percentage of GC content at the Order level of taxonomic identification, which demonstrates Campylobacterales was binned during the process of the shotgun metagenomic analysis even with high levels of sequence reads not associated with Campylobacter and many additional bins generated from the stool sample, thus many different aspects of metagenomic analysis can identify Campylobacter species from stool samples. The Campylobacter bin contained 150 contigs that equals 1,676,492 bp or 95.6% of the C. infans genome. However, there were 171 contigs overall assembled to various Campylobacter species equaling 1,781,027 bp from the sample including 11 additional C. infans contigs that were not binned for a total C. infans genome of 1,740,218 bp or 99.2% of the complete genome.\nMetaWRAP analysis also identified other organisms in each of these samples including potential diarrheal pathogens and intestinal flora. An advantage of shotgun metagenomics is the identification of the fecal microbiome in the samples from Peruvian children with Campylobacter species, thus allowing additional analysis of the fecal microbiome like the impact of high Campylobacter abundance or number of Campylobacter species on the alpha and/or beta diversity of the fecal microbiome (S2 Fig). For infant diarrheal sample 25500, 7% of the gut microbiome was identified as Escherichia coli and 32% was Bifidobacterium sp. For both samples 150687 and 19879, E. coli reads were the larger portion of the gut microbiome at 41% and 37% and Bifidobacterium sp. was 16% and 0%, respectively. Besides E. coli, 67% of reads for sample 19879 were from the family Enterobacteriaceae including 9% reads from Klebsiella sp. An additional advantage of shotgun metagenomics is that each of these dominate bacteria in the fecal microbiome from the different samples can be genome assembled and binned during the pipeline analysis, as was demonstrated in the majority of the fecal samples in this study (S3 Fig). Having these bins then allows for further studies such as the role these commensals or other enteric pathogens have in interacting with different Campylobacter species in the infants intestinal tract.",
    "Discussion": "We have previously demonstrated that stools from which Campylobacter is identified using qPCR, but C. jejuni and C. coli are not identified, have an elevated risk of watery diarrhea suggesting that at least some of these less well-known Campylobacter species result in clinical diarrhea in LMICs [5]. Herein, we demonstrated a method that identified Campylobacter species by mapping WSMS reads to the genomes of 27 different Campylobacter species using the reference assembler within Geneious Prime software, although, other assemblers could be used. Indeed, the metaWRAP pipeline retrieved similar results, identifying multiple Campylobacter species. The WSMS of stool samples that were previously identified as positive for Campylobacter by CIDT via 16S qPCR demonstrated how this second global CIDT process can broadly identify Campylobacter species and co-infections with multiple Campylobacters. We demonstrate that mapping the sample reads against the Campylobacter species genomes identified 41 out of 44 samples positive for Campylobacter. As previously observed [36], co-infections with multiple Campylobacter species, including C. infans and other atypical Campylobacter species including C. upsaliensis and C. concisus was demonstrated.\nIn this proof-of-principle study, we selected a group of archived samples from children who had tested positive for Campylobacter with a non-selective PCR probe for all Campylobacter species, but were negative for the cadF gene, one of the most common targets used to identify C. jejuni and C. coli from other Campylobacter species, particularly in LMICs. To our surprise, the majority of the samples contained C. jejuni and/or C. coli, despite the fact that the metagenomics and qPCR assays were run on the same extraction. This demonstrates that PCR using standard primers for the detection of the cadF gene is less sensitive than previously recognized.\nWhole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing (WSMS) as a supportive, species defining CIDT strategy provides more than just confirmation of a Campylobacter species. First, our results demonstrate that WSMS can identify Campylobacter species even when the sample provides limited sequencing reads (as low as 1,400 reads), but the ability to identify the Campylobacter species depends on the amount of these organisms within the microbiome. When levels of Campylobacter were high, as seen for sample 150687 (S1B Fig), many distinct reads from around the genome were mapped. In fact, for samples with high read counts to a specific Campylobacter species, remapping the reads to diverse variable regions of the species from multiple strains, such as lipooligosaccharide and capsule biosynthesis loci [37–39], will provide additional details to the strains in the samples. At lower levels, where fewer reads were mapped, the reads discriminatory power needs to be addressed through BLASTn analysis and elimination of mapped reads that were associated with non-discriminatory regions like the rRNA loci or transposons. Species-non-confirmatory reads, such as reads mapping to rRNA loci, can map to more than one genome, and in some cases different types of bacteria. In cases where there are few reads that identify a species, species-non-confirmatory reads would require a BLASTn search, which would identify different species and reduce the level of identification accordingly. When there are species-confirmatory reads and non-confirmatory reads, the non-confirmatory reads may help validate one of species but should be used with caution to only confirm based on the species-confirmatory reads. Our study indicates that removal of bacterial conserved sequences such as rRNA loci is required to reduce false species calls. This has been described previously [40]. Finally, despite identifying Campylobacter species reads, samples with very few total sequence reads were not very useful for species confirmation or additional analysis since there are few confirmatory reads mapped to the pathogens being detected or to other organisms of the microbiome. Instead, samples that provide a few million reads would be more useful.\nWSMS requires only a single sequencing method and given the breadth of species in the Campylobacter genus, a relatively efficient approach to unequivocal species identification. PCR and qPCR require distinct primer pairs for each organism to be detected and possible changes to conditions. Also, PCR/qPCR requires additional validation when altering the detectable species. With 27 possible Campylobacter species PCR/qPCR specific primer design quickly becomes impractical. Even designing a single 16S gene amplicon-based sequencing method requires determination and validation of new PCR conditions and primers to ensure each Campylobacter species may be distinguished. Using shotgun metagenomics, we utilize a method that works when there is DNA and can detect targeted organisms when there are enough reads. In this study, we were able to assemble a C. infans genome at over 95% complete for source tracking and/or transmission dynamics for one of our samples, which is useful given the nearly universal inability to culture this pathogen and lack of standardized culture protocols.\nFurthermore, even validated primers like the cadF gene primers for C. jejuni and/or C. coli can produce false negatives, as demonstrated by the results of this study where over 60% of the samples were actually positive for C. jejuni and/or C. coli after a negative cadF qPCR. Third, WSMS allows multiple Campylobacter species, including different strains of the same species to be identified from a single sample. Many of the species within the Campylobacter genus are more than 10% different, so most reads only have the potential to map to the genome of one species. There are some regions that are more conserved (<10% different) between species and reads mapping to these regions are non-confirmatory. Finally, WSMS provides sequence information regarding other members of the microbiota, identify other enteric pathogens, and co-infections between Campylobacter and these other enteric bacterial organisms.\nThe most notable finding of this study was the number of samples which contained concurrent infections with multiple species of Campylobacter, which has recently been observed in LMIC settings [36,41]. This suggests that prolonged and persisting mixed infections are occurring in this population. The infant population under study is chronically undernourished with a high level of intestinal inflammation, which may facilitate prolonged carriage, such as the increased rate of isolation of C. concisus in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [42]. Chronic infection, in some cases over years, have been reported in immunocompromised hosts [43], and even in hosts with no evident compromised immune system as a result of microbial factors, such as a cell invasion protein [44]. Given that Campylobacter is closely related to Helicobacter, the ability of the microbe to persist in the host as a result of microbial factors is also plausible. Lastly, changes in the microbiome in the chronically infected population may be more permissive for the establishment and maintenance of Campylobacter. We have previously established that specific taxa in this cohort are associated with Campylobacter infection [44] and identified microbes that are associated with an increased risk of infection (Ruminococcus gnavus (ASV23), Dialister (ASV26), Prevotella (ASV204 and ASV275)) and taxa that are associated with a decreased risk of Campylobacter infection (Bacteroides ovatus (ASV40), Ruminococcus toraues (ASV242), Bacteroides (ASv27) and Lachnospiraceae.\nC. infans was identifiable in 59.1% (26/44) fecal samples that were determined to have Campylobacter by a genus specific PCR assay, and that did not amplify the cadF gene. This potential new species of Campylobacter has only been isolated once from a patient in Europe, yet it was shown to be prevalent in fecal samples from children in Southeast Asia and Africa [36, 45, 46]. There is still limited information associated with the presence of this species and the occurrence of gastrointestinal diseases. Further studies are needed to inform its potential pathogenicity. Given the co-infection with C. infans and C. concisus in three infants, we hypothesize that C. infans presence may be associated with previously described decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract with an increased presence of oropharyngeal flora in the stool of undernourished children [47].\nPolyclonal pathogen populations facilitate the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in the infected host through the selection of resistant strains [48]. Our data suggest that co-infection of multiple Campylobacter species in settings of intense transmission is common and may facilitate the development of resistance and propagation of multidrug resistant Campylobacter in response to clinical therapeutics in LMIC at a higher rate than in the US or Europe where monoclonal Campylobacter infections are likely the rule. The emergence of multidrug resistant Campylobacter is often considered attributable principally to antibiotic usage in livestock and poultry production. However, our findings could suggest that in LMIC contexts, human antibiotic use may also play an important role but further investigation is needed to draw a definitive conclusion.",
    "Conclusion": "WSMS was able to efficiently identify Campylobacter species other than C. jejuni and C. coli. Other non-jejuni and non-coli Campylobacter species are prevalent among children in Peru, of which Candidatus “C. infans” was the most frequently identified Campylobacter species, although C. upsaliensis, C. concisus, C. helveticus and C. curvus were also identified. Children in Peru infected with Campylobacter often have multiple species present in the intestinal tract at one time."
