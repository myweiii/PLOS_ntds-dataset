The International Health Regulations (IHR) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework was developed by the World Health Organization to provide strategies to monitor and assess how countries are building their core public health capacities under IHR (2005). The framework has four components: annual reporting on IHR capacities (mandatory), Joint External Evaluation, simulation exercises and After Action Review (AAR). In November 2019, an outbreak of Lassa Fever occurred among health workers in a non-endemic district in Sierra Leone. The outbreak resulted in five cases, including two deaths and two exported cases to the Netherlands. The outbreak tested multiple technical capacities in the IHR (2005) in a real-life setting. We therefore conducted an AAR to assess how well the country responded to the outbreak. This hospital associated outbreak likely occurred due to a breach in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. The response launched after detection of the outbreak successfully contained the outbreak within one incubation period. Areas that worked well included coordination, contact tracing, active case search and ring IPC. Areas that needed improvement were cliniciansâ€™ knowledge on Lassa Fever, delays in accessing local emergency funding and late distribution of IPC and laboratory supplies.
