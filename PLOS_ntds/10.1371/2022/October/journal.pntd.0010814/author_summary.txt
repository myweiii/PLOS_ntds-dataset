Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is one of the neglected zoonotic diseases. Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus sensu latu are the causative agents responsible for alveolar echinococcosis and cystic echinococcosis, respectively. Alveolar echinococcosis is mainly endemic in the areas of the northern hemisphere, whereas cystic echinococcosis has a worldwide distribution. The disease has a long latent period of up to 5 to 10 years and is largely underdiagnosed, partially due to the lack of effective early diagnostic approaches. In recent years, an emerging role of EVs in intercellular communication and diagnosis has been recognized. Here, we employed a proteomic approach to identify parasite-derived proteins in the serum EVs from E. multilocularis-infected mice and assessed their diagnostic values. This study signify the role of EVs for the identification of diagnostic candidates by the discovery of two identified proteins, TER ATPas and TPX-1. First results indicate their diagnostic and prognostic values in experimental murine and human echinococcosis.
