Amphotericin B is increasingly used in treatment of leishmaniasis. Antimicrobial resistance is a persistent threat for any drugs and although reports of resistance to amphotericin B are rare in the field, it is something that cannot be ignored since this drug is used in leishmaniasis relapse cases and is indicated to treat other infectious diseases such as mycoses. Here, we report the selection and characterisation of fourteen independent lines of Leishmania mexicana and one of L. infantum resistant to amphotericin B or its analogue nystatin. Sterol profiles were altered in all resistant lines compared to wild-type. The predominant wild-type sterol, ergosta-5,7,24-trienol, was replaced by other sterol intermediates. In one set of mutants this could be attributed to loss of heterozygosity derived from mutations in the sterol methyl transferase (C24SMT) gene locus and in a second set the sterol C5 desaturase (C5DS) gene was changed. Differences in sensitivity to amphotericin B were apparent in cells grown in serum free defined medium compared to serum containing HOMEM and metabolomics analysis indicated that AmB promotes oxidative stress when serum is present but not in its absence. While some lines lost virulence in mouse infections others displayed heightened virulence in mice whilst all cell lines retaining their resistance phenotype emphasising the risk of resistance emerging in patients.
