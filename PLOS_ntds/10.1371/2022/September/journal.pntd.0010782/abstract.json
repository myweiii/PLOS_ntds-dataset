    "Abstract": "Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease that affects a wide range of warm-blooded host species. Neotropical primates (New World Primates; NWP) are highly susceptible, developing a lethal acute systemic disease. Toxoplasmosis in free-ranging NWP is poorly described, with only a few studies based on serosurveys. Herein we performed a retrospective study focusing on the epidemiology and pathology of toxoplasmosis among 1,001 free-ranging marmoset (Callithrix spp.) deaths from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This study included marmosets necropsied at the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria Jorge Vaitsman (IJV) from January 2017 to July 2019, which were found dead from all regions in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to better characterize toxoplasmosis in this free-ranging population. All samples were also tested for Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) RT-qPCR by the official diagnostic service. A total of 1,001 free-ranging marmosets were included in this study, with 16 (1.6%) cases of lethal Toxoplasma gondii infections identified both as individual cases and in outbreaks. Presence of infection was not associated with sex, age, geographical distribution, or year of death, and no co-infection with YFV was observed. The main pathological feature in these cases was random necrotizing hepatitis with detection of intralesional T. gondii zoites in all infected cases. Interstitial pneumonia rich in alveolar foamy macrophages and fibrin deposition, necrotizing myocarditis and necrotizing splenitis were also pathological features in affected marmosets. Therefore, toxoplasmosis was considered the cause of death in 1.6% of free-ranging marmosets in this retrospective series, including some cases associated with outbreaks. Necrotizing random hepatitis was a consistent pathological finding in affected cases and sampling of liver should be ensured from Callitrichid post mortem cases."
