Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and enteric parasite co-infection not only aggravates the clinical symptoms of parasites but also accelerates acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. In China, despite a large number of HIV-infected people, the data regarding co-infection with enteric intracellular parasites in this population is still sparse. In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba histolytica and Cyclospora cayetanensis in 384 HIV/AIDS including 308 MSM HIV/AIDS populations in two designated AIDS hospitals in Heilongjiang Province, North-East China between April 2016 and July 2017 by polymerase chain reaction. We also try to track the possible sources, risk factors, and any associations, with clinical significance, of human parasitic infections. Such knowledge will provide insights into prognosis, treatment, and preventive strategies against infections with such pathogens. The findings in this study have important implications for public health, the control of AIDS progression and control of parasitic infections.
