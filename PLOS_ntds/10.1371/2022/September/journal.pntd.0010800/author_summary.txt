Chromoblastomycosis is a neglected fungal disease that mainly affects low-income agricultural workers and rural population. The high misdiagnosis rate of chromoblastomycosis is a major challenge in dermatology, especially for rural hospitals. With the increase in the disease severity, infections may bring significant limitations to labor activities. Severe lesions tend to respond slowly or even become non-responding to antifungal drugs. A direct microscopic examination can find pathogens with typical characteristics; so, this technology must be promoted and mastered through short-term training in rural hospitals. The disease is an implantation mycosis, and therefore, wearing protective clothing and shoes are effective measures to prevent these diseases. The treatment choice and results depend on the patientsâ€™ lesion grade. Mild cases respond well to systemic agents, whereas high doses and a long treatment and combination therapy are the first treatment choices for severe forms. This study presents clinical features, mycological findings, pathogens, treatments, and outcomes of CBM from Zhejiang, Eastern China.
