Noma is orofacial gangrene that rapidly disintegrates the hard and soft tissue of the face. The mortality rate of Noma varies between 85–90%. The remaining 10–15% of Noma survivors permanently suffer from severe facial deformities. Noma is a widely neglected disease affecting poor people globally. Most cases of Noma are reported from the so-called Noma belt, located south of the Sahara and runs across Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia. Though Ethiopia is one of the countries in the Noma-belt region where people, particularly children, are significantly affected by the disease, the attention given to this devastating condition is remained to be very low. Therefore, we believe that assessing the severity and sequela of Noma in Ethiopia is crucially essential to lay bare the burden of the disease and increase the overall understanding of the condition among different stakeholders. We are also convinced that the study’s findings can serve as baseline data for further in-depth scientific investigations and preventive policy development.
