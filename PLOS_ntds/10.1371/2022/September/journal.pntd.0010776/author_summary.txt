Cryptosporidiosis remains a neglected infectious disease, even in high-income countries. Most of the reported cases and outbreaks are related to drinking water and recreational water contaminated with Cryptosporidium spp. In Europe, the search for Cryptosporidium spp. and other parasites in stool or water samples is not routinely performed by laboratories, especially in the absence of dedicated national guidance on testing. In France, cryptosporidiosis is not a notifiable disease. In order to better assess the pathogens involved in foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks a new outbreak investigation strategy was implemented in the French Armed Forces including: systematic stool sampling, routine syndromic multiplex PCR diagnoses, and pathogens genotyping. After several unexplained gastroenteritis outbreaks in a military camp in France, we identified the same C. hominis IbA10G2 isolate in the stools of patients and in the entire water distribution network. The highest levels of contamination were found in groundwater and in the water leaving the treatment plant. Our study demonstrates the value of syndromic diagnosis for gastroenteritis outbreaks investigation and highlights the importance of better assessing the microbiological risks associated with raw water.
