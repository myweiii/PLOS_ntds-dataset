Toxocariasis is a neglected parasitic disease of humans caused mainly by larvae of Toxocara canis. Given that T. canis is zoonotic and can infect a range of mammals, there has been substantial interest in host-parasite relationships, with studies showing that T. canis larvae secrete abundant mucins that effect/modulate immune responses and disease pathogenesis. To improve the understanding of immunomolecular interactions, we investigated the role(s) of the protein component of a mucin (Tc-MUC-1) secreted by infective larvae using a well-defined murine macrophage line (RAW264.7). The non-glycosylated recombinant protein of Tc-MUC-1 (designated rTc-MUC-1) was shown to interact with at least 219 proteins of RAW264.7 cells, particularly with the actin binding protein (CFL1) and a fatty acid binding protein (FABP5), which are involved in cell migration and phagocytosis, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose that Tc-MUC-1 regulates cytoskeletal organisation and signal transduction in host macrophages. It would be interesting to establish, using the integrative experimental approach employed here, whether the role(s) of Tc-MUC-1 protein homologues of related ascaridoids are conserved.
