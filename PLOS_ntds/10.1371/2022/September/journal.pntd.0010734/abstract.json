    "Abstract": "Toxocariasis is a neglected parasitic disease caused predominantly by larvae of Toxocara canis. While this zoonotic disease is of major importance in humans and canids, it can also affect a range of other mammalian hosts. It is known that mucins secreted by larvae play key roles in immune recognition and evasion, but very little is understood about the molecular interactions between host cells and T. canis. Here, using an integrative approach (affinity pull-down, mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and bioinformatics), we identified 219 proteins expressed by a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) that interact with prokaryotically-expressed recombinant protein (rTc-MUC-1) representing the mucin Tc-MUC-1 present in the surface coat of infective larvae of T. canis. Protein-protein interactions between rTc-MUC-1 and an actin binding protein CFL1 as well as the fatty acid binding protein FABP5 of RAW264.7 macrophages were also demonstrated in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293T). By combing predicted structural information on the protein-protein interaction and functional knowledge of the related protein association networks, we inferred roles for Tc-MUC-1 protein in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal remodelling, and the migration and phagosome formation of macrophage cells. These molecular interactions now require verification in vivo. The experimental approach taken here should be readily applicable to comparative studies of other ascaridoid nematodes (e.g. T. cati, Anisakis simplex, Ascaris suum and Baylisascaris procyonis) whose larvae undergo tissue migration in accidental hosts, including humans."
