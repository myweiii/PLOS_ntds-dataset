Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a neglected vector borne disease endemic in Palestine. It is transmitted by Phlebotomus spp. that inhabits hyrax (the main reservoir animal) dens. Despite the implementation of sanitation measures and insecticidal spraying in affected domestic areas, human cases are still reported. This suggests that complementary control measures are needed. The effectiveness of insecticide thermal fogging to control sand fly vectors inside hyrax dens has not been studied before. During 12 weeks in July-September 2019, we conducted a study in Tayasir, Tubas district (the most affected foci in northern West Bank) to estimate the effectiveness of insecticide thermal-fogging inside hyrax dens. We included one intervention and two control sites. We found a significant reduction on Phlebotomus spp. density and Leishmania infection in the intervention site at 36 hours, two and five weeks and during the whole post-intervention period. Our study findings show that insecticide thermal fogging inside hyrax is effective in reducing sand fly vectors up to five weeks post-intervention. We think that it could be an effective integrated and complementary method for source reduction of ZCL vectors especially when applied bimonthly.
