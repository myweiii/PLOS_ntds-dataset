Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global disease with accelerating morbidity and prevalence in both adult and pediatric populations, however, options have been limited in the remedy of this disease. IBD-hygiene hypothesis provides a promising strategy for the treatment of IBD. In the present study, we firstly investigated the therapeutic effects of proteins (rCsCP and CsCA) derived from Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) and the parasite itself on DSS induced acute colitis mice. C. sinensis infection could ameliorate colitis to some extent, but also cause the abnormality of blood biochemical indexes. In contrast, intraperitoneal administration of rCsCP and CsCA achieved better therapeutic effects on DSS-induced acute colitis without causing abnormal blood biochemical indexes. rCsCP was superior to CsCA in alleviating colonic inflammation, enhancing the percentage of Treg cells, and ameliorating types of inflammatory-related cytokines. rCsCP ameliorated colitis mainly through activating TLRs and other related innate immunity, up-regulating the secretion of Th2/Treg related cytokines (e.g., IL-10, IL-4 and IL-13) and down-regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12b, IL-23r, IL-7 and IL-17A), thereby restricting the transformation of Th1/Th17 cells. Our study suggests that rCsCP is a prospective therapeutic agent for treating IBD. This work also provides novel ideas for the application of parasites and their related products in IBD or other autoimmune diseases.
