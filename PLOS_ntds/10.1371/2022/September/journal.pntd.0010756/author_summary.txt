New leprosy patients diagnosed with visible physical deformities represent a significant disease burden that also poses an important public health challenge. The physical deformities often result from long delays in case detection. Greater insight into the healthcare factors that contribute to such delays will support the development of effective prevention programs. We therefore reviewed all studies on the healthcare factors related to case-detection delay that had been published between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2021. Twenty studies were included in our analysis. We found that misdiagnosis was a core healthcare factor related to delays. Other common factors included inappropriate health services, a high number of consultations before diagnosis; and a lack of referral centers, healthcare personnel, and case-detection methods. Detection delay was further influenced by geographical circumstances, financial and logistic issues, and health-service organization and management including the level of the decentralization of healthcare programs. Because delays in leprosy case detection are due mainly to misdiagnosis, we recommend to improve the training and capacity of healthcare staff. To avoid misdiagnosis and reduce detection delays, national leprosy control programs should ensure the sustainability of leprosy control within integrated health services.
