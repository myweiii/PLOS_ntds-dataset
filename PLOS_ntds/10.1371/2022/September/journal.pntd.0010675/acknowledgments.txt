We would like to thank Lutfyo Kayange, Margaret Dzalani and Ackim Chiudzu for the continued support in the field. Without their support, the data collection would not have been possible. We would also like to thank Dr. Patricia Wilkins and Jon Noh of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention for their generous support with Taenia solium diagnostics as well as for providing training in this area. This work is dedicated to Bagrey Ngwira who passed away far too early and who has been instrumental to this collaborative project from the planning phase to the conduct of the study in the field and beyond.
