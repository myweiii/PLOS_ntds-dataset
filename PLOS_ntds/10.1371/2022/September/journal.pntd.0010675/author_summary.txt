Epilepsy is more common in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. One of the reasons for this is that risk factors for acquired epilepsy such as Taenia solium cysticercosis are more common in these countries. In this study we conducted a screening for epileptic seizures among nearly 70,000 people of rural Balaka district of Malawi. We found that around 3 percent of people have ever experienced an epileptic seizure and that 1 percent of people suffer from epilepsy. The screening questionnaire that we used was quite accuracte, and the more criteria for screening positive were fulfilled, the more likely it was that the person has ever experienced an epileptic seizure. Among the patients with epilepsy, around 5% also had neurocysticercosis typical lesions in their brain.
