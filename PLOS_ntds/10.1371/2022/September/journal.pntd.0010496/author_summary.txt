Treatment of snakebite in Eswatini is reliant upon a single antivenom (SAIMR Polyvalent) manufactured in South Africa. This highly effective product is increasingly difficult to source and is expensive—alternative/additional antivenoms are urgently required to improve patient outcomes following snake envenoming. Using murine preclinical venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy assays, we identified two alternative antivenoms whose venom-neutralising characteristics, while less poly-specifically effective than SAIMR Polyvalent, were as effective against the lethal and tissue-destructive effects of the most common biting snake in Eswatini—Naja mossambica. These murine data, already shared and discussed with the Eswatini Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation, supports and justifies human testing of these two antivenoms in Eswatini because increasing the availability of effective and affordable treatments could resolve the current medical dependency of Eswatini snakebite patients upon a single, rarely available and expensive product.
