    "Background": "Brucellosis (Brucella melitensis) is endemic in many countries around the world, therefore, identifying what is required to control and prevent the disease is essential. The health promotion concept and five areas of action, presented in the Ottawa Charter (1986) may help understand how to go forward in the prevention of the disease. Israel serves as a case study.",
    "Aim": "To identify barriers to the control and prevention of brucellosis (Brucella melitensis) in Israel by analyzing trends in incidence in conjunction with interventions implemented over the last seven decades, applying the health promotion areas of action.",
    "Methods": "1. A document review approach was adopted to develop a list of interventions implemented in Israel to prevent and control brucellosis and identify barriers to implementation. These were analysed using the health promotion areas of action. 2. Data from the mandatory reporting of infectious diseases in Israel regarding brucellosis in humans between 1951 and 2021 are presented and analyzed in conjunction with the interventions implemented.",
    "Results": "A large range of interventions were implemented following outbreaks of the disease. These interventions followed the health promotion areas of action, including mainly: policy, education and environment and brought about a decrease in the disease among both animals and humans. However, major interventions were discontinued after a few years. In addition, we identified some areas of action that could be much improved on. The interventions, in many cases were not simultaneously implemented or coordinated, decreasing the chances of them having the expected long term impact.",
    "Conclusions": "Control and prevention of the disease in Israel is partial. Areas of action that could be improved include enforcement of regulations, strengthening community action and improving personal skills. Simultaneous and continuous implementation of the interventions may achieve the goals of sustained prevention and control. There seems to be a lack of a long-term strategy and an integrated holistic intervention approach that may contribute to the control and prevention of the disease."
