Brucellosis, is a zoonotic disease endemic in the Middle East. Israel, can serve as a case study to try to identify barriers for prevention of the disease. In this study, we present the concept of health promotion and suggest it may help improve prevention and control of the disease. Using the health promotion areas of action (Building public policy, Creating supportive environments, Strengthening community action, Developing personal skills and Reorienting health services) we analysed the interventions implemented in Israel. We suggest that there are areas of action regarding the prevention of the disease that could be much improved on. In addition, interventions were not simultaneously implemented as needed, hindering success and there was a lack of a long-term strategy. For example, funding for prevention was discontinued after an initial decrease in incidence rates, enabling re-emergence of the disease. An integrated approach such as health promotion may provide the missing link to a successful holistic intervention that also includes the behavioural changes in human behaviour needed.
