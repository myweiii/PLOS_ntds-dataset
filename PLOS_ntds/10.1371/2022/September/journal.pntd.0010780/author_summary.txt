Dengue outbreaks occur annually in Taiwan, and pyrethroid insecticides are commonly used to reduce mosquito density. Insecticide resistance of mosquitoes is commonly observed in the field and threatens vector control programs. Here, we analyzed the association between the combined vgsc genotype and resistance phenotype based on field surveillance data in March and October and a cypermethrin exposure bioassay. Resistance-attributable specific vgsc genotypes were proposed. Using the combined vgsc genotype rather than each vgsc allele is recommended for better resistance prediction to provide real-time information for control program managers.
