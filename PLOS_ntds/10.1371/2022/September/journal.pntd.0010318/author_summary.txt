Annual mass dog vaccination campaigns that reach at least 70% of the dog population, should maintain sufficient herd immunity (sustain vaccination coverage above 40%) between campaigns to interrupt rabies transmission. However, it is often challenging to reach 70% of the dog population with annual vaccination campaigns. We hypothesized that a community-based continuous approach to dog vaccination could better maintain high levels of vaccination coverage all-year-round. We describe the development of a community-based continuous approach to dog vaccination in Tanzania, and assessed the feasibility of delivering its components, its potential effectiveness and lessons for its optimization. We found that the approach was well accepted, as its development involved key stakeholders. Although less than half of the components of the community-based continuous approach were delivered exactly as planned, over 70% of dogs were vaccinated and the approach maintained coverage above the critical vaccination threshold throughout the year. We conclude that it is feasible to deliver a community-based continuous approach to dog vaccination, but that some components need further improvement; more supervision and community involvement should lead to better outcomes.
