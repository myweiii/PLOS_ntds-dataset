Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a neglected zoonotic disease of public health importance and responsible for high morbidity and mortality among humans in Africa. This study assessed knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices regarding bTB among occupationally exposed abattoir workers and drivers for transmission in slaughterhouses. We found low knowledge levels and preventive measures of bTB among abattoir workers. Important drivers of bTB in the study area were also identified. This study contributed to the epidemiological findings on bTB, which will be helpful as guidelines for developing and implementing preventive measures. Institution of awareness programs and training abattoir workers will improve their knowledge of bTB and other zoonotic diseases.
