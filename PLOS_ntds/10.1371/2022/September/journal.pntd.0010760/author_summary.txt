The majority of malaria research focuses on the Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax parasite species, due to their large public health burden. The epidemiology of P. malariae and P. ovale parasites has been comparatively neglected, due to a lack of research tools, most notably diagnostics. We present new molecular diagnostic assays for detecting P. malariae and P. ovale gametocytes, the sexual stage of the malaria parasite transmitted to mosquitoes. These assays were applied to samples collected in Papua New Guinea, a rare region with high transmission of the four major malaria parasite species. Patterns of co-infections were characterized accounting for interactions between pairs and triples of parasites. Heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites was identified as a key driver of patterns of co-infection. The effect of co-infection on parasite density was analyzed by systematic comparison of all pairwise interactions. The most significant within-host interaction of parasites was the large increase in P. malariae parasite density due to co-infection with P. falciparum. This finding was replicated for P. malariae gametocytes (but did not attain statistical significance due to low sample numbers) suggesting that co-infection provides a key transmission advantage to P. malariae.
