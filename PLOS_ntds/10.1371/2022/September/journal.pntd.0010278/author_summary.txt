Scrub typhus is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and is popular in the Asia-Pacific area. Nowadays scrub typhus has been recognized as a considerable burden on public health in Fujian province. We explored the epidemiological characteristics, spatiotemporal patterns and diffusion characteristics of scrub typhus, and detected high-risk regions at the county level in Fujian province between January 2012 and December 2020. Our results indicated that the majority of cases were reported in June-July and September-October and that that middle aged and elderly people were more prone to infection every year in Fujian province. The spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed clustering in geographic distribution of cases and several distinct spatiotemporal clusters were identified in north and southern parts of Fujian province. Compared with cases from low-risk areas, a higher proportion of cases were female, farmer, and older residents in high-risk counties.
