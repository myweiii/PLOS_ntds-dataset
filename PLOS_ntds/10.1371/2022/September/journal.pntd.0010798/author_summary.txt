Plasmodium vivax is one of the main species responsible for malaria in the world. The pathogenic mechanisms leading to the development of severe P. vivax malaria are not yet fully understood. Immune system molecules such as cytokines and chemokines actively participate in the control of the infection, however, their uncontrolled production can influence alterations in organs such as the liver, kidneys, among others. In this study we show that there is a differential concentration of some cytokines and chemokines between patients with non-severe malaria and severe P. vivax malaria; and that there are associations between these molecules with manifestations that occur in severe malaria. Four molecules with potential to become biomarkers of severity were identified.
