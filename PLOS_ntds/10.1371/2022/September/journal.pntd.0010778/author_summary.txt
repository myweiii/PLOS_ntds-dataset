Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease which causes 1.03 million cases and 58,900 deaths each year. Human infections occur when the primary reservoir hosts, such as rodents, contaminate food and water with leptospires. Unlike other bacterial pathogens, leptospires invade the human body through mucosal barriers and enter the bloodstream, which can result in septicemia. Left untreated, leptospirosis can spread into multiple organs and tissues such as lungs, liver and kidneys. Pathological features of this disease include high fever, myalgia, lymphadenectasis, hemorrhaging and jaundice. Human macrophages and vascular endothelial cells play important roles in eliminating and preventing the transmission of this pathogen. We speculated that leptospires could be neutralized in macrophages and subsequently transported by vascular endothelial cells throughout the human body. In this research, the diverse mechanisms of human macrophages and vascular endothelial cells infected by leptospires were explored. Our findings can be used to improve the treatment, prevention, and supervision regarding leptospire transmission and infection.
