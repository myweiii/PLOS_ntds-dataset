Human strongyloidiasis is caused by a soil-transmitted helminth, Strongyloides stercoralis, which typically causes severe symptoms in immunocompromised individuals. This infection can also alter the gut microbiota and is often found in areas where chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common. However, the relationship between S. stercoralis and the gut microbiome in CKD is not known. This is the first study to investigate the gut microbiota of CKD patients with and without S. stercoralis using high-throughput sequencing of the V3â€“V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Infection with S. stercoralis was associated with reduced gut microbial diversity. In addition, infection with this nematode led to reduced abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and enrichment of pathogenic bacteria. In particular, there were significant differences in abundance of the beneficial genus Anaerostipes (a decrease) and the pathogenic taxon Escherichia-Shigella (an increase) in CKD patients infected with S. stercoralis relative to controls. In the infected group, the representation of Escherichia-Shigella was significantly higher in patients over the age of 65 years. There was a significant inverse moderate correlation of Escherichia-Shigella with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
