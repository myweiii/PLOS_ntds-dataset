Loiasis is a parasitic disease, endemic in parts of Western and Central Africa. While the disease has traditionally been considered to be benign, only recently significant disease morbidity and mortality have been shown. Most of the knowledge about loiasis, however, stems from reports on returning travelers, while comprehensive data from patients living in endemic areas are missing. Blood microfilaremia and reported eye worm are important diagnostic manifestations of the disease, but they can occur independent of each other in affected individuals. We analyzed hematological and clinical findings according to loiasis infection states, comprising reported eye worm and microfilaremia positivity, in a large group of individuals from a highly endemic area.
While we found that all loiasis infection states were significantly associated with absolute blood eosinophilia, the eosinophilia was more pronounced in microfilaremic loiasis. Further, there was an association between the extent of microfilaremia and absolute eosinophilia. Analyzing the frequency of clinical disease manifestations, we found that eye worm positive loiasis was associated with a range of symptoms, but microfilaremic loiasis was not. Summarizing, even in highly endemic populations different loiasis infection states are associated with distinct disease manifestations, underlining that loiasis is a versatile and indeed relevant disease.
