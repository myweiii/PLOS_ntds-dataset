    "Background": "Emergomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis and blastomycosis are endemic to southern Africa; the first two are AIDS-related mycoses. We described laboratory-diagnosed cases of endemic and imported mycoses in South Africa over a decade and discuss available diagnostic tools, reasons for the current under-estimation of cases and future strategies to improve case ascertainment.",
    "Materials and methods": "We analysed electronic pathology laboratory data from all public laboratories and one large private laboratory in South Africa from 2010\u20132020. Diagnostic specimens processed at the national mycology reference laboratory were also included. We classified cases as proven, probable and possible based on the method of identification.",
    "Results": "We identified 682 cases, of which 307 were proven, 279 were probable and 96 were possible. Of 307 culture-confirmed cases, 168 were identified by phenotypic methods plus sequencing, 128 by phenotypic methods alone and 11 by direct PCR. Of 279 probable cases, 176 had yeasts observed on histology, 100 had a positive Histoplasma antigen test and 3 a positive pan-dimorphic PCR test. All 96 possible cases had compatible clinical syndrome with inflammatory infiltrates on skin tissue histology. A majority of cases had an unspecified endemic mycosis (207/682, 30.4%), followed by sporotrichosis (170/682, 24.9%), emergomycosis (154/682, 22.6%), histoplasmosis (133/682, 19.5%), blastomycosis (14/682, 2.1%) and talaromycosis (4/682, 0.6%).",
    "Conclusions": "This study reports a relatively low number of cases over a decade considering an estimated large population at risk, suggesting that a substantial fraction of cases may remain undiagnosed. There is a need to increase awareness among healthcare workers and to develop rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools and make these widely accessible."
