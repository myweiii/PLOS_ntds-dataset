Leprosy, also called Hansenâ€™s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that may result in devastating disabilities. The disability rate among new leprosy patients in Ethiopia is high compared to other countries. A delay in case detection is a major factor contributing to the development of disability. Late diagnosis also fosters ongoing transmission, increasing the incidence of the disease. We aimed to determine the extent of the detection delay and find the reasons for this delay in eastern Ethiopian districts, endemic for leprosy. One hundred leprosy patients who recently started multi-drug therapy were included in the study. The median detection delay was one year among all patients. About half of the patients had sought treatment from health institutions within one year after the onset of their first symptoms. Longer delays among leprosy patients were associated with a fear of stigma and painless symptoms at an early stage of the disease. This indicates that it is vital to improve community knowledge of leprosy symptoms and to take initiatives that reduce stigma. This should improve health-seeking behaviour and may prevent the development of disability as well as halt transmission.
