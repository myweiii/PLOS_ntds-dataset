In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, we estimated that annually there were 242,648 snakebite victims of which 15,909 victims were dead and 954 victims were amputated. We estimated that 69% of victims indicated for antivenom treatment were not treated with antivenom. Annual disease burden of snakebite was estimated at 391,979 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) with estimated total costs of snakebite of 2.5 billion US Dollars which were equivalent to 0.09% of the regionâ€™s gross domestic product. Almost all of the estimated economic and disease burdens were related to deaths from snakebite envenoming which suggested that the remarkably high burden of snakebite could actually be averted. We emphasized the importance of funding research to perform a comprehensive data collection on epidemiological and economic burden of snakebite to eventually reveal the true burden of snakebite in ASEAN and inform development of strategies to tackle the problem of snakebite.
