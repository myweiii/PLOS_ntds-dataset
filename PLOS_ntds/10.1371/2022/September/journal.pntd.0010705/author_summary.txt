The Yellow Fever virus (YFV) has caused serious public health issues in Africa and the Americas. YFV infections can vary from asymptomatic to severe clinical conditions, which may culminate in death. In Brazil, the main viral origin of YFV outbreaks is the states located in the Amazon Basin. In the present study, we detected YFV RNA in several tissues, including the heart, lung, brain, kidney, spleen, pancreas, liver, and testicle in two human cases. The YFV characterized in the present study belong to the South American genotype I, clade II, and they are associated with viral spread throughout the state of SÃ£o Paulo after intense viral circulation in the metropolitan region in 2018. Future investigations are necessary for a better understanding of the complex ecological factors involved in viral dispersion from the Amazon Basin.
