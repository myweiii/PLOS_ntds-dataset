Plasmodium vivax shows restricted host cell tropism to human reticulocytes for their asexual blood-stage replication. Reticulocyte binding protein (PvRBPs) family are essential molecules for reticulocyte recognition and host cell invasion. In this study, we focused on PvRBP1a as a novel target for vaccine development of P. vivax. Here, we analysed pvrbp1a genetic polymorphisms, natural selection, and evaluated the correlation of this genetic information with antigenicity. This study emphasizes the characteristics of the pvrbp1a genetic population in relation to efficient vaccine development.
