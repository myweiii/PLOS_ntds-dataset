Chagas disease is a potentially fatal neglected disease of poverty. It is endemic in continental Latin America with an estimated 300,000 cases in the United States, primarily among low-income people who have immigrated to the US from Latin America. Few Chagas screening programs have been established in the US. Existing recommendations for Chagas disease testing and treatment are rarely followed for many reasons including a paucity of knowledge among providers. We aimed to determine if the number of Chagas tests performed increased after information sessions at a community health center. A secondary aim was to determine if there was a difference in number of tests performed by provider type. We found that the number of T. cruzi serologies performed in the ten months after information sessions increased significantly over that in the ten preceding months. Chagas testing increased across departments, though Chagas diagnostics were an extra and unmitigated time burden on clinicians. Increasing provider knowledge is a major step to increase diagnosis and treatment of this neglected disease, when clinicians are motivated by their inherent prosocial preferences including altruism i.e., by the positive impact of their work on patientsâ€™ lives.
