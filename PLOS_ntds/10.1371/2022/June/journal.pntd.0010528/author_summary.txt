Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in cell-cell communication. They can transport functional molecules to target tissues and cells. During parasite infection, EVs provide suitable diagnostic makers and vaccine antigens for as well as inducing host immune responses. In Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis), we previous proved that Ts-ML-EVs exerted immunomodulatory effect that inhibited experimental colitis in mice. Based on these results, we tested the protein composition of Ts-ML-EVs and the immune protective effect of Ts-ML-EVs. Our study showed that Ts-ML-EVs contained a number of immune-related proteins and it could be potential vaccine antigen for preventing T. spiralis infection.
