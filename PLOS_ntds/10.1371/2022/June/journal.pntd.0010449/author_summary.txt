Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with Taenia solium larvae and is considered a neglected disease that causes significant neurological morbidity in humans. Animal models are essential to better understand the pathophysiological processes that occur during NCC infection, disease progression and to evaluate the effects of antiparasitic treatment. Here, we demonstrated that by injecting 5000 or more activated T. solium oncospheres into the carotid artery of pigs we consistently reproduced NCC in a number that closely resemble human infection. All cysticerci found in the CNS were apparently viable, whereas in the musculature viable and degenerated cysticerci were found. Serum antigens in experimentally infected pigs were detected as early as 14 days postâ€“infection and remained high in NCC pigs until necropsy. Histological analysis of brain cysticerci showed different degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration adjacent to the cyst wall, mostly composed of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, whereas most of the cysticerci were apparently intact with cyst wall and neck without damage. Our findings demonstrated that the intracarotid pig model is suitable for studies on the pathogenesis and antiparasitic treatment in NCC.
