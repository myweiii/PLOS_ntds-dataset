Fasciola hepatica is the parasite that causes fascioliasis in the Andes region. The factors associated with transmission of the disease among humans have not been well described in the area studied. In this study, we evaluate the spatial relationships between infected households and the environmental burden of Fasciola eggs passed by different livestock in the Cusco region of Peru. We geographically marked and tested for fascioliasis feces provided by children and livestock. Infected and uninfected cattle as well as sheep feces were more likely to be in proximity to human households with infected children than to households without infected children. We were able to identify and map the areas of higher and lower infections rates. This information and strategy may be used in the control of the disease.
