    "Abstract": "This study examined pyrethroid resistance intensity and mechanisms in Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) populations from Jigawa, North-West Nigeria. Resistance statuses to permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and alphacypermethrin were determined with both WHO and CDC resistance bioassays. Synergist assay was conducted by pre-exposing the populations to Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) using the WHO method. Resistance intensities to 2x, 5x and 10x of diagnostic concentrations were determined with the CDC bottle method. Species analysis and presence of knockdown mutation (Leu-Phe) were done using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Results showed that Cx. quinquefasciatus was the only Culex spp. present and “Kdr-west” mutation was not detected in all analyzed samples. Using WHO method, Cx. quinquefasciatus resistance to permethrin was detected in Dutse (12.2%) and Kafin-Hausa (77.78%). Lambda-cyhalothrin resistance was recorded only in Kafin-Hausa (83.95%) with resistance suspected in Ringim (90%). Resistance to alphacypermethrin was recorded in all locations. Pre-exposure to PBO led to 100% mortality to alphacypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin in Ringim while mortality to permethrin and alphacypermethrin in Dutse increased from 12.2% to 97.5% and 64.37% to 79.52% respectively. Using CDC bottle bioassay, resistance was also recorded in all populations and the result shows a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.728, p = 0.026) with the result from the WHO bioassay. Results of resistance intensity revealed a very high level of resistance in Kafin-Hausa with susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin and alphacypermethrin not achieved at 10x of diagnostic doses. Resistance intensity was also high in Dutse with susceptibility to all insecticides not achieved at 5x of diagnostic doses. Widespread and high intensity of resistance in Cx. quinquefasciatus from North-West Nigeria is a major threat to the control of diseases transmitted by Culex and other mosquito species. It is a challenge that needs to be adequately addressed so as to prevent the failure of pyrethroid-based vector control tools."
