Development of resistance to insecticide by mosquitoes has been identified to be a major challenge in the prevention and control of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. This informs this study that investigated the level of resistance of Culex mosquitoes from Jigawa, North-West Nigeria to Pyrethroids. The main type of Culex mosquitoes found in the sampled area was Cx. quinquefasciatus. The Cx. quinquefasciatus populations were found to be resistant to permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and alphacypermethrin. Resistance in Cx. quinquefasciatus from the three LGAs is more pronounced to alphacypermethrin. The methods employed by the mosquitoes in developing resistance involve detoxification of the insecticides by metabolic enzymes. Cx. quinquefasciatus from the three LGAs were observed to be highly resistant and can withstand multiple of the recommended doses. This development whereby Cx. quinquefasciatus populations were highly resistant to these recommended insecticides is of serious concern as it can lead to failure of all efforts geared towards prevention and control of diseases transmitted by Culex mosquitoes in North-West Nigeria.
