To respond quickly to disease outbreaks, policymakers need rapid data on the number of new infections. However, for many diseases, such data is very delayed, due to the administrative work required to record each case in a disease surveillance system. This is a problem for data on chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease which is a growing threat in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, delays in chikungunya cases being recorded average four weeks. These delays are sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. In stark contrast to chikungunya data, data on what people are searching for on Google is available almost immediately. People suffering from chikungunya might search on Google for information about the disease. Here, we investigate whether rapidly available Google data can help generate quick estimates of the number of chikungunya cases in Rio de Janeiro in the previous week. Our model uses a Bayesian methodology to help account for the varying delays in the chikungunya data. We show that including Google search data in the model reduces both the error and uncertainty of the chikungunya case count estimates, in particular during epidemics. Our method could be used to help policymakers to respond more quickly to future chikungunya epidemics.
