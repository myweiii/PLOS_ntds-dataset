Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease, classified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. It is present in more than 60 countries in four continents, with most tropical and subtropical countries affected. Without treatment, the disease is fatal. HIV-positive persons are especially affected by VL, with a worst prognosis. One of the main complications is the frequent reactivation of the disease even after successful treatment (VL relapse). Up to now, it is not clear why and when these reactivations occur, and many researches are trying to find some biological markers to answer this. Cytokines are one of these markers that may explain the progression of the disease. In this study, we compared the level of several key cytokines in symptomatic VL-HIV coinfected patients, asymptomatic VL-HIV coinfected individuals, and healthy controls living in a VL-endemic region in Northeastern Brazil. The serum cytokine levels were higher in symptomatic patients when compared with asymptomatic and healthy controls. More studies following VL-HIV patients are necessary to understand how these cytokines and the other biomarkers vary over time and whether they can predict VL relapse, and also the progression and the prognosis of the disease.
