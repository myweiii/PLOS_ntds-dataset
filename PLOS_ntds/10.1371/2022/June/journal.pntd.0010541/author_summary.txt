In areas with both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria, an intervention may impact the species differently due to their different biology. In particular, an inoculation with P. vivax can lead to liver-stage parasites which relapse weeks or months later. The intervention may affect the species equally or one more than the other and this may change over time. Knowledge of the expected relative effect of interventions would be useful for tailoring intervention strategies to address both species, and for interpreting monitoring data. This study aims to assess patterns of the proportion of clinical cases or patent infections that were P. vivax or P. falciparum on a short time scale of up to two years since implementation and to identify potential factors that could explain variation in these observed patterns for two vector-based interventions (insecticide treated nets and indoor residual spraying) and a drug-based intervention (mass drug administration). In all, there were 72 series of time-points for clinical data and 69 for patent infections. Overall there was an increasing proportion of P. vivax over time, but there was substantial variation between studies for all interventions. Coverage, transmission and relapse pattern were identified as possible explanations for some of the variation, however, this remains uncertain due to the high variation and the data available.
