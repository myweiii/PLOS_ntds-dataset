Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) still affect nearly 1 billion people worldwide and are a major public health problem in Angola. Schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil transmitted Helminthiases (STH) affect disproportionally school aged children (SAC). In endemic areas, implementation of preventive chemoprevention through school-based Mass Drug Administration Campaigns is a key strategy used to reduce the burden of these infections. Mapping of schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthiases is essential to know where transmission occurs and is used to inform interventions planning. A country wide SCH and STH mapping was conducted across 15 of the 18 provinces of Angola. Parasitological analysis of nearly 32,000 children was conducted to detect SCH and STH infections and determine the prevalence of these diseases. Eighty Six percent of the mapped districts are endemic for STH and 22.9% have a prevalence above 50%. Similarly, 90% of surveyed districts are endemic for SCH. There were higher STH infection rates in the northern provinces of Malanje and Lunda Norte, and higher SCH infection rates in the southern provinces of Benguela and Huila. These results are of vital importance to map the prevalence of SCH and STH in Angola and to plan adequate interventions that support NTD control across the country.
