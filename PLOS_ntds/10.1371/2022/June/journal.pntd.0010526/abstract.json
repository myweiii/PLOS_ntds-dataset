    "Background": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantaviruses is a frequently reported acute hemorrhagic fever in South Korea. These viruses are transmitted by various rodent species such as Apodemus agrarius.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "To investigate hantavirus infection and seroprevalence in rodents, wild rodents were captured from two districts in the suburbs of Gwangju Metropolitan City from January 2016 to December 2018. Nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the hantavirus-specific L segment and indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay using Hantaan virus antigen slides were performed. A total of 585 wild rodents were captured\u2014512 A. agrarius, 49 Crocidura lasiura, and 24 Myodes regulus. Nested RT-PCR was performed to examine the rate of hantavirus infection in wild rodents, and 1.88% (11/585) of all rodents, 1.17% (6/512) of A. agrarius, 6.12% (3/49) of C. lasiura, and 8.33% (2/24) of M. regulus tested positive. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the eleven PCR-positive products revealed that six PCR products showed over 85% sequence similarity with the Jeju virus, four showed over 99.7% similarity with the Hantaan virus, and one showed over 95.3% homology with the Imjin virus. Moreover, IgG antibodies against the Hantaan virus were detected in 6.15% (36/585) of all rodents, 6.8% (35/512) of A. agrarius, and 4.17% (1/24) of M. regulus. IgG antibodies were not detected in C. lasiura.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Hantaviruses were detected in all three wild rodent species of A. agrarius, C. lasiura, and M. regulus captured in the suburbs of Gwangju Metropolitan City, South Korea, and it was demonstrated that they were various strains of hantaviruses such as the Hantaan, Jeju, and Imjin viruses."
