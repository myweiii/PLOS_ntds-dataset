Pathogens have coevolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. As natural vectors, mosquitoes are permissive to and allow systemic and persistent arbovirus infection, which intriguingly does not result in dramatic pathological sequelae that affect their lifespan. In this regard, mosquitoes have evolved mechanisms to tolerate persistent infection and develop efficient antiviral strategies to restrict viral replication to nonpathogenic levels. There is a great deal of evidence supporting the implication of epigenetics in the modulation of the biological interaction between hosts and pathogens. This study reveals that Zika virus infection positively modulates the expression and activity of A. aegypti histone acetyltransferase CBP (AaCBP). This study shows that AaCBP plays a role in the activation of immune-responsive genes to limit Zika virus replication. This first description that Zika virus infection has epigenomic consequences in the regulation of A. aegypti immunity opens a new avenue for research on mosquito factors that can drive vector competence.
