Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious loss of sight worldwide. The mass treatment with azithromycin has been used in the prevention and treatment of chlamydia trachomatis and is recognized as a potentially vital and important public health strategy for the control of trachoma disease and other co-infections. Oral azithromycin is easy to administer and offers a better resolution for controlling blinding trachoma for long periods. The proportion of azithromycin mass treatment coverage in the Goro district was lower than the WHO minimum target. Having better knowledge about the trachoma and azithromycin mass treatment and being educated were some of the factors positively affecting the uptake of the azithromycin mass treatment. Hearing serious adverse effects of the drug from other people and campaigns conducted during harvesting or seeding time were some factors negatively affecting the coverage of azithromycin mass treatment in the current study.
