Despite initial symptomatic management and adequate antivenin strategy, highly venomous Bothrops snakebites frequently induce overwhelming inflammation leading to multiple organ system failure and death. We state that recognition of venom-associated molecular patterns and cellular damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) by pattern-recognition receptors will engage inflammation and cell-mediated immune response. Due to endosymbiotic bacterial origin of mitochondria, mitochondrial DAMPs released from injured envenomed tissues are recognized as danger signals and exacerbate the innate inflammatory host response. Hence, mitochondrial DAMPs will engage a vicious circle, which deregulates inflammation via aberrant mitochondrial signaling, impaired mitophagy and disruption of mitochondrial dynamics. Delineating critical factors that elicit mtDAMPs release will generate hypothesis for new treatments.
