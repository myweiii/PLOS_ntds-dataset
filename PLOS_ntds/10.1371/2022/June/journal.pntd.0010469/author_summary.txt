Domestic dogs are found throughout the world and interact closely with both wildlife and humans. Dogs can harbor numerous diseases that can be transmitted to other domestic and wildlife species, and human populations. They can serve as bridges, moving diseases between unconnected populations. Additionally, dogs can help in the early detection of wildlife and human diseases. Therefore, understanding what pathogens domestic dogs harbor can inform both wildlife and human health. In this study, we performed physical examinations, collected biological samples, and administered questionnaires to assess dog health and understand the role of dogs as potential bridges of disease transmission from wildlife to humans among indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area, Guyana. On physical exam, we observed ectoparasites on all dogs, however, few pathogens were detected with diagnostic screening. Our questionnaire data revealed that the Waiwai engage in husbandry practices that may promote Waiwai dog health.
