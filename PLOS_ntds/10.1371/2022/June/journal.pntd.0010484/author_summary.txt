Sporotrichosis, commonly known as ‘rose gardener’s disease’ is a rare but chronic fungal infection caused by several pathogenic members of Sporothrix. Although rare, Sporotrichosis can spread to the lungs or whole body, and thus, could be fatal. However, due to low frequency of its occurrence, scientific research on Sporotrichosis has been rather limited. To exacerbate the situation, many Sporothrix members have developed resistance against the common anti-fungal agents used to treat fungal infections. Many medicinal herbs are being explored for their effectiveness against drug-resistant microorganisms. In this connection, the well-known medicinal plant, Withania somnifera, commonly known as Winter cherry in English and Ashwagandha in Hindi, has been explored for its anti-fungal potentials against several pathogenic fungi. However, to the best of our knowledge, anti-fungal effect of W. somnifera against Sporothrix has not been assessed yet. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the anti-fungal potentials of Withania somnifera whole plant extract (WSWE) against Sporothrix globosa, known to cause Sporotrichosis in Asia. This study demonstrated significant anti-sporotrichotic effect of WSWE, which could be further explored for developing an alternative natural treatment for Sporotrichosis.
