A survey conducted in 1994 in school aged children showed that soil-transmitted helminth were very intensively transmitted in Pemba Island (Zanzibar) with prevalence near to 100%. Between 1994 and 2011 several rounds of administration of anthelminthic were organized and a second survey was conducted in 2011 showing a decrease of prevalence and intensity of infection.
The present paper reports the results of a third survey conducted in 2021 showing a further decline of the prevalence and a persistence of T. trichiura as the more prevalent parasite (in 1994 hookworms were the most transmitted STH). The interventions conducted until now where not sufficient to eliminate the morbidity caused by these parasites and it is suggested to include ivermectin in the anthelminthic distributed periodically.
