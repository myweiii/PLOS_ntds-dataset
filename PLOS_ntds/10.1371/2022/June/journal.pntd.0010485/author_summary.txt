F. monophora is a fungal pathogen that causes chromoblastomycosis. Melanin of F. monophora was synthesized through PKS in which TE is the last enzyme to catalyze the cyclization and release polyketide. Few studies have investigated the effect of TE on the metabolism and pathogenesis of F. monophora. In this study, TE deletion leads to albino phenotype, decreases the expression of other domains of the pks1, and reduces biosynthesis of metabolites. The Δpks1-TE-C500 strain exhibits a changed morphogenesis and becomes less resistant to various environmental stresses. In vitro study, the Δpks1-TE-C500 strain is avirulent and less resistant to macrophages and neutrophils. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the 500 bp C-terminal of TE is essential for the function of pks1, perhaps through its effects on melanin and metabolites to regulate the growth and virulence of F. monophora. Data from this study could inspire an exploration in development of clinical therapy for CBM.
