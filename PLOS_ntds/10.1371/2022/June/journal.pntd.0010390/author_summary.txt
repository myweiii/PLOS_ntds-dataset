Leishmania braziliensis affects poor human populations in the tropics, may cause face disfiguring lesions and may also resist treatment. There has been intense research for markers in these parasites genetic contents for helping predict if an infected human being would be of greater chance of severe disease or treatment failure. The consistent identification of such markers requires a deep understanding of how genes circulate within these parasitesâ€™ natural populations. We explored two small segments of DNA (i.e. loci), one on chromosome 24, the other on chromosome 28 of L. braziliensis to characterize a population that causes human disease in Northeast Brazil. We employed two samples of parasites obtained from lesions of patients diagnosed from 1999 to 2001, and from 2008 to 2011. We sequenced the DNA of those loci in each parasite of the two samples. Then, we evaluated the status of several population genetics parameters among them. Based on our findings to that region, we concluded that L. braziliensis can maintain populations that are genetically stable for several years in foci of human leishmaniasis and are capable of robust recombination of their genetic contents, probably due to events of sexual reproduction during its lifecycle.
