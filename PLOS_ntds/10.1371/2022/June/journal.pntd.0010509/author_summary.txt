Dengue fever (DF) represents a significant health burden worldwide and in Vietnam, which is forecast to worsen under climate change. The development of an early-warning system for DF has been selected as a prioritised health adaptation measure to climate change in Vietnam. This study aimed to use deep learning models to develop a prediction model of DF rates in Vietnam using a wide range of climate factors as input variables to inform public health responses for outbreak prevention in the context of future climate change. The study found that LSTM-ATT outperformed competing models, scoring average places of 1.60 for RMSE-based ranking and 1.90 for MAE-based ranking. Notably, it was able to forecast DF incidence better than LSTM in 12 or 14 out of 20 provinces for MAE or RMSE, respectively. Moreover, LSTM-ATT was able to accurately predict DF incidence and outbreaks up to 3 months ahead, though performance dropped slightly compared to short-term forecasts. This is the first time deep learning methods have been employed for the prediction of both long- and short-term DF incidence and outbreaks in Vietnam using unique, rich climate features, and it demonstrates the usefulness of deep learning models for climate-based DF forecasting.
