Bartonella species are recognized as emerging zoonotic pathogens that are mainly transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods, some being infectious to humans. Rodents are important natural reservoirs of Bartonella species. Bartonella infection has been detected in various countries worldwide, and their prevalence in rodents varies greatly across countries and regions. This is the first report of Bartonella prevalence and genetic diversity in Shangdang Basin of China. It revealed a high Bartonella-positivity rate in Niviventer confucianus and Apodemus agrarius in this area. Relatively higher occurrence of Bartonella species was detected in forests and farmlands. Six Bartonella species were detected, B. grahamii, B. phoceensis, B. japonica, B. queenslandensis, B. fuyuanensis and one unknown Bartonella species, of which B. grahamii was the dominant species, with high genetic diversity, and potentially pathogenicity in humans. Our study provided a better understanding of the occurrence and genetic diversity of Bartonella species in the small rodents in Shangdang Basin.
