The household composition data used to supplement Australian Bureau of Statistics data in this paper were collected as part of the Life Course Program. We thank the dedicated Life Course research team who traced participants and collected the data. We especially thank the young adults belonging to the Aboriginal Birth Cohort and their families and community for their co-operation and support and all the individuals who helped in the urban and remote locations.
