Melioidosis is a life-threatening infection, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is endemic to tropical regions in Australia. Variants of the bimA gene have been proposed as a virulence factor associated with more severe disease. In a genomic analysis of 76 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates from Queensland, Australia, we identified that the bimABm variant was associated with infection involving the central nervous system (odds ratio 2.8, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.3–6.0, P = 0.009), compared to isolates with the wild-type allele bimABp. Half of the isolates from this region were novel multi-locus sequence types, and bimABm was more commonly seen in these novel sequence types. Early genomic characterisation to identify virulence factors such as bimABm, may be useful as an early marker of more complex disease that could guide further investigation and help determine optimal treatment. Further investigation of a “genomics-guided” approach to the clinical management of this complex infectious disease are warranted.
