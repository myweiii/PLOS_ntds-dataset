Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is among the most neglected tropical diseases affecting a significant proportion of the world population, impacting mostly on the poorest communities. CL can present as localized, mucocutaneous or diffuse cutaneous. There are various reports on the prevalence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) in Leishmania parasites and/or lesion biopsies in patients with CL from both the Old World and New World regions. However, there is scarcity of comprehensive knowledge on the pooled prevalence of the virus in Leishmania parasites causing human CL. We searched different electronic databases and Google Scholar for published articles aimed to determine the presence of LRV in Leishmania parasites and/or lesion biopsies in patients with CL globally. The retrieved articles were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion parameters. Data was extracted based on the PRISMA guideline by reviewing the selected articles. Systematic review and meta-analysis would be one way to improve the level of evidence by providing pooled prevalence of the individual single studies regarding the presence of LRV in Leishmania parasites and/or lesion biopsies. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that a large proportion of the Leishmania parasites causing human CL harbour the endosymbiotic LRV. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of the virus in the clinical presentation of CL, as a potential target of treatment and vaccine development especially in Old World Leishmania parasites like L. aethiopica.
