Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus, (EBOV)), first characterized more than 40 years ago, is a causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD) which is associated with viral hemorrhagic fever. EBOV is thought to be transmitted to humans through contact with wildlife. Though bats are suspected to be the hosts that maintain EBOV in nature, it is currently not known which bat species serve as the reservoir. Identifying the wildlife species that maintain EBOV in nature would facilitate the development of strategies to mitigate the risk of EBOV transmission to humans from wildlife. In this manuscript, we describe the results of surveillance efforts to detect Ebola virus in wildlife near a contemporaneous outbreak of EBOV disease in humans. We detected evidence of recent EBOV infection in bats near the location of the EVD outbreak through serological techniques, but we did not find evidence of active EBOV infection in bats. These data support the need for more proactive surveillance in wildlife in EBOV endemic regions.
