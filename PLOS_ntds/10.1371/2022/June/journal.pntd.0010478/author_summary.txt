In areas which regularly experience outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, mosquito abundance and climate are two influencing factors which are often explored for their ability to aid prediction of and response to outbreaks. In 65 areas of the southern Philippines which regularly report dengue outbreaks, we compared trends in four different indicators of Aedes mosquito abundance during a 6-year period. We also compared data for Aedes indicators with climate data from the same areas. We found that patterns in Aedes mosquito abundance were highly variable over time and did not appear to have a distinct seasonal trend. The four different indicators of mosquito abundance each had weak yet significant relationships with different climate variables. We propose that further studies should explore additional types of data such as epidemiological and socio-environmental data for their value in assisting public health responses to Aedes-borne disease outbreaks.
