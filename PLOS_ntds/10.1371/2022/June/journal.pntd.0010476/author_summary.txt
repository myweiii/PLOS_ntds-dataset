Leprosy reactions are immune-mediated complications of leprosy. There are two types of reaction. To provide a deep understanding about experiences and perceptions of people with both types of reactions, we interviewed the individuals affected and conducted group discussions with their family members in two leprosy endemic countries: Indonesia and India. The results of this study show that both types of reactions significantly affect the participantsâ€™ lives. People with leprosy reactions in both countries experienced persistent pain which hampers their daily activities. A majority of participants reported that this makes them feel more often sad, that they isolate themselves, rely upon their family members and have less income. There is a need for more support for people with leprosy reactions and we recommend testing of different interventions including (peer) counselling.
