Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral infection common in young children. Although the association between ambient temperature and the risk of HFMD has been well documented, existing studies were solely based on the reported number of cases, failing to differentiate cases of different severity. This study improves the estimation of disease burden by additionally accounting for the severity of symptoms. Our major findings included that (1) we identified an inverse-U shaped association between the ambient temperature and the daily DALY (i.e. an established indicator for disease burden) associated with HFMD, with 2.7% DALY could be attributed to the temperature exposure; (2) the peak impact of temperature on DALY was estimated to be β = 0.0331 (95%CI: 0.0199–0.0463) DALY and identified at 23.8°C; (3) the trends were generally consistent across different demographic and geographic subgroups, with the peak effect identified to be greater among the males, those aged ≥3yrs or from the Pear-River Delta region; (4) the impact of temperature on DALY elevated more apparently in areas with a greater population density, per capita GDP, or per capita green space in parks.
