We have been conducting research and studies on the importance of understanding the biological characteristics of each vector species in order to eradicate vector-borne diseases. In recent years, most reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases in Japan, such as dengue fever, malaria, and chikungunya fever, are imported cases from overseas; however, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the only mosquito-borne disease for which autochthonous cases have been confirmed. The primary vector of JE virus (JEV) in Asia, a species called Culex tritaeniorhynchus, has long been recognized as a single species, however, this study is the first to report the existence of a cryptic species that is genetically distinct from Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Although long-distance migration of this species has been suspected for a long time, it has never been experimentally verified, and its contribution to the spread of JEV has not been investigated. The present study is also the first to confirm the capability of long-distance migration of this species biologically and physically, and to support it with meteorological data. Our objectives are to contribute to the prediction and minimization of the JE epidemic in Asia based on the results of experiments using the latest molecular genetic techniques combined with detailed physiological investigations.
