Soil-transmitted helminths affect almost 2 billion people globally. About 65% of the related morbidity is attributable to hookworm infection, especially anaemia, which is caused by adult worms attaching to the intestinal mucosa of the human host to feed on blood. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the target for the elimination of morbidity as reaching moderate-to-heavy intensity infections prevalence < 2%. In this paper, we aim to assess the suitability of the current WHO threshold to reflect hookworm-attributable anaemia. To this end, we developed a statistical model to simulate individual haemoglobin concentrations in association with hookworm burdens in adults, accounting for low haemoglobin values attributable to other causes, such as malnutrition and malaria. We used model outcomes to estimate the prevalence of hookworm-attributable anaemia in different endemicity scenarios. Our predictions suggested that anaemia is mainly associated to moderate-to-heavy intensity infection and that the 2% threshold corresponds to a prevalence of hookworm-attributable anaemia <1%. These results support the use of the current WHO threshold as a proxy for hookworm morbidity. Our predictions represent a first step towards better quantifying the prevalence of anaemia due to hookworm infection.
