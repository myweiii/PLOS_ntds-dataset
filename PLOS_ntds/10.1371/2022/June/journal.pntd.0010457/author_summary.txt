The first wave of Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic and its Congenital Zika Syndrome, has vanished. However, the consequences have remained for the affected children and families ever since.
In Brazil, the first cases of microcephaly, detected in the end of 2015 in the Northeast region, especially in coastal cities, quickly spread to other regions and cities in countryside of Brazil. Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of cases distribution is essential to identify areas of greater risk and enable preparedness for a future wave of cases.
In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of cases of ZIKV infection in pregnant women and cases of microcephaly in newborns by district, over a five-year period, in a large city in Midwest Brazil. Additionally, cases of microcephaly were correlated with the socioeconomic and structural conditions at the local level.
Our findings indicate heterogeneity in the spatiotemporal patterns of maternal ZIKV infections and microcephaly, which were correlated with seasonality and included a persistent high-risk geographic location (cluster) in the city of Goiania. We could identify geographically and socio-economically underprivileged groups, with higher risk for ZIKV infection, that would benefit from targeted interventions to reduce exposure to new vector borne infections.
