Immunoassays were developed for the detection of two Y. pestis proteins, LcrV and F1, which have been characterized as potential biomarkers of plague. A total of twenty-two high affinity mAbs were isolated from BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant LcrV, F1 and F1-LcrV fusion protein via hybridoma technology. MAbs were characterized by Western blots, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance. Antigen-capture LFIs and ELISAs were developed using the mAbs and optimized for analytical sensitivity. Prototype LFIs were evaluated to detect LcrV and F1 in surrogate clinical samples. A multiplexed LFI detecting both LcrV and F1 was assessed against a panel of Y. pestis isolates, clinically relevant near neighbors, and other bacterial Select Agents indicating high assay specificity. The prototype immunoassays will now need to be validated with multiple clinical matrices (i.e., whole blood), patient samples, and a larger specificity panel.
