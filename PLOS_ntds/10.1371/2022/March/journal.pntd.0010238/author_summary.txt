Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. It is a complex and neglected disease. Generally, it manifests as ulcers, nodules, or other lesions, mainly on the face and extremities. An estimated 0.7â€“1 million new cases occur annually in around 88 countries in South and Central America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, with the appearance of new outbreaks in different regions of the world.
For more than 70 years, pentavalent antimonials have been the first line treatment, despite their toxicity, varying efficacy and need of administration of painful injections for 20 days or more.
There is limited availability of effective and safe treatment alternatives and the strength of scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of the different schemes is variable, limiting the control of the disease from a therapeutic approach. Hence the need for effective, safe, low-cost treatment alternatives with non-invasive routes of administration.
This article reports the results of a clinical trial aiming to evaluate a combined therapy with two therapeutic alternatives (miltefosine and thermotherapy) approved for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, comparing it with thermotherapy alone. In this study, the combined therapy was significantly better than the monotherapy in managing cutaneous leishmaniasis.
