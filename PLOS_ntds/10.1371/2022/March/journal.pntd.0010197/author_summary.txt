Yaws is a neglected tropical disease produced by Treponema pallidum pertenue that causes skin ulcers in children living in remote rural areas of the South Pacific and West Africa. Children aged 5–15 and individuals with a history of recurrence are at higher risk of reinfection. Although yaws can be treated with single-dose azithromycin, some children present with recurrent cutaneous ulcers; however, the prevalence and risk factors for yaws recurrence are poorly known. Our analysis of skin ulcers in Papua New Guinea revealed that up to 20% of patients who presented to a health care facility in the Lihir island of Papua New Guinea with a cutaneous ulcer experienced a recurrent episode within the 6–36 months following treatment. Nearly all individuals with recurrent yaws were children aged 15 years or younger. Besides age, the number of previous ulcers was associated with a higher risk of recurrence. The molecular analysis revealed that among cases with T. pallidum at baseline that had a recurrence, this was often related to reinfection with the same microorganism. Our results confirm the need for active follow-up of young children diagnosed with cutaneous ulcers, with particular attention to those with younger age and previous history of recurrences.
