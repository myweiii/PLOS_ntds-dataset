Parasitic diseases are responsible for tremendous suffering and morbidly throughout the world. There is a need for new drugs to treat parasitic disease. New approaches aimed at treating parasitic diseases depend upon an understanding of the critical functions required for parasite survival. One such disease is lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), a devastating parasitic disease initiated by the bite of a mosquito carrying infectious larvae. The larvae develop into adult parasites which sequester themselves in host lymphatics where they survive for several years. We have identified a novel series of compounds which appears to affect filarial parasite epigenetic regulatory mechanisms compromising parasite survival. These compounds provide both a pharmacological probe for the study of filarial parasite epigenetic mechanisms important for survival as well as providing a potential opportunity for anti-filarial drug development. In addition, these mechanisms are present in a variety of parasitic nematodes offering the opportunity for development of treatments for a wide variety of parasitic nematodes.
