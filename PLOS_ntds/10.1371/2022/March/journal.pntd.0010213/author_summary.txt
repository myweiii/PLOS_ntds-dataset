Filarids are vector-borne Onchocercidae nematodes widely distributed around the world, related to several hosts, both wild and domestic, in different Biomes, including human-related species. In consequence to deforestation, environmental degradation, and climate changes, there has been an expansion in the distribution of vector-borne diseases around the world, such as those caused by filarids, in endemic tropical areas and even in temperate regions where they did not used to occur before. Thus, epidemiology and molecular genetic diversity studies of these filarial parasites are of great importance for three main reasons: zoonotic potential of many known species of filarids; the lack of data about the species inhabiting neotropical regions and the current worldwide deforestation and consequent habitat loss scenario, which favors the emergence or re-emergence of diseases resulting from the infection of domestic animals and humans by parasites that used to have as reservoirs only wild animals.
