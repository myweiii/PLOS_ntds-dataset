In about five decades in Nigeria, Lassa fever (LF) has infected 3897 and caused 1319 deaths (including 71 healthcare workers (HCWs)) giving a case fatality rate of 33.8% for confirmed cases in Nigeria. Poor knowledge of LF and its prevention and control (PC) measures amongst HCWs can lead to non-adherence to LF safety protocols, healthcare-associated infections, poor patient outcomes, and even the death of infected HCWs. In addition, LF knowledge over-estimation may lead to mismanagement of LF cases with potential fatal consequences. Therefore, this study assessed if the nine different cadres of HCWs interviewed from four health facilities during an LF outbreak in Katsina, Nigeria have the appropriate level of LF knowledge. Using a validated questionnaire, data were collected from 400 HCWs and then analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25. Results were tabulated and associations between the variables determined. More than half of the HCWs demonstrated inadequate LF knowledge with nearly two out of three of these HCWs over-estimating their LF knowledge. However, adequate LF knowledge was predicted by training on LF and this in turn predicted LF knowledge over-estimation.
