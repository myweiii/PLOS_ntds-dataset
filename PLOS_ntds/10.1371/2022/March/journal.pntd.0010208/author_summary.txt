This work, for the first time, isolated intestinal symbiotic bacteria S. oryzae from Ae. albopictus and verified its role in enhancing insecticide resistance in vivo and in vitro. We show that S. oryzae enhances deltamethrin resistance by inducing the metabolic detoxification genes and autocrine metabolic enzymes. This work highlights a new aspect of mosquito resistance. Moreover, S. oryzaeâ€™s capacity to high-effectively degrade insecticide in vitro may contribute to environmental protection by degrading the residual insecticide in the farmland and lakes.
