The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study estimated 20.9 million individuals with onchocerciasis, primarily in Africa. Onchocercal vision impairment/blindness and skin disease (e.g., skin pigment loss, debilitating itching) impact the social and economic life of infected individuals and their communities. This motivates onchocerciasis elimination efforts, today primarily through annual or biannual ivermectin treatment of affected communities. Despite progress towards elimination in many areas, others are not progressing well towards elimination and may require alternative treatment strategies. Moxidectin, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for treatment of onchocerciasis in people at least 12 years old, could be an alternative. How the amount of a drug in the body changes over time is important for choosing a dose and treatment regimen and for regulatory approval. We measured moxidectin blood levels in 18 to 60 year old men and women with onchocerciasis. We found that moxidectin blood levels peaked around three-four hours after ingestion, that moxidectin stayed in the body for a long time (i.e., its elimination half-life was around 20 days) and that moxidectin blood levels depended on the dose, but not the infection severity as measured by the number of onchocerciasis parasites in the skin.
