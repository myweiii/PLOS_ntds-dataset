Fasciola gigantica is a socioeconomically important tropical liver fluke of mammals, causing fascioliasisâ€“a neglected tropical disease. In the present study, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic approach were employed to explore the global transcriptional changes of hepatic lymph nodes (hLNs), peripheral blood lymphocytes (pBLs), and spleen of water buffaloes during F. gigantica infection at 3-, 42-, and 70-days post-infection (dpi). The results revealed significant transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in infected hLNs (42 and 70 dpi) and pBLs (3 and 42 dpi). However, downregulation of transcripts involved in immune response was detected in pBLs at 70 dpi. The downregulated transcripts were enriched in metabolic pathways, such as drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 in infected hLNs at 3 dpi. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of F. gigantica in its natural mammalian host.
