Chikungunya disease manifestation is characterized by a sudden onset of non-rheumatic flu-like symptoms and debilitating rheumatic symptoms in the acute phase. Little is known about the persistence of non-rheumatic symptoms after acute disease. In this prospective cohort study we investigated the clinical manifestations and persistence of baseline rheumatic and non-rheumatic/psychological symptoms and their impact on health related quality of life (QoL) 2.5 years after disease onset. Moreover, we investigated the performance of the classification instrument the Cura√ßao Long-Term Chikungunya Sequelae (CLTCS) score in classifying chikungunya disease severity over time. We found that 57% of the patients were still affected 2.5 years after disease onset. An increase of mainly recurrent rheumatic and non-rheumatic/psychological symptoms including fatigue, insomnia, sombreness, and loss of vitality were reported, with a significantly higher symptom recurrence and pain intensity reported by highly affected patients. In addition, QoL assessment indicates that the disease burden impaired the physiological well-being of these patients. We also showed that the CLTCS-score can be used to easily identify highly affected patients. This study demonstrates that disease severity increases non-rheumatic symptoms and subsequent physiological impairments and suggests a multidisciplinary treatment approach to treat the psychological effects of long-term chikungunya disease.
