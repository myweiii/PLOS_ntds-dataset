Due to immunosuppression caused by HIV, Chagas disease may behave as an opportunistic infection, being an AIDS marker. When Chagas disease reactivation takes place, the increase of parasite load with disease reagudization and clinical outcomes occurs, such as meningoencephalitis and myocarditis, several times with an unpleasant prognosis. CD4 T-cells dosage and viral load of HIV may provide pieces of evidence about the immunological response against opportunistic pathogens, as well as the parasitological tests that identify T. cruzi in the blood and biological samples that give parameters for the treatment options. Via quantitative molecular method (qPCR) and parasitological method (blood culture), we verified that the co-infected patients treated with ART had a low parasite load. Chagas disease patients with no HIV had the same pattern of parasite load and they were able to control viral replication and CD T-cells maintenance, besides promoting the response capacity to T. cruzi parasite load. The ART maintenance, the serological testing for Chagas disease in HIV-positive patients, and the use of molecular diagnostic tests are significant actions for co-infected T. cruzi/HIV patients.
