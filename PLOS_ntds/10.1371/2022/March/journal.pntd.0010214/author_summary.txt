Q fever caused by Coxiella burnetii is a significant zoonotic disease that affects wildlife, domestic animals and humans. This study determined the prevalence of antibodies to C. burnetii in livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) and human populations in arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya between December 2013 and February 2014. We also identified potential factors that were associated with exposure among the above-targeted hosts. Results from this study showed considerable exposure in both livestock and human populations. However, human exposure to this pathogen at the household level was not correlated with herd-level seropositivity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the transmission routes of this pathogen among humans.
