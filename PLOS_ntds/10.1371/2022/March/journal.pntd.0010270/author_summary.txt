Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease characterized by its high burden on the rural population and high mortality if antivenom is not administered. The ecology of this health problem is not well-understood; however, approaches to address the temporal are growing. So far, we know that rainfall can play an important role in driving snakebite incidence seasonality at a national scale. Moreover, geographical areas with high rainfall are more prone to have high snakebite risk, but the spatial heterogeneity of the temporal association (i.e., if there are different seasonal patterns of rainfall-incidence association in different geographical areas of a country) is just starting to emerge in the literature. By formulating and fitting compartmental models to data, we generated a flexible framework that relies on temporal resolved datasets and a compartmental mathematical model to understand the effect of climatic covariates (such as rainfall and temperature) driving snakebite dynamics in space and time. We applied this framework to Colombia and found that dry seasons cause a decrease in snakebite incidence: Rainfall only drives snakebite dynamics in regions with marked dry seasons. Thus, rainfall is a limiting resource of the system, and its effect is not spatially homogeneous. On the other hand, the temperature had no significant effect driving snakebite incidence. Our modeling approach can also be used to estimate the effect of climate anomalies on snakebite incidence and has the potential to be used as a tool to monitor snakebite incidence.
