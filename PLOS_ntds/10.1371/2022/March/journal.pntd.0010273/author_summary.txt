Trachoma, one of the leading infectious causes of blindness globally, is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2030. District-level estimates of active trachoma among children 1–9 years old are currently used to guide control programs and assess elimination. However, active trachoma, based on diagnosis of clinical signs, is a subjective indicator. Serological markers present an objective, scalable alternative that could be measured in integrated platforms. In a hyperendemic region, community-level seroprevalence aligned more closely with concurrent infection prevalence than active trachoma. The correlation between seroprevalence and infection prevalence was stronger among 0–5-year-olds compared to 6–9-year-olds and was consistent over a three-year period of increasing transmission. Serosurveillance among children 0–5 years old may be a promising monitoring strategy to identify communities with the highest burdens of ocular chlamydial infection.
