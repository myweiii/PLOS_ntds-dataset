Rabies virus is the deadliest virus affecting mammals. In Brazil, rabies transmitted by the common marmoset primate is emerging and causing unpredictable human deaths. This primate once endemic to the northeast of the country has now invaded regions in the south throughout human-mediated introductions. However, the dynamics of rabies in this primate and the extend of spillover risk to humans remain unknown. We found that outbreaks of rabies in this marmoset reported to the Ministry of Health are continuously reported in new areas, including three new states since 2012 and three states reporting rabies originated from the common vampire bat. We also showed that this primate has suitable habitat to invade other states in the north and west of Brazil. Preventive strategies should be implemented to limit further rabies spillover to humans in new areas.
