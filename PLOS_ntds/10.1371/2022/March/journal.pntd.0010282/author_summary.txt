The World Health Organization has validated that trachoma is no longer a public health problem in The Gambia as of April 2021. In this article, the authors summarize critical milestones achieved by The Gambia in its journey to elimination and the challenges to implementing the WHO-endorsed elimination strategy, including surgical management for people with trichiasis, antibiotics to all endemic communities, and uptake of face-washing practices and environmental improvements. In 1986, a national survey of blindness and low vision in The Gambia found that 17 per cent of blindness was caused by trachoma in the form of corneal opacity due to trichiasis. At this time, eye health services delivered by a trained eye health were limited to the Greater Banjul area, meaning people in remote locations were frequently left behind. This changed with the coordination of partners and donors strengthening the knowledge base of health workers on trachoma preventative measures and the capacity of ophthalmic nurses to deliver trichiasis surgical support to all trachoma-endemic communities. Final epidemiological surveys conducted in 2019 confirmed that there was sufficient evidence to show that elimination thresholds had been achieved all endemic areas prompting the formal submission of the countryâ€™s elimination dossier to the WHO.
