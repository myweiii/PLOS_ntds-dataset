Indirect immunoassays are the recommended method for chronic Chagas disease diagnosis and its performance relies on the employed antigen preparation. Chimeric antigens have been successfully utilized for chronic CD in vitro diagnosis and efficiently addresses commonly encountered hurdles arising from the use of recombinant and native antigens. Thus, our group developed four Trypanosoma cruzi chimeric antigens and evaluated their diagnostic potential in an indirect Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) design; however, this design restricts detection to a single antibody class and for a single species. To overcome this, we utilized conjugated antigens in a double-antigen sandwich ELISA (DAgS-ELISA) design, which is able to detect both acute and chronic infections, in a species and immunoglobulin class-independent manner. Despite their high discrimination levels, as illustrated through elevated AUC values, our results were different from those obtained previously, especially regarding sensitivity. Specificity values remained elevated, reaching 100% for 3 out of 4 antigens. As such, improvements are being considered to increase the sensitivity of the DAgS-ELISA.
