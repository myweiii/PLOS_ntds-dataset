An Ebola outbreak has been likened to a natural disaster in its devastating impact on child health and nutritional status. The ease of transmission of a disease with a 50% mortality rate for those once infected raises particular challenges for breast-feeding women. This systematic review explored the attitudes and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, family members, health practitioners and policy makers concerning infant feeding during an Ebola epidemic as documented in qualitative studies. Participants reported confusion and inconsistent guidance regarding breast-feeding practice, together with difficulties in conveying recommendations to separate mothers infected with Ebola from their breast-feeding infants. Disruption impacted on access to supplementary and complementary feeds, health systems monitoring child growth and support to child health. Widespread distrust and suspicion of health professionals hindered health care provision. Wider family assumed roles in feeding and caring for young children, within the context of reduced access to nutritious foods and supplementary feeds. The work of humanitarian agencies, while valuable, lacked coordination. Planning for an Ebola outbreak requires advance preparation of health messaging for mothers and caregivers, coordinated provision of complementary feeds and support for families who assume caring responsibilities. Strategies to ensure linked up working between government and humanitarian agencies are essential.
