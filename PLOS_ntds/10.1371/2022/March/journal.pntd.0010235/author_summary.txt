The number of new cases of tetanus occurring every year decreased considerably in many countries through mass vaccination programs. However, it continues to cause deaths of many people in low- and middle-income settings. The majority of hospital-admitted adult (≥18 years) tetanus patients included in this study were male, farmer and came from rural areas. More than one-third of them died within hospital. However, one must note that these hospitals lacked intensive care facilities. Tetanus mortality after hospitalization is dependent on many factors. Our study found that patients’ older age, short incubation period (time from injury to the appearance of symptom), short onset time (interval between the first symptoms and the first spasm), and development of complications were significant contributors of in-hospital deaths. Meticulous and individualized management of adult tetanus patients with one or more of the above features is required to increase their survival. Moreover, adult males from high risk occupation could be potential targets for booster vaccination strategies to prevent incidence of tetanus in Bangladesh.
