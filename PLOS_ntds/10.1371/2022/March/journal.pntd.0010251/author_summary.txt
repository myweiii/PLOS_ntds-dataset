Tungiasis is a dermatological disease that affects humans and animals infested with sand fleas (Tunga spp.), especially in communities exposed to contaminated sandy and dry soil, where living conditions are precarious and access to basic health is limited. These sand fleas penetrate host skin and cause severe acute and chronic injuries that can dramatically compromise the hostâ€™s health. Dogs are a primary reservoir and disseminator of these fleas in South America. In this clinical field trial, the efficacy of a single oral dose of fluralaner (Bravecto chewable tablets) was evaluated for treatment and prevention of tungiasis in dogs in an endemic area of Brazil. The treatment was assessed through absence of live sand fleas and resolution of characteristic tungiasis skin lesions. Fluralaner was 100% effective from the third to the eighth week post-treatment, eliminated live sand fleas and protected against new infestations during the study. Therefore, fluralaner proved to be an excellent therapeutic option for treatment and a highly effective control option for canine tungiasis.
