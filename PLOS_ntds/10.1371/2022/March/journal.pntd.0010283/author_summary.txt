Children who have been hospitalized in sub-Saharan Africa remain at a high risk of death and morbidity for at least 6 months following discharge. These children may harbor AMR in commensal bacteria following hospitalization, which may be associated with poor outcomes. There are limited data describing AMR and risk factors that are associated with AMR carriage at hospital discharge. In this cross-sectional study of Kenyan children under 5 years of age discharged from hospitals, we found AMR to be high. Children who received antibiotics in the hospital, had limited access to improved sanitation, and who were female had the highest prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli.
