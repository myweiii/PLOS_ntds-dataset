The large-scale modification of landscapes by humans has contributed to the rise of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. While the association between anthropogenic land-use change and these shifts in disease risk are frequently observed, our understanding of exactly how land-use change mechanistically alters disease risk remains unclear. Changes in local environmental conditions (e.g. temperature) may play an important role, due to the effects on mosquito life-history, but are rarely measured at scales relevant to these small-bodied ectotherms. Here we measure the impact of tropical forest conversion to oil palm plantation on each of the components that determine the potential for mosquitoes to transmit dengue virus (vectorial capacity). Dengue is one of the fastest-growing global infectious diseases, with 100â€“400 million new infections per year, and whilst Aedes aegypti is the dominant vector, the role of Ae. albopictus in epidemic outbreaks is of increasing concern. By combining fine-scale temperature data from the field, published temperature responses of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes and field data on adult mosquito populations, we show that land-use change from forest to plantation can be expected to increase vectorial capacity by 50%. Our results highlight the need to advance field research into fundamental mosquito ecology, and to more critically evaluate the increased risk of Aedes-borne disease in dynamic working landscapes against the benefits of economic development.
