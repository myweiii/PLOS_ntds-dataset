    "Abstract": "Although multiple antigenically distinct ebolavirus species can cause human disease, previous serosurveys focused on only Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Thus, the extent of reactivity or exposure to other ebolaviruses, and which sociodemographic factors are linked to this seroreactivity, are unclear. We conducted a serosurvey of 539 healthcare workers (HCW) in Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of the Congo, using ELISA-based analysis of serum IgG against EBOV, Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV) glycoproteins (GP). We compared seroreactivity to risk factors for viral exposure using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Seroreactivity against different GPs ranged from 2.2\u20134.6%. Samples from six individuals reacted to all three species of ebolavirus and 27 samples showed a species-specific IgG response. We find that community health volunteers are more likely to be seroreactive against each antigen than nurses, and in general, that HCWs with indirect patient contact have higher anti-EBOV GP IgG levels than those with direct contact. Seroreactivity against ebolavirus GP may be associated with positions that offer less occupational training and access to PPE. Those individuals with broadly reactive responses may have had multiple ebolavirus exposures or developed cross-reactive antibodies. In contrast, those individuals with species-specific BDBV or SUDV GP seroreactivity may have been exposed to an ebolavirus not previously known to circulate in the region."
