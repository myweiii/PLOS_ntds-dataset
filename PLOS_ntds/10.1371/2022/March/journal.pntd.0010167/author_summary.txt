Zaire ebolavirus is known to circulate in the Mbandaka region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, causing outbreaks in 2018 and 2020. However, we do not know the range of exposure to the local population. Here, we examined the seroprevalence of 539 local Congolese healthcare workers in the Mbandaka region with no known ebolavirus exposure. We found serological evidence indicating contact with at least one species of ebolavirus from these donors. Seroreactivity among the donors to the different glycoprotein antigens ranged between 2.2â€“4.6%. We observed correlations between jobs with indirect access to patients and a higher seroprevalence, which may be due to less training and less access to personal protective equipment. Our findings suggest that exposure to ebolaviruses may be more frequent than previously known and that lesser-skilled individuals in healthcare work may have a higher likelihood of ebolavirus exposure.
