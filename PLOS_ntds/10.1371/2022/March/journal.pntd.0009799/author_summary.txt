The cure for brucellosis involves a long course of treatment with a combination of antibiotics. However, some of the drugs are not recommended for very young children and pregnant women. Moreover, cases of relapse and resistance to these drugs are reported. With the Brucella Methionyl-tRNA synthetase as a target, molecular docking and virtual screening was used to identify possible drug candidates from a library of 1524 compounds obtained from edible African plants. Two lead compounds, Strophanthidin and Isopteropodin usually present in Corchorus olitorius and Uncaria tomentosa (Catâ€™s claw) plants showed potentials to inhibit the Brucella melitensis Methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Their bioactivities were also confirmed in their molecular dynamic simulation with the target protein. Consequently, both compounds have potentials for safety and efficacy in the treatment of brucellosis.
