Lassa fever is a viral disease endemic to West Africa that has been highlighted by the World Health Organisation as one of the top ten epidemic threats to global health. Ribavirin has been used to treat Lassa fever for more than 30 years. However, the clinical evidence for ribavirin is poor. We conducted a systematic review of the pre-clinical and human pharmacokinetic data in Lassa. We found that the minimum concentrations of ribavirin that inhibited Lassa virus replication varied hugely according to the experimental design and the type of cell and Lassa virus strain used. There was no comprehensive data on the concentrations of ribavirin in the blood of Lassa fever patients. Modelling of ribavirin concentration data from healthy humans suggest that the doses of ribavirin currently used to treat Lassa fever patients do not reliably achieve the concentrations required to inhibit viral replication.
