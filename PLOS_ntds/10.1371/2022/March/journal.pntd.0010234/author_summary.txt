Leptospirosis is a widespread bacterial zoonosis and one of the most important acute febrile infectious disease in tropical and subtropical regions, which is difficult to differentiate from other infectious diseases common in these regions. Leptospirosis is endemic to Okinawa prefecture, the southernmost prefecture of Japan, where the infection occurs mainly after recreational activities in rivers in the northern part of Okinawa Main Island and the Yaeyama region. This study combined several methods such as bacterial isolation from soil and environmental DNA metabarcoding from river water samples to understand the persistence of Leptospira outside the human host, leptospiral diversity in the environment, and their potential reservoir animals in the wild environment of the Yaeyama region. Although this study didnâ€™t confirm the environmental persistence of Leptospira species previously isolated from clinical cases, several newly reported Leptospira species with pathogenic potential from the Yaeyama region suggested the need for continual surveillance to improve leptospirosis control and prevention in this region.
