Dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have expanded their geographic range during recent decades and are now considered emerging threats in temperate areas. In particular, autochthonous transmissions of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have regularly been observed in Europe since 2010. The increase in international travel and trade appear to be major factors, encouraging both a circulation of these viruses on a global scale and the dispersion of one of their main vectors, Aedes albopictus. This trend is likely to increase significantly in the future and improved preparedness and response strategies are essential to manage these emerging risks. In this respect of decision support, we developed a mathematical model for CHIKV transmission. We first estimated key model parameters of CHIKV transmission and vector control effectiveness, using data from the two main CHIKV transmission events which have already occurred in mainland France. The model was then used to forecast the magnitude of outbreaks as a function of the delay in implementing control measures, and from the moment of virus introduction during the mosquito vector season. This work will help provide stakeholders in public health with a greater understanding of the dynamics of CHIKV transmission, and with evidence for the implementation of sustainable surveillance systems.
