The parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes sleeping sickness in humans, and nagana in cattle, and is transmitted by Tsetse flies. It grows in the bloodstream and tissue fluids of mammalian hosts, as "bloodstream forms", and as "procyclic forms" in the midgut of tsetse flies. Several hundred proteins are expressed in a stage-specific fashion, and this is essential for parasite survival in the different environments. RBP10 is an RNA-binding protein that is expressed only in bloodstream forms. It binds to procyclic-specific mRNAs, and causes their destruction. PGKC is an enzyme that is also specifically expressed in bloodstream forms. Developmental regulation of both is essential: expression of either RBP10 or PGKC in procyclic forms prevents their growth. The mRNAs encoding both proteins are very unstable in procyclic forms, and the sequences responsible are in an "untranslated region" of the mRNAâ€”sequences that follow the part that codes for protein. We here show that the mRNA encoding PGKC has two regions that independently cause developmental regulation, and that the very long untranslated region of the RBP10 mRNA has no fewer than six regulatory regions, but there were no obvious similarities between them. We suggest that the presence of several different regulatory sequences in trypanosome mRNAs might be a fail-safe mechanism to ensure correct regulation.
