Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected, arboviral zoonosis that causes severe and diverse disease manifestations in humans. Currently no licenced vaccines exist for use in humans and there is limited surveillance and estimation of disease burden which in part is due to the inability to concisely define the disease. We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science for published reports on the clinical manifestations of RVF in humans. Studies published in English, reporting frequency of symptoms in humans, and laboratory confirmed RVF were included. We excluded animal studies, studies among asymptomatic volunteers and single case reports for which a proportion could not be estimated. Pooled symptom frequency estimates were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. This review provides a detailed aggregation of the relative frequency of symptoms, and a description of the RVF clinical manifestations in humans. Previous systematic reviews provided a narrative account and it was difficult to identify the most relevant features of RVF disease in areas where other endemic infections present with similar symptoms. This review will refine the clinical diagnosis, improve case detection, and increase public awareness about RVF presentation in humans.
