We would like to thank the Davis homeowners who hosted chicken flocks and/or mosquito traps in their backyards for the duration of the study. We thank Maurice Pitesky for providing us with the chickens used in this study and his help, along with Macie Tanaka and Anny Huang, in transitioning the chickens from their pasture flock to our study. We would also like to thank Vaz Badiryan, Rachel Bowers Emard, Gurman Kaur, Olivia Winokur, Sarah Abusaa, Marisa Donnelly, Anna Kawiecki, Pascale Stiles, Brad Main, and Matteo Marcantonio for their hard work in chicken husbandry and data collection. We also thank the DART Lab (Ying Fang, Sandy Garcia, and Claire Chapman) and the Vector-Borne Disease Section of the California Department of Public Health (Vicki Kramer, Kerry Padgett, Tina Feiszli, and Mary Joyce Pakingan) for providing testing for our mosquito and chicken samples. We also thank Sunny An for raising the Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes used in our colony bioassays and Olivia Winokur for training and assistance on bloodfeeding colony mosquitoes. We thank Anil Singapuri in the laboratory of Lark Coffey for assistance and advice in lab work. We thank the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District for training on performing blood draws from chickens (Sarah Wheeler and Marti Towery), performing mosquito surveillance, identification, and ovarian dissection (Sarah Wheeler, Marilou Thomas, and Debbie Dritz), and providing us with the historical mosquito surveillance data that informed our sample size calculations.
