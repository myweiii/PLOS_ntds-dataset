In this study, we assessed the distribution and risk factors of nutritional indicators, anemia and micronutrient deficiency among schoolchildren of the Kikwawila and Kiberege wards, Tanzania. Our analysis revealed that malnutrition in form of stunting and wasting is still very high among schoolchildren in this region. About 14.0% of children were found to be anemic. Micronutrient deficiency was highly variable ranging from 0.50% (Folate) to 35.0% (Vitamin A). Schoolchildren from most rural schools were more likely to be found stunted and deficient with at least one type of micronutrient. Efforts to control and eliminate malnutrition, anemia, micronutrient deficiency and parasitic infections would benefit from sustainable and integrated approaches such as deworming, micronutrient supplementation, health education, vector control and an improvement in access to clean water and improved sanitation.
