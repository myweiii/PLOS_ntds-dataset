Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic infection caused by thread-like filarial nematodes and transmitted by mosquitoes. Lymphatic filariasis was endemic in American Samoa and seven rounds of mass drug administration were distributed between 2000 and 2006. Routine blood surveys in 2011 and 2015 did not identify any evidence of ongoing transmission. However, research studies conducted at around the same time showed evidence of residual hotspots and ongoing transmission, which was confirmed by both school-based and community-based surveys in 2016. This study analysed data from the 2016 community survey to identify clusters and hotspots using both non-spatial and spatial analytical methods. The findings confirmed previously known locations of ongoing lymphatic filariasis transmission in American Samoa and identified other potential hotspots that warrant further investigation. We demonstrated the utility of different non-spatial and spatial methods for investigating clustering and hotspots, and different information provided by each method. Noting the added value of these methods, they could potentially be considered as additional tools for improving lymphatic filariasis surveillance and optimising operational activities for elimination programmes, particularly for identifying areas of ongoing transmission or resurgence that may not be identified through current surveillance strategies.
