    "Background": "HIV infection is highly prevalent in French Guiana, a territory where leprosy is also endemic. Since the introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) in the management of HIV, leprosy has been reported as part of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We aimed to present a general description of these forms of leprosy as IRIS, highlighting clinical and therapeutic specificities. A retrospective study was conducted in French Guiana, including patients living with HIV (PLHIV) with advanced infection (CD4 < 200/mm3) and developing leprosy or a leprosy reaction within six months of HAART initiation, from 2000 to 2020. Clinical, histological and biological data were collected for all these patients. Six patients were reported in French Guiana. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, and its results were added to an overall analysis. Overall, seventy-three PLHIV were included. They were mainly men (74%), aged 22â€“54 years (median 36 years), mainly from Brazil (46.5%) and India (32.8%). Most leprosy cases (56.2%) were borderline tuberculoid (BT). Leprosy reactions were frequent (74%), mainly type 1 reaction (T1R) (68.5%), sometimes intense with ulceration of skin lesions (22%). Neuritis was observed in 30.1% of patients. The outcome was always favorable under multidrug therapy (MDT), continuation of HAART and additional corticosteroid therapy in case of neuritis or ulceration. There was no relapse.",
    "Conclusion": "Leprosy as IRIS in PLHIV mainly presents as a BT leprosy in a T1R state, sometimes with ulcerated skin lesions. Response to MDT is usually good. Systemic corticosteroids are necessary and efficient in case of neuritis."
