Human mobility plays a key role in the spread of many infectious diseases. Integrating this variable into spatial epidemic models can provide valuable insights for epidemic preparedness and response. Yet, there are numerous limitations and pitfalls often driven by data scarcity, especially in developing countries. To improve our understanding of the potential benefits of different human mobility data for outbreak prediction, in this work we focused on the aggregated mobility patterns derived from Call Detail Records (CDRs) data in comparison to more traditional data, including census data and mathematical mobility models. Using the 2015â€“2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Colombia as a case study, we employed a stochastic metapopulation model for vector-borne disease to simulate the ZIKV spread at the sub-national level in Colombia and assess the performance of each mobility network in capturing the ZIKV outbreak both nationally and sub-nationally. We found evidence that the population movements derived from aggregated CDRs data better capture the mobility and mixing patterns relevant to predict the local spread of ZIKV infections.
