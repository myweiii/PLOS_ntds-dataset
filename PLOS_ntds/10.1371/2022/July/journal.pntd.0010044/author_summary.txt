Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a helminth infection which can lead to disfiguring lymphedema, recurrent pain and inflammation, chronic disability and social stigma. Hence, LF is among neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination as a public health problem. In 2000, the WHO launched its Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). Large scale annual treatment of all eligible individuals in regions or countries where the infection is present was implemented to reduce the transmission of LF. In an area with a high prevalence of lymphatic filariasis in Southwest Tanzania, annual treatment with albendazole and ivermectin was conducted between 2009 and 2015. The effect of the government treatment was verified by our group in a carefully selected cohort of 1299 individuals who had participated in study activities both before and after mass drug administration. A significant drop in the prevalence from 35.1% to 1.7% was demonstrated by measuring the circulating filarial antigen by ELISA. The majority of the remaining infected individuals showed a reduction of the W. bancrofti worm burden. This government treatment was verified as an enormous step towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Tanzania.
