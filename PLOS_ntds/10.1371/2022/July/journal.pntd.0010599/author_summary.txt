Elimination of African sleeping sickness by 2030 is an ambitious goal, not least because of the unclear role that animals might play in transmission. We use mathematical models, fitted to case data from the DRC to assess and quantify the contribution of animals to the human case burden.
We found that 24 of 158 geographic regions included in this study had statistical support for animal transmission, although it appears extremely unlikely that animals could maintain transmission on their own. Animals could, however, delay elimination; using our model without animal transmission we predicted that 68 regions are expected to achieve elimination by 2030, reducing to 61 with animal transmission. If vector control to reduce fly populations (which transmit the disease to and from hosts) is used in addition to medical interventions, then 147 regions are predicted to reach elimination by 2030 even with animal transmission.
