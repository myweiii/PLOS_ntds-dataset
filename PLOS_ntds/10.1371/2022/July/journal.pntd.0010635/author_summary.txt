Brucellosis is a zoonosis endemic to many low- and middle-income countries around the world. Therapies recommended by the WHO are comprised of at least two antibiotics for several weeks, sometimes months. Relapses are frequent despite these harsh treatments. The underlying reasons for these relapses, besides reinfection and non-compliance to treatment, are unknown. Our study shows that Brucella abortus can form so called “persisters” in rich broth but also inside macrophages. This small bacterial subpopulation survives antibiotic treatment and resumes growth after removal of the antibiotics and could therefore serve as a reservoir for relapses in human brucellosis. Furthermore, we show that the intracellular lifestyle of Brucella has protective properties against recommended antibiotics as observed for other intracellular pathogens, highlighting the necessity to develop new infection models to assess antibiotic efficacy.
