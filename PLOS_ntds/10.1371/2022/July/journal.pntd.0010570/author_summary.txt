Schistosomiasis is a neglected but frequent disease that is caused by schistosomes, with over 290 million people worldwide at risk of infection. The major mode of transmission is through contact with fresh water sources infested with infected snails (the intermediate host). In this study, using the point of care test (POC-CCA), we screened 914 school aged children (10â€“15 years) living in the rural communities along the Lake Albert- River Nile shores of Pakwach district in Northern Uganda. We observed a very high prevalence of S. mansoni infections (over 80%) although the prevalence dropped to 40% in communities that were further from the lake shores. This high prevalence was also coupled with Kato Katz light schistosome infection intensities as categorised by WHO guidelines. We further compared the POC-CCA and Kato Katz tests to the more sensitive CAA assay and this revealed that even though both tests gave good probability of positive prediction, the POC-CCA had higher sensitivity in screening for S. mansoni infections than Kato Katz assay. The study also revealed high levels of stunting within the children, more so amongst boys. Frequent screening and mass treatment of these communities with praziquantel will reduce on the infection rates. But in addition, improved hygiene and sanitation will be required for a sustainable reduction in the prevalence and morbidity of schistosomiasis in the Albert-Nile communities along with dietary intervention for optimal child health.
