Rabies remains a public health problem in the Philippines despite improvements in the availability of rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The incidence of rabies is highest in Metro Manila and surrounding areas. We reviewed the records of all human rabies patients admitted to the national infectious disease hospital in Manila between 2006 and 2015. This hospital treats most cases in this area. During the 10-year study period, human rabies cases were continuously admitted to the hospital, with no notable decline in numbers by year. Most patients were adult men bitten by domestic dogs. The geographical areas in which cases commonly occurred during the 10-year period also did not change over time. Only 9.6% of patients had received at least one dose of a rabies vaccine as PEP. Although the risk of PEP failure is reported to be almost zero, we identified two suspected cases of PEP failure. The retrospective design of this study was a limitation, and the exact details of PEP were not reliably available. As human rabies death is a significant public health concern, the circumstances of each case should be prospectively investigated. Further research is required to understand how to reduce the number of rabies cases.
