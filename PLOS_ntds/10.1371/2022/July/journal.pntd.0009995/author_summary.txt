Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is characterized by development of egg-induced chronic inflammatory lesions of the cervix and the vagina. FGS causes various symptoms such vaginal discharge, genital itch, pelvic pain and post-coital bleeding, and the disease is further associated with reproductive complications such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Moreover, FGS is today hypothesized as a risk factor for transmission of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. General prevention directed against Schistosoma infection and use of praziquantel as anthelmintic drug therapy are cornerstones in the FGS control strategy. The aim of the study was to test inter- and intra-rater reliability using a cervical lesion proportion (CLP) measure in a series of digital images from women living in a Schistosoma haematobium hyperendemic area in Madagascar‚Äù. In that overall context, we have developed a digital image-based tool for quantitative assessment of FGS associated cervical lesions, which enables evaluation of treatment outcome at individual as well as community level with particular focus on resolution of cervical pathology, but also on risk of recurrence. The tool will also provide new information in understanding the natural history of FGS including development of clinical pathology.
