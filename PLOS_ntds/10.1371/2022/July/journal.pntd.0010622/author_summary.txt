Even though the overall infection risk of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in Guangdong Province decreased over time, it is still higher than the national average. Risk maps can assist spatial-targeting control and intervention. We developed Bayesian geostatistical models based on the data derived from three national surveys on important human parasitic diseases in Guangdong, conducted in 1988–1992, 2002–2003, and 2015–2016, respectively. Based on these, high-resolution, age- and gender-specific infection risk maps were produced. We found that the overall STH infection risk sharply decreased over time, from 68.66% to 0.97%. We identified that moderately endemic risk (>5%) mostly distributed in small areas of western Guangdong, and prevalence in all other areas was below 5% in 2015–2016. The higher infection risk of STHs was found among females. Children were most likely to be infected with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, however, middle-aged and elderly people had higher infection risk of hookworm. Therefore, results of this study suggested that the government can pay more attention to people in western Guangdong, especially middle-aged and elderly people engaged in farming. As such, the government may continue to strengthen the monitoring net in the historical endemic areas to avoid the re-infection.
