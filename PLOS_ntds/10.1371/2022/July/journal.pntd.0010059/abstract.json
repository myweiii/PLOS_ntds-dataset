    "Background": "Dengue’s emergence in West Africa was typified by the Burkina Faso outbreaks in 2016 and 2017, the nation’s largest to date. In both years, we undertook three-month surveys of Aedes populations in or near the capital city Ouagadougou, where the outbreaks were centered.",
    "Methodology": "In 1200LG (urban), Tabtenga (peri-urban) and Goundry (rural) localities, we collected indoor and outdoor resting mosquito adults, characterized larval habitats and containers producing pupae and reared immature stages to adulthood in the laboratory for identification. All mosquito adults were identified morphologically. Host species (from which bloodmeals were taken) were identified by PCR. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate relationships between adult or larval densities and multiple explanatory variables.",
    "Results": "From samples in 1,780 houses, adult Ae. aegypti were significantly more abundant in the two urban localities (Tabtenga and 1200 LG) in both years than in the rural site (Goundry), where Anopheles spp. were far more common. Results from adult collections indicated a highly exophilic and anthropophilic (>90% bloodmeals of human origin) vector population, but with a relatively high proportion of bloodfed females caught inside houses. Habitats producing most pupae were waste tires (37% of total pupae), animal troughs (44%) and large water barrels (30%).",
    "Conclusion": "Results provide an evidence base for the selection of appropriate vector control methods to minimize the risk, frequency and magnitude of future outbreaks in Ouagadougou. An integrated strategy combining community-driven practices, waste disposal and insecticide-based interventions is proposed. The prospects for developing a regional approach to arbovirus control in West Africa or across Africa are discussed."
