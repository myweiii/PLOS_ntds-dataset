    "Abstract": "The global impact of mosquito-borne diseases has increased significantly over recent decades. Ebinur Lake virus (EBIV), a newly classified orthobunyavirus, is reported to be highly pathogenic in adult mice. The evaluation of vector competence is essential for predicting the arbovirus transmission risk. Here, Aedes aegypti was applied to evaluate EBIV infection and dissemination in mosquitos. Our experiments indicated that Ae. aegypti had the possibility to spread EBIV (with a transmission rate of up to 11.8% at 14 days post-infection) through biting, with the highest viral dose in a single mosquito’s saliva reaching 6.3 plaque-forming units. The highest infection, dissemination and ovary infection rates were 70%, 42.9%, and 29.4%, respectively. The high viral infection rates in Ae. aegypti ovaries imply the possibility of EBIV vertical transmission. Ae. aegypti was highly susceptible to intrathoracic infection and the saliva-positive rate reached 90% at 10 days post-infection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed Toll and Imd signaling pathways were implicated in the mosquito’s defensive response to EBIV infection. Defensin C and chitinase 10 were continuously downregulated in mosquitoes infected via intrathoracic inoculation of EBIV. Comprehensive analysis of the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for EBIV in laboratory has indicated the potential risk of EBIV transmission through mosquitoes. Moreover, our findings support a complex interplay between EBIV and the immune system of mosquito, which could affect its vector competence."
