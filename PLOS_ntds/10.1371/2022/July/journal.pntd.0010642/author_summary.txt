Aedes aegypti, the major vector of numerous clinically important arboviruses such as dengue virus, is frequently used in studies of vector competence for arboviruses. Our findings imply that Ae. aegypti can get infected with EBIV following either oral feeding or intrathoracic injection, posing a risk of viral transmission. After oral infection, EBIV was able to enter saliva when the viral titer in the gut exceeded a threshold. Remarkably, the saliva-positive rates in mosquitoes infected by intrathoracic injection were greater than those infected by oral feeding. The results of oral feeding and intrathoracic injection indicate that the midgut escape barrier (MEB) is the principal barrier to EBIV infection in Ae. aegypti. According to our analysis of the changes in gene expression after infection, we also found that the expression of some immune-related genes changed during early viral infection, whereas the expression of mosquito genes involved in metabolism showed significant differences at late stage of virus infection.
