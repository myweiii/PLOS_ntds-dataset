Investigating relapse patterns in infections of Plasmodium vivax, a parasite that causes malaria, is challenging due to concurrent reinfection events alongside true relapses in most clinical cohorts. We performed sequencing on P. vivax samples from a cohort of Indonesian soldiers who were exposed to the parasite while deployed in a malaria-endemic region and then experienced relapses after their return to a region with no current malaria transmission. From these true relapses, we show that most infected individuals harbor multiple lineages of hypnozoites (latent liver stage parasites that reactivate to cause relapse) but individual relapses are largely driven by a single hypnozoite lineage or clone. Additionally, the average number of parasite clones detected in each relapse decreases over time. These findings suggest that P. vivax hypnozoites activate independently from each other and that their population in the liver decreases over time after the initial infection, possibly due to immune clearance or loss of parasite viability.
