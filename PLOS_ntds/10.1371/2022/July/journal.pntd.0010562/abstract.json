    "Background": "Viruses of the family Flaviviridae, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are widely distributed worldwide. JEV, DENV and YFV belong to the genus Flavivirus, whereas HCV belongs to the genus Hepacivirus. Children\u2019s symptoms are usually severe. As a result, rates of hospitalization due to infection with these viruses are high. The epidemiology and disease burden of hospitalized children have rarely been described in detail to date. The objective of this study was to report the general epidemiological characteristics, clinical phenotype, length of stay (LOS), burden of disease, and potential risk factors for hospitalized children infected with JEV, DENV, YFV, or HCV in Chinese pediatric hospitals.",
    "Methodology": "A cross-sectional study of epidemiology and disease burden of children hospitalized for Flaviviridae virus infections between December 2015 and December 2020 in China was performed. Face sheets of discharge medical records (FSMRs) were collected from 27 tertiary children\u2019s hospitals in the Futang Research Center of Pediatric Development and aggregated into FUTang Update medical REcords (FUTURE). Information on sociodemographic variables, clinical phenotype, and LOS as well as economic burden was included in FSMRs and compared using appropriate statistical tests.",
    "Findings": "The study described 490 children aged 0\u201315 years hospitalized for infections with Flaviviridae viruses. Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases are the highest, accounting for 92.65% of the total hospitalization cases caused by Flaviviridae virus infection. The incidence of JE peaked from July to October with a profile of a high proportion of severe cases (68.06%) and low mortality (0.44%). Rural children had a significantly higher incidence than urban children (91.63%). Most hospitalized dengue cases were reported in 2019 when dengue outbreaks occurred in many provinces of China, although only 14 dengue cases were collected during the study period. Yellow fever (YF) is still an imported disease in China. The hospitalizations for children with hepatitis C (HC) were not high, and mild chronic HC was the main clinical phenotype of patients. Among the four viral infections, JE had the highest disease burden (LOS and expenditure) for hospitalized children.",
    "Conclusion": "First, the present study reveals that JE remains the most serious disease due to Flaviviridae virus infection and threatens children\u2019s health in China. Many pediatric patients have severe illnesses, but their mortality rate is lower, suggesting that existing treatment is effective. Both JEV vaccination and infection control of rural children should represent a focus of study. Second, although the dual risks of indigenous epidemics and imports of DENV still exist, the prevalence of DENV in children is generally manageable. Third, YFV currently shows no evidence of an epidemic in China. Finally, the proportion of children with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is relatively large among hospitalized children diagnosed with HCV. Thus, early and effective intervention should be offered to children infected with HCV to ease the burden of CHC on public health."
