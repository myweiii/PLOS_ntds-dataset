Emerging viruses—newly discovered or with increasing disease incidence—pose a constant threat to public health. The most recent examples of devastating outbreaks of emerging viruses are Ebola virus, new coronaviruses, and Zika virus epidemics. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the emerging flavivirus related to Zika virus; it is the most important cause of brain infections in Asia that may cause death and severe neurological sequela in patients. Almost half of the world’s population lives in territories where JEV is permanently circulating. Like Zika virus, JEV is transmitted to humans via mosquito bites. However, there are emerging concerns about alternative beyond mosquito-borne ways of flavivirus transmission which may expand the geographical pathogen range to territories with no insect vectors. For example, sexual and transplacental Zika virus transmissions with replication in human vaginal epithelial cells, placenta, and fetuses have been described. Here, we questioned whether JEV also has potential for sexual transmission and studied its tropism in the human female reproductive epithelium—the primary barrier cells of the reproductive system. Also, using pigs—the native amplifying host for JEV, we studied JEV infection in the female lower and upper reproductive tract tissues. We discovered that JEV replicates in different reproductive epithelial cells and tissues of both humans and pigs for a long time, causing molecular and clinical pathology. Thus, further studies are needed to better understand the interactions of JEV with reproductive tissues, how persistent infection affects female reproductive functions, and the risks for non-mosquito transmissions.
