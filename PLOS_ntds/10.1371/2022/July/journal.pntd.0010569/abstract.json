    "Abstract": "Treatment of Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is based on using antimoniate derivatives; patients\u2019 compliance for systemic injections is low due to the pain and systemic complications. In this randomized open trial, the efficacy of intra-lesional (IL) injections of meglumine antimoniate (MA) once a week vs. twice a week in the treatment of Anthrpoponothic CL caused by L. tropica was studied. Eligible volunteer patients were selected according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. The included patients were randomly allocated to receive IL-MA injections once a week or twice a week. The primary outcome was set as complete healing of the lesion(s), and defined as complete re-epithelialization and absence of induration in the lesions. A total of 180 parasitologicaly proven CL patients caused by L. tropica were recruited, 90 patients were treated with weekly IL-MA and 90 patients received IL-MA twice a week. The complete cure was 87.9% vs. 89.2% in the group received weekly and twice a week IL-MA injections, respectively (P = 0.808). Patients\u2019 compliance was acceptable and side effects were limited to a few local allergic reactions to MA. Median time to healing was significantly shorter in patients who received IL-MA twice a week (median \u00b1 SE) 37\u00b13.8, (CI: 29.6\u201344.4) days compared to whom received IL-MA once a week 60\u00b12.3, (CI: 55.6\u201364.5) days (P< 0.001), however the number of injections was higher in group who received IL-MA twice a week (12 vs. 9 injections). In conclusion, the rate of cure in the group of CL patients with IL-MA twice a week was not significantly different from the group who received IL-MA once a week shorten, but the duration of healing was shorter in the group who received IL-MA twice a week while the group received more injections so is recommended to use IL-MA once a week due to the fact the compliance is acceptable with limited side effects."
