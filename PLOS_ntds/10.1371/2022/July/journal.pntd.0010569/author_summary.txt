Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an emerging uncontrolled neglected tropical disease which annually affecting millions of people in more than 80 countries. Currently available control strategy measures of CL showed not to be fully effective. Although, antimoniate derivatives are in use to treat CL for the last 80 years, but treatment of CL is a dilemma. Systemic use of antimonite derivatives is painful, with limited compliance and accompanies severe adverse events. Efficacy of intra-lesional injections (IL) of antimoniate derivatives is similar to systemic treatment, but there is no agreement how to use IL antimonite derivatives. In the present study efficacy of IL use once a week was compared with twice a week in the treatment of ACL caused by L. tropica in 180 parasitologically proven CL patients. The results showed that the duration of healing is shorter in those who received Glucantime twice a week, but overall treatment of CL using IL once a week is superior to twice a week and more practical.
