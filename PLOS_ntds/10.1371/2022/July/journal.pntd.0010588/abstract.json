    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with maternal infection associated with preterm birth, congenital malformations, and fetal death, and adult infection associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recent widespread endemic transmission of ZIKV and the potential for future outbreaks necessitate the development of an effective vaccine. We developed a ZIKV vaccine candidate based on virus-like-particles (VLPs) generated following transfection of mammalian HEK293T cells using a plasmid encoding the pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) structural protein genes. VLPs were collected from cell culture supernatant and purified by column chromatography with yields of approximately 1-2mg/L. To promote increased particle yields, a single amino acid change of phenylalanine to alanine was made in the E fusion loop at position 108 (F108A) of the lead VLP vaccine candidate. This mutation resulted in a modest 2-fold increase in F108A VLP production with no detectable prM processing by furin to a mature particle, in contrast to the lead candidate (parent). To evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy, AG129 mice were immunized with a dose titration of either the immature F108A or lead VLP (each alum adjuvanted). The resulting VLP-specific binding antibody (Ab) levels were comparable. However, geometric mean neutralizing Ab (nAb) titers using a recombinant ZIKV reporter were significantly lower with F108A immunization compared to lead. After virus challenge, all lead VLP-immunized groups showed a significant 3- to 4-Log10 reduction in mean ZIKV RNAemia levels compared with control mice immunized only with alum, but the RNAemia reduction of 0.5 Log10 for F108A groups was statistically similar to the control. Successful viral control by the lead VLP candidate following challenge supports further vaccine development for this candidate. Notably, nAb titer levels in the lead, but not F108A, VLP-immunized mice inversely correlated with RNAemia. Further evaluation of sera by an in vitro Ab-dependent enhancement assay demonstrated that the F108A VLP-induced immune sera had a significantly higher capacity to promote ZIKV infection in FcγR-expressing cells. These data indicate that a single amino acid change in the fusion loop resulted in increased VLP yields but that the immature F108A particles were significantly diminished in their capacity to induce nAbs and provide protection against ZIKV challenge."
