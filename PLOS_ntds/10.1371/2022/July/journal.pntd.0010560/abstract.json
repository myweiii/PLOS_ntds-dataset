    "Background": "Neglected Tropical Diseases amenable to Preventive Chemotherapy (PC-NTDs) affect the poorest populations around the world, especially in Africa. Scientific information on the distribution and level of endemicity of these diseases in the Republic of the Congo (RoC) is scarce in the published literature. We sought to collect all available epidemiological data on PC-NTDs in the RoC to document the historical and current situation and identify challenges in reaching the elimination of NTDs.",
    "Methods": "We searched Medline and Horizon databases for studies published until to July 4th, 2019, on onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and trachoma in the RoC. Unpublished reports were also reviewed. We included all epidemiological studies containing community data and excluded case reports. Location, prevalence data, and dates of the studies were extracted.",
    "Principal findings": "We identified 933 records, of which 56 met the inclusion criteria. The articles published before 1960 mainly concerned onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis. Despite a low number over the studied period, since 2005 there has been a steady increase in the number of publications. Most of the studies were cross-sectional and conducted in the general population. Trachoma is endemic in the Sangha and Likouala departments (prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular > 5% in some villages), and further mapping is essential to properly assess the burden of this disease in the country. While the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths is still high (over 20%) in a large part of Congo, cases of lymphatic filariasis (based on Wuchereria bancrofti antigenaemia and/or microfilaraemia) and onchocerciasis are becoming rare and very focused. To achieve the elimination of PC-NTDs, further intervention is required.",
    "Conclusions": "Except for trachoma, whose epidemiological situation should be better evaluated, PC-NTDs are endemic in the RoC, and actions to control them have been taken by health authorities. To eliminate PC-NTDs, which are still present in some locations, new mapping surveys are needed, and increased investment in scientific research should be encouraged in the country."
