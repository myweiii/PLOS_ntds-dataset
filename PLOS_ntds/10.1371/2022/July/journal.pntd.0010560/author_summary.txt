For many years, the Republic of the Congo has implemented control programs to combat neglected tropical diseases that cause severe disabilities. By tracing the past and recent distribution of these diseases through the analysis of epidemiological studies, we show that most remaining NTDs are located in defined foci of infection, maintained depending on ecology and lifestyle habits. However, the small number of recent studies limits the production of new knowledge, which would be useful for a better understanding of epidemiological patterns and to accelerate NTD elimination.
