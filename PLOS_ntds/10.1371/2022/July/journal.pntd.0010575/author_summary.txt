Schistosomiasis and intestinal parasites cause significant morbidity and, in endemic countries, WHO recommends the implementation of periodical large scale distribution of anthelminthic drugs (deworming) for the control of the morbidity due to these infections.
Deworming significantly scaled up from the year 2000 to 2019 reaching the majority of children at risk, as a consequence the number of infected individuals and the severity of the infections has been significantly reduced. This is reflected on the significant reduction of number of DALYs lost in the last two decades for these two infections.
