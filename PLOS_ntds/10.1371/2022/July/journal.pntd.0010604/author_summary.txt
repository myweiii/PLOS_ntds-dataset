Melioidosis, a disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, rarely develops in the absence of well-described predisposing conditions that include diabetes mellitus, hazardous alcohol intake, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, malignancy, and immunosuppression. These comorbidities are also strongly linked to patients’ short and long-term outcomes. In the large Darwin Prospective Melioidosis Study (DPMS) performed in Australia’s Northern Territory, the presence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and/or congestive cardiac failure (CCF) were independently associated with pulmonary melioidosis and independently predicted death. Indeed, patients with RHD and/or CCF and melioidosis had the highest case-fatality rate in the DPMS cohort.
The prevalence of RHD and/or CCF in cases of melioidosis in this study in Far North Queensland (FNQ), was similar to that seen in the Northern Territory. However, every patient had at least one other traditional risk factor for the disease. Furthermore, pulmonary involvement and mortality were not higher in patients with RHD and/or CCF. In FNQ, RHD and CCF are not independent risk factors for melioidosis and have limited prognostic utility. The high prevalence of these cardiac diseases in patients with melioidosis may be, at least partly, explained by the confounding presence of socioeconomic disadvantage that increases the incidence of all three conditions.
