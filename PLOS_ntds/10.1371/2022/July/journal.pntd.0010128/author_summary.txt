Mycetoma is a common health and medical problem that is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries and has devastating effects on patients. The destructive nature of late-stage infection means that treatment often requires long term use of antibiotic therapy, massive surgical excisions and amputation. Several different bacterial species have been described as causing this disease but our understanding of the true diversity of mycetoma causing bacteria has been limited by a lack of molecular sequence data. We have now sequenced the genomes of 17 samples isolated from patients at the Mycetoma Research centre in Sudan, revealing a diverse range of species associated with infection including one new Streptomyces species, and three species with no previous association with human mycetoma. Crucially, all isolates had a high IC against the current first-line antibiotics used to treat actinomycetoma under laboratory conditions. The highest ICs were seen in Actinomadura madurae, which was also the most frequently observed species isolated from patients in our study. We hope that these results will aid in the development of future rapid diagnostic tools and the improvement of treatment outcomes.
