Women who have fresh water contact in rivers or lakes may get infected with the waterborne parasites, that can cause Bilharzia, also called schistosomiasis. In Africa, Schistosoma (S.) haematobium is associated with HIV acquisition, genital tract lesions, bloody and malodorous discharge. There is also decreased clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with genital schistosomiasis. There are occasional case reports showing eggs of S. mansoni (intestinal schistosomiasis) in the genitals. However, no study has systematically looked for the genital tract lesions of S. mansoni and the impact on gynaecological health has never been explored. We sought to explore if S. mansoni causes the lower genital tract genital lesions. In women living near Lake Victoria, Kenya, we included 147 women who had S. mansoni but not S. haematobium infection. We found that the few women who had signs of sequelae of schistosomiasis infection in the genitals, so-called homogenous yellow patches had all potentially been exposed to S. haematobium in their youth. In this study population we found no lower genital tract lesions or genital symptoms to be associated with S. mansoni.
