Trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, is a chronic conjunctivitis caused by repeated infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. As more endemic regions approach the trachoma elimination goal, it becomes critical to identify tools that can be used for monitoring the potential resurgence or re-emergence of trachoma. Serologic testing for chlamydial antibodies is one potential tool. Understanding the risk of seroconversion and seroreversion in children in low endemic districts is critical for determining the value of serology as a monitoring tool. We followed a cohort of children in the formerly trachoma endemic Kongwa district in Tanzania over three years. We demonstrated the relative stability of antibody status with 85â€“86% of the children retaining their baseline serostatus. We also documented an overall seroconversion rate of 13% and a seroreversion rate of 12%. We found younger ages to be a risk factor for both seroconversion and seroreversion. Our study provides necessary new evidence for the slow rate of overall change in seroprevalence over three years and highlights the potential use of the younger aged children for sero-monitoring of trachoma as they are more likely to reflect the dynamic interplay of true seroconversion and seroreversion. Furthermore, using only cross-sectional serostatus to estimate seroconversion may result in an underestimate if seroreversion rates are not included in the estimation.
