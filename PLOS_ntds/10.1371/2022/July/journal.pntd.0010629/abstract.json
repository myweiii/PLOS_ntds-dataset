    "Background": "Serologic testing for chlamydial antibodies is one potential tool for trachoma monitoring. Understanding the dynamics of seroconversion and seroreversion in low endemic districts is critical for determining the value of using serology.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We surveyed a random sample of 2536 children aged 1–9 years in Kongwa, Tanzania, over three years; 1719 (67.8%) participants had all three follow-ups. Surveys assessed trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF), Chlamydia trachomatis infection, and anti-pgp3 antibodies. Mass drug administration occurred immediately after the first and second follow-up surveys. The cohort was classified into trajectories of change in serostatus, and risk factors were evaluated for seroconversion and seroreversion. We found that 86.2% of seropositives remained seropositive throughout the study, whereas 12.1% seroreverted. Seroreverters were younger (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.88 for every one-year increase in age, 95% CI = 0.79–0.99). 84.5% of seronegatives remained seronegative, and 13.0% seroconverted. Seroconverters were also younger (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87–0.98). Seroconversion and seroreversion were not explained by indeterminate values for the intensity of antibody response. Less than 1% of the cohort had unstable changes in serostatus, mostly explained by values in the indeterminate range. TF and infection in the cohort declined over time, while seropositivity increased from 31.5% to 36.4%.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Antibody status is relatively stable over time. Both seroconversion and seroreversion occurred over the three years in this low endemic district, especially in younger children. Modeling seroreversion is important for accurate determination of seroconversion. The use of serology as a monitoring tool should target the younger aged children as they will most likely capture recent changes in serostatus."
