In this study, we developed and standardized a Real-Time PCR with Reverse Transcription (RT-qPCR) to determine T. cruzi viability in R. prolixus samples. Moreover, we aimed to assess differences between the amplification signals of DNA and mRNA on a T. cruzi colonization kinetics in experimentally infected R. prolixus. Thus, it was possible to analyze the potential of parasiteâ€™s RNA as a molecular viability marker in parasite-vector interaction. This novel RT-qPCR methodology has potential application in viability assessment and raises the possibility for further monitoring of the parasite load in infected insects or studies related to vectorial capacity. Furthermore, the analysis of parasite viability by RT qPCR could be an especially effective tool for Chagas disease diagnostic purposes.
