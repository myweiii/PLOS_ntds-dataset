Viral hemorrhagic diseases have a high risk of emergence in tropical regions. The consequences on public health are often disastrous in the low- and middle-income countries that face difficulties to control epidemics. This scenario has unfortunately occurred in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 with the Ebola virus disease epidemic. There is an urgent need to increase the capacity for rapid detection of the emergence of such diseases and adopting a One Health approach since most of them are zoonotic. Community-based surveillance seems appropriate to address this issue in the context of these countries. We collected preparatory data through semi-structured interviews of community actors in human health, animal health and ecosystem health in Guinea. We used participatory epidemiology that appears to be a consistent method to assess local knowledge and perceptions of diseases and clinical signs and to identify health information exchange network opportunities. We aimed to provide relevant recommendations for the design of adapted case definitions and surveillance network in the prospect of implementing a community-based surveillance system of viral hemorrhagic fevers in Guinea and future surveillance activities to be carried out in West Africa.
