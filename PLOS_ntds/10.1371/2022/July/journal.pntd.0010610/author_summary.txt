Yellow fever, one of the most feared lethal zoonotic disease is re-emerging as a public health threat to tropical and sub-tropical countries of South America and Africa. Despite the existence of an effective yellow fever vaccine that is administered through mass vaccination campaigns and in routine immunization programs. against this disease, the mortality remains very high during the outbreak of yellow fever in several sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. It is necessary to have accurate epidemiological data on YFV infection, in order to prioritize the policies, funding for public health interventions, and health-care planning. Our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis with data provided on the case fatality rate (CFR) and prevalence of YFV in humans, and prevalence of YFV in arthropods, non-human primates (NHP), and other animal species in SSA. Broadly, the study shows that the CFR and prevalence of YFV in humans were relatively high and low respectively. Furthermore, mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and Anopheles funestus were the main vectors of YFV. Finally, only NHP of the Cercopithecidae family were the reservoirs of the YFV in SSA. These data provide evidence on the ongoing circulation of the YFV in SSA and the possibility of the large outbreaks YFV in SSA. Author suggests that preventive strategies should be promoted by educating and raising people’s awareness about YFV infection and strengthening practitioners ‘capacities towards adequate diagnosis and proper management of this infection in SSA.
