Infecting 1 in 3 worldwide, the single-celled parasite T. gondii causes a chronic infection whereby it can migrate to the brain and promote low-grade neuroinflammation. Given this intimate association, infection with T. gondii has the capacity to induce changes in brain morphology and behavior as well as modulate the production of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. Consequently, T. gondii has been linked with several neurocognitive disorders including schizophrenia, dementia, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, in addition to a loss of fear response. To examine how infection impacts pathways utilizing neurotransmitters, we used a mouse model, based on stimulant-induced (cocaine) hyperactivity. Infection with T. gondii did not alter fear behavior but did impact motor activity and neuropsychiatric-related behaviors. Gene expression analysis revealed an initial enrichment of uninformative immune-response pathways. By applying a novel context enrichment approach, we identified significant associations with neurologically relevant genes involved in multiple pathways. These include sets of genes which exhibited dampened response to cocaine exposure in the context of T. gondii infection, suggestive of a neuroprotective effect that may be advantageous to parasite persistence. We suggest this novel mouse model offers a new perspective to dissect the molecular pathways by which T. gondii infection contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders.
