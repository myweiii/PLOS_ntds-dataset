Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic in Cambodia and remains the most common cause of acute viral encephalitis, particularly in children and adolescents. The traditionally described cycle of JEV, involving wild birds as reservoirs, pigs as amplifying hosts and Culex mosquitoes as vectors is questioned, with increasing evidence of a more complex multi-host system involved in areas where densities of pigs are low. In Cambodia, the infection could be maintained in a multi-host system consisting of pigs and poultry as competent hosts, and dogs, cattle and humans as non-competent hosts. We defined a compartmental dynamic model of JEV transmission in a multi-host system representing a rural Cambodian village, to predict human exposure to JEV in the studied area, and to analyse how host community composition may affect human exposure and R0 value. Our theoretical approach showed that variations of the composition of the multi-host system may have an impact on human exposure to JEV, and thus on the disease burden in humans, especially in young children. Besides children vaccination in JEV endemic areas, a proper evaluation of the impact on human health is needed to target prevention actions and reduce JEV burden in Cambodia.
