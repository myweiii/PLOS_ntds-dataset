    "Background": "Undernutrition and schistosomiasis are public health problems and often occur in low and middle-income countries. Protein undernutrition can alter the host-parasite environment system and aggravate the course of schistosomiasis. This study aimed to assess the impact of a low-protein diet on the efficacy of praziquantel.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Thirty-day-old mice were fed with a low-protein diet, and 40 days later, they were individually infected with fifty Schistosoma mansoni cercariae. A 28-day-treatment with praziquantel at 100 mg/kg for five consecutive days followed by distilled water begins on the 36th day post-infection. Mice were sacrificed on the 64th day post-infection. We determined the parasitological burden, liver and intestine histomorphometry, liver injury, and immunomodulation parameters. Praziquantel treatment of infected mice fed with a standard diet (IN-PZQ) resulted in a significant reduction of worm and egg burdens and a normalization of iron and calcium levels. The therapy also improved schistosomiasis-induced hepatopathy and oxidative stress. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of praziquantel were also significant in these mice. When infected mice receiving the low-protein diet were treated with praziquantel (ILP-PZQ), the body weight loss and hepatomegaly were not alleviated, and the worm and liver egg burdens were significantly higher than those of IN-PZQ mice (P < 0.001). The treatment did not reduce the increased activities of ALT and \u03b3-GGT, the high malondialdehyde concentration, and the liver granuloma volume. The iron and calcium levels were not ameliorated and differed from those of IN-PZQ mice (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). Moreover, in these mice, praziquantel treatment did not reverse the high level of IL-5 and the low mRNA expression of CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1 and CXCL-10/IP-10 induced by S. mansoni infection.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "These results demonstrated that a low-protein diet reduced the schistosomicidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities of praziquantel."
