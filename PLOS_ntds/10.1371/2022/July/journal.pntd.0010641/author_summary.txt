Leprosy is complicated by episodes of inflammation called leprosy reactions. Leprosy reactions are important causes of nerve damage and illness. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) also called type 2 reaction is a severe systemic immune-mediated complication of borderline and lepromatous leprosy. ENL causes high morbidity and thus requires immediate medical attention. We recruited 60 untreated patients with lepromatous leprosy (30 patients with ENL reactions and 30 patients without ENL reactions) in Ethiopia to better understand the loss of immune regulation in ENL. We took blood samples at 2 time points before and after prednisolone treatment and assessed if the regulatory T-cells in these patients are functionally competent to control inflammation. Previously we described that the proportion of Tregs are reduced in ENL. In the present study we found that despite the reduction in the proportion of Tregs, their functional integrity is intact and competent which confirms that ENL is associated with reduction of Tregs proportion but not with loss of their function. This is an important finding which suggests that future studies should focus on ways of increasing the proportion of Tregs in ENL to control the inflammation.
