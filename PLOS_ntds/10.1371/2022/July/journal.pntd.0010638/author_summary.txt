Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrhea in travelers and in young children in low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC). ETEC infects the small intestine using surface located adhesins called colonization factors (CFs) and delivers toxins to the intestine. These CFs are optimal targets for ETEC vaccine development for the induction of colonization-blocking responses. In the current study we investigated the role of 2 CFs, namely CFA/I and CS21 when they are simultaneously expressed in geographically diverse ETEC clinical isolates, in infection using the human enteroid model. This system is the most human relevant and sensitive model to study enteric pathogens. We determined that CFA/I was important for adherence to the human enteroid by ETEC strains expressing CFA/I and CS21. Strain-specific levels of toxin delivery were quantified but there was no difference between wildtype and CF-deficient mutant strains. This result highlights the opportunity to consider the effects of intestinal movement and oxygen levels in the model. Infected enteroids did not have disrupted cell monolayers or produce inflammatory signals. This study supports the strategy to target CFA/I in ETEC vaccine development and underscores the enteroid as a significant model system.
