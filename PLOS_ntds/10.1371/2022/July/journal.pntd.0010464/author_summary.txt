Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease transmitted primarily via bites by animals infected with the rabies virus. The majority of human cases occur due to the exposure to infected domestic dogs. In the Republic of South Africa, rabies is endemic, and domestic dogs, mongooses, bat-eared foxes, and jackals are the main reservoir hosts. Rabies control efforts typically target domestic dog populations, as it is difficult to monitor and control in wildlife species. Jackals are known to sustain infection cycles with domestic dogs. This study was conducted to improve understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies in human, domestic dogs, and wildlife, in relation to ecology and socio-economics in northern South Africa. Human cases occurred where disease clusters in dogs were identified. Large size outbreaks in dogs were caused by dog rabies virus variants, but disease clusters included multiple virus variants in multiple host species. Rural communities in Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces, characterized by woodlands and high temperatures and precipitation, were at high risk of canine rabies originating from dogs.
