St. Louis encephalitis virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause human disease and is found in California, where it was detected every year from 1938 to 2003. However, after West Nile virus arrived in 2003, St. Louis encephalitis virus was not detected again until 2015, when it re-emerged in Riverside County. From 2015 through 2020, St. Louis encephalitis virus has been detected in mosquito pools and sentinel chicken sera samples in 16 counties and a total of 24 human disease cases have been reported. However, during that same time-period, West Nile virus has been detected in 10 times as many mosquito pools and 60 times as many chicken sera samples across 54 counties and over 2,400 human disease cases have been reported. Although mosquitoes are tested routinely for both viruses, surveillance is not uniform throughout the state, and there has been a steady decline in the use of sentinel chickens. Since St. Louis encephalitis virus patient screening is dependent upon environmental detection, California may be underestimating the incidence of human disease due to this virus.
