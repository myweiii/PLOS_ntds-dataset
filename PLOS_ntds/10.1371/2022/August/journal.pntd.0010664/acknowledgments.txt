The authors acknowledge the efforts of the local mosquito and vector control agencies, who collected and submitted environmental samples for testing, as well as their financial support to the testing laboratories, and the local public health departments who investigate and report human cases, the local public health laboratories who test specimens, and physicians and healthcare providers who collect specimens and provided clinical care. We are grateful to the member agencies of the Mosquito and Vector Control Association of California, the UC Davis Arbovirus Research and Training laboratory, and other staff at VRDL and VBDS.
