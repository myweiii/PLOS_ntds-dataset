In the Amazon rainforest, both Plasmodium vivax and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are common, yet the Burkittâ€™s lymphoma (BL) is rare, despite an association between endemic BL with chronic P. falciparum exposure. Nevertheless, the influence of EBV infection on malaria immunity remains undetermined. Here, we investigated for the first time whether continuous detection of EBV-DNA in the peripheral blood of adults exposed to P. vivax could impact the antibody response to blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates. The methodological approach involved 12-month follow-up among P. vivax-exposed Amazonian classified as persistent EBV-DNA carriers (PersVDNA) and an age-matched group with no viral DNA detection (NegVDNA); groups were further differentiated based on profile of viral antibodies (mainly IgG VCA-p18). Collectively, our findings demonstrated that antibody levels against P. vivax antigens were in general lower in the PersVDNA group as compared with NegVDNA. More significant differences were observed to a novel vaccine candidate (DEKnull-2) whose antibody response were previously associated with broadly neutralizing P. vivax antibodies. Differences between groups were less pronounced with P. vivax antigens associated with seasonal changes in the antibody responses. In this conceptual study, we provide evidence that long-term detection of EBV in peripheral blood may impact immune response to major malaria vaccine candidates.
