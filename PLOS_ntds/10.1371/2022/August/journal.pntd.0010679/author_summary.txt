Neglected tropical diseases include food-borne trematode infections such as paragonimiasis that causes severe illness with important social and economic consequences. In this study, we compared excretory/secretory products (ESPs) produced by the North American lung fluke Paragonimus kellicotti that are released during in vitro culture with those that are released in vivo inside the lungs of experimentally infected animals. We identified a total of 2,137 P. kellicotti proteins. These included 1,914 proteins in soluble extracts of whole flukes, 947 proteins identified in ESPs released during in vitro culture, and 37 proteins identified in fluid recovered from lung cysts that surround adult flukes in experimentally infected gerbils. The most abundant functional protein categories varied by sample type. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has compared proteins released in vitro and in vivo by adult Paragonimus flukes. Proteins released in vivo may help the parasite evade host immunity. They may have practical value as novel drug targets or lead to improved diagnostic tests for paragonimiasis.
