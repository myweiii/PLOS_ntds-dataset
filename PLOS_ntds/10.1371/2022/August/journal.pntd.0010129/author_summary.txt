Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major neglected tropical disease (NTD) affecting over 120 million individuals worldwide and identified as one of WHO’s 20 NTDs targeted for elimination. It has strong links with poverty and is associated with significant clinical morbidity, which impose considerable socio-psychological and economic burdens on the affected individuals. One of the main goals of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is the use of mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt LF transmission. The initial 2020 elimination target year set by the GPELF could not be met, with 2030 now the new proposed year targeted for global elimination. The study evaluated the impact of 15 years of MDA on the control of LF in two hotspot districts in Ghana. The results from this study are indicative of a halt in LF transmission in the districts, with microfilaria detected in <1% of those sampled. However, the antigenemia prevalence is still above the recommended level. MDA should be intensified especially at the border towns or alternative treatment strategies should be employed to finally eliminate the disease as some people who are still with the active infection can serve as a reservoir for recrudescence and transmission in already “LF-free” areas.
