To reduce morbidity caused by parasitic worm infections, hundreds of million treatments are given to children every year through repeat cycles of single-dose deworming drugs. This strategy works, and is cost-effective. However, the downside is drug pressure that potentially selects for resistant parasites. Hence, there is a need to monitor treatment efficacy, and do so in a way that allows us to pick up early any deterioration in treatment effects. We analyzed data from 13 trials that enrolled 5,688 infected people who were given deworming drugs or a placebo, by calculating the reduction in worm egg counts in their stools from before to 14–21 and 22–45 days after treatment using different methods. We found that many people harbored more than one species of parasitic worms. Neither multiple infections, nor the intensity of infection, or whether effects were measured earlier or later, appeared to affect treatment efficacy. We also found that the most common treatments are only partially effective. The World Health Organization recommended criteria for efficacy were met in 50%, 62%, and 33% studies of albendazole for roundworm, whipworm, and hookworm, respectively and in 25% of mebendazole studies. In addition, we confirmed that combinations of albendazole-ivermectin and albendazole-oxantel pamoate are promising treatments.
