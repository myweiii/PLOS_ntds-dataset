In Burkina Faso, like in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT) is hampering economic development. It was therefore important to investigate the extent of trypanosome infections after years of control. This study examined circulating trypanosomes in domestic animals using parasitological, molecular and serological tools in southwest Burkina Faso. The prevalence levels observed show that the known epidemiological situation in the region has not really changed. The trypanosome species usually found in the area such as T. congolense, T. vivax and T. brucei s.l. have remained the same, with a stronger presence of T. vivax. The low occurrence of tsetse flies and the predominance of T. vivax attests to the role of the mechanical vectors in maintaining the disease. Although no cases of T. brucei gambiense infection was encountered in the animals examined, trypanolysis tests suggest that there are contact cases in this historical focus of sleeping sickness. Efforts are therefore necessary to reduce or even eliminate the trypanosome burden, and the data provided by this study can assist the decision making.
