Infection of an animal with more than one pathogen may result into a more devastating impact. Only few studies have investigated co-infection with multiple pathogens in wildlife, despite their key role as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases. Therefore, there is need for investigations on co-infection with neglected zoonotic pathogens in wildlife to inform prevention and control approaches and reduce disease impact in wildlife and potential transmission of these pathogens between wildlife, livestock, and humans. This study assessed co-exposure of various Kenyan wildlife species with three zoonotic pathogens, including Brucella spp, Coxiella burnetii and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Results from this study revealed widespread, but varied exposure levels to the three individual pathogens within the several wildlife species. Likewise, the study also found the presence of co-exposure with the three pathogens. The findings from this study points to the need for establishment of surveillance and control programmes that target multiple pathogens in the wildlife populations to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious pathogens in wildlife and their zoonotic transmission.
