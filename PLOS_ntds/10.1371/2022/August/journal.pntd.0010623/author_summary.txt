Although pregnant rhesus macaques are susceptible to infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), fetal phenotypes can be subtle and variable. Most macaque studies of ZIKV have involved infection with Asian-lineage viruses because these viruses caused Western Hemisphere outbreaks beginning in 2015. African-lineage ZIKV yields more severe adverse fetal outcomes in small animal models. Here, we provide evidence that pregnant macaques infected late in the first trimester using a high dose of African-lineage ZIKV have frequent ZIKV-associated pregnancy loss. This severe phenotype establishes a new model for evaluating countermeasures and reinforces the idea that African-lineage ZIKV infection may be a cause of pregnancy loss in areas where it is endemic depending on the amount of transmitted virus during infection.
