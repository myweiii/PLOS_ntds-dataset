Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is a disease of global public and animal health significance. The disease is endemic in major livestock producing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Little or no attention is given to the disease and its impact on livestock and humans. We conducted a cross sectional molecular epidemiology study in Northern Ghana to understand the population structure and distribution of tuberculosis in cattle and to assess the possibility of transmission of the disease to humans. We collected tuberculosis-like lesions from selected cattle organs from three regional abattoirs in the five administrative regions of Northern Ghana and found half of the total samples to be infected with Mycobacterium bovis. Majority of our isolates appeared to be uncharacterised suggesting the need for routine tracking and characterisation of the M. bovis species circulating in the sub-region. Comparison of our analysis of the M. bovis from bovine origin to that obtained from human M. bovis from the same geographical area showed 75% (3/4) of the human M. bovis isolates having same molecular pattern with the bovine isolates. Our findings suggest possible zoonotic transmission and highlight the need for BTB disease control in Northern Ghana.
