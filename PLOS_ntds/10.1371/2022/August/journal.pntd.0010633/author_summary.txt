Plasmodium vivax is the second most common cause of malaria worldwide. It is particularly challenging for malaria elimination as it forms both active blood-stage infections, as well as asymptomatic liver-stage infections that can persist for extended periods of time. The activation of persister forms in the liver (hypnozoites) are responsible for relapsing infections occurring weeks or months following primary infection via a mosquito bite. How P. vivax persists in the liver remains a major gap in understanding of this organism. It has been hypothesized that there is pre-programming of the infectious sporozoite while it is in the salivary-glands that determines if the cellâ€™s fate once in the liver is to progress towards immediate liver stage development or persist for long-periods as a hypnozoite. The aim of this study was to see if such differences were distinguishable at the transcript level in salivary-gland sporozoites. While we found significant variation amongst sporozoites, we did not find clear evidence that they are transcriptionally pre-programmed as has been suggested. Nevertheless, we highlight several intriguing patterns that appear to be P. vivax specific relative to non-relapsing species that cause malaria prompting further investigation.
