Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are diseases transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Between 2014 and 2016 chikungunya and Zika viruses started causing outbreaks in Colombia, one of the countries historically most affected by dengue. We used case counts of the diseases by municipality and week to study the spread trajectory of chikungunya and Zika within Colombia’s territory, and to identify space-time high-risk clusters, i.e., the areas and time periods that dengue, chikungunya, and Zika were more present. Chikungunya and Zika spread similarly in Colombia, but Zika spread faster. The Atlantic coast, a famous touristic destination in the country, was likely the place of entry of chikungunya and Zika in Colombia. The south-western region was identified as a high-risk cluster for all three diseases in separate and simultaneously. This region has a favorable climate for the Aedes mosquitoes and other characteristics that facilitate the diseases’ transmission, such as social deprivation and high population mobility. Our results provide useful information on the locations that should be prioritized for interventions to prevent the entry of new diseases transmitted by Aedes and to reduce the burden of dengue, chikungunya and Zika where they are established.
