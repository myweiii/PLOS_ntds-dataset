Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic helminths of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosoma mansoni is the primary cause of intestinal schistosomiasis, a devastating and widespread parasitic infection that causes morbidity, death and socio-economic impact on endemic communities across the world and especially sub-Saharan Africa. Using whole-genome sequencing, we were able to elucidate the parasite population within Lake Victoria island fishing communities in Uganda which are among the major hotspots for schistosomiasis. We further assessed genetic markers that might be linked to recent observations concerning reduced susceptibility to praziquantel, the major drug used in the treatment of this disease. Whole-genome data on the population genetics of S. mansoni in an African setting will provide a strong basis for future functional genomics or transcriptomic studies that will be key to identifying drug targets, improving existing drugs or developing new therapeutic interventions.
