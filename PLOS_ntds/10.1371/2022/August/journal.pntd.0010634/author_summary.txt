Rabies is one of the most lethal infectious diseases and those living in Asia and Africa have the highest risk of dying from rabies. Bangladesh has the third highest number of estimated human deaths from rabies of all countries with an estimated 2,000â€“2,500 deaths annually. In 2018, a knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) survey was conducted to better describe the rabies burden in four urban and rural areas. Our manuscript will deepen the understanding of ways to develop cost-effective, risk-based PEP delivery to persons with probable rabies exposures to prevent unnecessary PEP shortages among urban and peri-urban populations. The findings here provide useful information regarding bite occurrences, healthcare-seeking behaviors, and a need for strategies to increase rabies awareness in urban and peri-urban areas. This study confirmed a high human rabies death rate in Bangladesh despite a high rate of PEP usage and completion rates and makes a case for IBCM as cost effective means to rabies control in Bangladesh.
