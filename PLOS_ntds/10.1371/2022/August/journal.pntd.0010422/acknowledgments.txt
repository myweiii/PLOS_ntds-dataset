The authors would like to thank all dog owners from the study areas in the Northern Communal Areas of Namibia for their overwhelming willingness to participate in this field trial. We also thank veterinary assistants Amanda Petrus, Taapopi Abisai, David Shaanika and Ashini Petrus for their participation in the vaccination teams and their excellent skills in vaccinating the local dogs. Special thanks go to students Hitjevi Mujorno, Ngurimuje Kahimuno, Abraham Kayambu and Sunny Nayeni from UNAM Ogongo Campus who served as data collectors in each of the vaccination teams. We are particularly indebted to Giulia Manzetti, who did an excellent job of documenting the entire field trial with photos and video recordings. Gratefully acknowledged is the GIS support by Patrick Wysocki and Ronald Schr√∂der (FLI, IfE). Last but not least, the authors would like to thank Drs Gregorio Torres, Moetapele Letshwenyo and Tenzin Tenzin from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WHOA) for their continuous support of the Namibian-German collaboration and their encouragement and help in our joint research projects.
