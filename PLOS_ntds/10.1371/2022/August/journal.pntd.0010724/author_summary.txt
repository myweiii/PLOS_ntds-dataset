Chronic sequelae after viral infections such dengue have been observed, but their true prevalence and impact remain undefined. We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 209 patients with dengue and acute viral respiratory infections (ARI) and followed them up chronic sequelae for up to one year. 18% of patients in the dengue cohort and 14.6% of patients in the ARI cohort experienced chronic sequelae such as fatigue, somnolence, headache, concentration impairment and memory impairment. Patients who experienced chronic sequelae also had lower month-3 SF-12v2 Mental Component Summary Scores, suggesting that such those who self-reported persistence of symptoms experienced functionally worse mental health. Overall our findings reveal an under-appreciated burden of chronic sequelae in dengue and ARI patients and call for further studies to define the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic options for this condition.
