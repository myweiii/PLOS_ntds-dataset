In this pilot study, using a metagenomic approach, we revealed in two Sudanese eumycetoma endemic villages within the While Nile State in Sudan, the habitat of M. mycetomatis and other fungal species responsible for eumycetoma. Although never isolated in culture, M. mycetomatis represented the most abundant eumycetoma-associated species found within soil samples and the third most common species within dung and housing wall samples. All the eumycetoma-associated fungal species detected by metagenomic in black grains samples were identified in patientâ€™s houses, except Falciformispora senegalensis and Acremonium alternatum. The findings obtained in this study provided insight into the habitat of eumycetoma-associated causative species and improved knowledge on eumycetoma origin and risk factors in endemic villages. Furthermore, despite the limited number of samples, these results suggest the main prevention measurements to contain eumycetoma in these endemic areas. These measurements include using gloves and alternative materials to endemic soil and animal dung in building the wall of the houses walls, constructing animal fences and appropriate use of footwear.
