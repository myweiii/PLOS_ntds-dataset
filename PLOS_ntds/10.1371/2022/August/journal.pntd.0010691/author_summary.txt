Severe forms of toxoplasmosis are well described in HIV-infected or transplant patients. However, they have been described in a less studied category of patients: those with autoimmune diseases and treated with immunosuppressive agents, corticosteroid and biotherapies. We report, conjointly with the French National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis, the largest collection of cases of toxoplasmosis occurring in these patients to clarify the risk factors and epidemiology associated with these serious forms of toxoplasmosis. In our series, as well as in the literature, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are the most common autoimmune diseases associated with toxoplasmosis, and antimetabolites, anti-TNF-Î± and corticosteroids were involved in most cases. The originality of this work lies in the molecular characterization of Toxoplasma to study the possible role of the strain factor in diverse clinical forms. Atypical strains, as those observed in South America, were more often observed in ocular toxoplasmosis cases. The significant proportion of cerebral toxoplasmosis (49,2%) and a 14.8% mortality risk highlight the necessity to inform clinicians of this opportunistic infectious complication and encourages them to evoke toxoplasmosis quickly even in case of occurrence of non-specific symptoms.
