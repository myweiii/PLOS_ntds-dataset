The mosquito taxa that make up the Culex pipiens complex are important vectors of the agents of several human diseases such as West Nile and St. Louis encephalitides, and lymphatic filariasis. They are also important vectors of avian malaria, which impacts livestock and wildlife. The development of effective strategies for the control of these mosquitoes requires knowledge of their origins, distribution, dispersal patterns, and the extent to which discreet taxonomic entities within the complex interbreed. To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to compare patterns of genetic diversity across many mosquito samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we developed a targeted, gene-based assay that allowed us to cost-effectively genotype a large number of genetic variants from a representative global sampling of individual Cx. pipiens complex mosquitoes. We show that this assay is a powerful tool for examining genetic structure and hybridization among populations. We also explore its utility for surveying alleles previously shown to be associated with insecticide resistance. Future use of this enrichment assay and the bioinformatics methods described here will allow researchers to study evolutionary patterns across the Cx. pipiens complex as well as monitor the presence of genetic variation that could affect control efforts.
