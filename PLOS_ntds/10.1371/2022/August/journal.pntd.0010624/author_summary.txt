In East Africa and South Asia, the number of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been increasing over the years. In addition to independently posing major health challenges, the two conditions have detrimental effects on each other. In light of new evidence on treatment regimens for this patient population, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its evidence-based region-specific treatment recommendations. To inform this process, we assessed the views of stakeholders on the outcomes of interest and on medication treatment options. The mixed methods study consisted of an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Outcomes such as mortality, complications, clinical cure, relapse and serious adverse events were viewed as important because of the burden associated with their experience, their consequences, and the co-infection status of the patients. Outcomes such as non-serious adverse events were viewed as less important for reasons relating to patient tolerability and ease of treatment. As compared to monotherapy, combination therapy was found to be more equitable, acceptable, and feasible. While our findings are important to consider by clinicians treating patients with VL patients coinfected with HIV, they also inform decisions made by other stakeholders such as guideline developers and program managers.
