River blindness, also known as onchocerciasis, affects 21 million people, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. For decades, the international community has fought this disease through mass drug administration (MDA) programs focused on controlling morbidity in areas of high prevalence. Now, as part of their 2021â€“2030 Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set an ambitious goal, shifting from controlling to eliminating onchocerciasis. This implies addressing areas of low infection prevalence. As a result, new diagnostics tools are required to identify and map areas of low onchocerciasis prevalence and to help decide where to initiate MDA. Similarly, new diagnostics are required to decide when the prevalence of onchocerciasis is sufficiently low to justify stopping MDA. A WHO-appointed independent panel, the Diagnostics Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases, and its subgroup specific to onchocerciasis, have established the desired Target Product Profiles (TPPs) for such new tests. The TPPs were posted in June 2021 on the WHO website. This article describes the methodology used to produce the TPPs, with an emphasis on calculating the required sensitivity and specificity characteristics.
