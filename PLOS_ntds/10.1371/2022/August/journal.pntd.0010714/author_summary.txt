Cryptosporidiosis is the most important waterborne disease in industrialized nations and a primary cause of severe diarrhea in children in low- and middle-income countries. While the IIa subtype family of Cryptosporidium parvum is responsible for most zoonotic cryptosporidiosis, its IId subtype family has emerged in China in recent years. To understand the biological differences between the two major zoonotic subtype families, we have compared the infection patterns, virulence, and genetic characteristics of IIa and IId isolates using a newly established mouse model and whole genome sequencing. We have shown that IId isolates induce significantly higher infection intensity, longer infection duration, and more severe pathogenicity than the reference IIa isolate. They also have three more invasion-associated genes and substantial nucleotide sequence differences. In contrast, the four IId isolates with different virulence differ from each other mainly in sequences of nine genes within a small area on chromosome 6. We conclude that C. parvum isolates in China have high infectivity and unique genomic characteristics, and the productive infection model developed in the study should be useful in evaluations of potential therapeutics and studies of pathogenesis of C. parvum.
