Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne virus which is the leading cause of encephalitis, namely Japanese encephalitis (JE), in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. To reduce the burden of disease, Thailand has introduced a nationwide vaccination against JEV into National Immunization Program (NIP) since the 1990â€™s. Although JE is endemic in Thailand, there have been a limited number of JEV seroepidemiological studies in Thai populations because of the lack highly specific serological assays which account for the cross-reactivity between JEV and other members of the flavivirus family. Thus, we conducted this study which primarily aimed to improve the understanding of immunity and susceptibility of the population living Chiang Mai, a northern Thai province and a JEV-endemic area, after 28 years of a vaccination program to guide the implementation of JE prevention and control measures. Our results suggest that, despite the commendable vaccination effort over the past 3 decades, approximately half of general population (39% of adolescents, 57% of adults, and 48% of older adults/elderly) remains susceptible to JEV infection. Ongoing nationwide surveillance on JEV seropepidemiology is an important strategy to understand the evolving population-level immunity to JEV, and to help formulating the appropriate recommendations on JE immunization.
