Many pathogens are zoonotic in origin and human transmission can occur via vector, direct contact, inhalation, absorption, among other routes enabling human-reservoir interaction. In Amazonia, the cycle of these pathogens (the reservoir, the mode of transmission â€¦) is not always well known. It is important to better understand these cycles in order to evaluate and anticipate the potential risk for human health, both on an individual and collective scale (risk of epidemic). In French Guiana, a French territory located in the Amazon, undocumented gold miners represent several thousand people mainly from Brazil who work in very remote areas in the middle of the rainforest. Documenting several zoonotic diseases among this population living in the middle of biodiversity is very valuable to better understand these cycles but also to assess the impact for their own health and to identify risks for public health. This article provides new data for four zoonoses: Q-fever, leptospirosis, leishmaniasis and yellow fever in this population and discusses the contributions to the understanding of cycles and public health issues.
