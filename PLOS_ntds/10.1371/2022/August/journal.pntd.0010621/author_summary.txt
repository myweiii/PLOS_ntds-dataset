Mucosal leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, is transmitted from animals to humans by sandflies. It is a forgotten disease that affects under-resourced populations in South America. Without treatment, this disease mutilates the face and can even be fatal. Diagnosing mucosal leishmaniasis is challenging. The only available testing in rural areas is the use of either a lesion smear or biopsy for light microscopy, however, this is unreliable. Many patients suffer for years before receiving treatment. Syndromic algorithms use patient characteristics, such as age, gender, and symptoms to identify patients for treatment. This method has been promoted to manage infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, in low resource settings. We explore clinical criteria for a new algorithm to diagnose mucosal leishmaniasis in patients described in the medical literature. We searched the literature for reports written in any language and identified 10 studies describing 192 patients with mucosal leishmaniasis. We found that male gender, ulcer of the nasal mucosa, age >15, and symptom duration >4 months lead to acceptable detection rates. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms might improve the detection of patients with mucosal leishmaniasis but need prospective studies in clinical practice to prove their true potential.
