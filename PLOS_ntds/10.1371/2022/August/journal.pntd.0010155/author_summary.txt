Domestic animals, including cattle and pigs, are known to be important for the transmission of the rhodesiense form of human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT), however the relative importance of these reservoirs compared to wild animals is uncertain and likely focus-specific. For the gambiense form (gHAT) transmission is predominantly human-to-human, however pigs are thought to be a possible reservoir. In this study we used pre-existing data on livestock density and HAT risk to estimate the strength of the effect of cattle and pig density on rHAT risk in Uganda and Malawi, and gHAT risk in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan. We found evidence that cattle and pigs increase the risk of rHAT in Uganda but not Malawi, that pigs increase the risk of gHAT in Uganda and DRC, and that cattle increase the risk of gHAT in DRC alone. These results indicate that control of both forms of HAT should include domestic animals in a One Health framework, however control of rHAT in Malawi is unlikely to be achieved if measures exclude wild animals.
