Schistosomiasis a significant parasitic disease that impose a major public health problem mainly in tropica and subtropical area of Africa. Schistosoma mansoni is endemic in different parts of Ethiopia including Haik town, and reported to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the community. The finding of the current study showed a significant change in hematological and biochemical parameters among S. mansoni infected adult patients. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are the most predominant hematological complications observed in patients with schistosomiasis. On the other hand, the intensity of infection is significantly corelated with the range of hematological abnormalities and alteration of liver function tests. Diagnosing S. mansoni infected patients for hematological and biochemical abnormalities is vital for controlling schistosomiasis associated morbidities and mortality. In addition, the finding of this study indicates the necessity of considering schistosomiasis as a cause of the abnormality or as a co-morbidity while interpreting hematological and biochemical profiles in schistosomiasis endemic areas.
