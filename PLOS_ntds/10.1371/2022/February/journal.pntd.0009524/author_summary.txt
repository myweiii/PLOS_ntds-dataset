Climate change can impact host-parasite systems by rising seawater levels, which flood coastal regions and increase salinity in many freshwaters. Host-parasite interactions are a key component of freshwater ecosystems, however, the effects of sea water intrusion on host-parasite dynamics are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the effects of sea salt concentration on the model host-parasite system, Biomphalaria alexandrina and Schistosoma mansoni. We demonstrate a significant, negative relationship between sea salt concentration and host survival, host reproduction, and parasite success. The increase in freshwater salinity associated with sea level rise has the potential to decrease parasite transmission and disease burden in humans and wildlife.
