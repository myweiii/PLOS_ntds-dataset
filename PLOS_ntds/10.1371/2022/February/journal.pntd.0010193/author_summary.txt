Despite vector-borne zoonoses being a major public health threat globally, they are often overlooked, particularly among resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia. Therefore, we reviewed the current knowledge and identified research gaps of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. We focussed on mosquito-, tick-, flea- and tsetse fly-borne zoonotic pathogens reported in the country. Although we found evidence of circulation of several vector-borne zoonotic pathogens among vectors, animals and humans, clinical cases in humans were rarely reported. This suggests sparse capacity for diagnosis of vector-borne pathogens in healthcare facilities in the country and possibly limited awareness and knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infectious agents. Establishment of facility-based surveillance of vector-borne zoonoses in health facilities could provide valuable insights on morbidity, disease severity, and mortalities associated with infections as well as immune responses. In addition, there is also need for increased genomic surveillance of vector-borne pathogens in vectors and animals and humans for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of these diseases in Zambia. Furthermore, vector ecology studies aimed at understanding the drivers of vector abundance, pathogen host range (i.e., including the range of vectors and reservoirs), parasite-host interactions and factors influencing frequency of human-vector contacts should be prioritized. The study revealed the need for Zambia to scale-up One Health research in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to enable the country to be better prepared for future epidemics, including pandemics.
