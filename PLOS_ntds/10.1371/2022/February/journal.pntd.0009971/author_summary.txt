Pathogenic intestinal protozoan parasites (IPPs) remain a major public health concern. Studies have documented that, the prevalence rates of protozoan infections are quite high in developing regions, particularly Africa and children are the primary victims. Despite numerous studies have been conducted on IPPs in school children in African countries, data on the burden of these infections in African school children have not yet been synthesised. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to provide continent-wide prevalence of IPPs amongst African school children. Our study found that about 25.8% of the children had one or more species of intestinal protozoan parasites in their faecal specimens. E. histolytica/ dispar and Giardia spp. were the most predominant parasites amongst the study participants. The relatively high prevalence estimate of IPPs amongst African children and the considerable variation in the disease prevalence over the years, between and within countries and regions clearly indicates the needs to improve sanitation and hygiene, paying more attention to preventive control measures as well as poverty reduction which are the key to reducing protozoan parasite transmission.
