Across the tropics malaria prevalence has been steadily declining over the last 15 years. This has revealed the importance of non-malarial febrile illnesses and their link to livestock production. Unlike malaria, managing NMFI in resource limited settings is challenging due to the limited number of diagnostic tools available and communities’ health seeking behavior. To develop effective NMFI prevention and management strategies, a comprehensive exploration of the socio-cultural drivers of NMFIs among rural livestock keeping communities is required. Towards this end we conducted a focused ethnographic study in Western Uganda among communities with high human livestock interaction to describe communities’ a) perception of the syndrome of fever b), important biosocial pathways associated with febrile illness and c) their management of these febrile illnesses. This paper describes important biosocial drivers of NMFI, highlights important aspects of the cultural epidemiology of NMFIs, and illustrates the unintended consequences of global health policies on the management of NMFIs at the community level. It concludes by proposing important additions to NMFI clinical algorithms that could improve the sensitivity of such tools in areas of limited diagnostic capacities.
