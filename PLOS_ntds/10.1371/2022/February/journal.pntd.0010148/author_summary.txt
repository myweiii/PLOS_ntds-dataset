Snakebite is an important but highly neglected medical problem, causing high morbidity and mortality in low-and-middle income countries all over the world, including Ethiopia. When bitten by a venomous snake, appropriate treatment with the correct antivenom is crucial. However, in Ethiopia the correct antivenom is not always available due to low access to health facilities in rural areas. Even if antivenom is available, patients can often not afford it due to the high costs of clinical effective antivenoms. This study explores the effectiveness of three different antivenoms, Fav-Afrique, VacSera and EchiTAb-PLUS-ICP, and provides insights in factors that might influence the outcome of the snakebite treatment. This study shows that patients treated with VacSera antivenom have a higher chance of an adverse outcome of the treatment. Much more research on snakebite epidemiology and the effectiveness of antivenoms should be conducted, aiming to alert governments and antivenom manufacturers that this is a serious problem which cannot be ignored any longer.
