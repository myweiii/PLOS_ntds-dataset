The island of Crete, is one of Greece’s major tourist destinations, receiving over 5 million tourists annually, making control of vector borne diseases (VBD) like West Nile virus (WNV) both a public health and economic priority. A comprehensive surveillance network targeting mosquitoes and associated pathogens was established in Crete for the years 2018–2020. Important disease vectors (Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles superpictus) were recorded across the island. The presence of WNV antibodies in sentinel chickens was also recorded and, notably, preceded human WNV occurrence in the same region by approximately two weeks. Mutations associated with resistance to insecticides used for vector control were also detected; most importantly the chitin synthase mutation I1043F (associated with high diflubenzuron resistance) was recorded for the first time in Greece. The findings of our study are of major concern for VBD control in Greece (and Crete specifically), highlighting (i) the necessity for establishing seasonal surveillance programs and ii) the need for establishing appropriate insecticide resistance management programs for sustainable vector control.
