In the effort to control the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, countries instituted lock downs and closed international borders. But is this the best approach to controlling transboundary infectious diseases? In this publication we demonstrate how we managed to control Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) introduced into Uganda from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2019. Once the EVD outbreak was announced in DRC, we intensified cross-border surveillance and instituted acceptable public health control measures following international health regulations to limit onward community and nosocomial transmission in Uganda. Consequently, on July 10th, 2019, three (3) cases crossed into Uganda and were detected at the point of first contact with health facility in Uganda in Kasese district and the fourth case was detected in August 2019 at a point of entry at the Uganda-DRC border by temperature screening. Sequencing of these cases showed that they were independent introductions related to two different clades of the ongoing outbreak in DRC. All the patients died without onward secondary transmissions in Uganda. We invite you to read this publication and learn how this was achieved as it can be used as a model for cross border surveillance to control similar infectious disease outbreaks.
