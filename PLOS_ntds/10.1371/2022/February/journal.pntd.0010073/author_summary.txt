Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections represent a global public health concern. EV-D68 are detected in apparently healthy subjects and patients with acute respiratory illnesses, acute flaccid myelitis, and asthma-related illnesses. Enterovirus D68 was first described in 1962 and exhibited sporadic circulation until August 2014 when outbreaks of EV-D68 infections were reported in the USA and Canada mainly in children with acute flaccid myelitis and severe acute respiratory disease. We systematically reviewed the literature on EV-D68 infections globally in the present study to determine the case fatality rate and prevalence of current and past infections. Our results show sporadic deaths in patients with severe acute respiratory EV-D68 infections. Our data also show a low prevalence of EV-D68 in current infections unlike the presence of EV-D68 antibodies (past infections) in almost all individuals of all ages. EV-D68 infections were more prevalent in hospital outbreaks, industrialized countries, children < 5 years, and patients with acute flaccid myelitis and asthma-related diseases. These data highlight the need to strengthen the surveillance of EV-D68 infections.
