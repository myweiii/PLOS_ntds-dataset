Aedes albopictus, also called the tiger mosquito, is one the most invasive mosquito species worldwide. It is originated from South-East Asia and islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans and is known to be able to transmit to humans many viral diseases. During the last four decades it succeeded to invade many countries in all continents through an increasing international trade and travel. This mosquito was first observed in Lebanon, in the Middle East region, in 2002. Previous studies revealed that the introduced mosquito was able to transmit Chikungunya and Dengue viruses under experimental conditions. Therefore, it represents a health threat for the Lebanese population. In this study, the authors assessed the status of the tiger mosquito in the country two decades after its first record. They showed that it is widespread in the humid and sub-humid regions of Mount Lebanon chain and is active from spring through late autumn. The authors experimentally demonstrated the ability of this mosquito to transmit Zika virus, a virus that is highly likely to get introduced to Lebanon due to important population flow from South America to the country during the summer season. Finally, the authors found that local populations of tiger mosquito were susceptible to insecticides of the pyrethroids and carbamates groups but resistant to those of the organochlorines and organophosphates groups. The generated information should help national health authorities to establish a targeted surveillance and control strategies for this mosquito.
