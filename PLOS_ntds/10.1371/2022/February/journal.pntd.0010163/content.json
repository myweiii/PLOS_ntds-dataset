    "Introduction": "Fast and efficient disease control approaches are critical for controlling cholera epidemics. Case area-targeted interventions (CATI) aim to interrupt transmission within small cholera outbreaks by rapidly addressing different routes of infection with multiple interventions (i.e., antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, household water treatment, and oral vaccination) in geographical \u2018rings\u2019 of 100\u2013250 metres around the household of the index case. [1,2] Such containment strategies for small outbreaks target people at the highest risk of infection and may be less resource-intensive and more effective than mass, community-wide campaigns over large geographical areas. [1]\nWe designed an observational study to measure the effects of CATI during a future cholera epidemic response, to be conducted by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The evaluation of CATI presents several challenges for the choice of a feasible study design and subsequently, for the estimation of statistical power. Randomizing individuals or communities to different interventions or a placebo is often not feasible and ethically problematic during a demanding epidemic response in a low-resource setting. For the evaluation of ring vaccination with a new vaccine during the 2016 Ebola epidemic in Guinea, an adapted cluster randomized-controlled trial (RCT) design was developed wherein each ring of contacts of confirmed cases was randomized to a different delay to implementation, thereby producing intervention and control groups. [3] During a cholera outbreak, where a package of routine rather than novel interventions is applied, the objective is to assess the allocation strategy. For this question, an RCT design may not always be appropriate or feasible.\nHere, a prospective observational study design is considered, where participants or groups are not randomized and the outcome is measured prospectively. [4] In our example, the measurement of effectiveness (i.e., incidence) is related to the strength of implementation of the intervention across small outbreaks rather than an assigned presence or absence of the exposure (i.e., CATI). The strength of implementation is represented by the natural delay between case notification and the implementation of CATI, which may differ across several small outbreaks. This results in CATI rings categorized by the delay between case notification and implementation. Two interrelated challenges emerge, which do not fit well with a classical statistical approach for study design. First, the analysis does not conform to the conventional formulae for sample size and power estimation given the presence of several \u2018natural\u2019 control groups. Second, the non-independence of infection risk between persons drives the incidence and is difficult to estimate a priori. [5] The interventions produce direct and indirect effects on infection and transmission, with infection prevention, infection, and/or treatment of one person affecting the outcome of another person. [6] Moreover, the cumulative effects of a package of interventions are difficult to predict.\nIn this report, we describe a strategy to estimate power for a prospective observational study across a range of sample sizes. This approach combines stochastic simulation modelling of small outbreaks and the direct and indirect effects of the intervention, with a simulation study of the study analysis based on model results. While simulation studies are often conducted to estimate power for RCTs, there is little documentation of (a) simulation used for other study designs and (b) mathematical modelling to simulate transmission dynamics for power estimation. [7\u20139] We provide details of the approach, and R code, as a foundation for further application to outbreak intervention studies of other pathogens.",
    "Methods": "We describe the study design for which we are calculating power. We then describe the simulation study using the Aim, Data Generating Mechanism, Estimand, Methods, Performance Measures (ADEMP) framework for the coherent reporting of simulation studies. [7]\n\nSummary of the prospective observational study design\nThe impact of CATI (which includes single-dose oral cholera vaccination (OCV), point-of-use water treatment, and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis) will be measured by the reduction in the incidence of cholera around the index cases of small outbreaks through direct and indirect protection, as a function of the time to implementation of CATI (Fig 1). The intervention is triggered when a suspected case is detected and tests positive by an enriched rapid diagnostic test (RDT). [10] Then, a 100\u2013250 metre radius around the index case\u2019s household is outlined (hereafter, the \u2018ring\u2019), wherein CATI is rapidly implemented. While the first outbreak clusters may be responded to very rapidly, as the size of the epidemic increases logistical barriers for field teams are anticipated to result in delays to implementation in new rings of up to 7 days, thus creating natural control groups. The ring is the unit of analysis. A regression analysis will model the observed incidence of enriched RDT-positive cholera in rings relative to the time to response (in days) and coverage. The regression function quantifying the association between timeliness/coverage and incidence provides a measure of effectiveness at different levels of performance.\nDelays to implementation of CATI give rise to natural controls. A regression analysis is used to model the observed incidence of enriched rapid diagnostic test-positive cholera in rings (outcome) as a function of the delay to response. CATI = case-area targeted intervention.\n\n\nSummary and rationale for the simulation\nThe study design rests on the assumption that the regression analysis will have sufficient power to detect an association between CATI performance and the incidence of cholera, i.e. that data from a sufficient number of rings of given size and characteristics (e.g. transmissibility of cholera within the rings) will be available. The aim of the simulation study is to explore these sample size requirements. We chose as a data-generating mechanism a stochastic transmission model to predict the incidence and the direct and indirect effects of CATI, applied with varied delays, on transmission across a large set of rings during a 30-day period. This mechanistic model of transmission and the predicted effect of the intervention is driven by transmission dynamics and is therefore more realistic than the assignment of an effect size, as typically used in statistical simulations. [5] The basic reproduction number for cholera, R0, is varied in the modelling scenarios. The estimand is the incidence of suspected cholera in each ring in the first 30 days after presentation of the index case. The method used for simulation involves a regression applied to each set of simulated data to estimate the association of CATI performance and cholera incidence, while tracking p-values for the association. For each combination of simulation parameters, the mechanistic model and regression on the resulting simulated data are replicated by an assigned number of simulations (nsim) by randomly sampling without replacement over the anticipated number of rings in the study (nrings). The proportion of runs in which the regression yields a significant association provides a measure of power given that a sample of nrings are available. A range of nsim (1000\u20133000) is used to assess the stability of power estimates. The performance measure is the predicted power.\nAll analyses were carried out in R version 4.0.5, using the following packages: bpmodels [11] for branching process modelling, lme4 for generalized linear mixed modelling, and the map_dfr() function of the purrr package to repetitively apply functions for the simulation coding.[12] In the following sections, we describe each step in detail, which together with the code provided, can be used to replicate the simulation (https://github.com/ruwanepi/CATI-power-sim-shared.git).\n\n\nStochastic transmission model\nUsing the bpmodels package, we applied a branching process model which generated infected persons and accounted for the depletion of susceptible persons to produce the incidence for each of 100,000 rings in the first 30 days after notification of the index case. The population size of the ring (normal distribution with mean 500, SD 50) was within the range of the number of people living in a 100\u2013250 metre radius in major African cities including N\u2019Djamena, Conakry, and Lumumbashi (mean 295, range 55\u2013456 persons). [2] People were assumed to mix homogeneously. Given the efficiency of person-to-person and environmentally-mediated cholera transmission within households, there is potential for exponential growth, mediated by the depletion of susceptibles, before effective control measures are implemented. [13] We assumed that the first notified index case was the true primary case for the outbreak and that all infectious cases were symptomatic and detectable, with some delay. Infection-to-reporting delays before and after CATI implementation were set as Poisson-distributed. The main outcomes of the model were, by ring, (a) cumulative incidence at day 30, and (b) a random effect accounting for the varying delay from infection to reporting of the primary case in the model (categorized as 0, 1, \u22651 days), as a proxy of the surveillance capacity by geographic area.\nTo model transmission, the parameters listed in Table 1 were used, and were either sampled from the underlying distributions or fixed. All persons were assumed to be susceptible without immunity derived from previous vaccination or exposure to V. cholerae. An outbreak started with a single seed case and each case generated a number of secondary cases drawn from a negative binomial distribution Z ~ NegB (R0, k). The mean is equal to the basic reproduction number at the early phase of the outbreak among an unvaccinated population (R0 = 1.5, R0 = 2.0). [14,15] Heterogeneity in the number of new infections produced by each individual is represented by a dispersion coefficient (D = 1.0, D = 1.5), which relates to the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution, k . [16,17] Each potential new infection was assigned a time of infection drawn from the serial interval distribution, S ~ gamma (shape = 0.5, rate = 0.1). [14] The number of susceptible persons in the population was progressively reduced due to infection or immunity, reducing the mean of the negative binomial offspring distribution by a factor n/N, where n is the number of remaining susceptible and N is the total population, while keeping the dispersion coefficient constant, and truncating the distribution at n. We assumed that no other interventions were implemented before CATI. Four scenarios using high and low R0 and D were modeled (Table 1).\nCATI interventions were then simulated, with a delay from notification of the index case as determined by a Poisson distribution, and the upper limit approximately based on the 75th percentile of the median delay from symptom onset to case presentation derived from a meta-analysis of cholera outbreaks (0 to 5 days), assuming that the surveillance set-up for CATI will prevent longer delays. [18] We assumed that implementation took one day and the population-based coverage was 80%. [19,20] CATI included distribution of (1) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) materials including chlorine tablets and a narrow-neck container so that the efficacy in reducing bacterial concentration via household water treatment (26%) and safe storage (21%) remained consistent for the 30-day period (cumulative efficacy, 41.5%). [21,22]; single-dose, oral antibiotic chemoprophylaxis against infection so that the efficacy in preventing infection (66%) was maintained for the first 2 days, whereafter it loses effect due to its biological half-life [2,23]; and single-dose, oral cholera vaccination (OCV) prevented infection with an efficacy of 87% over a 2-month period, taking effect 7\u201311 days after administration when peak vibriocidal response is reached.[24] The effectiveness (efficacy*coverage) was calculated in three phases over the 30 days reflecting the plausible timespan over which the relative effects of each intervention would manifest: (1) days 1 to 2: WASH and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, (2) days 3 to 6: WASH only, (3) days 7 to 30: WASH and vaccination. The combined effect of concurrent interventions was computed as (1 - ((1-effect.A)*(1-effect.B)*\u2026*(1-effect.Z))).\nWe conducted two sensitivity analyses to explore the main assumptions of rapid 1-day duration of implementation and population coverage of 80%. We evaluated a longer duration of implementation of 2 days and lower population-based coverage estimates of 50%, 60%, and 75%, based on findings from field studies. [19,20].\n\n\nSimulation method\nA generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to estimate the response variable (cumulative incidence rate) as a function of time to implementation. A negative binomial distribution accounted for overdispersion. Fixed effects quantified the main explanatory variable: the overall effect of time from case presentation to CATI implementation. The logarithm of the ring population was used as an offset to produce an incidence rate ratio (IRR). A random effect accounted for the delay from infection to presentation of the index case, which was categorized into 3 classes (0, 1, \u22651 days). For simplicity, other potential confounders that would require explicit measurement of geographical locations of rings were not considered (e.g., distance between the ring and the base of the field team). Model fit was assessed using the ratio of sum of squares of Pearson residuals to the residual degrees of freedom (to estimate overdispersion), inspection of the width of confidence intervals, and plotting of response by random effect levels (to estimate the benefit of including the random effect, as compared to using a generalized linear model (GLM)).\nAs the health of individuals in the same ring may be correlated, regression modeling approaches that account for the clustered nature of the data should be used for the study analysis. This includes GLMM, generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized additive models (GAM). GLMM uses random effects to account for contextual factors from the rings that alter the relationship between the exposure and the population effect, while GEEs infer the population-averaged effect across all rings. [25] As we expect there will be variance between rings and we may want to explore it further, GLMMs are preferred over GEEs for this study. GAMs add together the non-parametric and parametric fits of separate regressors into a transformed regression. [26] In this study, GAMs may be used if the observed relationship between delay to response and incidence offers a better fit than a purely parametric GLMM model. Regardless of model choice, the effect estimates should remain similar and unbiased.\nThe expected power was estimated for a range of sample sizes (nrings = 50\u2013150 rings), based on recent CATI experiences during large epidemics in Nepal and Haiti, with a target of 80% power. [27,28] We simulated 100,000 CATI rings using the above-described method. We then conducted a simulation study by randomly sampling a set number of rings (nrings), a set number of times (nsim). A negative binomial GLMM was run on each set of nrings. Power was assessed as the number of simulations with a significative effect of delay to CATI implementation (p<0.05), considered to be true positives, divided by the number of nsim. nrings was varied to assess the effect of the number of rings in each study on power. Table 2 lists the simulation parameters including the range of nsim values used to demonstrate consistency in results. For each set of nrings rings randomly sampled without replacement from the 100,000 rings simulated by the stochastic model, 500\u20133,000 simulations were run to evaluate the reliability of the results.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing R0 = 2.0, D = 1.5 and nsim = 100,000, the mean caseload increased with each single day from 12 cases (with delays of 0 days) to 59 cases (with delays of 7 days). A higher proportion of outbreaks were extinct by day 30 for the \u22643-day category versus the >3-day category. An IRR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.25\u20131.29) was produced, demonstrating a 27% increase in the incidence rate per single day increase in the delay of implementation of CATI (visualized in Fig 2). The model fit is described in S1 Text.\nThe compiled power estimates are presented in Table 3 and the main power estimations where R0, D, and nrings were varied are displayed in Fig 3 (additional graphs are found in Figs A\u2014D in S1 Text). Using the main model (R0 = 2.0 and D = 1.5), the simulation returned 80.6% (95% CI 71.2\u201387.6) power with nrings = 100; 73.7% power with nrings = 80; and, 88.7% power with nrings = 125 (Fig 3). Using R0 = 2.0 and D = 1.0, the simulation reached 81.2% (95% CI 71.9\u201388.1) power with nrings = 80. With R0 = 1.5 and D = 1.5, the power was reduced substantially wherein nrings = 150 produced 62.8% power. The model for R0 = 1.5 and D = 1.0 did not converge for any number of rings tested and is omitted from Fig 3. The results were generally consistent when nsim was varied.\n(A) R0 = 2.0, D = 1.0 (RED), (B) R0 = 2.0, D = 1.5 (BLUE), (C) R0 = 1.5, D = 1.5 (YELLOW). Power thresholds are indicated by the red dashed line (80%) and the grey dashed line (90%). R0, basic reproduction number, D, dispersion coefficient.\nShading indicates the variable that was changed (grey), and where power estimates were farthest from the 80% target (\u226469%, in orange), close to the target (\u226570 to 79%, in light green), and at or above the target (\u226580%, in dark green).\n\n\nSensitivity analyses\nApplying a slower duration of implementation of 2 days meant that 80% power is reached with >125 rings. Using lower population coverage of 50% and 60% increased the sample size required to >100 rings to reach 80% power. Lowering slightly the population coverage to 75% resulted in 79.1% power reached with 100 rings, which is close to the target of 80% power.",
    "Discussion": "Our simulation strategy provided a relatively simple means of estimating power and associated sample sizes for an observational study of CATI. Based on an R0 of 2.0, the sample size required to reach 80% power was 80\u2013100 rings, which was generally maintained when population coverage decreased from 80% to 75%. This would have been feasible during recent experiences in implementing CATI during large epidemics in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal (169 rings in 7 months), and Centre Department, Haiti (238 rings in 24 months). [27,28] Alternately, where CATI was used to suppress the tails of large outbreaks though only at the end of mass vaccination campaigns in Juba, South Sudan and Kribi, Cameroon, the sample size would far exceed the number of rings that are typically implemented. [19,20] As cholera epidemics frequently remain small due to the burn-out of the susceptible pool [18], overdispersion of R0 leading to extinction [16,17], or the impact of the interventions themselves, a pooled analysis of multiple epidemics within a country implementing the same CATI package could be a more secure prospect to attain the required sample size.\nA strength of this simulation strategy is the inclusion of a realistic depiction of CATI implementation which models the relative effects of its composite interventions over time. This accounted for the time-limited effects of antibiotics (~ 2 days) and the 7\u201311 day delay to a measurable immune response after administration of vaccination. [2,24] Another strength was that the stochastic model accounted for the depletion of susceptible persons to provide a plausible representation of early epidemic growth in a small population. This approach can be adjusted using the real-time estimates of the effective reproduction number (RE) to update sample size estimation. It is also computationally-light, as the process takes less than 2 hours to run without the use of parallel computing.\nThere are key limitations to our methodology and its simplifying assumptions. The mean population size of 500 persons reflects urban settings. However, cholera epidemics can occur across urban and rural areas simultaneously and would include smaller rings with lower intra-cluster variation in incidence. As such, a larger sample size may be required to reach 80% power. For the stochastic model, several parameters relating to the early growth of a cholera epidemic are uncertain. The main model used a relatively high R0 (2.0) sourced from early epidemic growth in unvaccinated populations in South Sudan and Yemen; considerably lower power was achieved with R0 = 1.5. [14,15] In addition, we assumed the entire population was susceptible at the start of the outbreak, which may not be the case in cholera-endemic or previously-vaccinated areas, lowering the RE and the measurable effect of CATI. The stochastic model is not spatially-explicit, so transmission between communities is not accounted for, nor is the force of infection external to a given ring which could represent long-distance transmission from outside the community or contamination of the local water supply. [2] A duration of implementation of a single day has been shown in Cameroon and South Sudan [19,20], but this may not be sufficient to cover the entire ring. This potentially leads to an overestimation of the effect, with the sensitivity analysis finding higher sample size requirements. Outbreak simulations are right censored at 30 days, and thus we cannot determine from the 30 day analysis alone whether outbreaks are fully extinct. How the delay to case detection was parameterized as a random effect may not truly represent the surveillance capacity, indicating that it must be accounted for empirically in the actual analysis of the study. Similarly, key co-variates that are thought to be influential on ring incidence (i.e., coverage, average rainfall, distance from roads) could not be simulated realistically without a more complex, spatially-explicit transmission model.\nDespite its limitations, the strategy demonstrates a relatively simple and efficient approach to integrating dynamic modeling of a cholera outbreak with study simulation to guide the design of a prospective observational study that we intend to implement. The approach can be used to provide power estimates for evaluations of similar highly targeted interventions for epidemic-prone diseases delivered rapidly to high-risk communities during an outbreak."
