From Ebola virus disease outbreaks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of real-time evaluations of interventions to contain outbreaks is vital for rapidly estimating impact during the outbreak itself. Such evaluations must be both epidemiologically rigorous and logistically feasible to justify their conduct during an outbreak. In this short report, we report on the process (with R code) and the results of a simulation strategy that we devised for power estimation for a prospective observational study of a novel intervention (“case-area targeted intervention”) to contain cholera case clusters that present at the start of a new outbreak. We used simulation in two ways: mathematical modelling to simulate the impacts of a cholera outbreak and the intervention, and simulation of the study analysis on the model results. The strategy provided estimates of the sample sizes of study units required to achieve 80% and 90% power. Our findings reinforce that this process is feasible to implement for similar observational study designs which aim to evaluate outbreak containment for other pathogens in geographically or socially defined rings.
