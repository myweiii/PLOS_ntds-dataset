The molecular mechanisms underlying the urinary and genital pathology from urogenital schistosomiasis have not been well-defined. This has mainly been due to limited mechanistic studies and the lack of a suitable animal model for S. haematobium infection. We leveraged a mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis, along with proteomics analysis, to determine the early molecular events that occur in the bladder after exposure to S. haematobium eggs, and to define protein pathways that may be involved in morbidity from urogenital schistosomiasis infection. Our results show that S. haematobium egg deposition in the bladder results in significant changes in proteins and pathways that play a role in pathology. Biological processes including carcinogenesis, immune and inflammatory responses, increased protein translation or turnover, oxidative stress responses, reduced cell adhesion and epithelial barrier integrity, and increased glucose metabolism are significantly enriched in S. haematobium infection. Our findings highlight important protein indicators of host-parasite interactions in the bladder and their association with tissue changes in urogenital schistosomiasis. The findings presented here will be relevant for development of improved interventions for disease control, and contribute to realizing the 2021â€“2030 NTD goals by demonstrating evidence on the early events that occur during schistosome infection.
