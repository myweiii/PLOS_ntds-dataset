Cryptococcus gattii is one of the life-threatening fungal pathogens that can infect immunocompetent individuals. C.gattii can be invaded through the respiratory tract and can be spread to the brain, causing meningoencephalitis and even death. In 1999, an outbreak of C. gattii VGII occurred on Vancouver Island in Canada and spread in the Pacific Northwest region, which attracted more attention. Compared with other nations, the data of C.gattii VGII in China was limited. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and microbiological characteristics of C.gattii VGII isolates from China, bioinformatics analysis and in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed for clinical strains. Multi-locus Sequence Typing and whole-genome sequencing reveal the genetic diversity of the isolates and genetic relationships with isolates from other countries. The antifungal drug susceptibility and virulence differences of the isolates were also investigated. The authors expect that our work can provide useful data for the prevention and control of C. gattii VGII in China and to draw more attention to C. gattii.
