Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-transmitted parasitic nematode that can live in human hosts for up to 6â€“8 years, disrupting the normal functions of the lymphatic system leading to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability, and social stigma. Lymphatic filariasis can be eliminated by stopping the spread of infection through preventive chemotherapy with safe medicine combinations repeated annually. Several small-scale trials demonstrated that a single dose of a triple-drug regimen (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole or IDA) was more effective at clearing infection than the standard two-drug regimen (diethylcarbamazine and albendazole or DA). This study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of IDA in a large community-randomised trial in a moderate transmission setting. IDA was shown to be as safe as the standard two-drug DA treatment and more effective for clearing microfilariae compared to DA. These results show that IDA is well tolerated in PNG and has the potential to accelerate LF elimination.
