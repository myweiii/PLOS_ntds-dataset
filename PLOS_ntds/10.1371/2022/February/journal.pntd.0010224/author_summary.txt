Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania is a neglected tropical disease. Leishmania donovani is the principal causative agent of VL in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent whereas in Europe, North Africa, and Latin America VL is mainly caused by Leishmania infantum. No licensed vaccine exists against VL. We have reported previously that live attenuated centrin gene-deleted L. donovani (LdCen-/-) parasite vaccine induced strong innate immunity which leads to a protective Th1 response in animal models. We recently demonstrated that neutrophils play an indispensable role following immunization with LdCen-/- parasites in inducing protective Th1 immune response. However, neutrophils also secrete chemokines that attract other innate cells such as dendritic cells and regulate their activities. In the current study we analyzed the interplay between neutrophils and DCs, and its effects on T cell activation during LdCen-/- infection and compared with wild type parasite (LdWT) infection. We observed that higher recruitment of DCs occurred in LdCen-/- infected mice ear draining lymph nodes compared to LdWT. This recruitment is facilitated by increased secretion of the chemokine CCL3 by neutrophils. A markedly decreased DC recruitment was observed in LdCen-/- infected mice following CCL3 neutralization indicating the key role of neutrophils in DC recruitment. Further, we demonstrated that DCs that ingest LdCen-/- infected neutrophils are better activated than those that acquire the parasites independent of neutrophils. Notably neutrophil depletion in LdCen-/- infected mice also attenuated activation of DCs in the ear dLN that resulted in poor CD4+T cell priming. Our results reveal that interaction between neutrophils and DCs play an important role in shaping proinflammatory immune response induced by a live attenuated Leishmania vaccine.
