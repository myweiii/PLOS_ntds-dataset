The establishment of a leptospirosis experimental model is still key to elucidating the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Hamsters were infected by intraperitoneal injection to establish experimental leptospirosis, although this is not a natural route of infection. The transmission characteristics of Leptospira and the disease progression in hamsters infected by a natural transmission route (e.g. through mucosal surfaces) had not been explored. In this study, we compared the dynamics of Leptospira infection in hamsters inoculated via the nasal mucosa or by intraperitoneal inoculation, and compared the burden of Leptospira and the level of antibodies produced with disease progression, such as body weight, serology, haematological changes and histopathological changes. Our data suggested that there are significant differences in the dynamics of infection between intraperitoneal and mucosal infection pathways. Although the result was the same in the later stage of infection, the course of mucosal infection was slower, which may better recapitulate the natural history of the disease, assist in studying kidney disease caused by Leptospira, and provide an animal model for the study of leptospirosis mucosal immunity.
