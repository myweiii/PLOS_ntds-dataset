The Bolivian Chagas Platform was born in 2009 to promote comprehensive care for Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical disease that affects more than a million people in Bolivia. A two-phase strategy was designed to introduce protocol-based healthcare in Bolivia through prevention, case-management, healthcare professionals training, and community activities. From an initial seven centers in the vertical phase (Chagas Platform centers), 52 healthcare primary healthcare centers adopted CD protocolized care in a second phase (Chagas Healthcare Network) through decentralized, horizontal scaling-up. 181,397 people at risk of having T. cruzi infection were tested (15%), 57,871 (31.9%) tested positive, and 18,582 (32.1%) were treated. Sixty-seven percent of healthcare workers were trained. Adequate domestic financial and human resources were ensured at the end of the scaling-up. Translational research and training activities improved evidence-based decision-making in clinical management. The Bolivian Chagas Platform as innovation, included attributes that enabled scaling-up at national and international level.
