This study investigated the seroprevalence and seroreactivity of Q fever and determined the risk factors associated with seroprevalence of Q fever among the nationally representative sample of workers in the veterinary service laboratory (VSL) in South Korea. We found the seroprevalence and seroreactivity of C. burnetii infection among VSL staff were 7.9% and 16.0%, respectively. In addition, the work-specific tasks such as antemortem inspection of cattle, goats, or sheep, contact with animals having Q fever, and having animal blood splashed into or around eyes were found to be significantly associated with the seroprevalence of Q fever. Our findings suggest precautions be taken when contacting cattle, goats, or sheep, especially during the antemortem inspection, and dealing with C. burnetii infected animals, and when there is a risk of ocular contact with animal derivatives, such as the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, and compliance with other measures that prevent C. burnetii infections among VSL staff in South Korea.
