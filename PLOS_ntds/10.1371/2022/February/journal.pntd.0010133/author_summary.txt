In 2017–2018, cities in southeastern Brazil experienced an unusual outbreak of yellow fever virus. In the early 20th century, these cities had large outbreaks of yellow fever, spread by Aedes mosquitoes. But until this recent outbreak, they had been free of yellow fever for nearly a century. While this outbreak was spread by Haemagogus forest mosquitoes, the reemergence of yellow fever in densely populated urban areas raises serious concerns about it reestablishing ongoing transmission in cities, spread by urban Aedes mosquitoes. Our study sought to understand how and why yellow fever virus remerged in this area. We traced the outbreak, finding that it started in hot, dry, rural areas and spread south into cool, wet urban areas. The epidemic coincided with a severe drought, particularly in Minas Gerais where the epidemic started. Individuals with outdoor or rural risk factors were at highest risk, especially when the epidemic started. Therefore, this severe drought may have promoted the spread of yellow fever at rural-urban boundaries. To further explore this idea, we developed a unique framework based on forest mosquito and Howler monkey biology. Our framework, “Mono-DrY,” shows how severe drought could have increased mosquito and monkey densities, promoting the spread of yellow fever.
