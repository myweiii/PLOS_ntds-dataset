Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The evaluation of diversity within B. pseudomallei has largely been conducted utilizing clinical isolates despite almost all infections emerging from environmental exposure. In this study, we surveyed the genomic diversity of 169 isolates collected from a single soil sample in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand. Seven different sequence types were identified, and substantial within-sequence-type gene diversity was observed. To test for differential virulence, 30 isolates were challenged in a mouse melioidosis model. A small number of isolates killed all mice, but most killed none, demonstrating the variable virulence potential of different B. pseudomallei isolates present in the single sample. A comparative genomics analysis identified multiple genes associated with virulence, including Hcp1, a component of the type VI secretion system and a known virulence factor. The results of this study have implications for the comprehensive environmental surveillance, environmental exposure, and differential virulence of B. pseudomallei.
