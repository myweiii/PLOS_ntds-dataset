Dengue infection is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral illness worldwide and becomes a vivid threat to non-tropical countries. Previous research has documented that viral infection can increase risks of adverse cardiovascular events. There were sporadic reports about the association of cardiovascular events and dengue infection in the endemic tropical countries. Our study analyzed the risks for major adverse cardiovascular events, and found that acute myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure were significantly higher in the immediate time period (within one week) after dengue infection, especially in patients with â‰¥60 years of age, female gender and severe admission dengue cases.
