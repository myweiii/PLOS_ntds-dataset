Infections with S. stercoralis and T. cruzi belong to the group of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are influenced by climate and the presence of their vectors and host reservoirs in areas with structural poverty. S. stercoralis and T. cruzi have high prevalence in northern Argentina. Due to the high prevalence and chronicity of infections by these parasites, coinfection with both is possible. We conducted a cross sectional study in six villages in the north of Argentina. These villages have different prevalence for the two parasites and are located in different ecoregions (Chaco, Yungas and the border between these two). We found that coinfection between S. stercoralis and T. cruzi occurs only by chance; and the most affected groups for S. stercoralis and T. cruzi infection are adults. We also found that adults or individual with infection with S. stercoralis were more likely to have anemia. In addition, each village represents a different setting for infection with S. stercoralis and T. cruzi, and individuals in different villages presented differences in the probability of infection.
