Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a bacterial disease characterized by eponymous recurrent fever episodes. The disease is common on all continents except Australia and Antarctica and is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria. The Borrelia bacteria causing relapsing fever circulate naturally between ticks and various animal hosts (usually small rodents). Humans become infected when they are accidentally bitten by an infected tick.
Although the disease has been known since 1904, many aspects of the disease have never been investigated in larger studies and are therefore still not conclusively understood. To shed light on some of these aspects, we reviewed the published literature on TBRF and analysed all reported data on the geographic distribution of the different TBRF-causing Borrelia spp. as well as on the clinical presentations of the disease, its complications, its diagnosis and treatment and its outcome, and compiled them in this review.
