Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (JEV) remains a leading cause of brain infection across Asia, resulting in considerable death and disability. No effective treatment exists. Mouse models are fundamental to evaluate novel treatments. We aimed to perform the first systematic literature review and data synthesis of JEV infection in mouse models. We identified an abundance of experimental data in the field, with 127 studies meeting the inclusion criteria involving a total of 5026 individual mice. Overall, 64.7% of mice died after JEV infection. However, there was incomplete reporting in publications and considerable variability in the results. In summary, the findings support the ongoing use of mouse models of JEV infection and inform researchers in the field in refining their experiments. Key factors affecting variation in mortality across studies that need to be carefully considered in study design are mouse age, mouse strain, virus strain, virus dose and route of inoculation. We highlight the need for researchers to adhere to reporting guidelines in preparing manuscripts for publication.
