Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, the fox tapeworm. Humans exposed to E. multilocularis may develop severe AE with progressive tissue and organ infiltrating growth of the larval stage. The E. multilocularis larvae appear to have developed effective immune evasion mechanisms which facilitate an asymptomatic incubation and an extended host and parasite coexistence for decades. Over a 10-year follow-up, this investigation aimed to gain a better understanding of the immunological process associated with an active and progressive, a stable or a regressive course of AE. In summary, the rapid decrease of antibodies against the E. multilocularis specific antigen Em2+, especially in cured patients, makes them a significant predictor for cured AE. The positive relation of E. multilocularis specific IgG4 responses and chemokine levels of TARC can indicate AE progression when both enhance over time. Enhanced levels of cytokines IL-8, IL-10, and chemokines MCP4 and LARC may predict AE regression. Repeated biomarker surveys are advisable to evaluate progression or regression of AE during longitudinal follow up, and such analyses can support imaging techniques and improve staging of AE patients.
