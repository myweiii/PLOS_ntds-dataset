Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating parasitic disease that has been targeted for global elimination. The transmission assessment survey (TAS) is a tool used to determine if LF transmission has reached low enough levels that prevention activities can be stopped. This study aimed to identify methods to investigate positive LF cases found during TAS. The investigation was conducted in Nippes Department, Haiti, where 8 positive cases were found in TAS in 2017. Participants were recruited through two methods: purposive selection of the closest 50 households to the positive case, and random selection of 20 households in the census enumeration area of the case. Participants completed a survey and were tested for LF antigen, indicative of current infection, and parasite-specific antibody, indicative of current or past infection. A total of 1,927 people participated in the study; 1.5% of these were antigen-positive, and 4.5% were antibody-positive. Purposive sampling found a higher number of antigen-positive individuals, and random sampling found a higher percent positive. Both sampling methods were feasible to use in this setting, and both methods identified signs of ongoing transmission in a large urban area. Additional research is needed to help standardize guidance for post-TAS surveillance to best identify ongoing transmission.
