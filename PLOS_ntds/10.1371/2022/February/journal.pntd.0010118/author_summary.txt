Dengue Virus (DENV) causes generalized fever in most patients and is transmitted via Aedes aegypti mosquitos. A small proportion of DENV infected patients have neurological complications associated with the critical phase of the illness. The usual neurological manifestations are encephalitis and encephalopathy, but there can also be movement disorders such as parkinsonism. DENV patients with parkinsonism present with tremor, bradykinesia, instability, and rigidity on top of the typical febrile manifestations of the disease. We searched the literature and uncovered 7 cases of clinically diagnosed DENV parkinsonism patients and 15 cases of suspected DENV parkinsonism. We found that the clinically diagnosed patients were more likely to be male, have expressionless face, speech issues and lymphocytosis. The suspected cases often had a diagnosis of encephalitis and were more likely to have tremors, thrombocytopenia, and low hemoglobin.
