Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode that is transmitted through the bite of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium. The disease manifests either as ocular or as dermal onchocerciasis with several symptoms including itching, nodules, skin thickening, visual impairment and blindness. The disease is still of public health concern especially in the study area where it is endemic and causes debilitating symptoms. This study assessed the Health-related quality of life and associated factors among persons with onchocerciasis. The findings of this study showed that the quality of life of onchocerciasis patients was lower than the healthy population. Also, an increased level of disability among the onchocerciasis patients leads to a reduction in their quality of life which worsens with increasing age. Health professionals should be aware of these findings because it will help them implement and continue community awareness programs on onchocerciasis for early detection and treatment to reduce disability and enhance health-related quality of life.
