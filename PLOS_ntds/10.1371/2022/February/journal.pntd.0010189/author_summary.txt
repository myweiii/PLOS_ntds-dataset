Considering the serious adverse events that occur in individuals with high intensity of Loa loa parasite when being treated with ivermectin during the MDA program for the elimination of onchocerciasis, there is need for a comprehensive, safe and cost-effective strategy to delineate village or communities that are safe for MDA. In this study, we propose a hybrid strategy that uses information from the Loa antibody rapid test and the LoaScope diagnostic test to delineate whether an area is safe for MDA. We developed a joint geostatistical modelling framework that exploits both the association between antibody and LoaScope responses at community-level and the spatial correlation of the Loa loa prevalence surface to determine if the risk of observing individuals with high-intensity infections in a village or community is sufficiently low. Our results support the use of a two-stage strategy in which antibody test is used first as a screening tool and only those communities for which safety are in doubt are followed up with confirmatory LoaScope testing.
