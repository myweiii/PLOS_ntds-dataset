Paracoccidiodomycosis is a human systemic mycosis endemic in Latin America that has a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from localized to fatal disseminated forms. Both in humans and experimental models, immunoprotection is mediated by T cell immunity whereas immunosuppression is associated with the severe forms of the disease. The literature shows that nitric oxide (NO) produced by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2 or iNOS) is the major fungicidal component of phagocytic cells. The role of NO production was previously investigated in the intra-peritoneal and intravenous murine models of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection. The human paracoccidioidomycosis is believed to be acquired by the respiratory route, thus our study aimed to characterize the role of NO production in a pulmonary model of infection. We verified that, paradoxically, absence of NO production by iNOS- deficient mice resulted in less severe disease and increased survival times. This was associated with increased development of cellular immunity and enhanced synthesis of TNF-Î± which enhances cell migration to the site of infection and contributes to the better organization of lesions. Our work highlighted the deleterious effect of excessive NO production in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis, and demonstrated that uncontrolled fungal growth can be overridden by an efficient immune response.
