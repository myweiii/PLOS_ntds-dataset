Evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies supports the hypothesis that genital infection with Schistosoma haematobium increases the risk of becoming infected with HIV among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Praziquantel is an oral, nontoxic, inexpensive medication recommended for treatment of schistosomiasis, which might be able to prevent the development of genital schistosomiasis. We constructed a mathematical model of female genital schistosomiasis and HIV infections, which we calibrated using epidemiological data from Zimbabwe. We used this model to investigate the potential cost-effectiveness of mass drug administration with praziquantel as an intervention strategy for reducing HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. We showed that mass drug administration with praziquantel may be a timely, innovative, and cost-saving intervention strategy for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. As a cost-saving strategy, mass drug administration with praziquantel should be prioritized over other less cost-effective public health interventions. Our findings indicate the possible benefit of scaling up schistosomiasis control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa, and especially in areas were Schistosoma haematobium and HIV are highly prevalent.
