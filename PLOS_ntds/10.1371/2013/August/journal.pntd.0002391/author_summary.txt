Enteric fever, caused by ingestion of bacteria Salmonella Typhi or Salmonella Paratyphi A, is common in regions with poor water quality and sanitation. We sought to identify individual-level risks for infection in Kathmandu, Nepal, a region endemic for enteric fever. In this study, we enrolled patients presenting to hospital who were blood-culture positive for enteric fever and a series of community controls matched for age, gender and residential ward. Our findings suggest that while some risks for infection with S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A overlap, these organisms also have distinctive routes of infection in this setting; poor water and socioeconomic status seemed more influential in infection with S. Typhi, whereas food consumption habits and migratory status were shown to play a larger role in infection with S. Paratyphi A. Additionally, serological evaluation of IgG levels against the Vi (Salmonella Typhi) and the O:2 (Salmonella Paratyphi A) antigens demonstrated high titers against both antigens throughout life, suggesting frequent and constant exposure to these organisms in Kathmandu. As major improvements in sanitation infrastructure are unlikely in this setting, we recommend water treatment and storage-based prevention strategies, as well as street food quality regulation, and the promotion of vaccination with existing typhoid vaccines.
