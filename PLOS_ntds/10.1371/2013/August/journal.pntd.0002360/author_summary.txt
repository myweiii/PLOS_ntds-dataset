Dengue disease is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. In Southeast Asia, where it is endemic, it represents a very important public health problem. Major outbreaks, including severe cases and death, occur every year. Two distinct transmission cycles have been described. Most common is the human-mosquito-human cycle observed throughout most tropical regions of the world, often associated with urban locations and always human habitations, often producing explosive outbreaks, whereas “sylvatic” dengue, genetically different, circulates in forest wild animals and has been reported to be able to infect humans. In the Lao PDR, a developing country where dengue is endemic, data on this disease are sparse. This study reports an unusual outbreak of dengue that occurred during the cold season in a village in a forested area. It also is the first extensive analysis of dengue virus nucleotide sequences, from 39 patients across the country, from Laos. Results suggest three patterns of dengue circulation in Laos: local transmission, transmission over the whole country, and transmission implicating bordering countries. The dengue virus isolated from patients in the forest village outbreak proved to be genetically similar to those found in urbanized areas throughout the country. More investigations are needed to understand the relationships between dengue in forested and urban areas.
