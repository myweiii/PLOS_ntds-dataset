Dogs are the most important domestic reservoirs of the parasite Leishmania infantum. Some infected animals develop a subclinical infection, without the classical symptoms characteristics of this disease. One of the major challenges in the serodiagnosis of canine leishmaniasis is the detection of actively infected animals that are already able to transmit the parasite to the vector, despite the fact they did not yet show external signs of the disease. In the present work, we have developed a new tool for the laboratorial diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis that clearly improves the performance of canine leishmaniasis serodiagnosis. An immunofluorescence assay was developed combining Leishmania recombinant protein-coated magnetic microspheres and flow cytometry. The antigen-coated microspheres were used to separate anti-Leishmania specific antibodies present in the serum of infected dogs. Flow cytometry allowed the specific quantification of the antibodies. The clinical evaluation of a panel of serum samples from natural infected dogs clearly demonstrates that this method detects with high specificity and sensitivity both clinical and subclinical forms of the disease.
