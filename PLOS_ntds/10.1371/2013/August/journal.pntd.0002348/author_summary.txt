The prominence of Ae. albopictus as a major vector came to light during the global pandemic of chikungunya. The continual global expansion of Ae. albopictus coupled with data from competence studies that show its ability to transmit more than 20 arboviruses has fuelled growing concerns that this mosquito may alter the epidemiology of arbovirus worldwide and increase the risks of humans to mosquito-borne diseases. This has stimulated our interest to determine the extent of pathogens Ae. albopictus can transmit, especially arboviruses with high epidemic potential. The current study showed that local Ae. albopictus are susceptible to ZIKV. By day 7 pi. all mosquitoes that were orally infected were found to have disseminated infections and 73% have ZIKV in their saliva. This study highlighted the potential of Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV. The local transmission of ZIKV in Singapore is plausible due to the presence of susceptible vectors, an immunologically naive and vulnerable human population, and the travel hub status of Singapore. Nonetheless, the threat of ZIKV can be mitigated by existing dengue and chikungunya control program being implemented in Singapore.
