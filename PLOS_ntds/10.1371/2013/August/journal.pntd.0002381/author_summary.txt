Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium that has a predilection for the skin and nerve cells, and the disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics (multidrug therapy, MDT). Nerve damage caused by the infection may lead to permanent disabilities, and can happen even during MDT and subsequent to patient release. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the leprosy bacillus and humans is mandatory in order to develop new tools for better disease control and management. Aiming to understand more about the effects of leprosy on human metabolism, we analyzed the chemical composition of sera from leprosy patients before and after MDT. Our results show that specific classes of molecules are affected by the infection, and that MDT can partially reverse these effects. In particular, lipids related to polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and known to play a role in the host's defense mechanisms were highly affected during the disease. A complete understanding of all the steps in this process may open new avenues for leprosy treatment with consequent prevention of neuropathy.
