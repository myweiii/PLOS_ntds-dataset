The range of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is expanding globally, raising the threat of emerging and re-emerging arbovirus transmission risks, including chikungunya and dengue. Detection of Ae. albopictus in southern Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1988 and 1992 placed it 150 km from mainland Australia. In 2004â€“05 it reached the islands in Australia's Torres Strait that separate the mainland from PNG. Suspecting a range expansion from PNG driven by human adaptation to climate variability, we employed population genetics methodologies to investigate possible origins of the introduced population, as well as population structure of previously existing populations from New Guinea. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences and 13 novel microsatellite markers revealed a clear genetic distinction between regional populations in PNG and the newly introduced population in the Torres Strait and Fly Region. The closest genetic relative to the introduced population was found in the Indonesian region to the west and it is now suspected that this species may have been brought into the Torres Strait by sea vessels involved in extensive illegal fishing activities during this period.
