The spider family Sicariidae includes two genera, Sicarius and Loxosceles. These spiders' venoms share a common characteristic, i.e., the presence of Sphingomyelinases D (SMase D). This toxin is the main component responsible for the local and systemic effects observed in loxoscelism. In the present study, we have investigated the toxic potential of male and female Brazilian Sicarius ornatus spider venoms and compared these with the venoms from Loxosceles species of medical importance in Brazil. We show here that Brazilian Sicarius ornatus venom is endowed with all toxic in vitro and ex vivo biological properties ascribed to the venoms from Loxosceles species, including the abilities to hydrolyze sphingomyelin and to induce keratinocyte cell death and complement dependent haemolysis, detrimental effects that were positively associated with the presence of active SMases D and with in vivo pathologies. Therefore, the venom of Sicarius ornatus spider can potentially lead to a similar pathology as that observed for Loxosceles envenomation.
