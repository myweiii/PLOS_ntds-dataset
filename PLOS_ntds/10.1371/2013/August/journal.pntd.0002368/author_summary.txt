Cholera in pregnancy has been long associated with high rates of stillbirths and abortions, but there is very limited published literature describing this association or possible mechanisms. During the major cholera epidemic that hit Haiti in October 2010, we set-up a specialized cholera treatment unit for pregnant women inside the Médecins sans Frontières hospital in Léogâne, allowing for intensive follow-up of cholera-associated dehydration and of pregnancy, and facilitating access to high-quality obstetric and neonatal services in case of complications. To describe the pregnancy outcomes and risk factors for fetal death, we analyzed routinely collected data from patient files. Of 263 women hospitalized, 21 (8%) lost their pregnancy during hospitalization for cholera; an additional 16 (6%) delivered a live baby at the hospital, and the remaining 226 women (86%) were discharged with preserved pregnancy. The risk factor most strongly associated with fetal demise was severity of dehydration at admission. In large epidemics, multidisciplinary units can help prevent negative maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes.
