Nematode haemoglobins are fascinating molecules with unusually high affinity for oxygen. This is one example of many unique adaptations that nematodes have acquired to survive in their hosts, as nematode haemoglobin is thought to sequester oxygen to maintain an anaerobic environment, and can break down nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide produced by host defences. This study describes the characterization of nematode haemoglobins using a novel monoclonal antibody (anti-Hb) generated against Anisakis haemoglobin, which was found to be highly expressed in stage 3 larvae and associated with the excretory-secretary ducts. Anisakis haemoglobin is an IgE-binding molecule in infected mice, while Ascaris haemoglobin was recognized by IgG but not IgE in human sera. Finally, passive immunization of mice with anti-Hb provided protection against Nippostrongylus brasiliens (rodent hookworm), with mice showing reduced worm burden and enhanced Th2 responses, showing that haemoglobin may be a good vaccine target in some nematodes. The monoclonal antibody generated in this study will be useful in further studies to examine the biology of nematode haemoglobins.
