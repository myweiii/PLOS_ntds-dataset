A mouse model of melioidosis with meningitis was established in this study by injecting mice with B. pseudomallei intravenously. Bacteria successively colonized the spleen, liver, bone marrow (BM) and brain. After infection, the splenic and BM CD11b+ populations carrying intracellular B. pseudomallei selectively expanded and became predominant. After adoptive transfer, melioidosis with meningitis was induced by the infected BM CD11b+ cells, partially induced by BM CD11b− cells and was not induced by splenic CD11b− cells or extracellular bacteria. The induction of melioidosis with meningitis was correlated with an increase in splenic CD11b+ selectin (CD62L)-expressing cells.
