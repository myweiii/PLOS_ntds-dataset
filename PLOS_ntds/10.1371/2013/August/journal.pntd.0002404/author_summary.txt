M. leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, cannot be grown on laboratory culture media. This characteristic, along with its extremely long generation time of 12â€“14 days, makes the study of the pathogenicity of this organism and the experimental testing of new drugs for the treatment of leprosy extremely difficult. We developed two M. leprae-specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays and tested their utility as biological markers of M. leprae viability in tissue specimens. These assays could detect high viability of bacilli growing in immunosuppressed mice as well as the inhibitory effects of anti-leprosy drug treatment, or of the host immune system in immunocompetent mice. The RNA preparations were also successfully used for detection of host gene expression. The application of these assays to various experimental models would benefit characterization of the infection or novel drug screening. Furthermore, because these assays utilize fixed tissues, their potential application to clinical and field settings could enable monitoring of M. leprae viability in conjunction with the host immune response during treatment.
