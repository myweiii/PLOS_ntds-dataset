Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is a mosquito-borne virus which is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. The cumulative attack rate for human JE cases is seemingly low (2-cases/105/year); however, epidemics are focal and intense, being concentrated in children 1 to 15 years of age and highly clustered spatially. Despite the availability of a vaccine against JE virus (JEV), a significant number of JE cases still occur in Asia. Increases in disease cases may occur in some countries, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh, due to increasing rice cultivation, pig husbandry and lack of vaccination or vector control programs in these areas. However, given the sensitivity of JEV transmission to climate through impacts on the mosquito vectors, changes in climate may increase or decrease JEV transmission. Clearly, JE vaccination has substantially reduced JE cases, but it is not clear if climate has any confounding impact on our ability to estimate vaccine effect. We found that approximately one quarter of the reduction in JE cases since vaccination was introduced might be attributable to climatically unfavourable years for the disease, rather than the effect of vaccination. Vaccination studies involving climate-sensitive diseases may be made more accurate by taking climate effects into account.
