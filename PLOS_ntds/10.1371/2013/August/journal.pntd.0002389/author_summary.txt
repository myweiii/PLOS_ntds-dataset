Reliable district-level prevalence estimates of active trachoma are essential to targeting control interventions. While cluster randomised surveys (CRS) remain the recommended strategy for obtaining these estimates, more rapid and cost-effective methods that can be integrated with other diseases are under investigation. One proposed method is Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM), which incorporates a school-based platform into the sampling protocol. This study uses a computerised sampling approach to evaluate whether ITM and CRS are equivalent, and explore the impact of varying key parameters on the performance of these sampling methodologies. The results from these simulations reflect a known limitation of school-based sampling: that resulting prevalence estimates are unreliable when the enrollment is low and/or the risk of disease in schools differs from communities. However, quantification of the performance of ITM at the district level highlights the variation in performance in different contexts and provides important information for national control programmes. The results from this study strengthen the evidence base around trachoma sampling methodologies and demonstrate the advantages of using a simulated approach to evaluate different sampling scenarios.
