Visceral leishmaniasis is listed as a neglected tropical disease and is considered a public health problem worldwide. The disease has been documented since 1885, the first case being reported in India. After over 120 years, the incidence of the disease remains high despite control strategies implemented. In areas where the disease is zoonotic, such as in Brazil, identification as well as removal of infected dogs is recommended in highly endemic areas for they are considered to be the reservoir of the Leishmania chagasi parasite. The theoretical basis that supports the culling of infected dogs is the assumption that the incidence of human infection is directly related to the number of infectious dogs. However, there is no consensus among researchers on the effectiveness of this strategy for controlling either human or canine visceral leishmaniasis. In this context, mathematical models can provide a basis for determining the strategies with the greatest potential for success. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion by introducing further complexities into the problem, in particular, the imperfect diagnosis of this infection and the time gap between laboratory diagnosis and culling and the presence of asymptomatic infections.
