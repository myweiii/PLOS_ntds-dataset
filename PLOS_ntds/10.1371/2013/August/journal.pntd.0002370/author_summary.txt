Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a parasitic infection that kills millions of mostly poverty-stricken people in Latin America. In recent years it has also spread to nonendemic countries – the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan – as a result of immigration. The only available drugs for its treatment were introduced more than forty years ago, have low efficacy, and cause various severe side effects. This dire public health situation has prompted us to search for new small molecules to act as drug candidates to treat Chagas disease. The T. cruzi enzyme cruzain, a key biological catalyst used by the protozoan to digest host proteins, is a validated drug target for Chagas disease. By combining in silico molecular design, X-ray crystallography and biological screening, we found a new class of non-covalent small molecules that inhibit cruzain in low micromolar concentrations.
