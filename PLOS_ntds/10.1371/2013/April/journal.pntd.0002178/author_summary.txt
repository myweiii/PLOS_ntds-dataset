Viperin is a virally induced host protein that has been previously shown to have antiviral activity against a variety of viruses. Here we have demonstrated that viperin is also anti-viral against the medically significant arbovirus, dengue virus. Viperin was able to inhibit dengue virus at the level of viral replication, and cell lines unable to produce normal levels of viperin grew the virus to higher titres. These anti-dengue effects of viperin were mediated by amino acid residues in its C-terminus, and did not require structural domains of the N-terminal region as has been previously shown by us and others for the related virus, hepatitis C virus. Viperin was also demonstrated to co-localise and interact with the dengue capsid protein on the surface of lipid droplets, as well as with the NS3 protein and viral RNA. Viperin's association with NS3 was further demonstrated to be involved in its anti-dengue activities. The anti-viral activities of viperin presented in this manuscript show both similarities and contrasts with other described anti-viral mechanisms for the protein and highlight the diverse nature of this unique anti-viral host protein.
