Leishmaniases are neglected diseases caused by protozoan parasites that belong to the genus Leishmania. No vaccine exists against any form of leishmaniasis and most of the existing anti-leishmanial drugs have serious side effects. Current strategies for discovering new leishmanicidal molecules are largely using inappropriate types of host cells or employing the irrelevant insect-specific parasite stage. We presented here an innovative and biologically relevant drug screening assay based on the use of the mammalian macrophage host cells and Leishmania pathogenic amastigotes. Our visual fluorescence assay has been established with the objective to screen diverse small-molecules including chemicals and natural compounds that selectively target intra-macrophagic amastigotes without displaying toxicity for the macrophage host cells. The validation of a miniaturized assay, relying on automated handling of biological materials and fluorescent imaging probes, image acquisition, data storage and analysis is presented. Based on robust statistical methods and quality control metrics, the data analysis pipeline allows for the classification of compounds based on their effect on parasite and macrophage survival observed after three days of treatment.
