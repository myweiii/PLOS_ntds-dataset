The authors are all medical entomologists who have worked in the field for more than 30 years. Over the past 20 years we have primarily worked on Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of Dengue and Yellow Fever Viruses. Twelve years ago, we began using mitochondrial markers to study relationships among Ae. aegypti populations. Since that time, 14 publications and 4 datasets have used the same markers and collectively 95 unique mtDNA haplotypes have been found. Haplotype phylogenies have consistently identified two clades. However, it wasn't until we combined efforts with our African colleagues that we realized that the two clades largely correspond with West and East Africa. Aedes aegypti populations from throughout the world are “mixtures” of mosquitoes from these two original clades. We plan to continue this effort to determine whether the composition of Ae. aegypti populations affects their ability to transmit arboviruses and also if mitochondrial haplotypes differ between mosquitoes with or without the newly discovered chromosomal inversions.
