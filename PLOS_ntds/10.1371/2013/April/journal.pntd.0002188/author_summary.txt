There is no specific approved antiviral and vaccine for treatment or prevention of dengue, an acute mosquito-transmitted viral disease that affects more than 50 million people each year. Dengue virus (DENV) entry is a critical step that establishes the infection and enables virus replication. Curdlan sulfate (CRDS) is known to inhibit the entry and propagation of HIV-1 in the laboratory. Here we applied a computational binding site identification strategy, which suggested that CRDS could be a probable entry inhibitor of the viral surface E protein. CRDS potently blocked DENV infection at an early stage of the virus lifecycle in vitro. In addition, CRDS prevented antibody dependent enhancement, which is considered to be one of the most important clinical observations in DENV-infected patients. CRDS shows a favorable selectivity index against all serotypes of DENV. Further computational docking indicates that the compound binds to a pocket on the DENV E protein. Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, it can be a good candidate for clinical application.
