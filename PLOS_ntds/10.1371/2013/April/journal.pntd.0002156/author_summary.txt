Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important neglected tropical disease that has caused severe epidemics and epizootics throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Severe outbreaks have involved tens of thousands of both human and livestock cases for which no effective, commercially available human vaccines or antiviral drugs are available. Mosquito transmission is the primary means for human infection although it can also be transmitted by aerosol or through mucosal contact. In this study, we directly compared the pathogenesis of RVF virus (RVFV) following aerosol exposure to a peripheral exposure in the mouse model. Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness of ribavirin, a known antiviral compound, administered prior to virus exposure. The virus affected the liver despite the route of exposure. However, viral invasion of brain tissues occurred much earlier and was more severe in mice exposed by aerosol compared to peripherally exposed mice. Mice exposed peripherally and treated with ribavirin were partially protected whereas treated mice exposed by aerosol were not protected. Our results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of RVFV and for the development and evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics.
