Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe clinical form of leishmaniasis. In the Americas, VL is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, an intracellular micro-organism transmitted to humans through the bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. The domestic dog is considered the main reservoir and human beings are dead-end hosts. The disease occurs in 12 countries of the New World and Brazil accounts for 90% of the reported cases. The factors associated with infection are only partially understood, making harder understanding the disease dynamics and the development of effective and well-targeted control measures. Our work is the first systematic review with meta-analysis about factors associated with human visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. It provides an organization of the available information, the description of more accurate data on the role of each of the factors studied, the evaluation of possible causes of heterogeneity in the results of the studies as well as the analysis of the quality of publications and limitations in the existing knowledge. The results of this study might be useful in the definition of which and where target interventions should be delivered, and for guiding researchers towards the development of future studies of better methodological quality.
