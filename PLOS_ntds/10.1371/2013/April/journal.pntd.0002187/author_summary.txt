Phlebotomus orientalis is the main vector of Leishmania donovani in East Africa and is, therefore, a sand fly species of high importance. We studied various properties of P. orientalis populations from both endemic (Addis Zemen) and non-endemic (Melka Werer) areas in Ethiopia. We successfully demonstrated the ability of laboratory colonies arising from these populations to crossbreed by obtaining 1st and 2nd generation hybrid progeny. Hybrids had similar or even higher fecundity than parental colonies. Comparison of the populations by sequencing of two genes (cytB and COI) and by RAPD (a multilocus method) revealed no genetic differences. We demonstrated that both populations are highly susceptible to experimental infection with L. donovani and even small numbers of parasites are able to initiate heavy infections in P. orientalis females. As the development pattern of L. donovani was similar for females from both colonies, we deduce that the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in the non-endemic area of Melka Werer cannot be attributed to different susceptibility of local P. orientalis populations to L. donovani.
