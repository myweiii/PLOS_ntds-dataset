Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important public health problem in different regions of the world. It presents high lethality in human cases without suitable treatment and is considered one of the most important disorders in dogs, the main domestic reservoir of the etiological agent of VL (Leishmania infantum). Most cases of VL in Latin America occur in Brazil, and control campaigns have not shown satisfactory results. The diagnosis of human and canine infection is critical for making decisions regarding surveillance and control policies. In this work, we propose a non-invasive collection method of mucosal and epithelial cells for the molecular diagnosis of canine VL by conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and for the estimation of parasite load by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). We used nasal, oral, and ear swabs as practical, simple, painless and fast alternatives for collecting samples. These procedures are according to the need of more simplified methods for detecting L. infantum infection by using robust diagnostic techniques such as cPCR and qPCR. Additionally, potential applications for diagnosing human VL are highlighted.
