The association between the infection with T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease (a neglected infectious disease), and pregnancy is frequent in Latin American endemic areas and occurs also in non-endemic areas. Information on the relationship between parasite genotypes (differently distributed in the endemic areas) and their effect on pregnancy is scarce. T. cruzi parasites are heterogeneous complexes of genetic lineages presently divided into six main genotypes (TcI to TcVI). Experimental studies might bring information on the effects of T. cruzi genotypes on gestation and on their potential role in congenital transmission and infection. The present work compares the effects of acute or chronic infections with three T. cruzi strains, belonging to the genotypes TcI, TcII and TcVI, on gestation outcome and the possible vertical transmission of parasites in mice. For the three strains tested, we show that acute infection, occurring during gestation, severely jeopardizes its outcome, whereas gestation during chronic infection mainly results in intra-uterine growth retardation. Moreover, we also show that congenital infection remains a rare consequence of dam infection and that transmission of parasites by breast milk is unlikely.
