Dengue is an increasing problem in the Asian subcontinent, but little research exists on dengue burden and transmission in this region. Dengue ranges from mild fever to pronounced circulatory shock and potentially death. However, clinical disease gives an incomplete picture of how much dengue is circulating, because many infections are asymptomatic. Presence of antibodies to dengue virus provides evidence of past infection. By studying how antibody prevalence changes with age, the force of infection can be estimated, a key measure of population transmission that quantifies the risk of a first infection among dengue-naive (seronegative) individuals. We estimated the force of dengue primary infection by applying a catalytic model to data from a serological study of children in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Over 70% of children experienced at least one infection by the age of 12 years, and the median age at infection was 4.7 years. Among dengue-naive children 14% can be expected to experience a dengue infection within 12 months. The high force of infection at young ages indicates a very high level of dengue virus transmission in this urban setting that is comparable with levels seen in other regions with well-established epidemics, including Southeast Asia and Latin America.
