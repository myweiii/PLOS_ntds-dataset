IFN-g release by NK cells is essential in early control of infections with intracellular pathogens by driving protective type 1 immune response. NK cell activation requires integration of signals delivered by cytokines, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and/or pathogens. Little information is available about this topic in neonates, known to be deficient in mounting type 1 immune response. We show that Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoa agent of Chagas disease, rapidly and strongly up-regulates the production of IFN-g by IL-15-primed cord blood NK cells to a level close to that produced by adult NK cells. This neonatal NK cell response was dependent on cross-talk with monocytes and engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 by the parasite. Importantly, IL-12 synthesis by monocytes, but not by dendritic cells, was central in driving NK cell IFN-g release. This study suggests that monocytes may compensate for the known defects of neonatal DCs to produce IL-12. This innate pathway may allow a pathogen to circumvent the defect to mount type 1 immune response in early life. This observation may be relevant in vivo in T. cruzi congenital infection, since such newborns have previously been shown to mount an adult like type 1 immune response.
