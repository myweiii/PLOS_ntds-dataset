Schistosomiasis is a neglected disease affecting more than 200 million people globally, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The mainstay of control of schistosomiasis is Praziquantel, but the mass administration of this drug is unsustainable due to the high rates of re-infection after treatment. These high rates of re-infection point towards the potential emergence of schistosoma drug resistance, making the anti-schistosome vaccine an essential component for the future control of schistosomiasis, as an adjunct to chemotherapy. Multiple strategies have been used to develop an anti-schistosome vaccine with different levels of success. These studies found that the tegument is the most important source of protective antigens; a logical assumption considering this structure represents the surface where the parasite and host interact. In our laboratory, we have isolated a (glyco)protein extract (AWBE) from the whole membrane fraction of adult worms, which is enriched by enzymatic and somatic antigens. Some of these antigens are recognized by infected patients and by mice immunized with irradiated cercariae. Given this context, we tested the possible protective effect of AWBE in mice. The results showed that immunization with AWBE induced a strong humoral response (IgG) with 43% protection against a challenge infection. The AWBE-vaccinated mice showed specific recognition of epitopes in identified proteins, such as schistosome phosphatase and probably actin, pointing to a possible association of these antigens with immunoprotection. These antigens may join the gallery of candidate proteins for vaccination against the infection by schistosomes.
