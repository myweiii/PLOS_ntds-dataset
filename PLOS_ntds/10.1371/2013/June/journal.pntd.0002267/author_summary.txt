Burkholderia pseudomallei is a category B agent that causes Melioidosis, an acute and chronic disease with septicemia. The current treatment regimen is a heavy dose of antibiotics such as ceftazidime (CAZ), however, the risk of a relapse is possible. In this study we demonstrate that bactenecin, CA-MA, RTA3 and BMAP-18 are able to inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of B. pseudomallei. The strong bactericidal activity of bactenecin is attributed to its greater ability to permeabilize the membrane. Computational modeling of these peptide-membrane interactions provide support for a model in which bactenecin is able to penetrate the membrane most effectively due to its cyclical structure. The peptide, bactenecin has the potential to act as a highly effective alternative to CAZ, or as a combination therapy with CAZ in the treatment of melioidosis. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of bactenecin may help us better design more effective peptides therapeutics of choice for melioidosis.
