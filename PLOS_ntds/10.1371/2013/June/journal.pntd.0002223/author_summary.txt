Part of the SAFE strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement) to eliminate blinding trachoma involves improving access to, and use of, water and sanitation. We combined the assessment of parasitic worm and intestinal protozoa infections with surveys of trachoma in an area of Ethiopia where the SAFE strategy, together with enhanced outreach services and the health extension program, had been implemented for more than 5 years. We compared our findings with results from a survey conducted in the mid-1990s. We documented significant increases in household access and use of latrines and clean water: the F and E components of the SAFE strategy as promoted by the health extension program. We found considerably lower levels of parasitic worm infections than those reported previously. Moreover, we documented, for the first time in this zone, pathogenic intestinal protozoa infections, which indicate poor water quality and unhygienic water collection and storage practices in the communities surveyed. A plausible hypothesis for the decline in parasitic worm infections might be the combined impact of ongoing simultaneous health programs: SAFE strategy for trachoma control alongside the health extension program and regular deworming of preschool-aged children.
