Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans that is affecting mostly children in endemic areas of West Africa. Proximity to slow flowing water is a risk factor, but the exact mode of transmission of BU remains unclear. Man-made environmental changes, such as sand mining, damming of rivers and irrigation have been implicated with increases in disease incidence. Here, we report findings from a survey for BU and continued case detection thereafter in the Bankim Health District of Cameroon. In this area, the local population believed that the damming of the Mapé River has led to the emergence of BU. In 28 months we identified 88 laboratory confirmed cases of BU. Studying these cases, we found that the age adjusted cumulative incidence of BU in the elderly is similar to that in children and that the distribution pattern of BU lesions neither matches mosquito biting patterns nor the distribution of small skin injuries. Multiple modes of transmission should therefore be considered. Our data further showed that the patients appear to have closer contact to the local Mbam River than to the artificial Mapé dam reservoir.
