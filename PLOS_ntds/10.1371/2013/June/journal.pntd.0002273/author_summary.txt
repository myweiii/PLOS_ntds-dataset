Onchocerciasis studies across Sierra Leone between 1974 and 2005 showed that 12 of the 14 health districts (HDs) are endemic for onchocerciasis. Baseline lymphatic filariasis (LF) studies 2005–2008 showed that all 14 HDs of Sierra Leone are LF endemic. Three annual rounds of integrated mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole 2008–2010 were conducted in the 12 HDs that are co-endemic for onchocerciasis and LF with good geographic, epidemiological drug (or programme) and drug coverage. A midterm evaluation study of mf prevalence and density was conducted in the 12 HDs in 2011. The hypothesis proposed for this study is that areas previously exposed to ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis control may require less rounds of annual MDA to eliminate LF (i.e. reduce microfilaremia (mf) prevalence to <1%). Results of the midterm evaluation study showed very significant and rapid reduction of mf prevalence and density with 11 out of the 12 districts having mf prevalence <1%. Relatively low LF baseline prevalence and effective integrated MDA for onchocerciasis and LF have led to rapid reduction in LF prevalence.
