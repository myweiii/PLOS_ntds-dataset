West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to persist long term in the brain and kidney tissues of humans, non-human primates, and hamsters. To define a murine model of persistent WNV renal infection, we characterized infection by WNV H8912, an isolate cultured previously from the urine of a persistently infected hamster. Our findings indicate that WNV strain H8912 is highly attenuated in both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence for mice. The virus persisted preferentially in kidneys of the mouse, and less frequently in the spleen and the brain. Moreover, mice infected with WNV H8912 had a delayed induction of IFN- β and IL-1β expression and WNV- specific IgM response, but a constitutive production of serum IL-10. There was a lower proinflammatory response in mouse kidneys when compared to equivalent findings in the spleen. This response may lead to a reduced T cell response in kidneys, which could ultimately contribute to renal-specific WNV persistence. Defining a murine model of WNV persistence by using a well-characterized, hamster-derived WNV urine isolate should provide important insights into understanding the mechanisms of WNV persistence.
