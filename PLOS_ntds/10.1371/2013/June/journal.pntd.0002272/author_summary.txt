Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) has a slow replication rate and infection is characterized by low morbidity and mortality, as well as silent transmission within the population. While rare, HTLV-associated diseases are usually debilitating and life-threatening. The virus is endemic in the state of Pará (Brazil), although there have been no studies of the distribution of the virus within the local population. The results of the present study confirm the existence of familial aggregations of HTLV infection in the metropolitan region of the state capital, Belém. Considerably higher rates of sexual transmission of HTLV from men to women were also demonstrated. Rates of infection were similar for the two virus types, although HTLV-2 appears to be increasing in the population. The frequency of positivity among family members increased in direct proportion to age and was associated with a relatively large proportion of asymptomatic carriers. In addition, widespread ignorance of the virus increases the risk of transmission. The available evidence indicates that significant human suffering is caused by this virus in patients suffering complications, and this is little justification for the lack of intervention on the part of public health authorities, which might impede the ongoing proliferation of this infection in the population.
