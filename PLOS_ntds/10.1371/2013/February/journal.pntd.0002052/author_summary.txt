About half of the human population is under risk of dengue infection. Because of the absence of a vaccine or drug treatment, the prevention of this disease largely relies on controlling its major vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Availability of the complete genome sequence for this mosquito offers the potential to help in the identification of novel disease control strategies. An efficient vector of arboviruses, Ae. aegypti is also a convenient model for laboratory studies. A number of genetic loci related to the remarkable ability of this mosquito to transmit various pathogens were genetically mapped to the three linkage groups corresponding to the three individual chromosomes of the mosquito. However, the exact physical positions of the genetic loci and genomic sequences on the chromosomes were unknown. In this study, we developed maps for mitotic chromosomes of Ae. aegypti and localized 100 clones carrying major genetic markers, which were previously used for mapping genetic loci associated with the pathogens' transmission. Finally, linkage, chromosome, and genome maps of Ae. aegypti were integrated. Anchoring of the genomic sequences associated with genetic markers to the chromosomes of Ae. aegypti will help to identify candidate genes that might be utilized for developing advanced genome-based strategies for vector control.
