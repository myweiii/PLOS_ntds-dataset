The difficulty of diagnosing Strongyloides stercoralis infections is the reason why up to date, accurate information on its geographic distribution in endemic regions and the total global burden is lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 458 schoolchildren, with the purpose of comparing two methods for diagnosing S. stercoralis infection (Koga agar plate ‘KAP’ culture and Baermann technique) on three stool samples from each individual and to assess the efficacy of ivermectin three weeks after treatment. About one quarter of the schoolchildren examined were infected with S. stercoralis. The sensitivity of KAP culture and Baermann technique was 88.4% and 75.0%, respectively. The prevalence of S. stercoralis infection increased considerably (from 18.6% to 24.4%) when three stool samples were examined. Almost three-quarters of the infections could have been avoided by proper sanitation. Ivermectin was highly efficacious against S. stercoralis infection, with a cure rate of 98.3%. In the absence of a “gold standard”, it is necessary to examine multiple stool samples using different diagnostic techniques in order to reach a “true” prevalence.
