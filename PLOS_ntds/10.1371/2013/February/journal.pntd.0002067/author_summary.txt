Recently, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused life-threatening outbreaks in tropical Asia. EV71 has one single serotype but can be phylogenetically classified into 3 main genogroups and 11 genotypes (A, B1∼B5 and C1∼C5). In Taiwan, nationwide EV71 epidemics with different predominant genotypes occurred in 1998(C2), 2000–2001(B4), 2004–2005(C4), and 2008(B5). In this study, historical sera from children infected with these 4 genotypes were collected to measure cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against 11 genotypes. In addition, amino acid sequences of P1 proteins of the tested viruses were compared. Serology data showed that children infected with genogroup B and C consistently have lower neutralizing antibody titers against genogroup A (>4-fold difference). Antigenic variations between genogroup B and C could be detected but did not have a clear pattern. Five amino acid signatures are specific for genogroup A and may be related to the observed antigenic variations. Vaccine development should monitor the antigenic and genetic variations to select vaccine strains.
