Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease and is fatal if untreated. VL mainly affects poor populations in rural areas and has important socio-economic consequences to the household because of high expenditures to access treatment and coping strategies to cover the costs of care. Since 2005, the government of Nepal has been engaged in a regional collaborative effort to eliminate VL from the Indian subcontinent. In this study we examined the economic burden of VL from the perspective of the household after the intensified implementation of VL control activities. Our findings indicate that the economic burden of VL as a percent of household income has decreased compared to studies conducted prior to the implementation of the VL elimination initiative in Nepal. In particular, the free provision of diagnosis and drugs at public health facilities has been an important policy measure. However, the economic impact of VL is still considerable and efforts are needed to further reduce the burden of VL to affected households or prevent the transmission of VL.
