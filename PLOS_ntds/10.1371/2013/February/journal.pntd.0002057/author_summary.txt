Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by infection with parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex, spread by the bite of blood-sucking sandflies, especially in South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. If untreated, symptomatic VL leads to systemic pathologies and is usually fatal. Up to approximately 400,000 new cases are estimated to occur annually, and regional epidemics have been devastatingly severe. Diagnosis of clinically suspect cases in the field, and thus appropriate treatment, relies principally on a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on detection of antibodies against a Leishmania antigen known as rK39. Although this test is reliable in South Asia, it has shown less success in East Africa. One reason may reside in diversity of the rK39 homologue among East African L. donovani, with consequent limitations in the binding of diagnostic antibodies. Here, we investigate the sequences of rK39 homologues in a panel of East African L. donovani strains, and show that there is significant diversity compared to rK39 and to South Asian sequences. Additionally, we examine diversity in another diagnostic antigen known as HASPB1/2. Our results indicate that an improved RDT may need to encompass East-African-specific antigen diversity to provide high performance field diagnosis for this region.
