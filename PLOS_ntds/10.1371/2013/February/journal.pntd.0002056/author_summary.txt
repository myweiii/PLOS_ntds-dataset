Dengue is the most common disease transmitted by a mosquito, with about 100–200 million infections occurring each year in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Policy-makers require accurate information about the number of symptomatic dengue episodes to make informed decisions concerning dengue control strategies. But dengue is usually underreported by national surveillance systems. Through a systematic literature review and analysis of empirical research, we estimated the rate of underreporting and the average annual dengue episodes by treatment (hospitalized and ambulatory) in 2001–2010, for 12 countries in Southeast Asia. We found an average reporting rate of 13.2% of the total symptomatic dengue episodes in the region, leading to an expansion factor of 7.6 for converting reported cases into estimated actual cases. While we focused in Southeast Asia, analogous principles apply to other regions of the world, and other diseases reported through surveillance systems. Estimating the total episodes of dengue is a critical step in studying the economic and disease burden of dengue fever, and the cost-effectiveness evaluation of dengue control and prevention strategies.
