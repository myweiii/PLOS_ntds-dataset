Leishmania are important vector-borne protozoan pathogens that cause different forms of disease, ranging from cutaneous self-healing lesions to life-threatening visceral infection. L. infantum is the most common species causing visceral leishmaniasis in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Iron plays a critical role in host-pathogen interactions. Both the microorganism and its host need iron for growth. However, iron may promote the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species, which contribute to pathogen elimination, but also to host tissue pathology. We investigated the effect of manipulating host iron status on the outcome of L. infantum infection, using the mouse as an experimental model. We found that dietary iron deprivation had no effect on L. infantum growth, and iron-dextran injection decreased the multiplication of L. infantum in mouse organs. The fact that this anti-parasitic effect of iron was not observed in mice genetically deficient in superoxide and nitric oxide synthesis pathways indicates that iron is likely to act in synergy with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced by the host's macrophages. This work clearly shows that iron supplementation improves the host's capacity to eliminate L. infantum parasites and suggests that iron may be further explored as a therapeutic tool to fight this type of infection.
