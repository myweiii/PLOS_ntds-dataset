Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi produces a condition known as Chagas disease which affects at least 17 million people. Adenylate kinases, so called myokinases, are involved in a wide variety of processes, mainly related to their role in nucleotide interconversion and energy management. Recently, nuclear isoforms have been described in several organisms. This “atypical” isoform in terms of primary structure was associated to ribosomes biogenesis in yeast and to Cajal body organization in humans. Moreover nuclear adenylate kinases are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In this manuscript we characterized T. cruzi nuclear adenylate kinase (TcADKn). TcADKn localizes in the nucleolus or cell cytoplasm. Nuclear shuttling mechanisms were also studied for the first time, being dependent on nutrient availability, oxidative stress and by the equivalent of the mammalian TOR pathway in T. cruzi. Furthermore we characterized the signals involved in nuclear importation and exportation processes. In addition, TcADKn expression levels are regulated at an mRNA level, being its 3′UTR involved in this process. These findings are the first steps in the understanding of ribosome processing in trypanosomatids.
