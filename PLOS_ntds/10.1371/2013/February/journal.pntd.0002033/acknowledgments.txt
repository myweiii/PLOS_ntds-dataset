We are grateful to the Ministry of Health (the Mexican Onchocerciasis Elimination Program) who provided the open access onchocerciasis data through its web site. We are much obliged to OEPA whose enthusiastic coordination with the national program made these data feasible. The authors thank all people in endemic areas and brigades of the onchocerciasis program in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas that have indeed contributed to the completion of databases. The Direction of Vector Borne Diseases of CENAPRECE (Dr. Armando Elizondo Quiroga as coordinator of the onchocerciasis program), Ministry of Health Mexico and the Health Services of the State of Oaxaca (Dr. Miguel Alberto Vásquez Rodríguez) and Chiapas (Dr. Francisco Gibert Prado Velasco) also supported this study as part of their tenure.
