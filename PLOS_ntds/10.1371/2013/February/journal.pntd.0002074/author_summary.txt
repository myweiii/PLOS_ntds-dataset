Dengue virus is spread by Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that prefers to feed on humans. Chemicals used at toxic levels is currently the only confirmed effective strategy for dengue vector control, but insecticide resistance issues are threatening this approach. Other chemical actions that break vector-human contact exist: contact irritant effects, causing escape from homes and spatial repellent effects, preventing house entry. These actions are being evaluated in the development of a push-pull strategy to target indoor resting sites (using contact irritants) and/or portals of house entry (using spatial repellents) at sublethal concentrations to push the vector away from the treated structure and associated human hosts. When combined with an attractant trap placed outdoors to pull the irritated/repelled vectors from the peridomestic environment, the integrated stimuli form a push-pull system that can be used to further enhance disruption of human-vector contact. Here we report on the quantification of contact irritancy (escape) behavior, knockdown and 24 hour mortality rates in populations of Ae. aegypti under both laboratory and field conditions. Evaluations were carried out against three pyrethroid insecticides. Findings indicate an increase in escape response using sublethal concentrations and focal application suggesting a potential role for contact irritants in a push-pull strategy.
