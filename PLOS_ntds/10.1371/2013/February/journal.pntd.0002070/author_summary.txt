Control of soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections is of central importance to improving preschool child health because these infections can have long lasting consequences on growth and development. Our study in indigenous Ng√§be preschool children in western Panama was conducted over a period of 16 months. We monitored reinfection dynamics of three STH infections (Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm) over two reinfection cycles to gain an understanding of regional, household and individual factors that influenced transmission of these infections among preschool children. Despite the rural setting, where virtually all households live under conditions of extreme poverty, we identified spatial clusters of high prevalence of Trichuris and hookworm in the most remote and poorest area, whereas Ascaris was present throughout the study area. Preschool children who were chronically malnourished (low height-for-age) had a higher reinfection burden of Ascaris and hookworm. Household poverty (low relative household wealth and maternal education) and infrequent latrine use were also influential in Ascaris reinfection. This cross-disciplinary analysis of preschool child STH transmission in a poor rural setting provides pertinent information for STH control programs that aim to break the cycle of poverty and infection.
