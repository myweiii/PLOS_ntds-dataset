Trypanosomes are single-celled organisms transmitted by the biting tsetse fly, which cause sleeping sickness in humans in sub-Saharan Africa, but also infect livestock and other mammals. Most trypanosomes cannot infect humans as they die in human serum, but two mutants of Trypanosoma brucei have evolved the ability to survive in human serum. This survival in human serum is conferred by the presence of one gene in the East African human-infective T. b. rhodesiense. How often trypanosomes exchange genetic material (they can mate in the tsetse fly) is debated, but will impact upon the spread of genes (e.g. that which confers human infectivity) through a population. We studied T. b. rhodesiense populations from different geographic locations (Malawi and two locations in Uganda), and over time (Uganda), to see if the populations are stable over time and space, using a panel of variable genetic markers enabling assessment of diversity. Our results suggest that there is significant difference in diversity between locations; those in Uganda are very closely related, increasingly so over time, whereas the Malawi population is very genetically diverse, consistent with the trypanosomes mating. These findings suggest that a greater understanding of T. b. rhodesiense population evolution will inform on sleeping sickness epidemiology.
