Rabies remains a major public health problem, although the means to control and prevent this disease are available through mass dog vaccination and provision of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to people exposed to bites by rabid or suspect rabid animals. Despite its necessity as a life-saving measure to prevent the fatal onset of rabies, access to PEP is a major problem in developing countries. We used extensive investigative interviews to estimate rabies incidence (deaths and exposures) and questionnaires to bite victims and their families to investigate health-seeking behaviour and costs associated with receiving PEP, in four districts covering both rural and urban Tanzania. Frequent shortages at health centres limited prompt access to PEP. Suspect bite victims often had to travel long distances to major hospitals to receive costly PEP, causing delays and increasing the risk of developing rabies. We calculated that an average patient in rural Tanzania would need to spend over $100 to complete the WHO recommended PEP schedules, unaffordable for many Tanzanians, who survive under the poverty line. Our data shows that rabies imposes a disproportionate financial hardship and high risk of dying of rabies to rural poor families and highlights the need to re-evaluate the burden of rabies in Africa.
