Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread human malaria parasite. In highly endemic areas such as Papua New Guinea, a very rapid onset of immunity against vivax-malaria is observed. Although it is known that numerous P. vivax merozoite antigens are targets of naturally acquired antibodies, the role of many of these antibodies in protective immunity is yet unknown. In a cohort of 183 children aged 1–3 years, we now show that the presence of antibodies to Merozoite Surface Protein 3α (PvMSP3α) and Merozoite Surface Protein 9 (PvMSP9) are associated with a significant reduction in the burden P. vivax malaria. Antibodies increased with age and in the presence of concurrent P. vivax infections. After adjusting for both age and individual differences in exposure, the strongest reductions in risk were seen in children with antibodies to PvMSP3α Block II (41% reduction, p = 0.001) and PvMSP9 N-terminal region. (32% reduction, p = 0.035). These results indicate that PvMSP3α Block II and PvMSP9 N-terminus should be further investigated for their potential as P. vivax vaccine antigens.
