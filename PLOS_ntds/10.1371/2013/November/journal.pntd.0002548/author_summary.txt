The food-borne clonorchiasis imposes public health problems on inhabitants in endemic areas. Praziquantel has been employed as an efficacious anthelminthic in large-scale campaigns as well as for individual treatment of Clonorchis sinensis human infections. Although praziquantel continues to have good efficacy, new drug development for this parasite has been recognized as a crucial issue to be investigated intensively. Clonorchis sinensis adults generate energy through glycolysis, actively utilizing exogenous glucose, and produce a large amount of eggs each day. Taurocyamine kinase (CsTK) is distributed abundantly in the locomotive and reproductive organs, and is an important enzyme in energy generation and homeostasis in adult C. sinensis. Enzymes of the glycolytic pathway are also expressed abundantly in these organs and in tegument, implying these organs play central roles which are essential for survival and reproduction of C. sinensis. The TK enzymes, including CsTK, are found only among invertebrate organisms and have substrate specificity for taurocyamine, which are significantly different from phosphagen kinases of vertebrate animals. With these molecular biological, enzymatic, and evolutionary characteristics, we propose here that CsTK could be a target for development of chemotherapeutic agents against C. sinensis and be a biomolecular model for other human-infecting trematodes.
