Rift Valley fever virus is a pathogen enzootic to sub-Saharan Africa, with epidemic transmission occurring sporadically between mosquitoes and mammals, notably livestock. The virus is regarded as a global threat to agriculture and human health because it has proven capable of expanding its range into western and northern Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula, and a recent study has shown that mosquitoes in North America are capable of transmitting the virus. Here, we used a set of mathematical equations to formulate a logical representation of potential transmission mechanisms, and we informed the model with real-world data and generalizable methods to define spatial and temporal variation in mosquito and host abundance. We applied these methods in California's warm, agricultural Central Valley, an area with a history of mosquito-borne virus transmission and a hub of California's dairy industry. Model-derived transmission estimates indicated broad potential for transient epidemics that could result in economic losses in livestock in all but the coldest winter months, but the greatest risk for intense, sustained transmission occurred during the summer when both vector abundance and temperatures were highest. We also highlight critical gaps in the data available to inform models for Rift Valley fever virus.
