We thank the California mosquito and vector control districts who participate in the California Vectorborne Disease Surveillance program (CalSurv) for providing trapping data used to estimate mosquito vector abundance, and California's Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, Fresno office, for information used to estimate the densities of dairy cattle within grid cells.
