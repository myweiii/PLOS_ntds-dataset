A human fascioliasis endemic area is described for the first time in North America. In Atlixco, Puebla State, Mexico, prevalences of 2.94–13.33% by F. hepatica were found in 865 6–14-year-old schoolchildren by FasciDIG coproantigen test and Lumbreras rapid sedimentation technique, and quantitatively assessed with Kato-Katz. Prevalences peaked in the 8–10-year age group. The use of a coproantigen test proved to be useful, as most children (72%) did not shed eggs. The link of fascioliasis risk with consumption of raw vegetables other than watercress suggests contamination when washing terrestrial vegetables with untreated water and/or in plant cultures using natural water for irrigation. The relatively high coinfection percentage with Giardia intestinalis and the lack of a treated water supply system reaching all dwellings suggest that infection may also occur by water drinking. Nitazoxanide efficacy against fascioliasis is worth mentioning, becoming an alternative to triclabendazole. Its wide spectrum against intestinal protozooses and helminthiases, usually coinfecting Fasciola infected subjects in human endemic areas, represents an important added value. In Atlixco, the low fascioliasis intensities indicate that no special precaution will be needed for child treatment (epg<400). The mesoendemic situation, with hyperendemic foci, adds concern about possible human fascioliasis underestimation in other areas of Mexico.
