Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects the liver and in the severe hepatosplenic form results in periportal fibrosis. This disease is a major public health problem in Northeast Brazil. Our study aim was to evaluate whether abnormal blood coagulation and liver function tests in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis depended on the severity of their fibrosis and could be used to inform diagnosis and treatment. We verified, by analyzing blood samples and by abdominal ultrasound of 55 patients, that blood clotting abnormalities are associated with reduced functioning of the liver and with increased liver fibrosis. Our results additionally suggested that reduced levels of protein C in plasma are a good marker of liver fibrosis progression. Also of note was our finding that a quarter of patients with advanced fibrosis have hyperfibrinolysis, a severe blood clotting disorder which may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, we recommend, for patients eligible for surgical procedures, that certain blood tests (D-dimer, prothrombin time and platelet count) be measured during the pre-surgical evaluation to better assess risk of bleeding.
