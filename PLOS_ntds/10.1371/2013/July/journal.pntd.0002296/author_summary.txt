There is a dire need for fast and efficient diagnosis of many viral diseases. Our research specifically looked at RVFV, a virus that can only be worked with in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories, and its capture with NanoTrap particles. NanoTrap particles are hydrogel particles that contain internal affinity baits. They have previously been used in the capture of several analytes, but never in the capture of whole virus particles. We were not only able to capture and detect RVFV at very low titers from both media and serum, but we were also able to inactivate the virus, which allows for its safe transport to BSL-2 laboratories. While there are other commercially available beads that can also capture virus, NanoTrap particles are the only beads that can protect the viral RNA from enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whole virus detection with NanoTrap particles is not limited to only RVFV, but that NanoTrap particles can be used to detect other viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV).
