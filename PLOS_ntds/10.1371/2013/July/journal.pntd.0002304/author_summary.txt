Congenital Chagas disease is the infection resulting of the transmission of T.cruzi parasites from an infected pregnant woman to her fetus during the pregnancy or at the time of delivery. This represents a relevant public health issue in endemic and non-endemic countries. The infected newborn detected at birth or before one year old, if treated, can be completely cured. In this work, we report results obtained from 2004 to 2009 during the implementation of a National Program based on PAHO recommendations; the implementation strategy has been adapted into the Bolivian context and integrated into the National Mother and Child Health program. Our conclusions show that it is necessary to test all newborns from positive mothers three times before one year of age. The infant, if positive and treated with a 30 day Benznidazole course, has excellent chances of cure.
