The clinical outcome of DENV infection in humans can be DF or the more severe DHF and DSS. The individual's previous DENV exposure history, infecting serotypes, and host genetics are thought to be contributing factors to dengue disease severity. Our study contributed to the current dengue research field in the following ways: 1) Our study reveals the dynamics of host gene expression over each day post onset of symptoms. The gene transcription patterns enabled classification of dengue disease into 2 subtle phases: early acute and late acute. 2) The study identified gene markers differentiating severe dengue cases from non-severe cases with >90% accuracy. Taken together, our study offers insight into host responses in DENV-infected subjects and these results may be valuable for the future development of diagnostic tools for disease severity.
