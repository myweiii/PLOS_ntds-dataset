Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, represents a major cause of socio-economic disruption throughout much of Africa. The discovery that Mectizan (ivermectin) was effective in treating onchocerciasis, together with the decision of Merck Sharpe and Dohme to donate this drug for the treatment of this disease, revolutionized onchocerciasis control efforts. But until recently, it was thought that ivermectin alone was not sufficient to eliminate this scourge. However, recent studies have suggested that long-term ivermectin treatment can eliminate onchocerciasis in some foci in Africa. This has revolutionized the thinking of the international community, turning its attention from an emphasis on control to an emphasis on elimination. For an elimination program to be successful, it is necessary to accurately map all at-risk communities. In the case of onchocerciasis, this is commonly done by epidemiological surveys. Here we report the validation of a remote sensing method to identify areas endemic for onchocerciasis. This method is based upon predicting the sites where the black fly vector for the parasite breeds. The method was found to be very accurate at predicting black fly breeding sites in West Africa and in northwest Uganda. The method should be useful in assisting in mapping at-risk communities in areas of Africa where ground-based surveys are difficult or impossible to implement.
