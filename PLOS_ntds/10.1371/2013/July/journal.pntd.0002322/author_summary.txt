Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease caused by the Leishmania donovani complex including Leishmania donovani in East Africa and India and by Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean area and Latin America. Clinical diagnosis of VL in East Africa is difficult as maladies with similar symptoms are endemic. For this reason, reliable diagnosis of VL is extremely important. However, tests based on antibody reaction with rK39 are not sensitive in East Africa most likely due to the genetic diversity of different Leishmania species. In this study, we cloned and expressed a new antigenic protein (rKLO8) of L. donovani strain originating from Sudan. Sequence analysis confirmed that KLO8 differs from other kinesin proteins of Leishmania. We thus tested and compared the performance of rKLO8 with rK39 and other commercial tests for VL diagnosis in Sudan. Our data show that sera of VL patients reacted stronger with rKLO8 than rK39, suggesting improved diagnosis of patients with low antibody titres.
