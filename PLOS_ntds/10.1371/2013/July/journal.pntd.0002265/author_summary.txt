Trachoma, an eye infection caused by C. trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide, affecting the developing world. The current standard for trachoma treatment involves mass drug administration (MDA) of an antibiotic that is given to a community to reduce transmission. A field test for the presence of infection would be a useful adjunct in measuring MDA impact. However, the current standard for measuring infection involves expensive, delicate instrumentation that is often only in laboratories in developed countries or capital cities, and eye swab specimens are mostly shipped to the developed world for analysis.
This study compared a standard method for infection analysis, Roche Amplicor, in the United States, with a new test, the Cepheid GeneXpert, in the field in Tanzania. We collected 144 duplicate eye swabs in children ages 0â€“9 years. 12% of specimens could not be analyzed by GeneXpert due to correctable technical difficulties. Of those analyzed, 100% of samples negative by Amplicor were also negative by GeneXpert, and 95% of samples positive by GeneXpert were also positive by Amplicor. The GeneXpert was easy to use with minimal opportunities for contamination, and is a promising new test for field-testing infection in trachoma control efforts.
