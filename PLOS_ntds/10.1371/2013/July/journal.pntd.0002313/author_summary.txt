Small mammals, especially rodents, coexist with humans, particularly in rural areas where they become infected with the larval stages of Echinococcus multilocularis via ingestion of eggs in feces from infected carnivores. As prey for carnivores, small mammals have an important role in the life cycle of E. multilocularis, the agent of a serious zoonotic disease, alveolar echinococcosis, infecting people in most northern hemisphere countries. We detected E. multilocularis infection in the liver of small mammals in villages of the Chenaran region of northeastern Iran, where we previously found adult E. multilocularis and/or eggs in all wild, and some domestic, carnivores examined. Several species of small mammals, especially the Transcaspian vole (Microtus transcaspicus), were natural hosts of this cestode. Since infected voles are a good marker of soil contamination with E. multilocularis eggs, they are an indicator of the infection risk for inhabitants. There is a need to educate local populations about risk of infection to avoid transmission of this pathogenic parasite.
