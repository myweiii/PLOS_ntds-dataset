During pneumonia and sepsis a procoagulant state is observed, with activation of coagulation and downregulation of anticoagulant pathways, both closely interrelated with inflammation. The protein C (PC) system is an important anticoagulant pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. The rate of conversion of the zymogen PC into the active end product of the PC system, activated PC, is enhanced when PC binds to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). We studied the role of EPCR in the host response during pneumonia-derived sepsis instigated by Burkholderia (B.) pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, a common form of community-acquired Gram-negative (pneumo)sepsis in South-East Asia and a serious potential bioterrorism threat agent. Plasma EPCR-levels measured in culture-proven melioidosis patients were higher than in healthy controls and were associated with an increased mortality. Furthermore, mice overexpressing EPCR demonstrated enhanced bacterial growth and dissemination to distant organs during experimental melioidosis, accompanied by increased lung damage, neutrophil influx and cytokine production and attenuated coagulation activation, while endogenous EPCR does not impact on the host response. These data point to a possible role for EPCR in the host defense against B. pseudomallei and may be of value in the development of therapeutic strategies against this dangerous pathogen.
