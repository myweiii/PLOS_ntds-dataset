Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium africanum are the two major lineages within the M. tuberculosis complex that cause human tuberculosis in West Africa. Despite being closely related, the outcome after infection differs between these two pathogens. Although M. africanum has not yet been studied to the same extent as M. tuberculosis, M. africanum is less likely to stimulate the host immune system or to progress to active disease. We hypothesized that this somewhat attenuated phenotype is due to the slower growth of M. africanum within the host. Therefore, we analysed clinical isolates from 522 patients with tuberculosis in The Gambia. M. africanum West Africa 2 strains grew more slowly than M. tuberculosis. We sequenced four M. africanum strains and identified several candidate genes that may cause the growth-attenuation of the bacteria. Describing the fundamental genomic and phenotypic differences between M. tuberculosis and M. africanum will enable us to better understand the virulence mechanisms that make M. tuberculosis one of the most successful bacterial pathogens, and to discover potential strategies to interfere with mycobacterial pathogenicity.
