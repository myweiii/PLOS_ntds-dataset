Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania parasites are seen as cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) clinical forms in Turkey. Leishmania (L.) tropica and L. infantum were determined as CL agents, while L. infantum was incriminated for VL in the country. Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is widely common throughout the country and L. infantum is the responsible agent of the disease. Related to Leishmania species diversity and different clinical forms in human and dogs in this geographical area, the identification of the parasite species prefers to be done during the time of diagnosis. Internal transcribed spacer region was chosen as the target area for developing a real-time PCR assay to use as a fast and standardized diagnostic method and species identification simultaneously. Clinical samples from parasitologically/serologically proven cases and isolates were included the study, and high positivity rate in species identification was obtained. The method can also determine the intragenomic heterogeneity in Leishmania tropica and L. infantum. The assay presents a sufficient sensitivity for fast and correct detection of leishmaniasis directly from clinical materials. L. tropica and L. infantum were found as causative agents of human CL, VL and CanL in Turkey. Knowledge about differences in the parasites is useful for future studies in Turkey.
