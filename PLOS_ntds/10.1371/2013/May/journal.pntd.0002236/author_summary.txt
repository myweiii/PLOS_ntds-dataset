The pathogenesis of severe dengue virus (DENV) infection is still not fully understood. It is hypothesized that it is caused by a cytokine storm as is described in severe sepsis. In the sepsis field, the potent immunostimulator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is proposed to play an important role in the development of a cytokine storm. In a previous study we have found elevated levels of LPS in children with severe DENV infection. In this study we have investigated if we could confirm that microbial translocation occurs in DENV-infected patients. Moreover, we have determined the levels of thirty cytokines to get more insight in the cytokine storm during DENV infections and we have investigated whether microbial translocation is associated with immune activation. The patients in this cohort were classified according to their clinical presentation. Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on the expression of the determined cytokines was applied to identify patients with similar cytokine profiles. With these two techniques, we identified cytokines that may contribute significantly to the cytokine storm, and we could relate elevated levels of LPS to patients with a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile.
