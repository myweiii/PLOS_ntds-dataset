Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic viral disease posing an increasing threat to animals and humans worldwide. Recent severe outbreaks of the disease in animal and human populations in endemic regions and outside the disease's traditional geographic boundaries necessitate the need for evaluating the diagnostic performance of RVF expert laboratories. Molecular methods are increasingly used for a rapid and accurate detection of viral nucleic acid. In this study we present the results of the first international external quality assessment (EQA) for the molecular diagnosis of RVF. Such EQA studies allow participating laboratories to monitor the quality and identify possible weaknesses of current diagnostic methods. Participants to this RVF EQA were 30 expert laboratories from 16 different countries worldwide. The study demonstrated that optimal results could be achieved by the majority of laboratories. Specific protocols showed evenly good performances and can therefore be recommended to all expert laboratories. However, other methods showed uneven performances suggesting the need for improved optimization and standardization of these protocols.
