Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiologic agent of melioidosis, a severe disease endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. B. pseudomallei is also classified as a Tier 1 select agent due to the threat of malicious use of the organism. Treatment of melioidosis is complicated by the inherent multidrug resistance of B. pseudomallei, leading to high case fatality rates or disease relapse. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve patient survival and to protect against a deliberate release of B. pseudomallei. Immunotherapeutics that can enhance the host immune response and delay disease progression represent a significant area of research interest. A number of immunomodulatory agents delivered locally to the lung prior to B. pseudomallei infection have afforded significant protection against pulmonary disease in animal models of melioidosis; however, their protective capacity significantly wanes upon post-exposure administration. In this work, we identify the PGE2 pathway as an immunotherapeutic target in pulmonary melioidosis and show that post-exposure COX-2 inhibition provides significant protection against lethal B. pseudomallei lung infection in mice. Further research examining FDA-approved COX-2 inhibitors as post-exposure prophylaxis for B. pseudomallei is warranted, as this may represent a safe, affordable, and efficacious immunotherapeutic strategy.
