Chlamydia trachomatis is the etiological agent of trachoma the world's leading cause of infectious blindness. In this study, we investigated whether delayed clearance of a primary infection in nonhuman primates was attributable to antigenic variation or related to gradual changes in the humoral immune response specific to chlamydial antigens. We found that antigenic variation was not related to the inability of monkeys to efficiently resolve their infection. However, exploring changes in the immune response as a possible reason for delayed clearance revealed that antibody recognition was restricted to the antigenically variable major surface protein and a few conserved polypeptides. Antibody recognition of the major antigenically variable surface protein correlated with the initial reduction in infectious burdens while recognition of conserved chlamydial antigens occurred late and correlated with infection eradication. These findings suggest that delayed clearance of chlamydial infection is not the result of antigenic variation but a consequence of a gradually evolving humoral immune response specific to different chlamydial antigens. Antibody recognition was at least partially directed against conformational epitopes, indicating that an efficacious subunit trachoma vaccine might require a combination of antigens delivered in their native conformation.
