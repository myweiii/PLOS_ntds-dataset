Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic human pathogens. Global reports show an emergence of various NTM diseases among immuno-suppressed as well as immuno-competent individuals. In Saudi Arabia, data are scarce on the prevalence of NTM and their genetic diversity. Currently, NTM infections are neglected in the country and the real magnitude of problems is still masked. As the first study of its type to be conducted in Saudi Arabia, we sought to explore the species spectrum of NTM by utilizing a nationwide collection of clinical isolates. The NTM species diversity is large and shows a different trend compared to Western countries as rapidly growing mycobacterial species are the most prevalent to cause diseases in the country. A large number of clinically relevant pulmonary cases show high pathogenic potential of NTM. Indeed, timely identification of mycobacterial species will lead to adapting an appropriate therapy and supports the implementation of control policies which is urgently needed in the country.
