Since the last decade, growing awareness of the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has resulted in worldwide increased pledges of drug donations. However, health care decision makers have a limited repertoire of strategies for a rapid assessment of infection intensity and for checking of drug resistance development. Therefore, we verified whether examination of pooled stool samples provide estimates of intestinal worm infection intensity and drug efficacy comparable to those obtained by examination of individual stool samples. Overall, the results showed that pooled samples provide comparable levels of infection intensity and drug efficacy. We conclude that pooling stool samples holds promise as a means of rapidly appraising the intensity of intestinal worm infections on a population level and of monitoring the efficacy of donated drugs. However, this study was conducted in an endemic region. Further research is required to determine when and how pooling of stool samples can be cost-effectively applied in a control program that is reducing the transmission of disease, and to verify whether this approach is also applicable to NTDs other than studied in this paper.
