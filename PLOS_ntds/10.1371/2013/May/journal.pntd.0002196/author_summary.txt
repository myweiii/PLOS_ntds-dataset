American cutaneous leishmaniasis is an endemic parasitic disease in Peru, with more than a reported thousand cases per year associated with significant disabilities and economic impact. In comparison to old-world cutaneous Leishmaniasis where the infection generally heals on its own, American cutaneous Leishmaniasis is a chronic skin disease and its treatment can be expensive, difficult to administer, and associated with significant adverse events. We developed a heat treatment using a novel and low-technology device named Hand-held Exothermic Crystallization Thermotherapy for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (HECT-CL). This device produces a stable thermal reaction ranging from 50–54°C which is considered therapeutic and has enormous benefits for its application in real world conditions, as it is extremely low cost, simple to use, and highly tolerable in patients receiving this treatment. Our pilot evaluation found cure rates close to those reported with the standard antimonial treatment and likely higher in cases of relapsing disease. Additionally, fewer severe adverse events were observed than reported with the use of other currently available heat therapies. Our objective is to show that HECT-CL therapy could be instituted in rural and real situations with limited health care infrastructure and with less cost and fewer side effects than standard antimonial treatment.
