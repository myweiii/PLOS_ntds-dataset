Taenia solium is a parasite that infects humans. The parasite eggs are released into the environment with human feces in villages with inadequate sanitation. Pigs might ingest the parasite eggs and develop the larval stage named cysticercosis (cysts), mainly in the muscles and heart. If a human accidentally ingests the parasite eggs, then the cysts develop principally in the central nervous system, a serious public health problem. Serological results in pigs do not always correlate with what is observed in the necropsy; in fact, some seropositive pigs are negative or have a few cysts. This study aimed to investigate the Electroimmunotransfer Blot (EITB) with the actual pig infection burden. We selected an endemic area of Peru, and sampled 476 pigs. Seroprevalence was 60.5% and there were more old positive pigs than young ones. A subset of 84 seropositive pigs were necropsied and only 43 (51%) had one or more cysts in the whole body. Older pigs also showed more moderate and heavy infection burdens compared to younger pigs. In general, the probability of having cysts increases with the number of EITB bands. This serological assay might be a measure of exposure rather than a test to detect the real disease.
