Eumycetoma is a mutilating fungal disease of mainly the foot and is found in (sub)tropical regions such as Sudan. At the moment it is not understood why some people develop eumycetoma and others not. In the regions were eumycetoma is prevalent many other infections are also found. These infections could alter the immune system which makes people more or less susceptible in obtaining another infection. One of the infections with such an effect is Schistosomiasis. In Africa, eumycetoma is found in regions were schistosomiasis is prevalent. In this study we show that eumycetoma patients more often have antibodies against Schistosoma species, than healthy controls from the same region. In contrast, eumycetoma patients did not have more often antibodies against Toxoplasma species. This might implicate that schistosomiasis predisposes eumycetoma development. If schistosomiasis indeed predisposes eumycetoma development, eradicating Schistosoma in a population could also lower the number of eumycetoma cases in that area, which in the end could lead to intervention strategies not only for schistosomiasis but also for eumycetoma.
