Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is a neglected tropical disease that is highly endemic in the Indian subcontinent and in East Africa and is the second most fatal parasitic disease after malaria. There currently exists several effective treatments for VL and it is therefore essential that the diagnosis be as accessible, sensitive and specific as possible. The current diagnostic test, known as the rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) involves detection of antibodies against the K39 protein antigen from Leishmania. The rK39 RDT was developed for use with serum from potentially infected individuals. However, the test is routinely performed with blood at the community level in the endemic countries because there are no facilities to extract serum from blood. We therefore undertook the present study to compare the sensitivity of the rK39 RDT on serum versus blood from the same potentially infected population from a highly endemic region in Bihar India. Our results show that the concordance between serum and blood was excellent. It was however possible to miss some rK39 positive individuals when using blood. We recommend that when an individual from an endemic area has obvious clinical symptoms of VL and the blood rK39 RDT is negative, that the test should be redone 2â€“3 weeks later if the symptoms persist.
