The soil-transmitted helminths (STH) Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are endemic in many tropical countries. Regular treatment with albendazole or mebendazole is the major means for controlling STHs. However, repeated treatment with the same class of benzimidazole anthelmintics has caused resistance in veterinary parasites, characterized by mutations at either codon 200, 167 or 198 in the Î²-tubulin gene. There is a concern that resistance may develop in human STH. Drug efficacy and mutation frequencies were assessed in T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides and hookworms collected in Haiti, Kenya and Panama prior to and after albendazole treatment. In T. trichiura from Haiti and Kenya, a significant increase of the frequency of the mutation at codon 200 was identified after treatment and drug efficacy was mediocre. Against A. lumbricoides, albendazole efficacy was good, even though the frequency of a mutation at codon 167 was relatively high, suggesting that, in this nematode, the codon 167 polymorphism does not impact efficacy. In hookworms, the mutation at codon 200 was identified, but at low frequencies and the response to albendazole was good. We conclude that monitoring for possible resistance in control programmes should be undertaken.
