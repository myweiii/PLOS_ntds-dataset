Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a consequence of accidental ingestion of the eggs of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. AE constitutes a serious and increasing medical and epidemiological problem in many countries including Poland. The natural environments with a high AE prevalence are the areas where the definitive hosts (foxes, raccoons) and the intermediate hosts (rodents) live. The increasing population of infected foxes that penetrate nearby the village and urban buildings and infected dogs poses a certain risk to human health. This report is a joint clinical and epidemiological analysis of 121 AE cases recorded in the years 1990â€“2011 in Poland. The highest percentage of E. multilocularis infected foxes in the north-eastern regions of Poland (about 40% of the examined population infected) bears a clear-cut relation to the highest incidence of detected AE human cases in those areas. An epidemiological and clinical survey of the local population conducted for over a dozen years has contributed to the discovery of several new AE cases. Alveolar echinococcosis in humans caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infection belongs to the emerging diseases in Poland where a continuous increase in the detection rate was noticed during the last two decades.
