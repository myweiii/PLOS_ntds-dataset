The mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus is responsible for acute febrile polyarthralgia and, in a proportion of cases, complications including chronic arthritis. Since 2005, it has massively re-emerged in the Old World. Although the large majority of patients are outpatients, the most detailed studies have focused previously on hospitalised patients (i.e., severe cases). Here, we report the detailed clinico-biological characteristics of ‘standard’ clinical presentations in patients followed-up by general practitioners in Reunion Island (2006) during the CuraChik clinical trial. At the onset of the disease, two stages were observed: (i) a ‘viral stage’ during the first 4 days, associated with an acute febrile polyarthralgic syndrome and a subsequent rapid clinical improvement; the main clinico-biological characteristics during that period were used to elaborate supportive chikungunya diagnostic scores, (ii) a ‘convalescent stage’ (days 5–14) with no detectable viraemia but a slower clinical improvement. Woman and elderly patients were found at risk for more symptomatic forms of the disease at both the acute and late stages (day 300) and we observed that the viral intra-host genetic diversity increased over time and that a higher viral amino-acid complexity at the acute stage was associated with more symptomatic illness at the late stage of the disease.
