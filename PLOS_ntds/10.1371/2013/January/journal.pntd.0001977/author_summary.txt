Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Ethiopia is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. This disease has one of the highest mortality rates: if left untreated, it is almost always fatal. VL belongs to the most neglected tropical diseases, affecting the poorest populations, for whom access to diagnosis and effective treatment are often not available. VL is worsened when the patients are co-infected with HIV. We have recently shown that patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL patients) and HIV seropositive patients (HIV+ patients) have increased levels of an enzyme, arginase, in their blood. This enzyme has been shown to prevent cells of the immune system from mounting an efficient response and controlling the replication of the virus in HIV+ patients or the parasites in VL patients. In this study, we show that arginase is considerably higher in the blood of VL/HIV co-infected patients as compared to VL patients. Our results suggest that this abnormally high arginase might contribute to the poor prognosis associated to VL/HIV patients.
