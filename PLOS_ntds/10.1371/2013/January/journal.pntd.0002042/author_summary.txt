Four cultured Borrelia species are responsible for relapsing fever in Africa. Three species (Borrelia crocidurae, Borrelia duttonii, Borrelia hispanica) are transmitted by ticks, whereas Borrelia recurrentis is transmitted by the body lice. These Borrelia species result in febrile infection mimicking malaria with varying severity, but particularly devastating during pregnancy where infection will often cause miscarriage. The lack of comprehensive laboratory tools for detection and speciation of these borreliae limits both medical management of patients and knowledge of the epidemiology of relapsing fevers in Africa. Based on genome analysis, we develop herein a multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene detecting all four borreliae, the glpQ gene detecting B. croidurae, the recN gene detecting B. duttonii/B. recurrentis and recC gene detecting B. hispanica. Compared to gold standard, this multiplex real-time PCR assay yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity for B. duttonii/B. reccurentis and B. hispanica and 99% sensitivity and specificity for B. crocidurae, when applied to 398 blood specimens. These findings provide the proof-of-concept that multiplex real-time PCR is a new tool for diagnosis of relapsing fever borreliae in Africa.
