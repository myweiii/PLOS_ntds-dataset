Snakebite accidents are a neglected cause of much death and suffering worldwide. The situation is especially severe in rural areas of low income tropical countries, where long distances to well-equipped health care facilities mean that the time needed to reach antivenom treatment is often long. Delays in receiving antivenom treatment of snakebites could lead to severe outcomes, such as death or permanent disability. In this study we demonstrate how Geographical Information Systems (GIS) could be used to allocate antivenom rationally and thereby decrease the impact of snakebite in a cost-effective manner. We map areas with a high risk of snakebite accidents, based on a high reported incidence and environmental conditions favoring snakebites. We then estimate the time needed to reach a facility in which antivenom treatment is available for the population in these high risk areas, thus identifying areas in need of improved treatment accessibility. Based on these maps of the unmet need of antivenom treatment, allocation of antivenom and other resources needed to treat snakebites can be made more efficiently.
