In tropical Africa, clinical laboratories capable of performing complicated diagnostic studies like PCR are rare and are almost always found in large cities. Moreover, a number of infectious diseases, many of them are emerging and neglected, may be quickly and reliably diagnosed only by molecular biology. This is one of the reasons why the repertoire of bacterial infectious diseases in tropical Africa is poorly known. The laboratory based on the Point-of-Care (POC) principle has been designed in order to resolve the time lag between test results and patient care, which is the critical point for the treatment. We report here the first successful experience of the installation of POC laboratory in rural Senegal. During the first year of the study (February 2011 to January 2012) we identified DNA from at least one pathogenic bacterium in 80/440 (18.2%) of the samples from febrile patients. In most of the cases it was relapsing fever and rickettsiosis agents. Malaria was diagnosed in 54 cases. In total, at least one pathogen (bacterium or protozoa) was identified in 127/440 (28.9%) of studied samples. Discovering that at least 18.2% of acute infections can be successfully treated with doxycycline should change the treatment strategy for acute fevers in West Africa.
