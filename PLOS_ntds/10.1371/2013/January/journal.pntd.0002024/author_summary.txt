Nipah virus causes severe disease in humans and outbreaks have occurred in two geographic regions, Malaysia and Bangladesh, and viruses have been isolated during outbreaks from both of these regions (NiV-M and NiV-B, respectively). The original outbreak of Nipah virus occurred in Malaysia and caused severe encephalitis in humans. All subsequent outbreaks of Nipah virus have occurred in Bangladesh or India and disease has been characterized as having a strong respiratory component. Nipah virus is a public health concern that can cause up to 100% lethality in humans and there is no approved treatment or vaccine. Current research should focus on understanding disease progression and pathogenicity. We compared NiV-M and NiV-B infection and disease progression using the Syrian hamster model. We found that NiV-M is more destructive in cultured hamster cells and has faster onset of cytopathogenicity compared to NiV-B. This is also true in hamsters, where although both viruses are pathogenic and cause a similar disease, pathology caused by NiV-M infection is accelerated. These data show that there is a difference in disease progression between the two strains of Nipah virus and will allow for a more detailed understanding of the events leading to disease caused by these viruses.
