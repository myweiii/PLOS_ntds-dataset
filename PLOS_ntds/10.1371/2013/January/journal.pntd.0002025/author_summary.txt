Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral disease with hemorrhagic manifestations, occurs as seasonal outbreaks in five districts of Karnataka state, India. Vaccination with formalin inactivated tissue-culture vaccine is the key strategy for the prevention of the disease in the region. In spite of high effectiveness of the vaccine reported in earlier studies, KFD cases among vaccinated individuals have been recently reported. We analysed KFD vaccination and case surveillance data from 2005 to 2010 to estimate the coverage and efficacy of the vaccine under programme conditions. Vaccination coverage was low with less than 50% of the population vaccinated. The effectiveness of the vaccine was 62.4% (95% CI = 26.1–80.8) among those who received two doses and 82.9% (95% CI = 71.3–89.8) for those who received an additional booster dose as compared to the unvaccinated individuals. Systematic efforts are needed to increase the vaccine coverage and identify the reasons for lower efficacy of the vaccine in the region.
