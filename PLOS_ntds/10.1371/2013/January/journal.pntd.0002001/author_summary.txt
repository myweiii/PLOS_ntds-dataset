The absence of a commercially-available dengue vaccine or anti-viral drug makes control of Aedes aegypti, the principal dengue mosquito vector, the only available method to prevent this disease. Sustained, effective application of vector control, however, has been difficult and this led to the call for innovative strategies, including genetic approaches. Here, the authors investigated the ability of a genetically-engineered strain of Ae. aegypti to eliminate wild mosquito populations in large outdoor cages. Females of the engineered strain cannot fly and, therefore, cannot mate or take blood meals necessary to lay viable eggs. Wild females that mate with genetically-engineered males, therefore, will not produce reproductive female offspring. In this study, although population reductions were detected in 4 of 5 field cages, none of the wild mosquito populations were eliminated. A mating disadvantage for genetically-engineered males appeared to account for a significant part of their fitness disadvantage. Results suggest that this specific strain may not be effective in a large-scale release and that new strains with the same or similar transgene, but improved mating performance, may be more effective for preventing dengue. Results also indicate that large outdoor cage experiments may provide valuable insights into the progressive, stepwise assessment of genetically-engineered mosquitoes.
