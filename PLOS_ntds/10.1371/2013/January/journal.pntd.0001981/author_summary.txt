Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection and is one of the main causes of febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region. If not properly treated with antibiotics, patients often develop severe vasculitis that affects multiple organs, and the mortality rate of untreated patients reaches up to 30%. To understand the pathogenic mechanisms of the infectious disease, we characterized the functional changes of O. tsutsugamushiâ€“infected dendritic cells (DCs), which play a pivotal role in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses. The obligate intracellular bacteria efficiently infected bone marrow-derived DCs and activated the cells as measured by induced surface expression of MHC II and costimulatory molecules, secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and autophagy induction. However, the live bacteria actively escaped from host autophagosomes and the migration of infected cells was severely impaired in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo infection models. Finally, we found that MAP kinases involved in chemotactic signaling were differentially activated in O. tsutsugamushi-infected DCs. These results suggest that O. tsutsugamushi can target DCs to exploit these sentinel cells as replication reservoirs and delay or impair the functional maturation of DCs during the bacterial infection in mammals.
