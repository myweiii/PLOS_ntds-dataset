Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease with more than two million new human infections annually worldwide. Tegumentary leishmaniasis, cutaneous and mucocutaneous, is mainly caused by five Leishmania species of the Viannia complex in South America. Different species can cause disease with similar symptoms but have dissimilar prognoses and may need different therapeutic regimens. Identification of Leishmania species traditionally relies on the multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) assay, but it can only be applied to culture-positive samples and takes at least six weeks of intense laboratory work. A reliable and rapid assay for species identification can be a valuable tool. Molecular assays are the fastest and most accurate way to identify the etiological agents causing leishmaniasis. This paper describes a novel real-time PCR assay for identification of the five main species that cause tegumentary leishmaniasis in the New World. The assay correctly identified each of these five species of Leishmania directly from clinical samples. Because of its reliability, speed and simplicity, this assay could be used for species identification in routine laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis in endemic regions.
