Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness) is an almost always fatal disease affecting poor people in rural, conflict-affected areas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is difficult to diagnose. Effective treatment exists, but because diagnostic and treatment services are usually based only in hospitals, many HAT patients in rural areas are never detected. Control programmes aim periodically to extend testing services via mobile teams (active screening) but their expense and operational issues severely restrict their use. We explored the predictive value of different combinations of symptoms that were present in a treatment-seeking population to identify people infected with HAT. Through this approach, we identified a simple four-symptom referral algorithm that, if replicable, has the potential to identify one HAT patient for every ten patients referred through subsequent testing. It would identify most symptomatic HAT patients who seek treatment, if systematically applied by non-specialist healthcare workers already working in these areas. As these types of health workers are rarely included in formal HAT control efforts, teaching this algorithm also represents an opportunity to decentralise life-saving knowledge, and contribute to endemic populations' long-term empowerment and ability to help control this disease.
