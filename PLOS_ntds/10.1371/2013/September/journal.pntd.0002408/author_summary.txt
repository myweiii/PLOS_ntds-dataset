Hookworm disease, caused by the nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, is an important cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. In children, hookworm disease has been shown to potentially result in growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. In a cross-sectional survey in Mbeya region, Tanzania, we assessed the effects of possible risk factors for hookworm infection with a focus on remotely sensed ecological factors such as elevation, vegetation density, land surface temperature, and rainfall. We found that several ecological variables were significantly associated with hookworm infection. However, differing effects for these factors were estimated when performing the analyses separately for the two sites with the highest hookworm prevalence. Our study shows that effects are scale-dependent and that prediction at smaller scales using large-scale data and vice versa should be handled with caution, because regional variation can substantially influence the presence of hookworm infection.
