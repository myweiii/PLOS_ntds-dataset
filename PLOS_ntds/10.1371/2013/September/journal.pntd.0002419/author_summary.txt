Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are part of the group of neglected infectious diseases (NID) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and are associated with several adverse chronic effects on child health. Although control interventions such as periodic administration of anthelmintic drugs, health education, improved access to safe water and sanitation, among others, are acknowledged to be an important means to reduce morbidity and to achieve control, epidemiological information on prevalence status is lacking at the lowest sub-national administrative levels (municipalities, districts or provinces) in many countries thus hindering decision making regarding not only the treatment, but also the monitoring of progress in deworming coverage, the assessment of epidemiological impact on parasite prevalence and load and, therefore, the achievement of the overall public health goals. Epidemiological surveys can be expensive and require time and effort for their implementation, which could explain the low number of studies published with data on prevalence and intensity of infection in the Americas. The use of alternative methodologies, for instance those based on geographical information systems and remote sensing technologies, or of sentinel surveillance in schools may help countries in the task of collecting information and support the implementation of integrated control programs against STH.
