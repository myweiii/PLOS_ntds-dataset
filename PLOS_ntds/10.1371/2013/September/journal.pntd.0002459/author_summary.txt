Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) probably originated in the Malaysia/Indonesia region. Currently, there are no systematic studies that adequately define how it subsequently dispersed throughout Asia. In this study, we demonstrate that JEV lineages can be divided into four endemic cycles, comprising southern Asia, eastern coastal Asia, western Asia, and central Asia. In each endemic cycle the source of virus was geographically independent regardless of year, vector, and host of isolation. The southernmost region (Thailand, Vietnam, and Yunnan Province, China) was identified as the most likely source of JEV transmission from its origin to the Asian continent. Based on the evidence, we identified three probable JEV dispersal routes from south to north. Analysis of JEV population dynamics further supports this view. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of JEV evolution and dispersal and highlight its potential for introduction into non-endemic areas.
