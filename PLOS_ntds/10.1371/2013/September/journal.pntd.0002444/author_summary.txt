The island of Cebu is one of the most leprosy-endemic areas in the Philippines. Multiple drug therapy (MDT), improved BCG-vaccine coverage and active case finding have significantly lowered the adult case notification rates (CNRs), but the CNR in children (which is a proxy indicator of ongoing transmission) seems to be more static over the last decade (2000–2010). The long incubation period of leprosy, hampers determination of time of infection, however one would expect the median age of notification in children to increase when transmission decreases, as younger subjects would have a lower risk of infection: in this study no significant changes in median age were found between 2000–2010. Furthermore, leprosy seems to be mainly confined to urban areas, where nonetheless the measured decrease in CNR is much larger than in less endemic rural areas. It is unclear why the significant decline in CNR have not been accompanied by evidence of reduced transmission and why CNR seem to level off beyond a certain threshold level. We believe that more targeted approaches (e.g. focused on household contacts in urban areas) involving chemoprophylaxis and/or immunoprophylaxis, followed by a specific approach for lower CNRs, are required to tackle leprosy more directly.
