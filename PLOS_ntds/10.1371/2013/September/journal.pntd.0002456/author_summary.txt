Genetic epidemiology uses genetic data to uncover patterns of disease processes. To acquire data for these analyses, individual pathogens are collected and scored at genetic markers, and the resultant data are analyzed to infer biological patterns about the pathogen populations. In lieu of invasive sampling of adult pathogens in humans, researchers have relied on non-invasive sampling of parasite offspring (often shed in fecal samples). One potential problem with this approach is that analyses using the offspring data will be biased because many of the offspring are related and family sizes are likely to be unequal. We show that this sampling issue is relevant in a natural transmission zone in western Kenya and that it yields biases in three important parameters: genetic differentiation, inbreeding coefficients, and estimates of the amount of non-random association between loci (linkage disequilibrium). We also develop a method to remove these biases by removing the sibling structure present in the dataset. Finally, we suggest that our measure of family number, as well as other genetic measures, may be useful measures of the worm burdens in patients.
