The sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi is the vector of Leishmania major, which is a causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Old World. Despite its impact on public health, leishmaniasis remains a problem because of the substantial holes that remain in our understanding of sand fly ecology and the failure of traditional vector control methods. We conducted laboratory and field trials to demonstrate for the first time that sand flies are feeding on the feces of rodents (the reservoirs of L. major). Based on this new information, we now can identify areas where sand flies feed on rodent feces and therefore could be targeted using rodent baits containing an insecticide that passes into the feces of baited rodents. We also conducted a field trial using rodent bait containing an insecticide that circulates in the blood of baited rodents. We demonstrated that sand flies feeding on baited rodents were killed, and confirmed this finding using a tracer system that marks sand flies that have fed on baited rodents. Combined, these results show that we now have methods and materials that could be used to break the transmission cycle of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis and target sand flies closely associated with rodents.
