Dengue viral infections have become one of the most important mosquito borne viral infections in the world and are one of the major emerging infectious diseases. The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever is thought to result from a complex interplay between the virus, host genetics and host immune factors. Patients with more severe clinical disease have been shown to have higher serum IL-10 levels and IL-10 has also been shown to be associated with poorer disease outcome in other viral infections. Therefore, in this study, we proceeded to investigate the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of dengue infections and its effect on DENV-specific T cells. We found that both DENV- serotype-specific (SS) specific T cell responses and DENV-NS3 specific responses were impaired in patients with higher serum IL-10 levels. Serum IL-10 levels did not appear to have any effect on non dengue viral protein specific responses. IL-10 blockade significantly increased IFNÎ³ production, in response to DENV-NS3 peptides but not to non dengue viral proteins in acute dengue infection. Therefore, our results suggest that IL-10 could be contributing to disease pathogenesis by inhibiting DENV-specific T cell responses.
