Leptospirosis is endemic in tropical areas and seems to affect adults more often and more severely than children. Factors responsible for such differences have not been clearly established. However, host-related factors are believed to play a role in the development of severe leptospirosis. The study aimed to describe disease spectrum and outcome differences in confirmed cases in children and adolescents in New Caledonia. One major finding is the milder presentation of children compared with adolescents. Clinical and biological characteristics in adolescents are similar to adults, including occurrence of Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Further studies are required to explore age-dependant host factors, including puberty-related physiological changes.
