Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is a parasitic skin disease present in many resource-poor communities in South America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. In this setting tungiasis is associated with important morbidity. Hitherto, the only effective treatment is the surgical extraction of embedded sand fleas. In the endemic areas this is done using inappropriate sharp instruments and causes more harm than good. The prevention of the infestation is the only option to control morbidity. In this study we show that the twice daily application of a herbal repellent based on coconut-oil (Zanzarin), is highly effective in preventing sand flea disease in a heavily affected community in Madagascar. The attack rate became zero immediately after starting the application of the repellent. The degree of tungiasis associated morbidity approached zero within 10 weeks. In contrast, the availability of closed solid shoes had only a marginal protective effect; although shoes were requested by the villagers and wearing shoes was encouraged by the investigators at the beginning of the study. In a control group from the same village the attack rate, the intensity of infestation and of tungiasis-associated morbidity remained unchanged. Our study in rural Madagascar shows that effective und sustainable morbidity control is possible using a repellent derived from coconut oil.
