Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide with 40 million cases annually. We conducted a large-scale prospective cohort study of dengue virus infection in children aged 2â€“14 years in Managua, Nicaragua. The observed rate of dengue cases was 16.1 cases per 1,000 persons per year. The observed rate of dengue virus infections was 90.2 infections per 1,000 persons per year. The observed rate of dengue virus infections is similar to the rates reported in Asian cohort studies, while the rate of dengue cases was lower than that observed in Asian cohort studies. The rate of dengue cases varied more than the rate of dengue virus infections, and a clear pattern of high dengue case incidence every other year was observed. The rigorous analytic methodology used in this study allows comparison of incidence of dengue virus infections and dengue cases across studies and across different infectious diseases. Our estimates of the burden of dengue in Nicaraguan children have significant policy implications for dengue vaccines as they become available.
