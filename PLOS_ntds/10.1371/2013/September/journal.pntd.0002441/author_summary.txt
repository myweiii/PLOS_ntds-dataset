Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is potentially fatal if not treated promptly. Its diagnosis is based on the presence of parasites in spleen or bone marrow aspirates. These are invasive and risky procedures. Simple, rapid and non-invasive diagnostic tests are needed, notably in rural settings. We evaluated 2 rapid diagnostic tests, DiaMed IT LEISH and Signal KA for VL diagnosis, using splenic aspiration as the gold standard. The study was carried out in 2 hospitals located in Rift Valley province in Kenya, where VL is endemic. A total of 219 patients underwent splenic aspiration; 131 were positive and 88 were negative. DiaMed IT LEISH was able to correctly identify 117 of the positive cases, yielding a sensitivity of 89.3%, while Signal KA correctly identified 101, corresponding to a sensitivity of 77.1%. DiaMed IT LEISH was able to correctly label 79 of the 88 negative patients, yielding a specificity of 89.2%, while the Signal KA correctly labelled 84 of them, giving it a specificity of 95.5%. In conclusion, our study showed that rapid diagnostic tests can be used to diagnose VL in Kenyan rural health facilities, where splenic aspiration cannot be carried out safely.
