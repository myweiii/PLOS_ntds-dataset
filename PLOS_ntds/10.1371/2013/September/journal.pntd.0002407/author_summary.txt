Treatment of Chagas disease is complicated by poor adherence and frequent adverse drug events (ADEs). To determine the utility of pill counts and frequent monitoring to improve treatment completion and reduce ADEs, this study randomized Bolivian adults with chronic Chagas disease to either weekly or twice-weekly clinical evaluations during treatment with 60 days of benznidazole. Patient outcomes were compared to a historical cohort of patients previously treated at the same hospital with less-rigorous follow-up. This study demonstrated associations between increased follow-up and improved treatment completion, reduced ADEs, earlier documentation of ADEs, and pretreatment factors associated with benznidazole toxicity. It also validated pill-counts and demonstrated feasibility of phone-based clinical evaluations among rural Bolivians.
