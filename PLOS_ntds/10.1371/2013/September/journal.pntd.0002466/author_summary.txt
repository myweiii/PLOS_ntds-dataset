Chagas disease is a parasitic disease of major importance in the Americas, transmitted by triatomine insects. Integrated control interventions targeting a combination of factors associated with the presence of the insect vectors are increasingly investigated for improved control. Here we identified the factors associated with the seasonal intrusion of triatomine vectors in houses from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, by studying the characteristics of 308 houses from 3 villages. The presence of triatomine vectors was associated with the presence of dogs, chickens and potential bug refuges, such as rock piles, and the proximity of houses to vegetation at the periphery of the villages and to public light sources. Thus, factors favoring seasonal intrusion of triatomines appear different from those favoring their domiciliation. Integrated control interventions based on this Ecohealth perspective should focus on several of the factors identified in this study to achieve effective and sustainable vector control.
