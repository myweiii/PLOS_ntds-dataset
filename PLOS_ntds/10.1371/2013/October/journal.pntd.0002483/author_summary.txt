Chikungunya is one of the neglected diseases. It has only attracted attention during outbreaks, in particular, the large epidemics in the Indian Ocean in 2005â€“2006. To our knowledge, there has never been any surveillance to determine the transmission of this virus among humans in non-outbreak settings. Such surveillance is particularly important because it will provide a better estimate of the disease burden and valuable information on how this virus is maintained outside outbreaks. Our study, conducted between 2000 and 2008 in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, yielded several important findings: 1. Chikungunya is an important cause of fever among adults in Bandung, Indonesia. 2. The clinical symptoms are mostly mild and short lasting. 3. In addition to previously described epidemiological features involving episodic outbreaks, it is also continuously transmitted throughout the year. 4. A few patients may have experienced more than one chikungunya virus infection. 5. Only the Asian genotype was found and not the East Central South African genotype that was responsible for the 2005 outbreak in the Indian Ocean. 6. The persistence of IgM for a long period after illness may complicate the interpretation of laboratory results.
