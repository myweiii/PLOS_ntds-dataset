Vivax malaria is widely prevalent, predominantly in Asia and South America. There were 390 million cases reported in 2009. Worldwide, in the same year, 2.85 billion people were at risk of infection. Plasmodium vivax is not limited to tropical and subtropical regions; it also appears in temperate areas. We previously examined the characteristics of P. vivax in South Korea, a temperate area, temporally, using 10 microsatellite DNA (a short tandem repeat DNA sequence) in the parasite genome and found the population to have low genetic diversity and a low recombination rate in comparison to tropical areas. In the present study, we examine the successive changes of the South Korean populations from 1994 to 2008, and the reasons for the lack of success in eliminating vivax malaria in this country. We found that, in spite of a low recombination rate, outbreeding between different genotypes seemed to increase gradually, and that the genetic composition of the population drastically changed during 2002 and 2003. This suggests that the parasite is continually introduced from other populations, probably from North Korea. The present study also demonstrated the utility of polymorphic DNA markers of P. vivax for the estimation of the transmission situation in endemic areas.
