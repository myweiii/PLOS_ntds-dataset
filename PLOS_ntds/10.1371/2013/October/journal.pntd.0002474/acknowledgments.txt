We would like to express our gratitude to all members of the SCORE secretariat for continuous advice, input, and support for our study. The Zanzibar Neglected Tropical Diseases Program acknowledges the WHO for the donation of praziquantel to cover biannual preventive chemotherapy of the population for the next 5 years and SCI for covering the treatment implementation costs. Moreover, we particularly thank our intervention and survey teams on Unguja and Pemba for their help and motivation to combat schistosomiasis on Zanzibar.
