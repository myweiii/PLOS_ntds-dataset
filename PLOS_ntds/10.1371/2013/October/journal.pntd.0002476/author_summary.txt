Chagas or American Trypanosomiasis is a disease that affects around 8â€“10 million people in Latin America, and can be transmitted by congenital infection. In areas where the vector insect and blood transfusions are controlled, this mode of transmission is epidemiologically important, as 15,000 Trypanosoma cruzi-infected children are born each year. Parasitological methods are available to detect T. cruzi but our results suggest that more sensitive diagnostic methods should be developed, as not all newborns have high parasite burdens to be detected by microscopy. If congenital infected babies are promptly diagnosed after delivery they can be cured, as the trypanocidal treatment is very effective in children and with no significant side effects.
