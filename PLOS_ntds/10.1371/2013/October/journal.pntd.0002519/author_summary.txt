The genus Bothrops inflicts the vast majority of snakebites in Central and South America and is responsible for 90% of snake envenomations in Brazil. Envenomations are characterized by prominent local effects, including edema and necrosis, and by systemic manifestations such as hemorrhage, coagulopathy and acute renal failure. Several components have been isolated from Bothrops venoms, and the snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are key enzymes contributing to the high toxicity of the venoms. Previously, we analyzed the pro-inflammatory properties of snake venoms from the genus Bothrops and demonstrated that several of them were potent activators of the Complement (C) system. C3a, C4a and C5a were generated in venom-treated sera not only through C-activation but also by direct cleavage of C-components. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized a metalloproteinase from Bothrops pirajai snake venom, named here as C-SVMP, which interferes with all three complement pathways, generating potent pro-inflammatory fragments, such as C3a, C4a and C5a. Our data suggest that C-activation by Bothrops pirajai venom is due to activity of an SVMP, which may play a role in the progression of symptoms that follow envenomation.
