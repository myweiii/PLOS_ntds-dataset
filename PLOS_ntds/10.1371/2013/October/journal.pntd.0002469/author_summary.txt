Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate receptors that are emerging as central effectors in the control of infections and inflammatory pathologies. NLRP3 is the most studied member of inflammasomes with established role in the control of bacterial and viral infections. This manuscript describes original studies on the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the control of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a chronic infectious illness that affects millions of people in the world. T. cruzi activates NLRP3 inflammasome by a mechanism involving cathepsin B. NLRP3−/− and caspase1−/− mice display high parasitemia during acute phase of T. cruzi infection, which could be explained by a severe defect in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and in the impairment of their macrophages to control intracellular parasites. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase-1, but not the neutralization of IL-1β and IL-18, the best-studied caspase-1 substrates, abrogated NO production by WT and MyD88−/− macrophages and rendered them as susceptible to T. cruzi infection as NLRP3−/− macrophages. Together, our results indicate a caspase-1-dependent and IL-1β and IL-18-independent pathway for NO production as a new effector mechanism played by NLRP3 to control T. cruzi infection.
