Human African Trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a fatal disease restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. The treatment relies on chemotherapy exclusively. Drug resistance in T. brucei was investigated mainly in laboratory-selected lines and found to be linked to mutations in transporters. The adenosine transporter TbAT1 and the aquaglyceroporin TbAQP2 have been implicated in sensitivity to melarsoprol and pentamidine. Mutations in these transporters rendered trypanosomes less susceptible to either drug. Here we analyze T. brucei isolates from the field, focusing on isolates from patients where melarsoprol treatment has failed. We genotype those isolates to test for mutations in TbAQP2 or TbAT1, and phenotype for sensitivity to pentamidine and melarsoprol. Six T. b. gambiense isolates were found to carry mutations in TbAQP2. These isolates stemmed from relapse patients and exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity to pentamidine and melarsoprol as determined in cell culture. These findings indicate that mutations in TbAQP2 are present in the field, correlate with loss of sensitivity to pentamidine and melarsoprol, and might be responsible for melarsoprol treatment failures.
