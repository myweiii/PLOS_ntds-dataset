Resource constraints prevent adequate surveillance of neglected infectious diseases such as rabies in developing countries leading to a poor understanding of the disease burden and limited evidence with which to design effective control measures. We utilized a low cost mobile-phone based system to carry out the first prospective surveillance of dog-bites and rabies in Pakistan by screening all patients presenting to nine emergency rooms in eight cities over a two-year period. We found a large number of dog-bite cases (nearly a third of which were severe based on a World Health Organization classification) with substantial geographical variability in time to presentation as well as health-seeking behavior following dog-bites across the reporting sites. Spatial analyses of collected data from Karachi, Pakistan's largest city identified areas with increased risk of dog-bite exposure, which has implications for the design of necessary control measures such as dog vaccination. While mobile phone based technologies have the potential to address limitations in disease surveillance in developing countries, the cost-effectiveness of large scale implementations of such strategies need to be explored and further evaluated where appropriate.
