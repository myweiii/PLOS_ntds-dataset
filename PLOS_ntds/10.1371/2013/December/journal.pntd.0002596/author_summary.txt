Schistosomiasis causes severe health problems and economic losses in transmission areas in the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. In regions where treatment is available, such as Brazil, chemotherapy has led to decreased morbidity of the disease. However, parasite resistance to drugs is of general concern. Drug resistance is known in some species of helminths, and there are reports of decreased susceptibility in schistosomes, although such reports are not widespread. The impact of consecutive drug treatment on parasite populations at transmission sites can be evaluated by the genetic makeup of the population. For example, the decrease in the genetic diversity of these populations upon chemotherapy can be interpreted as the selection of less sensitive parasites. In this study, we used a laboratory mouse model of schistosomiasis that was treated with increasing amounts of praziquantel (the drug of choice for human treatment) until we reached the highest dose of 3Ã—300 mg PZQ/kg. Our results clearly indicate that the parasite population showed a decrease in genetic diversity after measuring allelic and genetic diversity. This observation confirms that drug selection occurred in this population. The work highlights the need for genetic monitoring of populations under drug pressure, resistance mechanisms, and the dynamics of parasite populations upon treatment.
