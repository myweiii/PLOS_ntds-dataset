Buruli ulcer (BU) is a necrotizing bacterial infection of skin, subcutaneous tissue and bone, caused by an environmental pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. BU is considered as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases with a poorly known global prevalence, and mainly affects remote rural African communities. Data on the burden of BU disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are scanty. The present study is the first exhaustive survey in DRC on the frequency of BU in the community. The survey demonstrated large variations in prevalence between health areas in Songololo Territory. Moreover, our data showed that the BU cases in the hospital-based reporting system reflect only the tip of the iceberg of the true active BU prevalence. Indeed, only one in thirteen active BU cases was notified at the hospital at Kimpese in the 6â€“8 months prior to the survey. The present data will serve as a baseline assessment for the evaluation of control interventions in the study area, and, more generally, this study aims to raise awareness about the issue of underdetection of BU and the importance of increasing access to diagnosis and care. As such, we hope the study will contribute to improved control of BU.
