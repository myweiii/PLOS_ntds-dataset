Both brucellosis and tuberculosis are systemic infections which may involve any organ. When they affect specific locations, extrapulmonary tuberculosis and brucellosis cause symptoms that are very difficult to differentiate clinically. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and Brucella spp are slow-growing microorganisms whose culture and isolation require several days to weeks. Methods based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have proven more sensitive than conventional culture, for both extrapulmonary tuberculosis and focal complications of brucellosis. Multiplex real time PCR is a variant of PCR in which two or more target sequences can be simultaneously amplified in a single tube. We developed and evaluated the results of several multiplex real-time PCR strategies for the rapid differential diagnosis between extrapulmonary tuberculosis and focal complications of brucellosis. Multiplex real-time PCR targeting of SenX3-RegX3+IS711 sequences showed a sensitivity of 89.1% and a specificity of 100% when applied to 91 clinical specimens. These findings provide solid evidence suggesting that multiplex real-time PCR could be a useful tool to reduce the time required for the differential diagnosis between extrapulmonary tuberculosis and complicated brucellosis, thereby improving prognosis.
