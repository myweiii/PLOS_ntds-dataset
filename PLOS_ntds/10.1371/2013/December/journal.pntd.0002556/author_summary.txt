Chagas disease is a parasitic protozoan that affects the poorest population in the world, causing a high mortality and morbidity. As a result of highly toxic and long-term treatments, the discovery of novel, safe and more efficacious drugs is essential. Natural products isolated from plants are commonly used as drug prototypes or precursors to treat parasitic diseases. As part of our investigation of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora, the present study was undertaken in order to determine the antitrypanosomal effects of the soulamarin, a coumarin isolated from the stem bark of Callophyllum brasiliense (Clusiaceae), against Trypanossoma cruzi. This study moreover investigated the lethal action of soulamarin towards the parasite. Considering the obtained results, secondary metabolites of plants affecting the bioenergetic system as soulamarin may contribute as scaffolds for the design of novel and selective drug candidates for neglected diseases, mainly Chagas disease.
