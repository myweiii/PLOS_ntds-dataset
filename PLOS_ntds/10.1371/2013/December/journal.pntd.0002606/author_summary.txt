Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) has afflicted more than 35 million people in world and approximately 15 million in China, creating a socio-economic burden in epidemic regions. The infection of C. sinensis is highly related to cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been documented that excretory/secretory products of C. sinensis (CsESPs) involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Csseverin, expressed at life stage of egg, metacercaria and adult worm, was a component of CsESPs. In the current study, we characterized the properties of Csseverin such as sequence signature, actin and calciumion binding activity. In addition, we demonstrated that Csseverin could cause apoptotic inhibition in spontaneously apoptotic human HCC cell line PLC cells by using morphological analysis, detection of the apoptosis-associated change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay. Our study provided an exploratory sight view of mechanism involved in progress of carcinoma associated with the infection of C. sinensis and Csseverin might exacerbate the process of C. sinensis infected HCC patients.
