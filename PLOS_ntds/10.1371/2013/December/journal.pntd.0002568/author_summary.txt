This study applies co-authorship network analysis to generate baseline information about the patterns and structure of Canada's neglected tropical disease (NTD) publication activity and research network. Researchers, public and private funders, not-for-profit organizations, and policy makers may use the methodology or study findings for targeting, monitoring, and assessing Canada's contribution to a research field that is ready for attention and advancements. Future studies could use the findings to comparatively analyze the emergence of specific NTD research amongst institutional networks or further examine attributes and mechanisms that support and impede Canadian involvement in NTD research production and collaborative Northâ€“South research partnerships.
