Trypanosomiasis is a disease also known as sleeping sickness in humans (Human African Trypanosomiasis) and nagana in animals (Animal African Trypanosomiasis). This disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. Tsetse flies are responsible for the transmission of these parasites. Trypanosoma congolense is the main causative agent of nagana in cattle. The clinical signs of the disease have been linked to the presence of an enzyme called trans-sialidase. Interestingly, the enzyme alternates in different forms in the mammalian and the insect vector. Previous knowledge had shown that the parasite requires the enzyme for survival in the fly vector. Our current work has revealed other forms of the enzyme that could be essential for the persistence of the disease in mammalian and vector hosts. These enzymes, though similar in structural architecture, show differences in their activities that could be key in delineating their individual roles in the pathophysiology of the disease.
