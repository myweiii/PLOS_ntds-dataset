The discovery and development of new drugs to improve the treatment of BU is greatly hampered by the slow growth rate of the organism, which requires up to 3 months to form countable colonies on solid media. Here, we engineered a virulent reporter strain of M. ulcerans with intrinsic bioluminescence to enable serial, real-time, non-invasive in vivo monitoring of viable bacterial counts and demonstrate its utility for high-throughput in vitro and in vivo screening of antibiotic efficacy using a panel of anti-mycobacterial drugs with various mechanisms of action. We show: 1) that a drug's in vitro activity against M. ulcerans is detectable in real time after as little as 2 days of exposure, and 2) that a drug's in vivo activity against M. ulcerans is detectable in as little as 1 week through rapid, serial, non-invasive assessment in live mice performed with a benchtop luminometer. This method promises dramatic reductions in time and effort as well as requirements for animals, compounds and other supplies. We believe such a strain is capable of transforming drug discovery and development efforts for BU.
