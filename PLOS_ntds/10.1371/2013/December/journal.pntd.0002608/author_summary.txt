In the developing world, over 230 million people are infected with parasitic Schistosoma worms. Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium are the most abundant species in Africa, affecting the liver and urinary tract, respectively. Both parasites are spread through infested freshwater. Although it is known that the disease occurs focally within countries or regions, little is known on its geographic spread on a smaller scale. Here, we examined 599 people from a community in northern Senegal for S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections and related abnormalities of the liver and urinary tract. We recorded where they lived and where they had water contact and visualized this information in geographical maps. The study showed that each Schistosoma species clustered in a different section of the community, and that liver abnormalities were more severe near the mostly used water contact site. So far, this is the first study to investigate the geographical spread of both species in a single community, and the first to map schistosomal disease on such a small scale. Further studies are needed to confirm and explain these results. They could contribute to a better understanding of schistosomiasis and have important consequences for the control and elimination of this disease.
