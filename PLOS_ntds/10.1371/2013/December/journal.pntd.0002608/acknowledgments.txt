We gratefully thank the community of Diokhor Tack and the village chief Daouda Pene, for their hospitality and participation in this study. This study would not have been possible without the field workers in Richard Toll, Abdoulaye Yague, Mankeur Diop, Moussa Wade and Ngary Sy, who assisted in the sample collection and microscopic analysis. We would like to thank Boubacar Fofana and Ahmed Dieng for their help with the ultrasound examinations, and the medical staff of the Health Centre in Richard Toll for their support. Furthermore, we greatly appreciated discussions with Guy Hendrickx and Els Ducheyne from Avia-GIS (Zoersel, Belgium), and with Sophie Vanwambeke from Universit√© Catholique de Louvain (Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium), as well as advice from Martin Kulldorff, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (Boston, Massachusetts, USA).
