The amino acid asparagine is important not only for protein biosynthesis, but also for nitrogen homeostasis. Asparagine synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of this amino acid. There are two forms of asparagine synthetase, A and B. The presence of type A in trypanosomes, and its absence in humans, makes this protein a potential drug target. Trypanosomes are responsible for serious parasitic diseases that rely on limited drug therapeutic options for control. In our study we present a functional characterization of trypanosomes asparagine synthetase A. We describe that Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi type A enzymes are able to use either ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen donor, within the conversion of aspartate into asparagine. Furthermore, we show that asparagine synthetase A knockdown renders Trypanosoma brucei auxotrophic to asparagine. Overall, this study demonstrates that interfering with asparagine metabolism represents a way to control parasite growth and infectivity.
