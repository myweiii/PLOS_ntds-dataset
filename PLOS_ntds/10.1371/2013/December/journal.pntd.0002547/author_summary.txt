There is a need to develop diagnostic methods for parasitic infections specifically designed for use in resource-deficient situations. Worm infections are common in many poor countries and even if repeated treatment can be arranged at low cost, diagnostics and identification of treatment failures demand resources not easily available. With the proliferation of mobile phones, data transfer networks and digital microscopy applications the stage is set for alternatives to conventional microscopy in endemic areas. Our aim was to show, as proof of concept, that it is possible to achieve point-of-care diagnostics by an inexpensive mini-microscope for direct visualization on a display and remote diagnostics by computer vision. The results show that parasitic worm eggs can be recognized by on-chip imaging using a webcam stripped off the optics. Images of eggs from the blood fluke S. haematobium present in urine of an infected patient could be interpreted visually and by computer vision. The method offers both an inexpensive alternative to conventional microscopy and diagnostic assistance by computer vision.
