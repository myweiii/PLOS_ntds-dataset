The global strategy for leprosy has moved patient care to general health services with the aim of improving access to treatment. We suspected that leprosy patients with a common complication, leprosy reactions, are not being diagnosed and treated promptly in integrated services. Leprosy reactions cause nerve damage and, if not treated early, can cause significant disability. We interviewed 75 patients with a leprosy reaction in Nepal, a country with a fully-integrated leprosy service. Patients were experiencing average delays of 2.9 months between developing leprosy reactions and starting treatment. Many required extended courses of treatment, an inpatient stay or experienced a recurrence of their reaction. Patients also continue to attend specialist services for both diagnosis and follow-up. Patient care could be improved by utilising specialist knowledge for training and the management of complex cases. Health care workers and patients need to be educated about leprosy reactions. A wider implication of the study is that health policy-makers need to be cautious not to over-simplify medical conditions when restructuring services.
