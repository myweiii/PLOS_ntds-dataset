Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is the world's second-leading cause of disability and causes limb lymphedema and elephantiasis in up to 15 million people and lymphedema or hydrocele in over 40 million people, worldwide. A massive global effort has been undertaken to eliminate LF as a public health problem. LF elimination is based on two pillars: (1) interruption of transmission and (2) treatment of clinical disease among those already affected. The Indian NGO, Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA), has been providing community-based treatment of lymphedema in Khurda District, Orissa State, India, since 2007. We evaluated the impact of this treatment program on the participating patients' perceived disability using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II). After two years of enrollment in the program, patients had significantly lower levels of perceived disability. We found that being employed and time enrolled in the program were associated with significant reductions in disability scores. Compared to baseline, patients enrolled in the program for at least 12 months reported 2.5 fewer days of work lost in the previous 30 days due to their lymphedema. These findings indicate that participation in a community-based lymphedema management program can reduce patients' disability and prevent days of work lost due to lymphedema.
