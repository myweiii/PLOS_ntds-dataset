Solid evidence is needed to decide how to treat conditions. In the case of cutaneous leishmaniasis, the diversity of clinical conditions, combined with the heterogeneity and weaknesses of the methodologies used in clinical trials, make it difficult to derive robust conclusions as to which treatments should be used. There also other imperatives - ethical (not exposing patients to treatments that cannot be assessed adequately) and financial (optimize use of limited resources for a neglected condition). This paper is meant to provide clinical investigators with guidance for the design, conduct, analysis and report of clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of treatments of this condition.
