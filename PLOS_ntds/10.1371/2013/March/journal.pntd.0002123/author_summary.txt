Schistosomiasis japonica is one of the serious infectious diseases causing problems in public health in People's Republic of China (P.R. China). The prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica is easily rebounding in the lake regions due to unique environmental settings. By considering the importance in assessing the risk factors for transmission of schistosomiasis, we conducted an epidemiologic investigation of schistosomiasis in Jiangling County, a lake region of P.R. China. Results showed that the top risk factors included integration of water contact history and infection history, infection times, main lifestyle of water contact, main recreation of water contact, etc., illustrated by both back-propagation artificial neural network and multivariable logistic regression approaches. It was found that the population at age 15 or younger having one or two times of infections was the high-risk group in the study settings. We concluded that socioeconomic factors are far more important than environmental factors in the transmission of schistosomiasis at local settings or in a small scale in Jiangling County, P.R. China.
