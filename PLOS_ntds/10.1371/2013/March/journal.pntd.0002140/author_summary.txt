Balantidium coli is a pathogenic ciliate occurring in various hosts, including primates. Balantidiasis is considered a neglected disease with zoonotic potential and it is associated with pigs as reservoirs. Although it is considered to be rare, a high prevalence of B. coli persists in tropical and subtropical areas. The infection can cause symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to fulminating dysentery. Recently, balantidiasis has appeared to be a serious problem in immunocompromised persons. Although a chapter about balantidiasis is included in almost every parasitology textbook, many aspects of the occurrence of these ciliates in mammals, including humans, remain unknown. As balantidiasis can pose a serious health problem, a better understanding of this organism has important practical implications. We performed an extensive evaluation of genetic diversity in B. coli based on samples from non-human primates, together with comparative material from pigs and reference sequences. We find that the diversity of the cyst-forming ciliates in non-human primates is broader than expected. This discovery poses novel questions about the real spectrum of intestinal ciliates occurring in humans, and might explain unknown factors in the epidemiology and pathogenicity of ciliate infections.
