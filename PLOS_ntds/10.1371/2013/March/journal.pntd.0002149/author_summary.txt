Partial human immunity to infection with trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma is associated with IgE specific to adult worm-derived antigens and eosinophils. Treatment studies of Schistosoma infection allow us to examine the temporal features of the immune response post-antigen exposure, their inter-dependence and their relationship with re-infection levels. Here the boosted levels of the cytokine IL-5, measured at 24-hrs post-treatment of a Malian cohort, aged 5â€“40 yrs, were found to be significantly associated with pre-treatment levels of IgE to worm-derived antigens and eosinophil number, linking this rapid response to two of the main correlates of human immunity to these parasites. The IL-5 levels at 24-hr were in turn related to increased eosinophil counts and SWA-IgE levels at 9-wks post-treatment. In line with previous studies SWA-IgE was associated with resistance to re-infection. The study therefore identifies temporal relationships between immune mediators prior to and post treatment induced antigen exposure that are associated with resistance to re-infection.
