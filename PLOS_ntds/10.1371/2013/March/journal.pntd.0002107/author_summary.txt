Dengue is the most common insect-borne viral disease globally. The continued absence of an effective therapy stems from an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis, of which the host response to infection is thought to play a central role. While previous studies have described the changes in total gene expression with dengue virus infection, they have not been able to provide any information on the subtle variations of the host RNA. These variations lead to the production of gene isoforms that can have a profound effect on gene function. In the current study, we have used the newly developed technique of RNA sequencing to more accurately interrogate the variations in the host RNA after infection with a wild-type dengue virus or its attenuated derivative. Findings from this study show that there is an extensive amount of previously uncharacterized variation in host RNA response to dengue infection. The response to infection with the wild-type dengue also differs significantly from infection with the vaccine strain. This suggests that variations in the host RNA comprise a part of the host response to viral infection that is in large part evaded by wild-type dengue viruses.
