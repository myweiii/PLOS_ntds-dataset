The emergence of resistance to the available drugs against cutaneous leishmaniasis emphasizes the need of new chemotherapeutic approaches. Cysteine proteases from Leishmania are important virulence factors and, therefore, interesting drug targets. Studies on inhibitors against these enzymes during Leishmania major infection in mice had shown that host equivalents of these proteases are also affected, namely cathepsin B and cathepsin L. The inhibition of cathepsin B resulted in immune-mediated protection, while inhibition of cathepsin L caused susceptibility to the parasite. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cathepsin deficiency on the signals used by dendritic cells to orchestrate the T helper (Th)-mediated immune response against L. major and the control of parasite proliferation within infected macrophages. The results demonstrate that cathepsin B-deficient dendritic cells express higher levels of the antigen-presenting MHC class II molecules than WT and cathepsin L-deficient cells. Surprisingly, dendritic cells and macrophages deficient for cathepsin B showed higher expression of the protective Th1-inducing cytokine IL-12. Therefore, we propose a novel role of this protease as a regulator of cytokine expression. Altogether, these findings suggest that cathepsin B down-regulates the Th1 response to L. major, and, in its absence, antigen-presenting cells express signals protecting against the parasite.
