Hookworm's infection is a health problem that affects areas of poverty worldwide. Nutritional diseases, including dietary protein deficiency are also prevalent in those areas. It is well known that nutritional status can influence parasite infection, reducing host responses to infection. However, the influence of nutritional status and Hookworm's infection is less explored. Our goal was to study the consequences of coexistence of low-protein malnutrition and Hookworm's infection in hamsters that are good models of this infection. For that, we established a model of protein malnutrition by feeding hamsters on standard diet or isocaloric, low-protein diet for 50 days. Hamsters fed on those diets were infected with hookworm's larvae for assessment of biochemical and parasitological parameters compared to non-infected controls. Our results confirm that malnutrition was installed, as suggested by low antibody response and by increased fecal lipid excretion in malnourished group. Regarding Hookworm's infection, animals fed low-protein diet presented a more severe infection, with higher number of worms recovered in intestine. Nonetheless, egg production was reduced in malnourished hamsters, suggesting that protein restriction was determinant on egg formation. These results confirm the hypothesis that host nutritional status greatly influences the course of Hookworm's infection.
