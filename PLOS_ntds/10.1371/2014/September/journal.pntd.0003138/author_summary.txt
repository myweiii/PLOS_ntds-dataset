Transmission of dengue virus has long been studied in Kamphaeng Phet, Northern Thailand, but how cases are related in time and space is still unclear, as is the role of human movement in generating these patterns. Because of these knowledge gaps, public health officials cannot make educated decisions on how to target vector control interventions and mechanisms of virus dispersal are not known. We mapped the homes of dengue cases admitted to the main hospital in the province capital from 1994â€“2008 and quantified the spatial correlation between them. We found an almost three times greater chance that cases from the same month came from the same village than expected, given the overall distribution of cases. Some clustering was also observed between cases in neighboring villages with the overall epidemics experienced by neighboring communities also more correlated than epidemics in villages farther apart. The short-term clustering observed within individual villages implies that effective spatially targeted interventions deployed within villages may reduce infection risk. As the distance between neighboring communities exceeds the typical flight range of the dengue vector, these findings also suggest a potential role for human movement in driving the wider spread of the virus.
