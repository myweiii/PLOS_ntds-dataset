Mass drug administration (MDA) efforts with ivermectin-based regimens for onchocerciasis and for lymphatic filariasis in Africa have been suspended in certain areas that are co-endemic for Loa loa infection. This is due to the serious adverse events (encephalopathy and death) that can develop following ivermectin administration in individuals with very high circulating levels of Loa loa microfilariae (mf) (>30,000 mf/ml). Currently thick-blood smears are performed to quantify the mf levels that are neither rapid nor high throughput. To develop a point of care (POC) strategy for rapid and high throughput mf quantification, a repurposed handheld automated counter (HHAC) was assessed and shown to be an efficient POC tool to identify individuals with very high Loa loa microfilaraemia in a manner sufficient to be used as part of a Test and (not) Treat (TNT) program in an effort to restart the suspended MDA programs while preventing severe adverse neurologic events.
