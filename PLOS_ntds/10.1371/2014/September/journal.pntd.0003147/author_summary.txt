Bunyavirus infections cause febrile illnesses of varying severity worldwide; however, despite their public health importance most remain relatively unstudied. In order to clarify the genetic relationships among African orthobunyaviruses associated with human infection, we have sequenced multiple strains of Bwamba (BWAV), Pongola (PGAV) and Nyando virus (NDV). Based on genetic analysis we showed that, while different BWAV and PGAV virus strains are closely related, NDV strains were highly variable and warrant classification as two distinct virus species. In addition, sequencing of the previously unclassified Moju√≠ dos Campos (MDCV) and Kaeng Khoi (KKV) viruses showed that both are closely related to NDV. This was unexpected considering that these viruses were isolated in South America and Southeast Asia, respectively, and are mainly associated with bats. Further, our experiments also indicated that BWAV and PGAV, as well as NDV, MDCV and KKV, are able to infect both bat and mosquito cell lines, suggesting that ecological studies focusing on these potential host and vector species are warranted. In the future, the availability of complete genetic information for these viruses, together with an understanding of their genetic relationships, will aid in better defining the distribution and public health impact of these viruses.
