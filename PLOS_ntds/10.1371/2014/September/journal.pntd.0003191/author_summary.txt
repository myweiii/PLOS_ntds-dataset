Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease, often displayed as severe acute febrile illness. It is caused by infection with O. tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium. Every year, approximately one million people are infected globally, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Mechanistic studies of host immune responses are limited, partially due to the limited availability of suitable animal models and research facilities. We demonstrated here selective suppression in innate immune regulators, but activation of inflammatory cytokines, during the first few days of O. tsutsugamushi infection in mice. Importantly, these immune alterations correlated with acute tissue damage, disease progression, and animal death. As the first report describing dysregulation in innate immune responses in a murine model of severe scrub typhus, this study improves our understanding of disease mechanisms and opens new avenues for the exploration of treatment options.
