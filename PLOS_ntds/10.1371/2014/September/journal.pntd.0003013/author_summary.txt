Bilharzia is a parasitic disease endemic in many parts of the world. The schistosoma parasite that causes Bilharzia infects humans but uses a fresh water snail as a secondary host. These two organisms have co-evolved together, and as such the parasite will have mechanisms to overcome the host defences. Understanding this delicately balanced relationship is fundamental to controlling or eradicating the disease. We have studied how this parasite can influence how the DNA within the snail behaves. We have shown snail genes have specific locations within the cell nuclei. Further, we have revealed that specific snail genes related to a schistosome infection change to a new non-random nuclear location as they are turned on or up-regulated. We have snail strains that are susceptible or resistant to the infection of parasites and we can also take live parasites and make them unable to complete an infection by irradiating them. In this unique study, we have shown a gene that is involved in stress pathways moves to a new nuclear location and becomes turned on, but only in susceptible snails, infected with fully functional parasite. Our data suggest that this gene is regulated by the parasite, which has control over the host's DNA, so that the gene is moved to an area where it can be actively expressed. We have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby the spatial organization of a host organism is interfered with by a pathogen. This type of control is probably found in other host-pathogen relationships.
