In Mozambique many parasitic diseases persist as a result of low living standards and environmental contamination from human and animal fecal waste. Parasites undermine the health of Mozambique's poorest inhabitants and will be difficult to eradicate without a considerable improvement in the sanitary conditions. Many helminthic infections are undiagnosed because of the need to employ immunologic and image analysis methods, both of which are very costly. We want to know the scope of these co-infections, their possible interaction with HIV, and the course of the disease. We have therefore investigated the seroprevalence against four tisular helminth diseases (cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis and echinococcosis) in a group of HIV infected patients, obtaining data previously absent and relevant conclusions that will enable us to continue working in this field and design strategies in order to improve the quality of life of our people.
