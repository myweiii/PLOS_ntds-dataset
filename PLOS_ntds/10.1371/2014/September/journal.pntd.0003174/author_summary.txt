Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected systemic fungal infection prevalent mostly in South America. Serological tests have long been established as rapid, simple and inexpensive tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of PCM. However, different protocols and reagents are used. We compared here the performance of six Brazilian reference centers for serological diagnosis of PCM. Each center provided 30 sera of PCM patients, with positive high, intermediate and low titers, which were defined as the “reference” titers. Each center then applied its serological routine test to the 150 sera from the other five centers blindly as regards to the “reference” titers. Surprisingly, all centers exhibited a high rate of discordances (mean of 31 discordant scores in 150 sera tested). When the scores given by one center to their own sera were compared with the scores given to their sera by the other centers, a high rate of major discordances was found (a mean of 14.8 sera in 30 presented a discordance with at least one other center). We concluded that there are inconsistencies among the laboratories that can potentially result in conflicting information regarding the patient's treatment. Renewed efforts should be promoted to improve standardization of the serological diagnosis of PCM.
