    "Abstract": "Cyclic AMP-activated intestinal Cl\u2212 secretion plays an important role in pathogenesis of cholera. This study aimed to investigate the effect of diclofenac on cAMP-activated Cl\u2212 secretion, its underlying mechanisms, and possible application in the treatment of cholera. Diclofenac inhibited cAMP-activated Cl\u2212 secretion in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells with IC50 of \u223c20 \u00b5M. The effect required no cytochrome P450 enzyme-mediated metabolic activation. Interestingly, exposures of T84 cell monolayers to diclofenac, either in apical or basolateral solutions, produced similar degree of inhibitions. Analyses of the apical Cl\u2212 current showed that diclofenac reversibly inhibited CFTR Cl\u2212 channel activity (IC50\u223c10 \u00b5M) via mechanisms not involving either changes in intracellular cAMP levels or CFTR channel inactivation by AMP-activated protein kinase and protein phosphatase. Of interest, diclofenac had no effect on Na+-K+ ATPases and Na+-K+-Cl\u2212 cotransporters, but inhibited cAMP-activated basolateral K+ channels with IC50 of \u223c3 \u00b5M. In addition, diclofenac suppressed Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 channels, inwardly rectifying Cl\u2212 channels, and Ca2+-activated basolateral K+ channels. Furthermore, diclofenac (up to 200 \u00b5M; 24 h of treatment) had no effect on cell viability and barrier function in T84 cells. Importantly, cholera toxin (CT)-induced Cl\u2212 secretion across T84 cell monolayers was effectively suppressed by diclofenac. Intraperitoneal administration of diclofenac (30 mg/kg) reduced both CT and Vibrio cholerae-induced intestinal fluid secretion by \u223c70% without affecting intestinal fluid absorption in mice. Collectively, our results indicate that diclofenac inhibits both cAMP-activated and Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 secretion by inhibiting both apical Cl\u2212 channels and basolateral K+ channels in intestinal epithelial cells. Diclofenac may be useful in the treatment of cholera and other types of secretory diarrheas resulting from intestinal hypersecretion of Cl\u2212."
