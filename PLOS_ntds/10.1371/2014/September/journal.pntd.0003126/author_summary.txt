Schistosomiasis is one of the most widespread of all human parasitic diseases, Schistosoma mansoni being the most important species causing human intestinal schistosomiasis. The diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on parasitological and serological methods, but they are not effective in detecting S. mansoni infections in the acute stage of the disease. New diagnostic tools to detect the disease during the first weeks would be desirable, permitting early treatment and preventing the pathology associated with chronic infections. An approach is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique, which can amplify DNA with high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal conditions. DNA amplification and reading of results require minimum equipment, thus the technique has great potential for use in diagnosis of neglected tropical diseases. In our study, we developed and evaluated a LAMP assay for the early detection of S. mansoni DNA in stool samples from mice experimentally infected with the parasite. The results indicated that our LAMP assay is specific, sensitive and cost-effective in detecting S. mansoni DNA in stool samples as soon as one week post-infection, when parasitological and serological methods are not effective. The assay has the potential to be developed further as a field diagnostic tool for use in schistosomiasis-endemic areas.
