Caves have enduring appeal to humans, and their lure in Central America includes tourism, religious ceremonies and shelter. The major Chagas disease vector in this region, Triatoma dimidiata, inhabits caves throughout its range. We challenge the assumption that cave-dwelling vectors are not important for human transmission by determining blood meal sources of vectors collected in caves from three locations that differ in the activities of humans at the caves, and link the results to cultural practices that differ among locations. Seventy percent of cave-collected vectors were positive for human DNA, and fed on 10 additional vertebrates with relationships to humans varying from companion animal (dog), food animals (pig, sheep/goat), wild animals (duck, bat, opossum) to commensal animals (mouse, rat). Feeding sources relate to human activities that vary among locations, for example, human and food animals were the main sources in Cahab√≥n caves, located within deforested areas that are now agricultural fields and houses. We tested vectors from one location for infection with the Chagas disease parasite and found 30% (3 of 10) infected, including two of the three vectors from this location that had evidence of human blood. Humans should be aware of potential consequences of visiting and sleeping in caves.
