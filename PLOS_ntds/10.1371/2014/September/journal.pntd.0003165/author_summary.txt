A disabling and disfiguring disease that “begins where the road ends” (among poor and isolated communities), yaws is targeted by WHO for eradication by the year 2020. The global campaign is not yet financed. We provide benchmarks for the cost and health effects of global yaws eradication, based on evidence from four yaws eradication pilot sites and other mass treatment campaigns. We suggest that a global yaws eradication campaign could be established with a relatively modest investment in the period 2015–2020 — as little as US$ 100 million in the 12 known endemic countries. Eradication would cost about US$ 26 for each additional year of life lived without disability or disfigurement due to yaws between the years 2015 and 2050. The real cost of not doing anything but wait for more roads (the end of poverty) would be about 15 million years of life needlessly affected by disability and disfigurement. We expect that yaws eradication will be cost-effective. Importantly, from the perspective of universal health coverage, it will benefit some of the world's least well off citizens. Yaws eradication should therefore be seen as complementary to universal health coverage and shared prosperity on the post-2015 development agenda.
