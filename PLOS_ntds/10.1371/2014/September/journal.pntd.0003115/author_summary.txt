The wMel infection is a Wolbachia infection introduced into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations; wMel can provide potential suppression of dengue if the infection persists in populations. We show that the infection has persisted at a high frequency since its initial introduction into two natural populations in North Queensland, Australia. The infection, which is inherited through females, appears perfectly transmitted to offspring in the field. It has continued to produce a high level of incompatibility when infected males are mated with uninfected females; these females are likely to enter populations at a low frequency as migrants. These features ensure that the infection will stay at a high frequency in populations, but costs prevent its rapid spread.
