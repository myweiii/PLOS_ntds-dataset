Parasites of the Leishmania genus have developed many strategies to survive inside their host. Initially, they were only considered capable of infecting macrophages; however, it has been observed that Leishmania is able to infect other cell types, such as fibroblast, neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are well known for their antigen-presentation capabilities, and they are considered as the fundamental bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the effect of L. mexicana promastigotes on DCs. Our results showed that L. mexicana inactivates signaling cascades responsible for the expression of immune effector molecules, such as cytokines, concomitantly with the activation of protein phosphatases in the host. Furthermore, we observed that promastigote-infected cells had lower expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules on their surface, as well as decreased antigen-presentation capacity. In conclusion, our study showed that Leishmania parasites are able to inactivate the immunological mechanisms of DCs, as they do in macrophages, in order to survive inside its host.
