Rabies is a neglected disease that primarily affects poor rural communities of the developing world. Lack of surveillance, related to limited diagnostic capabilities, contributes to the underestimation of the burden of this disease. Here we report an evaluation of the direct immunohistochemical test (dRIT) as a method for routine rabies diagnosis in southern Africa. The dRIT has potential as a practical and cost-effective test that may improve rabies diagnostic capacities where it is most needed, and with this work we hope to contribute to the advancement of the dRIT as a more generally accepted and applied method. For the first time, we have evaluated a modification of the dRIT in which a polyclonal antibody preparation was biotinylated and compared to the monoclonal antibodies used for the development of all subsequent experimental applications of the dRIT to date. We conclude that the dRIT is a superior test for rabies diagnosis that is easily adaptable to tolerate the use of different antibody preparations. We further demonstrate that the assay should be optimized with respect to the virus variants of the region where it is to be implemented.
