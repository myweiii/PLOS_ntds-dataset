Leishmaniasis is one of the most important human neglected parasitic diseases worldwide. When it appears in the visceral form it has the most aggressive outcome, and is fatal if left untreated. The current mode of reproduction of these parasites is under discussion, from propagation to a sexual reproduction process. Here, we describe for the first time the intraclonal genetic exchange between two transgenic L. infantum fluorescent strains in their natural vector Phlebotomus perniciosus. Hybrid clones displayed parental phenotypic traits such as yellow fluorescence and double-drug resistance. The DNA content of the hybrid lineage was 3n, while the parental lineage was 2n. The hybrid clone was able to undergo all the morphogenic transitions required to complete a full life cycle to infect a susceptible mammalian host, and maintained both phenotype and genotype. However, its capacity to generate the same lesions as those observed with parental clones in BALB/c mice was reduced.
