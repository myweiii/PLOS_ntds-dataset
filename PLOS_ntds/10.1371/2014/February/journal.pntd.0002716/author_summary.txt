Lymphatic filariasis affects approximately 120 million people and is the second leading cause of life-long disability worldwide. Because lymphatic filariasis is one of the World Health Organization's six eradicable diseases, much effort has been placed into reducing transmission of the disease and managing morbidity. Novel interventions frequently use health-related quality of life as an outcome measure to monitor efficacy of the intervention. In an effort to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of health status measures and recommend use of a single tool in the lymphatic filariasis population, we compared the use of three health status tools (The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, the Dermatology Life Quality Index, and the Lymphatic Filariasis Quality of Life Questionnaire) in lymphatic filariasis subjects and healthy controls in Kerala, India. The Lymphatic Filariasis Quality of Life Questionnaire performed the best by discriminating well between subjects and controls, possessing significant content overlap with the other two tools, yielding a low missing value rate, and being internally consistent. This is the first study to compare health status measures in lymphatic filariasis subjects and provides insight into the use of the tools in quality of life analysis.
