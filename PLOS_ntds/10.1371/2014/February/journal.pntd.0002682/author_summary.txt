The transmission of Plasmodium vivax has induced enormous public health problems at the global level. Natural transmission of P. vivax depends on interactions between anopheles mosquitoes and human beings. There are two important factors that influence its geographical spread. First, different locations may have different risks of infection due to their heterogeneous environmental and demographical profiles. Second, human mobility may bring pathogens from high-transmission locations to low-transmission locations. In view of this, to effectively and efficiently control the geographical spread of P. vivax, it would be desirable for us to characterize how it transmits from one location to another. To achieve this, we first build a spatial transmission model to characterize both the heterogeneous infection risks at individual locations and the underlying mobility of infected populations. By doing so, we can further infer the underlying P. vivax transmission networks from tempo-spatial surveillance data by using a machine learning method (i.e., based on a recurrent neural network model). Our study offers new insights into malaria surveillance and control from the viewpoint of both system modeling and machine learning.
