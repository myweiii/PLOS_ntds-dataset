We aimed to estimate the burden of diarrhea due to Shigellae and ETEC among persons â‰¥5 years of age in Africa and South Asia using two methodological approaches. Method 1 employed diarrhea proportionate mortality and published estimates of pathogen-specific hospitalization. Method 2 utilized published incidence rates and case-fatality rates. Method 1 resulted in 19,451 deaths due to Shigellae and 42,973 deaths due to ETEC in AFR, and 20,691 deaths due to Shigellae and 45,713 deaths due to ETEC in SEAR in 2010. Method 2 resulted in 15.0 million episodes due to ETEC and 30.4 million episodes due to Shigellae in AFR, and 28.7 million episodes due to ETEC and 58.1 million episodes due to Shigellae in SEAR in 2010. These figures highlight the importance of Shigellae and ETEC as major causes of morbidity and mortality among older children, adolescents and adults in Africa and South Asia.
