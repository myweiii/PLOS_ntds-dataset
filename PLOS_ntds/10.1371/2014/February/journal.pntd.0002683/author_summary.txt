Cholera is a severe dehydrating diarrheal illness of humans caused by organisms Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139 serogroup organisms. Protective immunity against cholera is serogroup specific. Serogroup specificity in V. cholerae is determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Generally, polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic, especially in young children. Unfortunately, children bear a large burden of cholera globally. Here we describe a novel cholera conjugate vaccine and show that it induces immune responses in mice, including memory responses, to OSP, the T cell-independent antigen that probably is the target of protective immunity to cholera. These responses were highest following immunization of the vaccine with a novel immunoadjuvant, dmLT. We also show that immunization of mice with this conjugate vaccine protects against challenge with wild-type V. cholerae. A protectively immunogenic cholera conjugate vaccine that induces long-term memory responses could have particular utility in young children who are most at risk of cholera.
