Epilepsy is a chronic disease affecting more than 50 million people around the world. In many countries neurocysticercosis (NCC), a parasitic disease of the central nervous system, is a frequent cause of seizures and epilepsy. After a human ingests poorly cooked pork with cysts of the tapeworm Taenia solium, the larvae develops in the small intestine as an adult tapeworm. The tapeworm carrier becomes a source of infective eggs which are released with the stools and can infect humans or pigs with the larval stage, causing cysticercosis. There are many forms of clinical manifestations of NCC; epilepsy is one of them and the most frequent. Scarce population based-studies to identify individuals with epilepsy in rural communities exist, including only a few from Latin America. Our community-based study used a validated survey applied by trained non-medical professionals (nurse, nurse technicians, mid-wife, etc.) and found 301 individuals with epilepsy (17.25/1000), 70% of them without antiepileptic medication and 39% of them with images suggestive of NCC. The prevalence of epilepsy is high in this region and cysticercosis is a frequent finding in individuals with epilepsy.
