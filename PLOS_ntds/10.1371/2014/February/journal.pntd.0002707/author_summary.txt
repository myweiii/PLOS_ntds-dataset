Ubiquitin and ubiquitin like proteins (Ubls) and the enzymes that mediate the conjugation/deconjugation reactions have not been well studied in protozoan parasites despite their widely recognized importance in a broad range of cellular functions in eukaryotes. We have previously reported that Ufm1 has distinct protein targets and cellular localization in the human parasite Leishmania donovani and deletion of Ufm1 in L. donovani adversely impacts the pathogenesis suggesting that Ufm1 associated enzymes could be exploited as drug targets. Using sensitive FRET based activity probes we identified the Ufm1 processing peptidase Ufsp in L. donovani. In addition, we show that deletion of Ufsp specifically reduces the survival of amastigotes, the parasite stage that is present in the humans thus altering the pathogenesis. Studies showing inhibition of Ufsp activity by anti-leishmanial drug further suggests that Leishmania Ufsp can serve as a novel target for pharmacological intervention for this parasite that causes deadly disease.
