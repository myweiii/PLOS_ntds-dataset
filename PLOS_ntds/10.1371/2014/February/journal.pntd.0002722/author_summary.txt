Snakebite remains a major problem worldwide causing death or serious illness in many tens of thousands of victims annually. An approach to reduce the burden of envenoming is to provide optimum first aid procedures. We have previously shown that topical application of a nitric oxide (NO) donor slowed lymph flow to similar extent in humans and rats as well as increased the time to respiratory arrest by âˆ¼50% for subcutaneous injection of eastern brown snake venom into the hind feet of anaesthetized rats. The present study examines the use of several other topical pharmacological agents that aim to slow venom toxins reaching the circulation through the lymphatic system. The study found that the agents examined were similarly effective to that previously found for the NO donor. The fact that one of these is a commonly used topical local anesthetic may be an ideal adjunct first aid, as it provides first aid while reducing pain.
