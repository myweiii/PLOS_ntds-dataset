Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are intestinal worms that cause significant morbidity in school age and pre-school children in developing countries. Infections are associated with poverty, particularly through lack of access to sanitation and clean drinking water. Current control strategies rely on periodic anthelmintic treatment of schoolchildren but new strategies are required for STH control in young children. There are few data on modifiable risk factors in pre-school children. We investigated environmental and socioeconomic risk factors for STH infection in the first 3 years of life in a birth cohort from an STH-endemic region of Latin America. Our data provide evidence that maternal STH infections documented during pregnancy are an important risk factor for infection in young children, raising the possibility of a novel intervention for the prevention of STH-associated morbidity in early childhood through the deworming of women of childbearing age, in particular before pregnancy.
