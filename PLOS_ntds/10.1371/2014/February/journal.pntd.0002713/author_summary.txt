Dengue is a common and growing problem worldwide. Delays in traditional surveillance systems limit the ability of public health agencies to identify and respond to dengue outbreaks efficiently. Internet search queries provide near real-time indicators of infectious disease activity and have proven effective for monitoring disease activity in some countries, but have not been assessed on smaller geographic areas. We compared Google Dengue Trends data for 17 states in Mexico to traditional surveillance data from those states. We found that the utility of Google Dengue Trends at the state-level is highly variable and depends on climatic conditions supporting dengue virus transmission. Novel surveillance tools like Google Dengue Trends can provide timely information to public health agencies, but to be useful on a local scale, they must be considered within the local context of dengue transmissibility.
