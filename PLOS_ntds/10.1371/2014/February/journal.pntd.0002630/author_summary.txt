Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the world's most neglected diseases transmitted by female sand flies and affecting mostly developing countries with about 1.2 million cases every year. In most African countries, the disease is typically caused by one of two species of Leishmania parasite: L. major or L. tropica. Clinical symptoms of both infections are similar, producing ulcerative and nodular lesions. Notwithstanding their similarity, lesions caused by L. major self-heal and bestow immunity to re-infection and therapy, if applied, is often by antimonials administered intra-lesionally, whereas the treatment of CL caused by L. tropica is difficult. Differentiating between these agents in any CL focus is important. Following the outbreak of CL in Ghana, we focused on the sand fly species present in the area in order to detect Leishmania DNA in potential vectors. Our study provides evidence on the occurrence of L. tropica and L. major DNA, and the detection of Trypanosoma DNA in Sergentomyia sand flies in Ghana. These findings have considerable implications in determining the epidemiology and dynamics of the disease. Significantly, our study supports the possibility of Sergentomyia sand flies as the vectors of CL in Ghana other than Phlebotomus, which contains all currently known vectors for Leishmania in the Old World.
