Leprosy can lead to physical disabilities and deformities if not diagnosed and treated early. Even today, the disease affects more than 200,000 people per year, particularly the poorest people from developing countries, such as India, Brazil and Indonesia. Cases among children <15 years old have been used as an important indicator of recent transmission in the community. Recently, geographic information systems and spatial analysis have become important tools for epidemiology, helping to understand the transmission dynamics of several diseases. In this work, we determined the spatial and temporal distribution of leprosy in a hyperendemic municipality of the Brazilian Amazon region. In association with clinical, epidemiological and serological data of household contacts and school children in the general population, we further correlated the occurrence of subclinical infection and overt disease with the distribution of reported cases. We identified heterogeneity in the distribution of leprosy, with significant clusters of high and low detection rates. Our analysis revealed that children with leprosy or those harboring subclinical infection were in close proximity to spatial and temporal clusters of leprosy cases. These findings can be applied to guide leprosy control programs to target intervention more systematically to areas where the risk of leprosy is high.
