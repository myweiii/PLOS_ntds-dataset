Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a systemic disease with highest prevalence in South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. VL is caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex, transmitted to humans when an infected sandfly takes a bloodmeal. Within the human host, the parasites replicate within cells, particularly of bone marrow and spleen. Without effective treatment, symptomatic VL is usually fatal. Correct treatment depends on accurate diagnosis, which is by detection of parasites or specific antibodies. The rK39 rapid diagnostic test for antibody is highly sensitive in South Asia but less so in East Africa, for poorly understood reasons. Here, we have directly compared the anti-Leishmania antibody response in groups of VL patients from India and Sudan. We found a strikingly higher anti-Leishmania antibody response in Indian compared to Sudanese patients, which was also seen when further analysed by age and sex of the patients. Thus in addition to parasite factors, we have shown that difference in antibody levels may contribute to the lower sensitivity of antibody-based diagnosis for VL in Sudan.
