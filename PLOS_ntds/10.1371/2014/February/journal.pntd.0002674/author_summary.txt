Secretory diarrhea is a major health challenge in developing countries. Causative agents include bacteria, as in cholera, and viruses, as in childhood rotaviral diarrhea. Though oral rehydration solution (ORS) has reduced mortality from diarrhea four-fold in the last three decades, its efficacy is limited, particularly in the young and elderly, and because of practicalities in its availability and compliance. Antisecretory drug therapy for diarrhea may be efficacious when ORS is not available, as during natural disasters, and it may potentiate the efficacy of ORS. As an alternative approach to the costly and lengthy development of a new chemical entity, in this study we investigated the possibility that effective, natural-product antisecretory therapeutics may already be available, but unappreciated. Screening of diarrhea remedies from around the world for enterocyte chloride channel inhibition identified Krisanaklan, a herbal extract used widely in Thailand for treatment of diarrhea, as effective in inhibiting intestinal chloride secretion. We report the antidiarrheal efficacy and cellular mechanisms of Krisanaklan, providing proof-of-concept for its potential utility for antisecretory therapy of major, life-threatening diarrheas in developing countries.
