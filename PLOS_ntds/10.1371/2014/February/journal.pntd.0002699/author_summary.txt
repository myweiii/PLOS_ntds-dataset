Adult filarial worms are long-lived nematode parasites that have proved very difficult to kill with existing drugs. Current campaigns for the control or elimination of these parasites are largely based on treatment with drugs such as diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin, that preferentially kill the first stage larvae of the parasite, the microfilariae. As microfilariae repopulate the body from unaffected adult worms, repeated dosing with these drugs is required over the long reproductive life span of the worm. The availability of compounds with macrofilaricidal activity would help facilitate the goal of controlling filarial infections. Hsp90 is a recognized target in tumor cells: consequently many oncology programs have developed small molecule inhibitors of Hsp90, several of which are commercially available. Here we provide proof of principle that inhibition of Hsp90 is lethal to adult Brugia worms in vivo, as well as in vitro, suggesting that these compounds may have potential for further development as macrofilaricidal drugs.
