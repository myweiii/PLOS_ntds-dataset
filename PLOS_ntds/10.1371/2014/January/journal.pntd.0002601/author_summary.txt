G. p. palpalis is one of the principal tsetse fly vectors of African Trypanosomiasis. Its range stretches from Liberia in West Africa to Angola in Central Africa. G. p. palpalis inhabits tropical rain forest but has also adapted to urban settlements. Reduction of tsetse populations remains one of the most effective methods to control disease transmission to man and animals, and development of visually-attractive insecticide-impregnated traps and targets for palpalis group tsetse dates from half a century ago. Here we describe field experiments made in wet and dry seasons in the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola to establish the most efficient, long-lasting and practical object that induces the strongest landing response in G. p. palpalis. Independent of season and country, both phthalogen blue-black 1 m2 cloth targets covered with adhesive film proved as good as traps in phthalogen blue or turquoise blue cloth when employed as capturing and landing devices for G. p. palpalis. Pyramidal trap efficiency was inconsistent. As landings on 0.25 m2 square phthalogen blue-black targets were not significantly different from landings on the 1 m2 targets, these smaller targets show promise as simple cost effective devices for the management of G. p. palpalis populations.
