Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease of serious public health importance. No efficient vaccine is currently available. Parasites are transmitted to mammalian hosts during sand fly bites. During this process, both parasites and sand fly salivary products are delivered into the skin. Immunization with salivary proteins from most sand fly species can protect mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, immunization with sand fly saliva of Lutzomyia intermedia leads to aggravation of leishmaniasis. We investigated the impact of Lutzomyia intermedia saliva exposure on the development of immune response to Leishmania braziliensis, the major causative agent of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Brazil. To this end, we analyzed in mice the gene expression pattern induced by immunization with salivary gland extracts. Among the genes highly induced were the interferon-inducible genes known to contribute to resistance against parasite infections. These genes were also induced in blood cells of human individuals that were naturally pre-exposed to bites of Lutzomyia intermedia sand flies. Interestingly, subsequent infection with Leishmania braziliensis blocked the induction of these genes in mice. These data show that the induction of potentially protective genes by insect saliva can be altered by the infecting parasite. This should be considered when including salivary components in a vaccine.
