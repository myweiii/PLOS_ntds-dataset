Parasitic worms like Brugia malayi cause widespread lymphatic filariasis (LF) in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The adult worms causing most of the symptoms of LF are difficult to treat with existing drugs. As a possible step toward new LF drugs, we searched for inhibitors of the B. malayi cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (iPGAM), an enzyme thought to be critical to survival and development of this parasite. Despite testing over 100,000 compounds at each of two screening centers, we found only two compounds that consistently inhibited the B. malayi enzyme more strongly than the cofactor-dependent enzyme found in humans. These compounds have limited potency and are not especially great starting points for drug development. The 3-dimensional structure of iPGAM suggests that the active site is difficult to access from the surrounding solvent, which may partly explain our very low yield of inhibitors. We conclude that iPGAM may not be an ideal drug target in B. malayi or related organisms because it is difficult to inhibit with druglike compounds.
