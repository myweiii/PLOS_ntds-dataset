Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute, tick-borne disease with a case fatality rate of 10â€“30%. It is geographically the most widespread tick-borne disease in the world. In recent years there has been an increase of the disease incidence in several countries, mainly in the countries of the Balkan. The disease is also endemic in Kosovo. Since CCHF virus is very genetically diverse we aimed to determine the genetic variability of the virus in Kosovo in the span of 22 years. We obtained the largest number of patient derived nucleotide sequences and found great genetic variability which has been more or less stable during the 22 year period. Our results also suggest that significant changes in viral population occur in different years. We show that ecological factors such as temperature could play a role in the composition of the viral population.
