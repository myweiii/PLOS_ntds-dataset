Lassa virus (LASV) causes a viral hemorrhagic fever that affects about 300,000 people and leads to 5,000 deaths annually. Lassa fever (LF) is a public health problem in West Africa, where it is endemic, because of the number of cases, deaths and disabling effects. There is no vaccine against LASV and the only treatment, ribavirin, is not useful in the field. Little is known about the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with LF. Chemokines are involved in the induction of immunity and attraction of immune cells to inflamed sites. We compared the ability of antigen-presenting cells to produce chemokines in response to infection with LASV, the closely related but nonpathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) and a LASV unable to inhibit the type I IFN response due to mutations in its nucleoprotein gene. We found that MOPV and the mutant LASV, but not wild-type LASV, strongly induced CC and CXC chemokine production by dendritic cells and macrophages, in a type I IFN-dependent manner. We confirmed in cynomolgus monkeys that these mediators probably play a role during LF. These results highlight the role of innate immunity in LF control and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to survival or death after infection.
