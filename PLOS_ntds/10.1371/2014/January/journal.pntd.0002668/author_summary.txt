Mycobacterium ulcerans causes the disfiguring human skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). The mechanism of transmission and reservoir for human infection remain unknown. In previous research, we reported the detection of M. ulcerans DNA in the faeces of possums (small tree-dwelling marsupials) in an area of South-East Australia (the Bellarine peninsula) where the largest recorded outbreak of human BU has been in progress for the last decade. The current study was carried out in a new outbreak area (the Mornington peninsula), and describes the detection of M. ulcerans DNA in possum faeces collected from the ground, in locations which correspond closely with the addresses of human BU cases. The association of new human BU cases with areas where M. ulcerans positive possum faeces are found contributes further evidence to the possible role of possums as an environmental reservoir of infection. Possums may be useful sentinel animals to monitor the spread of BU in Australia.
