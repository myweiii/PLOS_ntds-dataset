An outbreak of Murray Valley encephalitis with 17 confirmed cases occurred across Australia in 2011. This outbreak involved parts of Australia where cases had not occurred for many decades. The epidemiology in this outbreak reflects a change that has occurred over the past 15 years, with more non-Aboriginal cases, fewer children and more cases that were not resident where they acquired the infection than had been observed prior to 2000. The outbreak was associated with significant flooding in many parts of Australia and most cases reported either outdoor activities where mosquito exposure was highly likely or significant mosquito exposure.
