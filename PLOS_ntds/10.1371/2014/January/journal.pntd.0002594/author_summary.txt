The bloodsucking bug Rhodnius prolixus is a vector of Chagas' disease, which affects 7â€“8 million people in Latin America. In contrast to other insects, the digestive tract of Rhodnius has three segments that perform different functions during blood digestion. Here we report analysis of transcriptomes for each of these segments using pyrosequencing technology amounting to several million sequences. Comparison of transcript frequency in digestive libraries with a whole-body library was used to evaluate expression levels, leading to the discovery of several families of enzymes associated with the digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, as well as proteins involved in immunity, signal transduction, amino-acid metabolism, and detoxification. Together, our findings present a new view of the triatomine digestive apparatus and will help us understand the mechanism of blood digestion by Rhodnius and its interaction with the agent of Chagas' disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that grows within the insect's digestive system.
