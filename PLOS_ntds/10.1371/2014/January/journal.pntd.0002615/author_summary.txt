Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, is characterized by fever, haemorrhage, headache, back pain, abdominal pain, and acute kidney injury. China has the highest incidence of HFRS worldwide. Reported cases account for 90% of the total global cases. Approximately 1.4 million HFRS cases were reported in China between 1950 and 2010. During the same time period, >46 000 people died from HFRS, and the fatality rate was 3.29%. A great deal of interest and excitement has developed recently for understanding the role of the environment in the transmission of HFRS. Our article provides evidence that rodent density and behavior depend on natural factors. Changes in animal reservoirs may lead to the emergence of new epidemics and threats to human health. However, economic development may promote a more residential environment, which could inhibit disease transmission from animals to humans by limiting their contact. We combined data about the rodent reservoir, the natural environment, and socioeconomic factors in the model. The results will be helpful for making and prioritizing preventive measures.
