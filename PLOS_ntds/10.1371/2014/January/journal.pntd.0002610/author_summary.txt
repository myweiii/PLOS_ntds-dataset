To date, praziquantel is the only available drug for the treatment of the tropical neglected disease schistosomiasis and is widely used in morbidity control programs. To discover new chemical scaffolds for the treatment of schistosomiasis, we investigated the Medicines for Malaria Venture malaria box containing 200 diverse drug-like and 200 probe-like compounds with known antimalarial activity against Schistosoma mansoni. Compounds were first investigated on the larval stage of S. mansoni, followed by testing against adult worms in vitro and by in vivo studies of lead candidates. We identified two entirely new chemical scaffolds: the N,Nâ€²-diarylurea and 2,3-dianilinoquinoxaline derivatives with antischistosomal in vitro activity in the sub micromolar range and significant activity in the mouse model. Since both compounds offer a good pharmacokinetic profile, low cytotoxic potential and easy chemistry, structure-activity relationship studies should be launched.
