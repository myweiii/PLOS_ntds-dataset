Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major health concern for people living in Latin America. There are no vaccines to prevent this disease and only two drugs are prescribed for treatment. Current methods to diagnose patients are not always successful and thus new methods need to be developed. One approach to develop an alternate method is to detect proteins and metabolites that are secreted by parasites into the blood of infected individuals. We have utilized a selection based method to isolate ligands that bind to these secreted proteins. These ligands, called aptamers, have been used to develop an assay that can detect the circulating parasite targets in the plasma or serum of an infected host. In an animal model of Chagas disease, our assay can detect parasite biomarkers as early as seven days after infection and as late as 230 days post infection. As the laboratory instruments and procedures are similar to performing an ELISA, the aptamer assay reported here could be easily performed at diagnostic facilities. Further improvement in this assay can lead to a new quantitative diagnostic test for Chagas disease. A similar selection based approach could also be used to develop ligands for the detection of biomarkers in other diseases.
