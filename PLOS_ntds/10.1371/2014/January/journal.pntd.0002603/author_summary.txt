Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-azar, is a protozoan parasitic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. After malaria, VL accounts for the second-highest burden of parasitic diseases worldwide. India has half of all the VL patients worldwide, of which up to 90% are in Bihar state. Between 2007–2012, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) together with the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI) supported existing health structures in Vaishali district, Bihar, by treating 8749 VL patients with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) 20 mg/kg. Initial cure rate was high, with low default and mortality rates. We describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of this large patient group, including risk factors for late presentation. Ambisome can be given in short courses and is safer, better tolerated, and more effective than existing VL treatments. The MSF-supported program treated nearly 1400 ambulatory patients in rural primary healthcare centers, using existing government facilities and non-incentivized staff, demonstrating that a resource-limited healthcare system in a rural setting can meet the cold chain and human resource standards required to administer Ambisome safely. We also describe a long-term follow-up survey showing a continuing low VL relapse rate after 5 years of routine use of Ambisome. More relapses occurred after 6-month follow-up; suggesting a 12-month follow-up in future VL studies may be more appropriate.
