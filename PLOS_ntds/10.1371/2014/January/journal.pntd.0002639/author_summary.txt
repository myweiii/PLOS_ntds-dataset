Lepromatous leprosy is a generalized infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae with the patients showing T cell mediated unresponsiveness to the pathogen and chronicity of lesions. The causation of unresponsiveness and anergy in this form of leprosy is not fully understood. The recent discovery of CD25+FOXP3+ cells with regulatory functions (Tregs) in mice and man have made it possible to study their role in the dampening of T cell responses in lepromatous leprosy. We investigated both skin and PBMC from leprosy patients for lineage specific molecular, and phenotypic markers of Tregs as well as cytokines in situ and in in vitro M.leprae stimulated PBMC cultures (iTreg). Our studies find an increase in lineage specific CD4+ iTregs in lepromatous leprosy as compared to the limited form of borderline tuberculoid leprosy. Such cells secrete TGF-Î², an inhibitory cytokine and may play a role in negatively regulating the T cell immune responses in lepromatous disease.
