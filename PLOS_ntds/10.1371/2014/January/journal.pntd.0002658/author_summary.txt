Th2 cells are CD4+ T cells that produce a unique set of cytokines - IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Th2 cells are commonly associated with allergies, asthma and helminth infections. A common helminth infection that infects over 120 million people worldwide is lymphatic filarial infection caused by filarial parasites. We show here data that filarial infection is associated with the expansion of two types of Th2 cells, one which produces IL-4 and IL-13 alone without IL-5 and the other which produces all three cytokines. Interestingly, while the former subset is associated with the levels of antibodies - IgG4 and IgE; the latter is associated with the presence of eosinophilia in filarial infected individuals. In addition, these subsets appear to be modulated differently by the immunoregulatory cytokines - IL-10 and TGFÎ². Therefore, our study highlights a novel regulation of Th2 cells and suggests that the Th2 compartment is quite heterogeneous in phenotype with possible functional consequences.
