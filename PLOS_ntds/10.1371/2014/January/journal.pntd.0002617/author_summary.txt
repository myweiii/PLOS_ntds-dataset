Schistosomiasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by helminths from the genus Schistosoma, which affects hundreds of millions of people, mainly the poor. Despite schistosomiasis being one of the most prevalent and debilitating neglected tropical diseases, the treatment and control of this disease relies on a single drug, praziquantel. However, there is increasing concern about the development of drug resistance. For this reason, the search for new schistosomicidal agents is a priority. Here, we report that phytol, a molecule from chlorophyll widely used as a food additive and in medicinal fields, shows promising antischistosomal properties against adult Schistosoma mansoni in vitro and in laboratory studies with mice harbouring adult S. mansoni. Phytol is a common food additive and is nonmutagenic, with satisfactory safety. Thus, phytol has potential as a safe and cost-effective addition to antischistosomal therapy. Further studies are needed because our results might have public health relevance.
