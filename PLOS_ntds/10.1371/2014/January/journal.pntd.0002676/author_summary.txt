Chagas disease is a neglected tropical parasitic infection. An estimated 10 million people are infected worldwide, and more than 25 million people are at risk of acquiring the disease. The therapeutic agents used to treat the disease may not be effective in all cases and also produce considerable side effects. Therefore, it is important to identify the key factors in the life cycle of the parasite that could be targets for new chemotherapeutic strategies. This paper provides evidence that a new cytoplasmic catalytic subunit of T. cruzi calcineurin (TcCaNA2) may play a critical role in host cell invasion by metacyclic trypomastigotes. Metacyclic forms with reduced TcCaNA2 expression following treatment with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides had significantly decreased capacity to invade HeLa cells. Epimastigote proliferation was inhibited to some extent by treatment with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide targeted to TcCaNA2, but to a lesser degree than by calcineurin inhibitors (CsA, FK506 and INCA-6). The structural differences between TcCaNA2 and its human ortholog CaNA were analyzed to determine the potential of this newly identified calcineurin subunit as a chemotherapeutic target.
