Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent in Chagas disease, may result in heart disease. There has been an increase in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and ischemic cardiovascular disease in endemic areas. Previously, we demonstrated that adipose tissue is an early target and a reservoir for T. cruzi. T. cruzi has high affinity for lipoproteins, and that infected tissues there is an increase in intra-cellular cholesterol levels. It is likely that adipocytes and lipoproteins play a key role in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease. The role of host lipids in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease is understudied. Diet plays a major role in the regulation of systemic and whole body lipid levels including adipogenesis and lipogenesis. We report, for the first time, the effect of diet on myocardial inflammation and damage observed during acute T. cruzi infection and provide data on the role of parasite associated LDL/HDL in the regulation of systemic lipid homeostasis in white adipose tissue (WAT) and in the heart. Interestingly, we demonstrate that a high fat diet protects mice from the consequences of infection-induced myocardial damage through effects on adipogenesis in adipose tissue and reduced cardiac lipidopathy.
