Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that affects over one million people worldwide, causing chronic morbidity in the majority of infected individuals. A certain proportion of individuals develop asymptomatic infection that allows persistence of the parasite and therefore transmission of disease through the blood-circulating microfilariae. We show that monocytes and macrophages, innate effector cells that circulate in the blood, migrate or reside in tissues and come into contact with microfilariae, can be stimulated by microfilarial (Mf) lysate in vitro to develop a regulatory phenotype via expression of PD-L1 and IL-10. Significantly, this regulatory monocyte phenotype was directly reflected in monocytes isolated from filaria asymptomatically infected patients in the absence of external stimuli. Mf lysate-modulated monocytes inhibited adaptive immune functions, some of which could be restored by neutralisation of IL-10. Mf lysate-modulated macrophages had reduced phagocytic capacity, while macrophages differentiated in the presence of Mf lysate displayed significantly inhibited innate responses to LPS stimulation. This suggests that microfilariae modulate the innate response by acting on macrophage differentiation and macrophages themselves, and modulate the adaptive CD4+ T cell response by acting on monocytes. The phenotypic pattern observed by modulated monocytes is recapitulated in vivo in active infection. This highlights a previously unclear mechanism of immune modulation by the parasite.
