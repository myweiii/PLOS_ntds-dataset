Cutaneous leishmaniasis displays a wide spectrum of clinical and microscopic findings. The microscopic manifestations have been categorized into five groups. The type of granulomatous response defined in group V is usually tuberculoid in nature with exceedingly rare cases described with necrotizing granulomas in contrast to cutaneous infections with tuberculosis and other mycobacteria that are typically associated with necrotic granulomas. The old world countries endemic for cutaneous leishmania also happen to be endemic for other granulomatous diseases such as leprosy, tuberculosis and cutaneous mycoses. The most common diagnostic approach used in these countries is still microscopic examination despite the advances in molecular diagnostic techniques and culture methods. We document an 18.2% incidence of caseating granulomas in cutaneous leishmania. Hence, cutaneous leishmania should be part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions in addition to other causative infections.
