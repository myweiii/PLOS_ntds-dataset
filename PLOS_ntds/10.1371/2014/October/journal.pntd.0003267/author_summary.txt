Since 2009, an emerging infectious disease which was identified as the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was reported in rural areas of Hubei, Shandong and Henan provinces in China. A novel bunyavirus designated severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus (SFTSV) had been identified to be the etiological cause of SFTS. But what risk factors lead to the disease is still not clear. Further investigations for risk factors are needed to effectively prevent and control the disease. Here we have designed case-control study to try to develop the risk factors of the spread of SFTSV. It is hoped that our research could provide epidemiological evidence for further study. Also help to determine the spread of the virus in the environment.
