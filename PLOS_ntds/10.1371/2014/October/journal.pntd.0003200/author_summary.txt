Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Usually, the number of patients presenting with ulcers in an advanced stage is high. This complicates treatment and increases the risk of disabilities. The disease is endemic mainly in West Africa. The primary strategy for control is early detection using community village volunteers. In Bénin, data was collected to understand the role of the different referral systems on the stage of disease at presentation in the hospital and the diagnostic precision. About a quarter of the patients were referred to the hospital by the community health volunteers. Community health volunteers referred patients more frequently in an earlier stage of disease. The PCR confirmation rate among patients referred by the community health volunteers was not systematically lower than in patients referred by other systems. We found that community health volunteers played an important role in the referral system of BU patients in Bénin. This information is relevant for health care programs attempting to control BU but may also be relevant for health care programs working on other diseases in areas with restricted resources.
