Congenital Chagas disease is one of the main pillars for the control of Chagas disease because 25% of new infections occur by this route. Conventional diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease is based on microscopy at birth and serology at 9 months. However microscopy misses many infections and many at-risk infants fail to complete serology at six to nine months. We have developed a Chagas urine nanoparticle test (Chunap) for concentration and detection of T. cruzi antigens. Chunap was evaluated in urine samples of 1-month old children. At this age children have the highest levels of parasitemia and therefore also excrete the highest levels of antigen. Parents prefer a urine test to having their baby's blood drawn. Chunap diagnosed congenital infection in a single urine sample as well as PCR in two blood samples. This study also shows that hydrogel/trypan blue particles used in our test efficiently capture, concentrate and protect urinary T. cruzi antigens from enzymatic degradation. Chunap allows for the early diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease, and with appropriate adaptation, may allow early point-of-care intervention.
