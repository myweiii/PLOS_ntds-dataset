Knowledge regarding the evolutionary history of insect vectors of pathogens is essential to design precise and appropriately integrated control strategies, since species' dispersal and invasive capacity are key components to prevent human-vector interaction. Given several well-known invasive or dispersal events of Triatominae, and their adaptive capacity to colonize modified habitats, the question arises whether niche conservatism (i.e. the limited capacity for niche differentiation within clades) across sister species could influence distribution patterns. Niche conservatism is herein analyzed across the highly heterogeneous landmass of North and Central America where most species complexes of the Triatominae are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. Since phylogenetic relationships among and within triatomine species complexes are still ill-defined, we first used a multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear loci to validate relationships between species. Similarity of the ecological niche between six sister species' pairs was used to test the niche conservatism hypothesis. The results provide robust evidence of monophyly for North and Central America triatomine species. The hypothesis of niche conservatism was not rejected for any sister species pair, independently of niche width, distribution range, biogeographic affinity, or environmental heterogeneity; niche similarity correlated inversely with taxa divergence and according to a retention model.
