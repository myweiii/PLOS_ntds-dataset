Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite which is transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. Bednets treated with insecticide are one of the key tools used to prevent malaria and they have been distributed on a large scale in many countries, particularly in Africa. It may be possible to control other diseases transmitted by insects using insecticide-treated bednets because many of these insects also enter houses. We did a review of studies looking at the effectiveness of insecticide-treated bednets, curtains and house screening against nine major diseases transmitted by insects. We assessed the effect these tools had on reducing numbers of the insects and disease in humans. Insecticide-treated bednets were found to be effective in preventing cutaneous leishmaniasisâ€”a disease transmitted by sandfliesâ€”and insecticide-treated curtains and screening showed potential in preventing other insect borne diseases. Although further studies are required, it is clear that insecticide-treated bednets, curtains and screening have the potential to prevent transmission of insect-transmitted diseases.
