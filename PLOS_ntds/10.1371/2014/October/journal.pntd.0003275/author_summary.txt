Antimony-containing compounds are the main drugs used to treat leishmaniasis but the severe associated side effects pose the need for alternative chemotherapeutic options. Herein, we evaluated the ability of 17-AAG (a Heat Shock Protein 90 inhibitor) to kill Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis parasites, a species that causes both cutaneous and mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis in Brazil. Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) is associated with important biological processes; inhibition of this molecule interferes with parasite survival and, hence, it can be exploited as a chemotherapeutic target. We show that exposure to 17-AAG induced killing of L. brazilensis parasites in both its extracellular and intracellular forms. This effect was not dependent on the activation of the host cell. More importantly, treatment of mice infected with L. (V.) braziliensis also modulated lesion development and decreased parasite growth at the infection site. Collectively, our results show that targeting HSP90 is a promising alternative for development of novel chemotherapeutic options for leishmaniasis.
