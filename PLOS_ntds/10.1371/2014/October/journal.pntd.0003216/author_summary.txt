The nCounter, a high throughput digital molecular detection and quantitation system, was used to define the inflammatory response of SW mice to WNV infection following intraperitoneal injection in multiple tissues over a 9 day course of viral infection. Data analysis identified expression profiles common and unique to major tissues. Complementary protein suspension array analysis of a subset of genes demonstrated the expression kinetics of RNA and protein expression compared to infectious virus production. Data stratification of WNV (+) versus WNV (âˆ’) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response versus tissue-specific responses due to infection with WNV over time. The results generated from this study will allow for further hypothesis generation and testing.
