In Chagas disease, a parasitic disease found primarily in Central and South America, individuals are chronically infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. A few decades after initial infection, 20â€“30% of infected individuals will develop cardiac disease. If we were able to predict which individuals would progress to cardiac disease, treatment in these low resource areas could be targeted to those at highest risk. The ideal transition point to identify those at risk would be as individuals progress from a normal electrocardiogram to an abnormal electrocardiogram, the first step in the progression of cardiac disease. Previous studies have suggested a group of serum biomarkers able to differentiate between these stages of disease. However, our larger and more comprehensive study finds that none of the ten cardiac and remodeling biomarkers we tested are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with the earliest evidence of cardiac disease. We did find cardiac biomarkers to be elevated in those with severe cardiac disease as expected in both T. cruzi infected and uninfected individuals.
