Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic disease affecting about 10 million people, mostly in the Americas, and transmitted mainly by triatomine bugs. The elimination of the insect vectors from houses is the main strategy for the prevention of the disease. The success of such interventions relies on their acceptance and appropriation by communities, which depend on their knowledge and perceptions of the disease and the vector. In this study, we performed the first analysis of school-aged children's views of triatomine vectors and Chagas disease in Yucatan, Mexico. We analyzed 261 drawings on the theme of “triatomines and my house” collected in four rural villages. Children appeared very familiar with triatomine vectors, but their role as vectors of a chronic and severe cardiac disease was less understood. These results can help design more specific education materials and campaigns, and promote the inclusion of children in raising Chagas disease awareness in these communities.
