Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) constitutes a serious public health problem in the Americas, particularly in Brazil. The disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted by the bite of female sand flies, and dogs are the main source of infection. To decrease the risk of transmission, the Brazilian VL control program recommends residual insecticide spraying and environmental management for vector control, and culling of seropositive dogs in areas with moderate to high levels of transmission. Because there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting such interventions, we designed a study to assess the effectiveness of dog culling and residual insecticide spraying in the reduction of incidence of human VL infection. The results show that only dog culling had some statistically significant effect on reducing the incidence of infection, with estimates of effectiveness varying between 27% and 52%. In light of the continuous spread of VL in Brazil despite the large scale deployment of insecticide spraying and dog culling, the relatively low to moderate effectiveness of dog culling and the non-significant effect of insecticide spraying on the incidence of human infection, we conclude that there is an urgent need for revision of the Brazilian VL control program.
