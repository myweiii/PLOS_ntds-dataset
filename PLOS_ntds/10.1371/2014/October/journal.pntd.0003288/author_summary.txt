An important factor influencing the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases is the contribution of hosts with different parasitemia (no. of parasites per ml of blood) to the infected vector population. In this study we developed a novel mechanistic model that facilitates the quantification of this contribution and applied it to an ample data set of people infected with visceral leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. Among vector borne diseases, visceral leishmaniasis is the second most important killer after malaria. It is caused by infection with Leishmania parasites with most cases (âˆ¼90%) occurring in the Indian sub-continent, East Africa, and South America. The disease is transmitted between people and other mammalian hosts by blood-sucking sand flies. Our findings indicate that a 3.2% of the most infected people were responsible for the infection of about 65% of the infected sand fly vector population. Identifying the hosts that contribute most towards infection of the vectors is crucial for understanding the transmission dynamics, and planning targeted intervention policy of visceral leishmaniasis, as well as other vector borne infectious diseases (e.g., Dengue, West Nile Fever).
