Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs; roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms) infect millions of children in sub-tropical and tropical countries, resulting in malnutrition, growth stunting, intellectual retardation, and cognitive deficits. To fight against STH, large-scale deworming programs are implemented in which anthelmintic drugs (either albendazole (ALB) or mebendazole (MEB)) are administered. Currently, these large-scale programs are intensifying, highlighting the need to closely monitor the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs to detect changes in drug efficacy that may arise through the evolution of anthelmintic drug resistance in the parasites. We have previously defined the minimum expected efficacy of ALB based on the fecal egg count reduction (FECR) rate, but these reference values are lacking for MEB. Therefore, we therefore evaluated the FECR rate of MEB against STHs in six STH endemic countries. In addition, we compared the results of the FECR rate for MEB with those we obtained previously for ALB. The results confirm that MEB treatment was highly efficacious against roundworms, and to a lesser extend against hookworms, but not against whipworms. Compared to ALB, MEB is less efficacious against hookworm, but equally efficacious against roundworms and whipworms. Based on this study we propose the minimum expected FECR rate for MEB-dependent large-scale deworming programs.
