WHO has recognized mycetoma as one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) worldwide. Studies indicate infections from soil or possibly mediated by thorn pricks, but no detailed studies have investigated effects of soil type and Acacia distributions on mycetoma in Sudan. Here, we investigated risk factors associated with mycetoma infections in Sudan using ecological niche modeling (ENM), integrating mycetoma case records, Acacia records, and geospatial data summarizing soil, land-surface temperature, and greenness. ENMs calibrated in endemic districts were transferred across Sudan, and suggested that greatest risk was in a belt across central Sudan. Mycetoma infections occur under diverse environmental conditions; we found significant niche similarity between Acacia and mycetoma. Model predictions were amply corroborated by a preliminary assessment of a much larger mycetoma case-occurrence data base. Our results revealed contributions of different environmental factors to mycetoma risk, raised hypotheses of a causal mycetoma-Acacia association, and provide steps towards a robust predictive risk map for the disease in Sudan.
