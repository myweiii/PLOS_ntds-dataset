Rabies is a worldwide zoonosis disease and is of considerable public health threat and hazard. The Guangxi province of southern China is a severe rabies epidemic region. Human rabies cases decreased from 839 in 1982 to 24 in 1995 in Guangxi as a result of a dog vaccination campaign. However, the number subsequently underwent a sharp increase, and has since maintained a high level. This study reports the systematic surveillance of rabies in Guangxi over the 30-year period from 1982 to 2012. The data revealed that a re-emergence of human rabies has occurred mainly in rural areas of Guangxi since 1996. Human rabies incidence rate increased follows increased instances of RV positive normal dogs. To further understand this re-emergence of rabies, the biological properties of the rabies virus (RV), including the RV-positive rate of normal dogs, pathogenicity, antigenicity and evolution, have been evaluated. The Guangxi isolates all showed similar pathogenicity and antigenicity. These isolates also exhibited similar topologies with strong bootstrap values in the two groups and were closely bonded. Thus these findings will be helpful to understanding the epidemiological situation for rabies in Guangxi.
