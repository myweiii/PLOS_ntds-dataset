In this study we analyze data on sand fly (SF) abundance and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases from Panamá. We asked whether weather patterns and climatic variability could have an impact on vector abundance that is ultimately reflected in CL transmission. We found that large epidemics of CL occur during the cold phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with regular cycles coinciding with the oscillation patterns of ENSO. By contrast, and counterintuitively, we found that during the hot and cold phase of ENSO the average number of SF was reduced when compared with the normal phase of ENSO. Nevertheless, the cold ENSO phase also shows the largest variability in vector abundance, which is a likely indicative of sudden and extraordinary increases in SF abundance. We, therefore, propose that marked SF abundance changes, triggered by anomalous weather patterns associated with ENSO, likely play a major role in shaping CL interannual transmission cycles in Panamá.
