Canine leishmaniasis is caused by uncontrolled infection with Leishmania infantum. The dog is also the principle reservoir of this parasite which can infect humans. The key determinant of the outcome of infection is the ability of the dog's immune system to respond appropriately. This should be mainly cell-mediated immunity; the antibody responses often desired for viral or bacterial infections are not protective. Therefore, vaccines capable of inducing this cell-mediated immune profile are a desirable prevention tool. Previous studies with CaniLeish (consisting of the parasite's excreted-secreted proteins with an adjuvant) have demonstrated the ability of this vaccine to induce an appropriate immune profile and to protect against an intravenous challenge, as well as to reduce the risk of transmission of the parasite to the sandfly vector. This paper reports a study where vaccinated dogs were exposed to natural parasite transmission over two full seasons in two Mediterranean locations (one in Italy and one in Spain). Data from the unvaccinated control group confirmed that the levels of exposure were high. We demonstrated that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of progressive infections and disease confirming the interest of using vaccination as part of a comprehensive control program for this disease.
