In endemic areas, pigs acquire cysticercosis when ingesting Taenia solium eggs that have been released into the environment in the feces of a person infected with T. solium. The present study has found evidence that players, such as dung beetles, might be involved in further dissemination of the parasite into the environment. Specifically, we found an association between helminths, for whom dung beetles act as an intermediate host, and porcine cysticercosis infection and exposure after adjusting for other porcine cysticercosis predictors such as distance to tapeworm carrier and age. Although the study does not evaluate dung beetles directly, parasites specific to dung beetles serve as a novel proxy to evidence the potential role of dung beetles in the epidemiology of cysticercosis. Therefore, it is important that further studies elucidate the role of other players in cysticercosis transmission in order to better explain the reemergence and persistence of cysticercosis after elimination and control efforts. In addition, vector populations could potentially be used as markers for cysticercosis in the communities.
