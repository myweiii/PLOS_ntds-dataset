FTLSV is novel bunyavirus belonging to genus Phlebovirus and was first found in Huaiyangshan area. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of FTLSV remain poorly understood. This lack of information underscores the importance of analyzing the movement and genetic history of FTLSV in China. Recent advances in Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses have resulted in more sophisticated methods being available for determining the relative age of emerging pathogens. In this study, a phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analysis was performed for FTLSV whole genomic sequences isolated from China. Results identified the Huaiyangshan area as the most probable origin of FTLSV and suggested migrating routes of the virus. These results offer the first description of the movement and history of FTLSV in China. RNA segment reassortment was found in FTLSV; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force driving the evolution of this virus. The results of this study could be used to facilitate the development of new strategies for controlling FTLSV.
