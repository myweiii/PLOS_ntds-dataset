Diverse eukaryotes, including various fungi, utilize RNA interference (RNAi) pathways to regulate genome-wide gene expression. Since the initial characterization of these pathways and the demonstration of its artificial induction in the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora crassa, RNAi has emerged as the most robust reverse-genetic technique to scrutinize the function of genes and has been increasingly adopted in high-throughput functional genomics in search of new insights into fungal pathobiology. Herein, we have developed appropriate molecular tools and straightforward techniques to streamline the generation of stable loss-of-function phenotypes for the human-pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which is phylogenetically related to Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum. Likewise these thermo-dimorphic fungi, P. brasiliensis infection in immunocompetent or immunocompromised individuals ensue in a life-threatening systemic mycosis known as Paracoccidioidomycosis.
