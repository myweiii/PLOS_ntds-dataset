Dengue is a major cause of morbidity in Puerto Rico and is well-known to its physicians. Early case identification and timely initiation of treatment for patients with severe dengue can reduce medical complications and mortality. We conducted a survey among physicians who practice in Puerto Rico to determine clinical management and reporting practices and assess knowledge of dengue and its management. We found that although respondents clinically diagnosed, on average, 12 cases of dengue in the preceding three months, one third did not report any suspected cases to public health officials while about half reported all cases. We found that knowledge of dengue management was limited and compliance with WHO treatment guidelines was not optimal. As other dengue endemic countries have reported similar findings, a sustained continuing medical education training initiative may be necessary to improve case detection and clinical management even in countries where the disease is common. Our findings were used to design a postgraduate training course to improve the clinical management of dengue.
