The Mycetoma Research Centre (MRC) in Sudan adopted an integrated village management model in an attempt to encourage patients to present early for treatment. The model consisted of a house to house survey to detect mycetoma suspected patients and to refer them for further management, KAP, epidemiological and ecological studies. In this study, 33 new patients were detected, and no definite risk factor was detected. However, contact with thorns, animals and animal dung may have contributed to the development of mycetoma. All patients had medical treatment and wide local surgical excisions in a mobile surgical unit at the village, except one with massive lesion who was referred to the MRC for further management. As the study population's knowledge, attitude and practice to mycetoma were poor, several health education sessions were conducted. This integrated management approach proved to be practical and successful. The various problems associated with the late presentation of patients and poor treatment outcome were addressed simultaneously at village level. That had encouraged patients to present early with small lesions with good outcome. However, for the longer term management of mycetoma patients, establishment of local medical and health facilities with qualified health staff remains essential and urgent.
