Malaria and dengue fever are typical diseases in tropical regions of developing countries; such as the Brazilian Amazon. They become serious problems in public health as they mostly affect vulnerable populations. Both diseases are mosquito-borne. These diseases present similar signs and symptoms. Brazil registers most of the malaria cases in the Amazon. The four dengue serotypes also circulate in this region. Similar to malaria, there are records of dengue outbreaks during the first months of the year, and isolated cases in the remaining months. Official records of malaria and dengue co-infection are infrequent in Brazil; however, we believe that this event is more frequent than usually reported. Our study detected high prevalence of the co-infection in the hospitalized patients infected with malaria or dengue in a tertiary health care unit, reference in the treatment of tropical and infectious diseases in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. We highlight the high likelihood of co-infected patients to present clinical complications. Besides, we observed that the presence of jaundice in dengue patients, and bleeding in malaria patients, are possible indications of co-infection. Therefore, this paper is useful to physicians working in the tropics, enabling the clinical suspicion of a not so rare condition.
