Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a neglected tropical disease that has been identified by the international community as a candidate for elimination. Both the criteria for verification of elimination and for post-treatment surveillance developed by the international community rely heavily on the use of entomological metrics. Large numbers of vector black flies must be collected to satisfy these metrics. The current standard method for collection of vector black flies for this purpose is human landing collections, is both inefficient and potentially hazardous to the collectors. Here, we report studies evaluating a community-based trial of an inexpensive trap made largely from locally available materials for the replacement of fly collection teams. Traps were provided to residents of a formerly onchocerciasis endemic community in Mexico, and the residents allowed to operate the traps over a 60 day period. The number of flies collected was sufficient to meet the current international criteria necessary to verify that the community was free of O. volvulus transmission. These findings suggest that community based operation of this simple trap might replace human landing collections in the process of verifying the interruption of transmission of onchocerciasis.
