Whipworms are a group of gastrointestinal worms that are both common and globally distributed. These parasites are known to stunt development, especially in school-aged children, and therefore hinder economic, social, and intellectual growth. Unfortunately, research on whipworms has lagged behind its effects, at least in part because this parasite infects the world's poorest populations. Currently, a single species of whipworm is assumed capable of infecting both humans and non-human primates. In this study, we tested this assumption by collecting fecal samples from humans and overlapping non-human primate populations containing monkeys and chimpanzees in Western Uganda. Using molecular analyses, we examined patterns of genetic similarity between human and nonhuman primate whipworms. We identified three genetically distinct groups of whipworms that could not be distinguished by microscopic examination of their eggs. One of these groups was found in all nine species of primates examined, including humans. These findings suggest that some varieties of whipworms are indeed transmissible between humans and non-human primates, which raises concerns for both human health and conservation.
