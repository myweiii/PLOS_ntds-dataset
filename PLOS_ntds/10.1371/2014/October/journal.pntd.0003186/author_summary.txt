People tend to live close to natural water bodies, and often these water bodies are used as waste disposal in many regions of the world. The consequences of this are often studied with regard to bacterial and viral infections, but rarely for parasitic infections. In this study the authors examined a rural community settled along a river in Brazil, and found that the concentration of fecal bacteria in water accumulates as the river runs downstream. Molecular methods were able to show that most of these fecal bacteria were of human origin rather than from local livestock or other domestic animals. To assess the impact of fecal contamination of surface waters, the authors investigated its association with schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection transmitted by snails exposed to water contaminated by human feces. Similar to the distribution of fecal contamination, the proportion of people with schistosomiasis was higher in areas located downstream. A model combining concentration of human fecal bacteria in water and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of schistosomiasis prevalence showed that areas of increased concentration of human feces correlated with areas in the village at higher risk for schistosomiasis. This research provides insight into the dynamics of fecal contamination of rivers and its spatial impact on a human parasitic disease.
