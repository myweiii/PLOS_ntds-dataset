Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting hundreds of millions worldwide. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the current drug of choice against schistosomiasis, and, indeed, is the only approved antischistosomal treatment available in most parts of the world. Though effective overall, PZQ has limitations, including its lack of activity against immature schistosomes. Furthermore, reported cure rates in the field are often below optimal levels, and there is increasing evidence that schistosomes can become resistant to the drug. ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein are efflux transporters that mediate detoxification of cells via removal of toxins and xenobiotics, including drugs. They underlie multidrug resistance in mammalian cells, and are also associated with drug resistance in parasitic worms, including schistosomes. Here, we show that compounds that inhibit these efflux transporters potentiate the activity of PZQ against schistosomes, including normally PZQ-insensitive juvenile worms. Similarly, suppressing expression of these transporters also increases adult worm responsiveness to PZQ. Our experiments may provide insights into the role of these drug transporters in PZQ action, and could also translate into new therapeutic strategies for augmenting treatment of schistosome infections and overcoming drug resistance.
