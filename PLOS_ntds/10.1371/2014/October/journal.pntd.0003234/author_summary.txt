Malaria and Schistosoma mansoni are co-endemic in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies support the hypothesis that concurrent infection with S. mansoni is associated with greater malaria incidence among school-age children. We use mathematical modeling to evaluate the epidemiological impact of S. mansoni infection on malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Using epidemiological data on the increased risk of malaria incidence in S. mansoni endemic communities from Senegal, we developed a co-epidemic model of malaria and S. mansoni transmission dynamics to address key epidemiological interactions between the two diseases. Parameterizing our model for S. mansoni high-risk endemic communities, we show that the interaction between S. mansoni and malaria may reduce the effectiveness of malaria treatment for curtailing malaria transmission. Moreover, we show that in addition to reducing schistosomiasis health burden, mass praziquantel administration will generate indirect benefit in terms of reducing malaria transmission and disease burden in S. mansoniâ€“malaria co-endemic communities. Our findings indicate the possible benefit of scaling up schistosomiasis control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa, and especially in areas were S. mansoni and malaria are highly prevalent.
