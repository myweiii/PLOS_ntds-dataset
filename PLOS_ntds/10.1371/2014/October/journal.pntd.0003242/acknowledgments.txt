The authors would like to thank Dr. Patricia Willkins, Dr. Scott Folk, and Washington University physicians for providing sera from P. kellicotti patients. We thank John Martin, Phillip Ozersky, Rahul Tyagi, and Dr. Bruce Rosa from the Mitreva Lab for assistance with similarity searching and figure preparation, and the Genome Institute production team for RNAseq data generation. The RNAseq data was generated as part of the Foodborne trematode genome project funded by NHGRI (P. kellicotti NCBI BioProject Accession: PRJNA179523). The proteomic sample processing and LC-MS data acquisition by Petra Gilmore, Anne Kettler and Rose Connors at the Washington University Proteomics Core Laboratory is gratefully acknowledged. We thank Jeanne Rumsey for expert proteomic data processing and protein database searching.
