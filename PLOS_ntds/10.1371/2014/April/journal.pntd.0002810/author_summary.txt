Visceral leishmaniasis is suspected to be the second largest parasitic killer in the world after malaria. On the Indian subcontinent, the vector-borne disease is caused by the protozoan flagellate Leishmania donovani and transmitted by the sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes. The regional elimination programme has suggested as a target line to reduce the annual incidence below 1 case in 10,000 by 2015. Using a previously developed mathematical model, we investigated to what extent the sand fly population must be controlled to achieve elimination. These calculated thresholds were compared to data from two recent trials conducted in India, Nepal and Bangladesh to evaluate the efficacy of different vector control measures. Our results indicate that elimination should be feasible because the evaluated effect of indoor residual spraying exceeds the threshold. However, emerging insecticide resistance may compromise the effectiveness of this measure. The observed effects of long lasting insecticidal nets and environmental management do not seem to be sufficient to reach either threshold. Integrated vector management based on indoor residual spraying combined with long lasting insecticidal nets and more effective environmental management may allow overcoming the limitations of the current vector control methods and should also prevent re-emergence of the infection after local extinction.
