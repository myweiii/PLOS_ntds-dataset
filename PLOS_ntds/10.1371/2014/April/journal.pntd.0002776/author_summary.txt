Chagas disease is caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, vectored in Mexico in both rural and urban areas via one of 18 triatomine bug species. Despite ample morbidity and mortality evidence, however, health policy managers in Mexico have continued to neglect prevention, control and clinical attention for the disease. A computer simulation Markov model was programmed and fed with information from published evidence and an expert panel. The lifetime cost for a timely diagnosed and treated Chagas disease patient is US$ 10,160, while the cost for an undiagnosed individual is US$ 11,877. The cost of a diagnosed and treated case increases 24-fold from early acute to indeterminate stage. The major cost component for lifetime cost was working days lost, between 44% and 75%, depending on the program scenario for timely diagnosis and treatment. Timely medical attention for infected individuals is cheaper than doing nothing, especially if life and labor costs are included. The evidence provided, essential for decision-making, should be used to develop disease-specific prevention, control and patient clinical diagnosis and treatment policies for Chagas disease in Mexico.
