Infections by food-borne trematodes are estimated to infect over 40 million people worldwide, although infections by echinostomes make up only a portion of these cases, usually in regions where their prevalence is high. In South East Asia and in the far east of Asia, human infection is associated with cultural and dietary factors and the prevalence of infection may reach 50% in parts of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Treatment is generally dependent on the use of praziquantel or benzimidazole drugs but with the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance to these compounds it would be desirable to have an understanding of the diversity present in the echinostome populations within a given locality. This study deals with the systematics of echinostomes and informs various aspects of the epidemiology of echinostomiasis which may aid the development of future control strategies.
