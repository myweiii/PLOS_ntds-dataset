West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that can infect mammals, including humans. Most infected humans do not develop disease, but in about 20% of cases humans develop WNV-related disease symptoms, varying in severity from fever to a sometimes life-threatening neuro-invasive disease. The number of WNV infections in Europe has increased in recent years and is caused by viruses that are genetically different from the viruses that caused the WNV epidemic in North America. In this study, we have experimentally infected two different monkey species, rhesus macaques and common marmosets, with the European WNV isolate Ita09 to evaluate the early events after infection and the onset of the disease. Both species were equally susceptible to infection with WNV-Ita09, but differences between species were observed. Compared to rhesus macaques, common marmosets had higher virus loads in blood, and presented a wider distribution of the virus in various organs. Based on the analysis of virological, immunological, biochemical and hematological parameters, we conclude that rhesus macaques as well as common marmosets are potentially useful animal models to evaluate vaccine candidates or to investigate WNV pathogenesis.
