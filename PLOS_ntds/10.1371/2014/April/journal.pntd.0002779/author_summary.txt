Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe disease present in Chile, Argentina and other countries in the Americas. Mortality rates for HPS can be as high as 60% for some outbreaks. Although hantavirus outbreaks tend to be small, the high death rate, unavailability of a vaccine, and occurrence of infections in rural regions where individuals are least likely to have appropriate healthcare make HPS forecasting an important public health issue in Chile and other countries. We present an approach for modeling and forecasting confirmed HPS cases in Chile. Seasonal time series models that predict future cases based on previous cases appear reasonable. However, adding climate variables such as precipitation, which is thought to indirectly influence outbreaks of hantavirus slightly improves the model fit. To further improve the current models to make them more useful for public health preparedness/interventions, data at the regional level with reliable predictions several months into the future are needed.
