The parasite Schistosoma infects over 200 million people world-wide and can cause serious morbidity. Infection occurs following exposure to larvae (cercariae) which release excretory/secretory (E/S) material to aid their entry into exposed skin. Larvae mature into adult worms that produce hundreds of eggs per day which also release E/S material. Both sources of E/S material have the potential to stimulate the hostâ€™s innate immune system. Circulating monocytes are important cells that act as potential sentinels in the recognition of these E/S materials. Different sub-sets of human monocytes can be identified according to their expression of CD14 and CD16 but their role following infection with schistosome helminths has not been investigated. In the current study, three sub-sets (classical, intermediate and non-classical) were enumerated in individuals living in a region co-endemic for S. mansoni and S. haematobium. Although all three monocyte sub-sets bound to fluorescently-labelled schistosome E/S material, the intermediate sub-set had significantly enhanced ability to recognise cercarial and egg E/S in co-infected participants. This is the first demonstration that circulating human monocytes can recognize schistosome E/S antigens and that their ability to do so is modulated by infection which may affect the development of schistosome immunopathology and/or protective immunity.
