Coagulative tissue necrosis and local immunosuppression caused by the M. ulcerans macrolide toxin mycolactone are typical features of Buruli ulcer disease (BU). In particular in BU endemic remote rural areas of West Africa, patients often report with large ulcerated lesions. Despite the availability of an effective dual antimycobacterial antibiotic therapy, some ulcerative lesions may take long time to healing and represent a major burden for the patients as well as for the health system. Proper wound healing is a well-orchestrated process involving numerous cellular and acellular components. Here we have performed immunohistochemical studies with tissue from BU lesions collected before, during and after antibiotic treatment. We identified a set of markers which are appropriate to evaluate formation of granulation tissue (alpha-smooth muscle positive fibroblasts), matrix deposition (pro-collagen 1, fibronectin and tenascin C), cell activation (phosphorylated S6), hyper proliferation of the epidermis (cytokeratin 16) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) during wound healing. These markers may become suitable for assessing progression of tissue repair and for investigating the functional basis of impaired wound healing.
