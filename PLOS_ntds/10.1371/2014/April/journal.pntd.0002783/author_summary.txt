Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and currently affects approximately 8 million people in Latin American countries. Although vector control campaigns against the most effective Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, have been highly successful, T. infestans is re-establishing in once-endemic regions. To monitor re-establishing triatomines, new epidemiological tools are needed. Antibody responses of hosts to triatomine salivary proteins represent a promising tool to detect biting bugs, and highly immunogenic salivary antigens may be used as markers of triatomine exposure. Therefore, we analyzed the antibody response of guinea pigs, common peridomestic hosts of T. infestans, to salivary proteins of nymphs and adults of four different T. infestans strains from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Developmental stage- and strain-specific proteins in the saliva of T. infestans influenced the antibody response of guinea pigs, and different salivary antigens were recognized by guinea pig sera. Despite the variations of immunogenic salivary antigens, a 35 kDa antigen was recognized by almost all guinea pig sera and this antigen may be a useful marker of T. infestans exposure.
