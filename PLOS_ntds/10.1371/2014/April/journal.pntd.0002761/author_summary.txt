Trachoma, which is caused by infection by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. Annual mass drug administration with azithromycin is recommended for trachoma control; however, monitoring the impact of azithromycin, which targets C. trachomatis, relies on the clinical assessment of follicular trachoma. If the relationship between chlamydial infection and the presence or absence of follicular trachoma were to remain unchanged with each round of treatment, we would be able to predict the level of residual infection, and the need for additional treatment, from the prevalence of follicular trachoma. In this study, we examined the association between infection and presence or absence of follicular trachoma in children prior to and following multiple rounds of treatment. Findings suggest that with increasing rounds of treatment, the prevalence of infection declines in children both with and without signs of follicular trachoma. Newer strategies, including tests that can rapidly detect infection under field conditions, may be needed to assess residual infection in treated communities.
