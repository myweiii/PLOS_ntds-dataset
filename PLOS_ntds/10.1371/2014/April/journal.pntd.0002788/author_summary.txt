Paracoccin is a constituent of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a human pathogen that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. Paracoccin is a dual function protein with domains for lectin and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. Proteomic analysis of paracoccin preparation revealed its correspondence to a hypothetical protein from the P. brasiliensis isolate Pb-18, annotated as PADG-3347, which has a polypeptide sequence similar to family 18 endochitinases. These endochitinases are multi-functional proteins with distinct lectin and enzymatic activity domains. The multi-exon assembly of the correspondent gene (PADG-3347) was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the physical and biological features of the recombinant protein was compared to those of the native paracoccin. Moreover, recombinant PADG-3347 was evaluated for its immunomodulatory properties and its ability to confer protection against murine P. brasiliensis infection. The results presented herein showed that mice treated with recombinant paracoccin displayed lower pulmonary fungal burdens and reduced pulmonary granulomas. These protective effects were associated with augmented pulmonary levels of IL-12 and IFN-Î³.
