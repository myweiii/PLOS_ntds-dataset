Buruli ulcer, a severe skin disease in West and Central Africa results in significant disability. The causative bacterium, M. ulcerans has been detected in many aquatic sources, but how bacteria enter the skin is an enigma. Two major hypotheses for infection are 1) that bacteria are injected into the skin through the bite of an aquatic insect, or 2) that bacteria enter open wounds on a person's body. In this study, we use a guinea pig infection model to evaluate whether application of M. ulcerans to an open abrasion produces Buruli ulcer. Our results show that despite topical application of very large numbers of M. ulcerans, we are unable to produce infection in open abrasions. These results are extremely surprising because most bacteria such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus can readily infect abrasions. In contrast, intra-dermal injection of M. ulcerans into the skin of guinea pigs consistently produced an ulcer. Our studies are the first to explore the route of infection of M. ulcerans in an experimental model. These results suggest that Buruli ulcer is not likely to be due to passive entry of bacteria into pre-existing abrasions and supports the role of biting invertebrates, puncture wounds, or lacerations as a requirement for infection.
