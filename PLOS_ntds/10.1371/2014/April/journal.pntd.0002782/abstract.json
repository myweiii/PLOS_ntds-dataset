    "Background": "Chagas disease has historically been hyperendemic in the Bolivian Department of Cochabamba. In the early 2000s, an extensive vector control program was implemented; 1.34 million dwelling inspections were conducted to ascertain infestation (2000\u20132001/2003\u20132011), with blanket insecticide spraying in 2003\u20132005 and subsequent survey-spraying cycles targeting residual infestation foci. Here, we assess the effects of this program on dwelling infestation rates (DIRs).",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "Program records were used to calculate annual, municipality-level aggregate DIRs (39 municipalities); very high values in 2000\u20132001 (median: 0.77\u20130.69) dropped to \u223c0.03 from 2004 on. A linear mixed model (with municipality as a random factor) suggested that infestation odds decreased, on average, by \u223c28% (95% confidence interval [CI95] 6\u201344%) with each 10-fold increase in control effort. A second, better-fitting mixed model including year as an ordinal predictor disclosed large DIR reductions in 2001\u20132003 (odds ratio [OR] 0.11, CI95 0.06\u20130.19) and 2003\u20132004 (OR 0.22, CI95 0.14\u20130.34). Except for a moderate decrease in 2005\u20132006, no significant changes were detected afterwards. In both models, municipality-level DIRs correlated positively with previous-year DIRs and with the extent of municipal territory originally covered by montane dry forests.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Insecticide-spraying campaigns had very strong, long-lasting effects on DIRs in Cochabamba. However, post-intervention surveys consistently detected infestation in \u223c3% of dwellings, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance; higher DIRs were recorded in the capital city and, more generally, in municipalities dominated by montane dry forest \u2013 an eco-region where wild Triatoma infestans are widespread. Traditional strategies combining insecticide spraying and longitudinal surveillance are thus confirmed as very effective means for area-wide Chagas disease vector control; they will be particularly beneficial in highly-endemic settings, but should also be implemented or maintained in other parts of Latin America where domestic infestation by triatomines is still commonplace."
