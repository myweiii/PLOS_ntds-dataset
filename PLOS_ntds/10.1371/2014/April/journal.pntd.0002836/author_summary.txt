Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) has been detected in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and guyanensis species, parasites causing not only cutaneous but also mucosal and disseminated leishmaniases. In a mouse model, the viral dsRNA genome within L. guyanensis parasites is recognized by host Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, typically IL-6 and TNF-α, which are hallmarks of human mucosal leishmaniasis. Metastatisic complications such as mucosal and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis have also been described in other parts of the world, e.g. in Ethiopia. We detected LRV within L. aethiopica human isolates. Sequencing of three L. aethiopica LRVs (LRV-Lae) genomes confirmed that LRV-Lae belongs to the same Totiviridae family of LRVs found in South American species (LRV1) and present in a single L. major isolate from Turkmenistan (LRV2). LRV-Lae genomic organization is similar but not identical to the other LRVs, with a unique −1 frameshift situation in the overlapping region of the capsid protein/polymerase genes. Finally and similarly to L. guyanensis LRV1, LRV-Lae induced a TLR3-dependent inflammatory response in infected macrophages. The presence of LRV and its detection could be a crucial step towards better understanding the pathology spectrum of L. aethiopica infections.
