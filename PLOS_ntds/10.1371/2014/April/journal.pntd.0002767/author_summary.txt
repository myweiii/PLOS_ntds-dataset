Relapsing fever spirochetes cause recurrent febrile episodes, rigors, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and pregnancy complications, and are a leading cause of hospital admissions in regions of Africa. Routes of pathogen transmission include crushed human body lice and feces, or through bites by Ornithodoros spp. of ticks. The life cycle of Ornithodoros turicatae, the vector of Borrelia turicatae, includes over six nymphal stages, upwards of a ten year life span, and a bloodmeal that is completed within an hour. We investigated B. turicatae transmission from the tick vector and assessed the rapidity of spirochete entry into the mammal and dissemination in the blood. Salivary glands from infected ticks were also evaluated to visualize B. turicatae within the tissues to determine spirochete localization. We conclude that given the transmission dynamics of B. turicatae, it may be important to target conserved surface proteins that relapsing fever spirochetes produce in the salivary glands in order to develop preventative measures against the pathogens.
