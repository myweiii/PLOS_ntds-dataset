Female genital schistosomiasis commonly remains undiagnosed due to its unacknowledged clinical manifestations. Millions of women in endemic areas are infected, and many suffer from abnormal vaginal discharge, contact bleeding, genital tumours, ectopic pregnancies, and an increased susceptibility to HIV. Sandy patches and rubbery papules identified by visual inspection may serve as indicators for the diagnosis of genital schistosomiasis. However, text books do not contain this information and it is not taught in medical school or to nurses serving these patients in endemic areas. The aim of this Atlas is to present the photocolposcopic manifestations of schistosomiasis in the lower female genital tract. Photocolposcopic images were captured from women between 15 and 49 years of age, between 1994 and 2012 in four different sites endemic for S. haematobium in Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Madagascar. This is the first atlas to present the clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis. Two types of sandy patches, abnormal blood vessels and rubbery papules are shown, as well as differential diagnoses. PloS NTDs makes it possible for all to access this information.
