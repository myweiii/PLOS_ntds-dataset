Leprosy presents with a polarized spectrum, with lepromatous leprosy having high bacillary numbers and TH2 dermal cytokines, versus tuberculoid leprosy showing very few bacilli and TH1 cytokines. The mechanism underlying this polarized presentation is largely unknown. In the following study, we isolated mRNA from skin biopsies from 85 individuals with leprosy and measured the expression of a panel of 24 cytokines and 6 cell markers. We found that three soluble mediators (CCL17, CCL18 and IL10) and one cell marker (CD14) were differentially expressed in leprosy dermal lesions. CCL18 and IL10 were more highly expressed within lepromatous lesions, and CCL17 and CD14 were more highly expressed within tuberculoid lesions. In addition, CCL18 protein expression was confirmed by immunostaining. CCL17 and CCL18, were more strongly associated with leprosy polarity than traditional TH1 and TH2 cytokines. These data suggest that newer soluble chemokines may be important in leprosy pathogenesis and uncover a molecular signature of the two polar phenotypes of leprosy, which may be useful in future diagnostics.
