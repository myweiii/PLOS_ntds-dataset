We would like to thank the members of the nonhuman primate animal core (especially Al Legasse, Shannon Planer, Sierra Paxton, Merete Ohm and Miranda Fischer) for sample collection and assistance with necropsy; as well as the Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) at the Oregon National Primate Research Center for superb animal care and husbandry. We also thank Dr. Karla Fenton (University of Texas, Medical Branch, Galveston National Laboratories) for input regarding the histopathology.
