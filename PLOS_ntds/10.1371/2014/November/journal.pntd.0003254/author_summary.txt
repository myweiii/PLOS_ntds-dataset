Buruli ulcer is a stigmatising condition caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. Besides the long term medical consequences, Buruli ulcer may lead to participation restrictions in social life. The Participation Scale intends to assess perceived participation restrictions; however, this instrument has been developed in patients affected by leprosy and other disabling conditions, and has never been used before among Buruli ulcer patients. We aimed to analyze the reliability and validity of the Participation Scale among former Buruli ulcer patients in Ghana and Benin. This study included former Buruli ulcer patients from 2 different treatment sites, along with their relatives and healthy community controls residing in similar geographical areas. Former Buruli ulcer patients were interviewed using the Participation Scale, Buruli Ulcer Functional Limitation Score, and the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue to measure stigma. Relatives and healthy community controls were interviewed using the Participation Scale. We tested the Participation Scale for discrimination, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, inter-item correlation, item-total correlation and construct validity. The results of the analysis suggest that the Participation Scale has acceptable psychometric properties. As such, the instrument can be used to assess participation restrictions among former Buruli ulcer patients in Ghana and Benin.
