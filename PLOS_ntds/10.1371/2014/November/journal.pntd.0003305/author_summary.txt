Lymphatic Filariasis is the largest world-wide source of secondary lymphedema and is caused by parasitic nematodes that migrate to and dwell in the lymphatic system. The World Health Organization estimates that over 120 million people in 73 countries are currently infected, and a further 1.4 billion live in infection-prone areas. Infection is initiated when a mosquito deposits infective larvae on the skin of the human host. The larvae then penetrate the skin at the site of the bite and migrate to afferent lymphatic vessels feeding into lymph nodes, where they mature into adult worms. While a large portion of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, many individuals show signs of potent immune responses that result in diseases such as lymphedema, elephantiasis and hydrocele. Through mass drug administration it is possible to kill the microfilariae stage of the parasite, which is the infective form for the mosquito intermediate host. There are currently no proven treatments for the adult worm, thus making it difficult to treat the estimated 120 million people already infected. Understanding how and why these parasites migrate to and reside in the lymphatic system will further aid researchers in designing treatment strategies that interrupt this mechanism. Here we describe an in vitro platform that allows researchers to quantify the migration behavior and the effects of drugs while maintaining the worm in the presence of cells typical of the host infection site.
