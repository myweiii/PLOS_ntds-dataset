The riverine tsetse Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and Glossina tachinoides are among the principal vectors of African trypanosomiasis. Their range stretches from West across Central to East Africa, with isolated populations in Sudan and Ethiopia. Population suppression is one of the most effective methods to control disease transmission and has led to the development of visually attractive insecticide-impregnated traps and targets for palpalis tsetse species for over half a century. We describe field experiments made in different seasons in Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya to establish the most efficient and long-lasting object that induces the strongest landing responses in G. f. fuscipes and G. tachinoides. Independent of season and country, targets made from black and blue fabrics (either phthalogen or turquoise) covered with adhesive film render them equal to or more efficient than traps at capturing G. f. fuscipes and G. tachinoides. Biconical trap efficiency varied between 25% and 33% for both species. As landings per unit area on smaller phthalogen blue-black targets were significantly higher than landings on corresponding 1 m2 targets, we propose a 0.5 m high√ó0.75 m wide blue-black target as a practical cost-effective device for management of G. f. fuscipes and G. tachinoides populations.
