We conducted this comprehensive systematic review to determine the impact of dengue disease in Thailand for the period 2000â€“2011, and to identify future research priorities. Well-defined methods were used to search and identify relevant published research, according to predetermined inclusion criteria. In addition to information from studies published in the literature, the review draws largely on surveillance data from the Annual Epidemiological Surveillance Reports published by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. The pattern of annual number of reported dengue cases over the review period was complicated by epidemic years; consequently, a trend in the number of reported cases could not be identified. It was apparent that despite a shift in age group distribution dengue from younger towards older persons, dengue in Thailand remains a predominantly childhood disease. The seasonality and heterogeneous spatial and temporal nature of the disease were confirmed. It is clear that the nationwide passive surveillance system is a source of consistent data relating to severity, age and serotype. However, several gaps were identified that would benefit the understanding of dengue epidemiology in Thailand, such as seroprevalence data and a record of the proportion of reported cases that are hospitalized.
