Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU) which affects the skin, can lead to extensive ulceration, and often results in disabilities. The exact mode of transmission of the disease is still unknown. Previous studies have identified demographic, socio-economic, health and hygiene, as well as environment, related risk factors for BU. This case-control study was done to ascertain the risk factors in a study area in Ghana which was previously non-endemic for BU. The study involved 226 participants, of which 50% were BU confirmed cases and 50% age-, gender-, and community matched controls (persons who had no signs or symptoms of active or inactive BU). This study found presence of wetland, insect bites in water, use of adhesive when injured, and washing in the Densu river as risk factors associated with BU. These factors were similar to previous studies and hence should be used in the implementation of national BU control strategies.
