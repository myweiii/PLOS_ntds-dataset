Dengue is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral disease. It represents a formidable public health problem that is expanding in both infection rates and geographical range. Fortunately, vaccines, improved diagnostics, innovative vector control approaches, and other disease control methods are under development. Despite the importance of dengue, there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude of the disease burden and economic cost of dengue, particularly in the number of symptomatic dengue infections. There is substantial variation in national reporting systems for dengue, which hinders accurate estimates of total cases and, therefore, of economic burden. Here we suggest a combination of immediate, short-term, and longer term strategies to address this knowledge gap. Immediate strategies include, for example, documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization. Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to improve estimates of dengue incidence. Long-term efforts include increasing the collection and analysis of seroprevalence and economic data, use of enhanced surveillance (e.g., use of incentives to improve reporting, include private sector sentinel sites). Implementing these steps would give policy makers more reliable, systematic data for strengthening and refining policies about the application and financing of new technologies to control dengue.
