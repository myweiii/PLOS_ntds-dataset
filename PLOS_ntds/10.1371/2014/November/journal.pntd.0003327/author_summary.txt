Typhus is an under-recognised and under-studied public health problem in Asia. In rural areas of Southeast Asia murine and scrub typhus are probably the most common treatable cause of fever. The estimated number of scrub typhus cases in Southeast Asia, more than 1 million yearly, results in approximately 50â€“80,000 deaths per year. Treatment delays due to lack of appropriate diagnostics and lack of awareness lead to a substantial health and economic impact in the one of the world's most densely populated regions. Only 97 cases in pregnancy are available from the published world literature over the past 18 years. Only 82 of these had known outcomes, including two maternal deaths. The proportion of poor neonatal outcome including stillbirth, prematurity and low birth weight was high occurring in more than 40% of pregnancies, and higher when the fever clearance time was longer. While poor neonatal outcomes were observed with all antibiotics prescribed, azithromycin appeared to be associated with shorter fever clearance times but this was not statistically significant. Evidence to support the use of azithromycin is weak. The correct antimicrobial or combination for undifferentiated fever in pregnant women in Southeast Asia is unknown.
