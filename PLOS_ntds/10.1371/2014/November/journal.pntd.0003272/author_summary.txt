Cryptococcosis is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, with the most serious manifestation of disease being infection of the central nervous system (CNS). C. neoformans tends to cause disease in immunosuppressed patients, especially those infected with HIV, while C. gattii affects immunocompetent patients preferentially. C. gattii is usually endemic in tropical and subtropical areas. However, highly virulent strains have recently emerged in temperate areas, such as British Columbia in Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The Colombian national cryptococcal survey characterized the demographic, clinical manifestations and microbiological aspects of C. gattii cryptococcosis. An annual average incidence of infection of 0.07 cases/million inhabitants/year was determined. In contrast, in Norte de Santander the incidence reached 0.81 cases/million inhabitants/year. The national prevalence was 3.7% among all forms of cryptococcosis. Involvement of the CNS (88%) was the commonest clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis. Molecular type VGII, which is the same molecular type as described in the recent outbreaks of this mycosis, was the most prevalent. Overall, clinical C. gattii strains from Colombia showed great genetic diversity. This work contributes to knowledge of the global epidemiology of cryptococcosis and its clinical behavior in Colombian patients.
