    "Background": "Interleukin (IL)-10 levels are increased in dengue virus (DENV)-infected patients with severe disorders. A hypothetical intrinsic pathway has been proposed for the IL-10 response during antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection; however, the mechanisms of IL-10 regulation remain unclear.",
    "Principle Finding": "We found that DENV infection and/or attachment was sufficient to induce increased expression of IL-10 and its downstream regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. IL-10 production was controlled by activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB), primarily through protein kinase A (PKA)- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PKB-regulated pathways, with PKA activation acting upstream of PI3K/PKB. DENV infection also caused glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β inactivation in a PKA/PI3K/PKB-regulated manner, and inhibition of GSK-3β significantly increased DENV-induced IL-10 production following CREB activation. Pharmacological inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) activity significantly decreased DENV-induced IL-10 production, whereas silencing Syk-associated C-type lectin domain family 5 member A caused a partial inhibition. ADE of DENV infection greatly increased IL-10 expression by enhancing Syk-regulated PI3K/PKB/GSK-3β/CREB signaling. We also found that viral load, but not serotype, affected the IL-10 response. Finally, modulation of IL-10 expression could affect DENV replication.",
    "Significance": "These results demonstrate that, in monocytes, IL-10 production is regulated by ADE through both an extrinsic and an intrinsic pathway, all involving a Syk-regulated PI3K/PKB/GSK-3β/CREB pathway, and both of which impact viral replication."
