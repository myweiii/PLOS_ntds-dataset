Persons affected by neglected tropical diseases, such as, Buruli ulcer, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis and leprosy, can experience stigma. One important source of stigma are members in the community. Neighbours, religious leaders, and community leaders can exclude, reject, blame or devalue a person affected by one of these diseases. It is important to be able to assess this type of stigma for the prevention and management of these diseases. Assessing stigma is not an easy task. There are several instruments available, but these were developed with different aims or tested in different settings. We can use these instruments, but we need to be sure that they assess what we want them to assess and whether the instrument produces consistent results. In this paper the authors report a study that investigated the validity of two scales that assess stigma in the community towards people affected by leprosy in Indonesia. The names of the scales are Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue Community Stigma Scale (EMIC-CSS) and Social Distance Scale (SDS). The results show the two scales to be adequately valid and reliable in the target culture. There are, however, also several improvements possible and the authors provide suggestions how to incorporate these. In addition, the authors provide recommendations for the use of these scales among people affected by other neglected tropical diseases.
