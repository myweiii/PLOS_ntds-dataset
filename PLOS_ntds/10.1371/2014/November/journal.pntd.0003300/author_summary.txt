It is known that CD8+ T cells are important for primary immunity to low dose L. major infection, but whether low dose-induced immunity is long lasting and whether CD8+ T cells are also important for memory immune response to low dose L. major is unknown. We studied whether infectious dose affects primary anti-Leishmania immunity and the contribution of CD8+ T cells in immunity following recovery from low and high dose infections. We found that low and high dose infections preferentially induced proliferation and cytokine production by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, during early and late stages of infections. Also, both low and high dose-infected mice were solidly protected against secondary L. major challenge. Depletion of CD4+ cells in mice that healed low and high dose infections abolished resistance to secondary challenge, but depletion of CD8+ cells had no effect. Together, our results show that although CD8+ T cells are selectively activated and contribute to optimal primary immunity after low dose infection, they are not required for secondary immunity. This research further enhances our understanding of the immunobiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
