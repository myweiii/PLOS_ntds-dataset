Viral etiologies of fever, such as dengue, Chikungunya, influenza, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality particularly in children in the tropical and subtropical countries. Despite their importance, the true burden of viral etiologies of fever in Tanzania is not known, and in most cases these diseases are unrecognized and treated as malaria. This study aimed to identify viral etiologies as a cause of fever in children and co-infections among viral diseases and malaria. A total of 364 febrile children were enrolled, of these, 83 (22.8%) had malaria, 76(20.9%) had presumptive acute dengue, among those, 29(38.2%) were confirmed cases. Dengue was more likely to occur in children aged ≥ 5 years than in <5 years (OR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.35–3.86). Presumptive acute Chikungunya infection was found in 17(4.7%) of patients. Co-infections between malaria and Chikungunya, malaria and dengue as well as Chikungunya and dengue were observed. Furthermore, 5(5.2%) of the patients had influenza virus, 5(12.8%) had rotavirus and 2(5.1%) had adenovirus. Knowledge on occurrence of these viral etiologies of febrile illnesses will alert clinicians to be more responsive towards viral infectious agents as potential causes of febrile illnesses in the routine diagnosis and management of febrile patients.
