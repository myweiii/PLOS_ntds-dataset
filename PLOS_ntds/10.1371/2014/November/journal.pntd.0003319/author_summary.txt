The mass drug administration (MDA) programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) was initiated in 2000. By the end of 2012, the programme was in place in 55 endemic countries. During these first 13 years (2000â€“2012) of programme implementation, 6.37 billion annual single dose anti-filarial treatments were offered and 4.45 billion doses were consumed by the target populations. This massive programme is estimated to have prevented or cured 96.71 million LF cases that include 79.20 million microfilaria carriers, 18.73 million hydrocele cases and a minimum of 5.49 million lymphedema cases, a 59% reduction of initial LF levels. It is further estimated that, currently, i.e. after 13 years of the MDA programme, 67.88 million LF cases remain, including 36.45 million microfilaria carriers, 19.43 million hydrocele cases and 16.68 million lymphedema cases. Progressive reduction in this burden is possible as the programme extends to the endemic countries and regions within endemic countries that have not yet been covered by the MDA programme, and if the morbidity management component of the programme can be effectively implemented.
