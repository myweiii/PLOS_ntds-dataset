With intensified malaria control in endemic countries, there have been dramatic changes of malaria epidemiology. One of such changes is the increased proportion of Plasmodium vivax malaria, a demonstration of resilience of this parasite to control efforts. In Thailand, malaria has been largely eliminated from the central plain, and transmission is concentrated in isolated international border regions. This study aimed to examine whether the changing malaria epidemiology was reflected in the population dynamics and genetic diversity of the isolated parasite populations. We collected parasite samples from two regions in Thailand with drastically different endemicity settings and used a polymorphic genetic marker (Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 3β – pvmsp3β) as an indicator of genetic diversity of the populations. Analysis of the pvmsp3β sequences revealed high genetic diversity of parasites from western Thailand, and suggested the suitability of this gene as a molecular marker to infer parasite genetic diversity. Comparing the pvmsp3β sequences, we further discovered extreme divergence in genetic diversity between the southern and northwestern Thai P. vivax populations. Our study offers important insights into malaria epidemiology and provides the needed knowledge for designing novel control tools in the malaria elimination campaigns.
