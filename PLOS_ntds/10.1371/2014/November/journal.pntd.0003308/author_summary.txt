Distinct laboratory mouse based models have allowed elucidating some of the processes that account for so called resistance or vulnerability to the Leishmania major parasite cutaneous inoculation. The outcome ranges from rapid healing – C57BL/6 mice- to progressive nonhealing ones – BALB/c mice. Distinct cell lineages contribute to sense and process molecules derived from the L. major parasite. Previous studies revealed a role for intracellular Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in host resistance to Leishmania major. L. major DNA is involved in innate immune response, since it induces TLR9 signaling and activation of dendritic cells. We were interested to further explore L. major DNA sequences focusing on their features as (a) either direct TLR9 agonists or antagonists (b) as well as once partnering with endogenous DNA binding proteins. We more specifically used mouse dendritic cells as sensing cells of L. major DNA as well as DNA from other Trypanosomatidae in comparison with vertebrate DNA. Overall, the data underscore a counter-selection of TLR9 agonist motifs in vertebrate DNA which is not found in Trypanosomatidae DNAs and suggest how TLR9 could discriminate between pathogen and self DNAs, to maintain the cellular integrity.
