Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are a group of viruses that can have major impacts on public health, animal health and agricultural trade, and appear to be increasing in both number and prevalence worldwide. Despite their importance as emerging pathogens, the spatial patterns, long-term seasonal characteristics and drivers of seasonality in many arboviruses are poorly understood. The island continent of Australia provides an ideal case study for the spatial analysis of emerging arboviruses, harboring diverse climatic conditions across a wide range of latitudes. Herein we utilize long-term serological data from a nationwide network of sentinel herds in Australia to describe the seasonality of three economically important animal arboviruses: bluetongue virus, Akabane virus and bovine ephemeral fever virus. Using epidemiological time series analysis, we demonstrate that these viruses exhibit a distinct spatial pattern in both the peak timing and intensity of annual epidemic cycles, with the strongest seasonality observed in southerly geographic regions. In addition, we reveal the climatic factors that drive patterns of arbovirus distribution and, by doing so, provide a more complete understanding of arbovirus seasonality, which in turn will improve the risk assessment of these viruses.
