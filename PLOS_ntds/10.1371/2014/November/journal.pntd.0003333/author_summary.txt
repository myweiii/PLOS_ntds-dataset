Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a widespread neglected tropical disease most frequently recognized as elephantiasis that is caused by parasitic worms and spread by mosquitoes. To overcome this public health problem, the World Health Organization created the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 2000, subsequently committing to the elimination of LF as a public health problem by the year 2020. Between 2000 and 2012, GPELF provided over 4.4 billion treatments in 56 endemic countries. In order to assess the progress during the first 13 years of GPELF in reducing the at-risk population (initially 1.2 billion) requiring treatment for LF, we developed a model that indicates that the number of people remaining at-risk of infection has decreased by nearly half through 2012 to 789 million people globally. This is important progress in the global efforts to eliminate LF, but significant scale-up is still required over the next 8 years to achieve the 2020 elimination goal.
