Tropical theileriosis is a leukaemia-like disease of cattle caused by the Apicomplexa parasite Theileria annulata. Live attenuated vaccines are used to control the mortality and morbidity of tropical theileriosis and each endemic country produces its own vaccine by isolating a virulent clinical isolate and then growing the infected and transformed macrophages for many months in the laboratory. With time, virulence is progressively lost, and loss is evaluated from time to time by injecting infected macrophages into calves and monitoring any resulting pathology. If the calves demonstrate clinical symptoms, in vitro culture of vaccine lines continues, and eventually attenuation is achieved after approximately two years. The process is empirical, and with time in culture the infected macrophage lines lose their vaccine potential such that when cattle are injected the immune response to the vaccine can be compromised. To circumvent these problems we engineered the rapid loss of a host macrophage virulence trait and obtained complete attenuation of dissemination of T. annulataâ€“transformed macrophages when tested in an immune-compromised mouse model. This rational, rather than empirical, approach now allows injecting into calves Theileria-infected macrophages engineered for attenuation to evaluate the role of Theileria-infected macrophage dissemination in the pathology of tropical theileriosis.
