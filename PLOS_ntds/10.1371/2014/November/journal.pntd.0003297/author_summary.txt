Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquito bites. Globally, 120 million people are affected, and 40 million are disfigured and disabled by complications such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons. In American Samoa, significant progress has been made towards LF elimination, and antigen prevalence has dropped from 16.5% in 1999 to <1% in 2011/2012 after seven rounds of MDA. Current challenges include identification of any residual hotspots of ongoing transmission, and effective strategies for early identification of any resurgence. Our study examined the prevalence and spatial distribution of LF antigens and antibodies in American Samoan adults to improve understanding of LF transmission in an area of low prevalence, develop tools and strategies to more accurately verify interruption of transmission, and provide evidence-based guidance for future elimination strategies in American Samoa.
