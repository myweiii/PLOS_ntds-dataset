Data on the prevalence and distribution of Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm) is scarce in many resource-poor countries. We carried out a cross-sectional study during the dry season among 2,396 rural Cambodians of all ages. We used a rigorous diagnostic approach, involving two stool samples per person and two examination techniques, namely, Koga agar plate culture and the Baermann method. We predicted the spatial distribution of S. stercoralis using Bayesian Kriging analysis. Almost half of the participants (44.7%) were infected with S. stercoralis. Of the S. stercoralis cases, 39.7% involved participants under 16 years old. S. stercoralis infection prevalence was significantly higher in males than in females. Participants younger than 10 years old had a lower risk of infection than did older participants. Furthermore, our study showed that toilet use could prevent threadworm infections by 39%. Infection prevalence in the province was negatively associated with rainfall and soil organic content and positively associated with land covered by rice fields. We conclude that access to adequate treatment for S. stercoralis must be addressed in Cambodia. Infection prevalence is likely to be similar in other countries of the region and the developing world.
