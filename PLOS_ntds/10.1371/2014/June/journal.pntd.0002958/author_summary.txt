Fishborne zoonotic trematodes (FZT) are small parasitic flatworms (flukes) living either in the intrahepatic bile ducts or in the intestines of humans and many species of animals and birds. Transmission occurs by eating infected raw freshwater fish. FZT are especially common in Southeast and East Asia. WHO suggests using preventive chemotherapy in the control of these parasites by providing an effective drug, praziquantel, once a year to either all inhabitants in the endemic areas or selectively to those who are at special risk because they eat raw fish. Preventive chemotherapy has been used for some years in Northern Vietnam, but the effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined. We followed a group of 396 people who had eaten raw fish and examined the stool for the presence of trematode eggs before preventive chemotherapy and two, 16, 29 and 60 weeks after. The proportions of egg positive persons were 40.2% before, 2.3% two weeks after and increased to 29.8% sixty weeks after preventive chemotherapy. We found a high rate of reinfection. Contribution from animals to the transmission implies that preventive chemotherapy of humans alone will most likely be insufficient to control the FZT infections.
