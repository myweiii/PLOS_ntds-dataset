Mycetoma, a unique neglected tropical disease, is characterised by massive deformity and disability presenting with painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses that produce sero-purulent discharge. Secondary bacterial infection is common in mycetoma and it is assumed that, this bacterial co-infection reduces the effectiveness of the antifungal treatment and is responsible for the poor treatment outcome. To investigate this hypothesis, this study examined the combination of Ketoconazole and antibiotics in two groups of patients with eumycetoma and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) co-infection. The first group received ketoconazole and amoxicillin-clavulanic and the second group received ciprofloxacin and ketoconazole. The study also included a historical group of patients who had only ketoconazole as a control group. Patients who had amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ketoconazole had an overall better clinical outcome and superior infection eradication compared to the two other groups. It can be concluded that the combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ketoconazole is safe treatment and offers better clinical outcome in eumycetoma patients with S. aureus co-infection.
