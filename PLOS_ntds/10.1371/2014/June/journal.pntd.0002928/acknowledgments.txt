We wish to dedicate this work to the late Prof. Dave J. Kemp, who championed the work on molecular aspects of scabies, a neglected disease particularly of the poor. We thank Dr. Deborah Holt for providing the pyoderma Staphylococcus isolates. We acknowledge the assistance of Lindsay Christian in generating the data for Figure 1b as part of his Vacation Research Experience Scholarship at QIMR Berghofer.
