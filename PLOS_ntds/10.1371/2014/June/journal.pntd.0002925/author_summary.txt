Enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi A, B, C) remains a global public health concern. While numerous studies have estimated the levels or burden of S. Typhi, there are only limited data estimating the burden of S. Paratyphi A, particularly in Asia and Africa. We reviewed both English and Chinese-language databases for estimates of the regional burden within Africa and Asia, including new paratyphoid A cases/year and proportion of enteric fever cases attributable to paratyphoid A. S. Paratyphi A appears to constitute a significant proportion of all cases of enteric fever in Asia, though population level estimates are limited, especially in Africa. There was high variability in reported paratyphoid A burden estimates, which suggests considerable geospatial variability in the burden of paratyphoid fever. Improved efforts to monitor enteric fever at the population level are warranted in order to correctly measure the public health threat posed by S. Paratyphi A and to determine the potential need for S. Paratyphi specific prevention and treatment interventions.
