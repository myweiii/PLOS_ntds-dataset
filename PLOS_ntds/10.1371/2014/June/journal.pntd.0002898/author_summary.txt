Cholera is a potentially deadly diarrheic disease caused by the toxin-secreting bacterium Vibrio cholerae. In many poor countries, this prototypical waterborne disease is considered endemic and linked to the climate-driven proliferation of environmental reservoirs of the pathogen. Although such a statement implies radical public health consequences, it has never been proven in Africa. The present study aimed to elucidate the origin of the cholera epidemic that struck the Republic of Guinea in 2012 following a three-year lull period. This investigation integrated a spatiotemporal analysis of the national case databases, field investigations and thorough genetic analyses of 38 clinical bacterial isolates sampled throughout the Guinean epidemic. The Guinean V. cholerae DNA sequence results were aligned and compared with the sequences of nearly 200 strains isolated throughout the world over the past 60 years. Overall, these results suggest that the 2012 cholera epidemic strain was likely imported from Sierra Leone to Guinea by traveling fishermen. The emergence of cholera epidemics due to human-driven activity may be widespread throughout Africa. This highlights the importance of transborder collaborative public health strategies targeting highly mobile and high-risk populations. Similar integrated studies should be conducted in other countries impacted by the disease to better understand the spread of recent epidemics and thus better intercept future outbreaks.
