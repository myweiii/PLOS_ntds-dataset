Aedes aegypti inhabits tropical and subtropical regions worldwide and is the major vector of dengue and yellow fevers, and a secondary vector of chikungunya fever. Dengue fever is epidemic in more than 110 countries and causes up to 100 million infections annually. As there is no efficient vaccine or medicine currently available, vector control remains the primary solution for reducing the number of cases of this disease and relies heavily on the use of insecticides. Intensive and long-term use of insecticides has resulted in the worldwide emergence of mosquitoes with resistance to these chemicals. Here we newly identified two P450s, which have the ability to detoxify pyrethroid insecticide and are over produced in the resistant A. aegypti strain. Our study showed there were at least four P450 isozymes associated with resistance and target site insensitivity. These findings may lead to the development of more accurate monitoring systems in the field and also assist to identify new target sites for insecticides that are effective against resistant insects.
