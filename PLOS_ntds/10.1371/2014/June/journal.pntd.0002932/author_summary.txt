Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness. Recurrent episodes of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis cause conjunctival inflammation in children who go on to develop scarring and blindness as adults. The current effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Alliance for Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET2020) is to eliminate trachoma as a blinding disease worldwide by the year 2020 using the SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement). To estimate the prevalence of trachoma in the North Region of Cameroon in order to facilitate the planning of trachoma control activities in this region, a survey was carried out in 2011 and 2012 in 15 health districts (HDs). The overall prevalence of TF in the region is 4.2%, and that of TT is 0.25%; three HDs have a TF prevalence ≥10%. These three HDs are eligible for mass drug administration with azythromycin, along with the implementation of the “F” and “E” components of the SAFE strategy. There were estimated 1265 TT. This survey provides baseline data for the planning of activities to control trachoma in the region.
