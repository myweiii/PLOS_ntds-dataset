Diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin, the conventional antifilarial drugs, exert poor activity on adult filarial worms. Brugia malayi, a causative agent of human lymphatic filariasis, harbors an obligate alpha-proteobacterium, Wolbachia. Because the endosymbiont is required for the development, viability, and fertility of the parasite, wolbachial proteins seem to be a potential target for antifilarial drugs. Transcription elongation factor is one of the bacterial factors that plays an essential role in efficient transcription by facilitating the movement of RNA polymerase on DNA template. The factor is also necessary for bacterial viability because deletion of greA leads to hypersensitivity to environmental assaults such as ionic detergents, elevated temperature or osmotic shock. Functional characterization of Wol GreA with its domains was undertaken to ascertain the molecular trappings underlying Wolbachia maintenance within the filarial parasite and gain further insight into the mutualism between the bacteria and the nematode host. In the present study, GreA of Wolbachia revealed phylogenetic divergence from other bacteria. Wol GreA, a member of the Gre family, authenticates its essentiality by the presence of evolutionarily conserved N and C terminal domains, where dimeric CTD exhibited chemical cross-linking and direct binding to α2ββ′σ subunits of Wol RNAP.
