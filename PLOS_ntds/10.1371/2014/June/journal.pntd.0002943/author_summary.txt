Currently, rainwater harvesting cisterns built up through the “One Million Cisterns” Program, coordinated by the Brazilian Government, represents the most important public policy for water supply in the rural semiarid region of Brazil. Despite the extensive use of this water provision, few studies have been performed to assess the associated health impact. To assess such impact, this study investigated factors associated with the occurrence of Giardia duodenalis (protozoan closely related to the ingestion of contaminated water) in children aged between 4 months and five years old. Two distinct groups of children, one with access to rainwater cisterns (cistern group) and the other without cisterns, with water supplied from alternative sources, including rivers, springs or dams (comparison group) were followed up for approximately one year. It was observed that the risk occurrence of G. duodenalis prevalence was greater in children from the comparison group, when compared with those from the cistern group, indicating that the odds of infection by this parasite were 1.72 times greater for comparison group children. In conclusion, the study showed health benefits related to rainwater cisterns, but also identified that other complementary sanitation interventions are needed to minimize the risk of disease in populations with limited access to drinking water.
