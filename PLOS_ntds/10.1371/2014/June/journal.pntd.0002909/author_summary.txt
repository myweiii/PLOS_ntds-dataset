Parasitic worms infecting the intestines of grazing livestock cause economic losses and welfare problems. Infection is predominantly controlled by wormers, the indiscriminate use of which has led to drug-resistance problems in the worms infecting livestock on which many of the world's resource-poor farmers are dependent. New and cheap control methods are needed. Vaccination with protein extracts from the parasite Haemonchus contortus reduces the burden of infection and some work has indicated that cross-protection between closely related parasites is possible. Typically, these extracts are made using relatively sophisticated centrifugation and chromatography equipment as well as needing refrigeration capabilities. In this study, the authors show that equally efficacious extracts can be prepared using a very simplified protocol not requiring these specialist facilities. Proteomic analyses demonstrated the close similarity between protein extracts from both H. contortus and Mecistocirrus digitatus and vaccine trials in sheep showed that the simplified extraction protocol resulted in an equally efficacious vaccine compared to the more complex methods described prior to this work. Antigenic cross-reactivity was demonstrated between extracts from the two species; the M. digitatus extract gave a slight reduction in worm egg output when used to vaccinate sheep challenged with H. contortus.
