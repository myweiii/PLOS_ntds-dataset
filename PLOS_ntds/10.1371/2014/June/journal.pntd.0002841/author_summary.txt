Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease due to a small parasite called Leishmania. This parasite causes disfiguring skin lesions that last for months or years. There are many different subtypes of Leishmania, each giving rise to lesions of different severity and responding to therapies in its own way. Treating physicians must know as soon as possible which subtype of Leishmania is involved to propose the best treatment. Because it is impossible to differentiate the Leishmania subtypes microscopically, the identification of the culprit subtype currently requires complex and expensive typing methods, the results of which are generally obtained several weeks after the diagnosis. Here, we have evaluated the ability of a new method using mass spectrometry to differentiate Leishmania subtypes. Our results were consistent with those provided by reference typing methods and were obtained rapidly after the parasite had been cultured in vitro. This new method may help physicians know very soon which Leishmania subtype is involved thereby facilitating treatment choice.
