The new world arenavirus Jun√≠n virus (JUNV) is the causative agent of a lethal human infectious disease, Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Laboratory mice are used as models to study many viral diseases. However, adult laboratory mice are generally resistant to JUNV infection. Interferons are early immune regulatory molecules that induce potent anti-viral status in host cells and activate host immune cells to counteract virus infection. The activity of interferons relies on their cell surface receptors. We have previously reported that mutant mice with defect in interferon receptors succumbed to challenge with JUNV, highlighting the critical role of interferon in restricting JUNV infection in mice. Here we further study the basis of mouse resistance to JUNV infection and report that the replication of both pathogenic JUNV and its vaccine strains are highly sensitive to type I IFN treatment in mouse cells. However, both strains replicate efficiently in Africa green monkey-derived Vero cells and human cells when treated with high doses of interferon. Additionally, the vaccine strain replicates less efficiently in mouse cells compared with the pathogenic strain, which might partially explain its attenuation in mice. Our new findings help better understand the JUNV-host interaction.
