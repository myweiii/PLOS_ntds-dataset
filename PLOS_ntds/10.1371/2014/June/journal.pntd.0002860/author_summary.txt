To improve the serodiagnosis of human fasciolosis caused by Fasciola hepatica, we comparatively evaluated the accuracy of two different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the use of two published recombinant antigens. The best performance was achieved with the recombinant F. hepatica saposin-like protein-2 antigen (recSAP2). Although the F. hepatica E/S antigen exhibited a slightly higher diagnostic sensitivity, the higher specificity performance of recSAP2 renders this antigen very suitable for application in low endemic areas, especially when coupled to an easy and standardized production facility as compared to the relatively complex production procedure for an E/S antigen. Conclusively, the recSAP2-ELISA can be used as a routine individual serodiagnostic test for human fasciolosis, especially when backed up by a compatible clinical history together with other serodiagnostic technique for other helminth infections of the liver, e.g. alveolar or cystic echinococcosis.
