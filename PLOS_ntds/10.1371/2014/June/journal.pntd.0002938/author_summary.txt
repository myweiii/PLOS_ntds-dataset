Toxocariasis is one of America's most common neglected infections of poverty and a helminthiasis of global importance. Little is known about the epidemiologic, demographic, and clinical features of ocular toxocariasis (OT) in adult patients, and the treatment regimen for OT has not been standardized. We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the clinical features, serologic markers, clinical course of granuloma, probable infection sources, and treatment outcome in 101 adult patients diagnosed clinically and serologically with OT. All the patients had unilateral involvement. Ninety-three (92.1%) and 78 (77.2%) of 101 adult patients had retinal granuloma and intraocular inflammation, respectively. In addition to retinal granuloma, retinal nerve fiber layer defect, epiretinal membrane, vitreous opacity, retinal detachment, macular edema, and macular hole were observed in the eyes with OT. Granuloma in OT can involve all retinal layers, and its intraocular migration was observed in 15 patients (16.1%). Among the 101 patients, 69.6% and 11.6% showed elevated immunoglobulin E levels and eosinophilia, respectively. We believe that OT may be associated with ingestion of uncooked meat, especially cow liver, in adult patients. Furthermore, we suggest that combined albendazole and corticosteroid therapy may reduce intraocular inflammation and recurrence.
