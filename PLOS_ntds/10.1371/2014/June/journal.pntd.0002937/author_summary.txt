Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis with a cosmopolitan distribution. Molecular analysis was carried out on 43 hepatic CE cysts from 43 cases confirmed histopathologically at the NCP, Mongolia. Molecular analysis revealed two species, Echinococcus canadensis and Echinococcus granulosus s.s. Twenty three haplotypes of the cox1 gene were identified. All pediatric cases (n = 18) were by E. canadensis. Sixteen of 39 CE cases with data on age, sex and province of residence were from UB (41.0%), and 13 of these 16 cases were caused by E. canadensis (81.3%). Among the 13 cases from UB, nine were children (69.2%). A total of 31 serum samples from these 43 cases were analyzed for antibody response to rAgB with 22 (71.0%) samples positive by ELISA to rAgB. Thirteen of 20 E. canadensis (G6/7) (65%) and nine of 10 E. granulosus s.s. (90%) were seropositive. CE cases by E. granulosus s.s. showed a higher absorbance value than cases by E. canadensis (p  =  0.0137). This is the first study to evaluate age distribution of and antibody responses to rAgB in CE cases caused by the two species in Mongolia. It remains unknown why E. canadensis appears to be more common in pediatric cases.
