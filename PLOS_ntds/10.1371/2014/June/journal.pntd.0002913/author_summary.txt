Parasitic worm infection and malaria are common in tropical and subtropical countries and many people suffer from multiple parasite infections concurrently. It is important to gain knowledge on co-endemicity patterns because such information can help to design and prioritize interventions and control strategies focusing on areas at highest risk of co-infection. We carried out the first national survey on parasitic worm and Plasmodium infection among children in 92 schools all over Côte d’Ivoire. Questionnaires were administered to determine the children's socioeconomic status and infection-related risk factors. We found an overall prevalence of Plasmodium infection of 63.3%. Hookworm was the most common parasitic worm infection (17.2%), whereas schistosome worms were more focally distributed (9.1%). One out of six children was co-infected with parasitic worms and Plasmodium. Children from the poorest households living in rural areas were at highest risk of co-infection. The lack of sanitation facilities, and activities like swimming or fishing in nearby rivers were found to be positively associated with multiple species parasite infection. Our study motivates the integration of combined intervention measures that concurrently target neglected tropical diseases and malaria in highly resource-constrained settings.
