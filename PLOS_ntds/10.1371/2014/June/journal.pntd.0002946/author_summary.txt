The highly invasive Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) transmits several pathogens that cause disease in humans and other animals. Therefore, Ae. albopictus poses a large and growing threat to public health across the world. One step toward managing the reproduction and threat of this species is to determine factors that influence its reproductive biology. Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are transferred from male mosquitoes to females during mating, and receipt of Sfps changes female reproductive behavior and physiology. Here we report the identity of 198 Ae. albopictus Sfps. We discuss the potential roles and impacts of these Sfps on reproduction. In addition, we compare Ae. albopictus Sfps with proteins (including reported Sfps) from other species, including two other important mosquito vectors of pathogens that cause human diseases. Our results provide a foundation for future studies to investigate the roles of individual Sfps on Ae. albopictus reproduction.
