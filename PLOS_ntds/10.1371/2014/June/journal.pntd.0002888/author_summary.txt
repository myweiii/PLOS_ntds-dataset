Being able to quantify human movement is important for studying activity patterns, exposure to pathogens and developing realistic infectious disease models. We compared fine-scale human mobility data obtained by Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices and semi-structured interviews (SSI) from 160 individuals in Iquitos, Peru, in order to assess the quality of data using these two different approaches and our ability to measure fine-scale human mobility patterns in a resource-poor urban environment. Using various methods to process the GPS data, we found the SSI identified more locations a person had visited than GPS. Though the GPS gave more precise data, there were behavioral, technical, and analytical barriers. The SSI provided richer context and was easier to process, but also had more false positives. SSI was the only option for identifying locations retrospectively.
