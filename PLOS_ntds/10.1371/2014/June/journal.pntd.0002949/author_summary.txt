Enzymes known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases/MAPKs) influence a number of essential biological activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. However, for the Schistosoma mansoni flatworm parasite, very little is known about these enzymes. We used RNA interference (RNAi), a technique designed to decrease or stop the production of specific proteins of interest, to examine the contributions of five Schistosoma mansoni MAPKs to parasite growth and survival. After inducing the RNAi effect in young parasites, we then transferred the worms into mice and after 37 days, counted the number of surviving adult worms in the bloodstream, eggs in the liver, and examined those surviving worms for morphological defects. We found that RNAi of SmJNK decreases parasite survival by 56%, whereas RNAi of SmERK slows the maturation of the ovary and, thus, egg-laying. We also noted that c-fos, that is responsible for activating genes in the genome, was upregulated after RNAi of MAPKs. Our results help define the importance of MAPKs in the normal development and survival of the schistosome parasite and suggest one or more of these enzymes may be useful as drug targets to treat schistosomiasis.
