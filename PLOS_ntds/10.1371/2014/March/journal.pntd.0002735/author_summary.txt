Knowledge of potential pathogens in seafood is of major significance for human health. The high rates of parasitation of fish all over the world make Anisakis a serious health hazard. In fact, Anisakiasis is a growing zoonotic disease in countries where consumption of raw/marinated fish is high. Moreover, Anisakiasis could be under diagnosed in countries where the consumption of these dishes is less common, since it could be easily misdiagnosed as appendicitis, gastric ulcer or other food allergies. Allergen structural studies are essential for the development of specific diagnostic tests and novel immunotherapy strategies. In the present study, we have elucidated for the first time the tertiary structure of Ani s 5 Anisakis allergen and its IgE and IgG4 regions implicated in allergic response. Ani s 5 belongs to the SXP/RAL-2 protein family. Several members of this family have been detected in animal and plant parasitic nematodes. As no homologs have been identified outside the Nematoda, these proteins may be suitable targets for controlling the damage caused by these parasites. Our work reveals that the structure of Ani s 5 resembles that of Calmodulin but binds Mg2+ instead of Ca2+, which suggests some putative functions for SXP/RAL-2 proteins.
