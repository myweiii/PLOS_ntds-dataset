Despite recent significant advances in knowledge of the fundamental biology of the carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, little is known of the complement of molecular interactions occurring between this parasite and its prosobranch snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos. The determination of such interactions is a key, necessary component of the development of future integrated control strategies for liver fluke infection and associated bile duct cancer. Here, we use cutting-edge high-throughput sequencing technologies and advanced bioinformatic analyses to characterize, for the first time, qualitative and quantitative differences in gene expression between uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos collected from an endemic region of Northeast Thailand. The analyses led to the identification of a number of molecules putatively involved in immune defense pathways against invading O. viverrini, and of key biological mechanisms potentially implicated in the ability of the parasite to successfully colonize its snail intermediate host. We believe that this ready-to-use molecular resource will provide the scientific community with new tools for the development of strategies to control the spread of liver fluke infection and the resulting bile duct cancer.
