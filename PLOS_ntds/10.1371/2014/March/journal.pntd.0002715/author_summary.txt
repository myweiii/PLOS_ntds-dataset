We conducted analyses of DNA sequences obtained from the infective larvae of Necator spp. from humans and great apes inhabiting Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. Three sequence types (I–III) were recognized in the in the ITS region, and 34 cox1 haplotypes represented three phylogenetic groups (A–C). I-A, II-B, II-C, III-B, III-C combinations were determined. Combination I-A, corresponding to Necator americanus, was demonstrated in humans and western lowland gorillas; II-B and II-C were observed in humans (local inhabitants and researchers), western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees; III-B and III-C were found only in humans. Pairwise nucleotide difference in the cox1 haplotypes between the groups was more than 8%, while the difference within each group was less than 2.1%, suggesting that each type represents a distinct species. This is the first molecular evidence that Necator species found in great apes can infect humans and vice versa.
