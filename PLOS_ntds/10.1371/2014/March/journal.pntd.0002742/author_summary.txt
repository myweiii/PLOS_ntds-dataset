Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness) is a fatal but treatable disease affecting poor people in sub-Saharan Africa. Most HAT diagnostic equipment, infrastructure and expertise is located in hospitals. The expense of expanding testing services to remote areas using mobile teams severely restricts their use. Non-specialist healthcare workers (HCWs) in first-line (primary) health care facilities can contribute to control by identifying patients in need of testing based on their symptoms. We therefore trained first-line HCWs to recognise potential syndromic cases of HAT and refer them to a hospital screening service. Against a low baseline of HCW HAT referral experience, four months after the intervention, HCW knowledge of HAT symptoms increased and HCWs in 71.4% of facilities across the county had made referrals, incorporating new and pre-existing ideas about HAT case detection into referral practice. There was only a modest increase in numbers of referred patients received at the hospital for screening, however, largely because of distance. In an era where approaches to HAT case detection and control must increasingly be integrated into health referral systems, it is vital to understand the opportunities and challenges associated with syndromic case detection in first line facilities to design effective interventions.
