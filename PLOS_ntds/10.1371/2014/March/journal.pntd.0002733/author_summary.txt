Giardiasis is a major diarrheal disease with worldwide distribution. 5-nitroimidazoles, which include metronidazole and tinidazole, are the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of giardiasis. In recent years, many other drugs with variable efficacies and adverse effects have been proposed for the treatment of giardiasis. No systematic review has evaluated efficacy of 5-nitroimidazoles as a group in comparison to the other antigiardial drugs. In this context, we performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacies of 5-nitroimidazoles with a control drug with the aim of assessing effectiveness of 5-nitroimidazoles in the treatment of giardiasis. Four research databases were searched; 30 trials with 3,930 subjects met our inclusion criteria. Results show that there was a high variation of study outcomes between included studies. 5-nitroimidazoles were associated with higher giardiasis cure rates than controls; also, 5-nitroimidazoles are associated with lower risk of abdominal pain, and higher risks of bitter or metallic taste and headache than controls.
