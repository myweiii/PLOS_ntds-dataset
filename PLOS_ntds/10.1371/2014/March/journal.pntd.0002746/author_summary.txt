Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen, which causes febrile illness, encephalitis and fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and severe hepatic disease with high mortality and spontaneous abortion rates in ruminants. RVFV is endemic to the African continent. Because many different mosquito species support RVFV replication, the virus has the potential to spread to other areas of the world, such as North and South America, Asia, and Europe and could cause serious public health problems and economic losses. Consistent with this concern, RVFV has caused epidemic disease in the Arabian Peninsula. Currently, there is no approved vaccine suitable for mass vaccination programs of humans. Although the MP-12 strain of RVFV is a live attenuated vaccine candidate, its neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in mice are areas of concern, especially when considering the immunization of children and the immunocompromised. In this study, we present a novel MP-12-based, single-cycle replicable RVF vaccine candidate. This vaccine candidate was not neurovirulent in mice and was effective in protecting immunized mice from wild-type RVFV challenge, indicating its potential to be developed as a safe vaccine for use in both humans and livestock.
