The Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata is one of the most important vectors in America, owing to its wide genetic and epidemiological heterogeneity. Colombian T. dimidiata populations occupy eclectic sylvatic ecotopes, but have also been found in dwellings infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and therefore it is considered (along with Rhodnius prolixus) the most important vector in several departments. The current study explores the population structure history of Colombian populations by means of a molecular coalescence approach. The results indicate that the historical population processes in T. dimidiata in Colombia are in accordance with population expansions that may have been accomplished by two important biotic and orographic events such as the Great American Interchange and the uplift of the eastern range of the Andes Mountains in central Colombia. The genetic history as well as the heterogeneity of the populations could be reflected in different responses of the populations to vector control interventions; thus, a local level of entomological vigilance should be implemented to evaluate the intervention results in each region.
