Buruli Ulcer is an infectious skin disease, mainly occurring in West Africa. Previously, the disease was treated exclusively by surgery, but in the last decade, effective treatment with antibiotics has been established. The WHO recommended regimen consists of 8 weeks of oral rifampicin combined with intramuscular streptomycin. However, prolonged use of streptomycin is known to cause permanent ototoxicity and transient nephrotoxicity. To study this, we performed audiometry and measured the serum creatinine in 127 former Buruli ulcer patients who received either 4 or 8 weeks of streptomycin 4 to 6 years ago. Ototoxicity was present in 29% of adults and 25% of children. Adults who received 8 weeks of streptomycin had significantly worse hearing at long term follow-up, and this was most prominent in the high frequencies. In children, no differences between the two groups were found. Nephrotoxicity that had been detected in 14% of adults and in 13% of children during treatment, was present in only 2.4% of patients at long term follow-up. The findings indicate that caution should be exercised when prescribing streptomycin to adults for prolonged periods of time. Treatment regimens for Buruli ulcer that do not contain streptomycin are desirable and should be investigated.
