Despite intensive efforts towards disease control, schistosomiasis is still highly prevalent in most endemic countries. Although effective treatment is available and widely used, it does not prevent reinfection, as it could be achieved with the use of a vaccine. Efforts to control and eradicate schistosomiasis rely on praziquantel, the only drug available for treatment. Therefore, the identification of antigens that can induce protective immunity is highly desirable, as well as the need for more sensitive assays, useful to detect low intensity infections and treatment follow-up. The occurrence of natural resistance in schistosome endemic areas suggests that there is protective immunity. However, the mechanisms involved in protection, or the proteins that induce this protective immunity, are not yet known. These proteins, once identified, may constitute the basis for a successful vaccine. In this study, we compared the profile of reactive proteins to the serum antibodies of infected and non-infected individuals residing in a schistosomiasis endemic area using two-dimensional western blotting. The association of proteomic and serological screening methodologies enabled the identification of immunogenic proteins of the parasite, which could be an informative source for the development of vaccines and new diagnostic assays. In this manuscript we describe the discovery of potential candidate proteins for subsequent testing as protective or diagnostic antigens.
