Bats and rodents are important hosts for emerging human diseases. While a large body of research has focused on viral pathogens in these hosts, the diversity, evolution, and transmission of their bacterial pathogens remains relatively unstudied. We conducted co-evolutionary analyses of two bacterial genera know to be pathogenic in humans, Bartonella and Leptospira, along with their bat and rodent hosts. We found that Bartonella had a significant pattern of coevolution with both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira in bats showed a lack of congruence with its bat hosts and a high number of host switching events. Our statistically driven approach to understand the frequency of host switching events in these mammal–bacterial systems can be easily applied to other host–pathogen systems, including viruses, to assess the likelihood of zoonotic spillover.
