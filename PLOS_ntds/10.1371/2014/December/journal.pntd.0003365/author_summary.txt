The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 7 to 8 million people are currently infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The WHO recommends insect vector control as the primary prevention method; and insecticide spraying is the most commonly used intervention technique. Sylvatic insect vectors are a special concern because they are a source of reinfestation after insecticides have been applied to living quarters (domestic) and immediate surroundings (peridomestic). To better understand sylvatic insect vector movement, we used two molecular biology techniques to detect the blood meal sources of sylvatic insect vectors. The first technique, cloning of 12S PCR products, allows us to cast a wide net and detect blood meal sources with no previous knowledge of vertebrates or mammals in the study site. After acquiring knowledge of vertebrates in the study site (either through the aforementioned cloning technique, literature review or survey of the area), the second technique, the species-specific hydrolysis probe-based qPCR provides a highly sensitive assay for particular taxa.
