Tsetse flies transmit sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis), and visually attractive targets and traps are important tools for the control of the flies and prevention of disease. Previous studies have tried to determine the best colour for visual baits by relating their light reflectance properties to their attractiveness to tsetse. However, these methods represent only part of the visual information captured by the fly's eye, which is encoded by five different types of photoreceptor with varying sensitivities to different wavelengths of light. I use established methods to calculate the excitation of each fly photoreceptor type by the visual baits used to catch tsetse flies in three previous field studies. This method more completely describes the visual information captured by the fly's eye. Tsetse fly attraction can then be largely explained by a comparison of the excitations of three different photoreceptor types within the fly's nervous system. This knowledge and approach will allow for the more complete quantification of visual bait reflectance spectra, so that more efficient bait materials can be identified and employed to control tsetse flies.
