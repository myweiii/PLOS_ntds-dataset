We have developed an assay for screening test compounds for their ability to kill intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania parasites, causative agents of human leishmaniasis. The assay is based on freeing amastigotes from infected macrophages by mild detergent lysis and measuring the number of parasites following their extracellular replication by a fluorescence-based method. The validity of the assay has been confirmed using the gold standard drugs, Amphotericin B and Miltefosine, which kill parasites at highly reproducible concentrations. Our results show that this assay is easily transferable between laboratories, can be adapted to specific applications and used to test any parasite species or strain, and does not rely on genetically-modified parasites. These features will enable its use in screening isolates taken directly from patients, vectors or reservoir hosts. We used this assay, in parallel with enzyme activity data, to test lead-like and hit-like inhibitors of a validated target enzyme, Leishmania N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). Compounds from two of four newly-identified Leishmania NMT-selective hit series displayed host cell cytotoxicity, while all four series displayed low translation of enzyme to cellular activity in analysis of intracellular parasite viability. Improvements in potency and physicochemical properties will be required to deliver attractive lead-like Leishmania NMT inhibitors.
