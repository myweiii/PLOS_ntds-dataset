Chagas disease is endemic in Central and South America, Mexico and part of the United States. However, migration flows permitted a diffusion outside those borders, so nowadays there are infected people living in Europe, mostly in Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. This manuscript describes the patients with Chagas disease attended at a referral center in Italy between 2005 and 2013. They were classified into different categories according to the presence of possible cardiac and/or gastrointestinal involvement: one third of patients presented signs of organ damage. Ninety-seven percent of the infected patients were treated with benznidazole, 16% had to stop the treatment due to adverse events.
