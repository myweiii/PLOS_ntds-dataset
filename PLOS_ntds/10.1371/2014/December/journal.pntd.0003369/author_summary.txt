Malnutrition, including stunting and underweight, is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in preschool-age children. Children under two years of age are at a particularly critical period for growth and development, and for first exposure to worm infections in tropical and subtropical environments. The association between malnutrition and worm infection, however, is not well understood in this age group. A nested cross-sectional survey was therefore conducted between September 2011 and June 2012 in 1760 children 12 and 13 months of age living in a worm-endemic area of the Peruvian Amazon. Length, weight, development (i.e. cognitive, language and motor development), worm infection, and socio-demographic information were obtained. Results showed a high prevalence of stunting, and a significant association with worm infection and lower development. Overall, these adverse effects have the potential to negatively impact short-term and long-term health and nutrition, and educational and social achievement, into school-age and adulthood. Emphasis is needed on determining the most appropriate and effective interventions to reduce poor health and nutrition outcomes in this age group.
