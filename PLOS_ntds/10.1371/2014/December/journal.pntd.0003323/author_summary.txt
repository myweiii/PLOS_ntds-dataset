The control or elimination of soil-transmitted helminth diseases through chemotherapy has recently become the focus of increased interest and funding from international agencies, charities, and pharmaceutical companies via drug donations for treatment in the poorer regions of the world. The design of treatment regimes and the interpretation of their impact benefit from analysis using robust and reliable mathematical models. By analyzing models of the effect of treatment on host parasite burden, we identify several aspects of parasite natural history and transmission which are often overlooked, but have a marked effect on the impact of treatment strategies. In particular, the inclusion of sexual reproduction and the dynamics of eggs or larval stages in the model changes the response of the parasite population to treatment when parasite burdens are low. This in turn has implications for the design of treatment strategies to eliminate parasites in terms of minimizing total drug use and the length of the program delivering them.
