Leishmaniasis is a major public health problem expanding in Brazil and one of the reasons is that we still have poor knowledge of some aspects of the biology and epidemiology of Leishmania species, including the role of wild mammals. Caviomorph rodents, some of the oldest Leishmania spp. hosts, are widely dispersed in Brazil and reported as potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites. Spleen fragments of 373 brazilian caviomorph rodents from 20 species were investigated for Leishmania infection. The molecular algorithm proposed to diagnose the infection associate the sensitivity of a molecular target with multiple copies with the specificity of another marker with discriminatory taxonomic ability between species. These demonstrated their usefulness in identifying most of the parasite species infecting the rodents, including the description of species in previously unknown hosts and in areas not previously included in their known distribution, such as L. shawi in Thrichomys inermis from Northeastern Brazil and L. naiffi in T. fosteri from Western Brazil. Although the percent of infection by molecular diagnosis was 4.6%, the serology demonstrated that about 51% of them had been exposed to Leishmania parasites pointing that caviomorph rodents are inserted in enzootic cycles of Leishmania, to a higher extent than currently recognized.
