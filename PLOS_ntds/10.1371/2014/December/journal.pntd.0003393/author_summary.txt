Integrated vector management aims to optimize efficacy and make better use of available funds, including targeting multiple diseases, using one or more interventions. However, we have relatively poor understanding of the programmatic demands that arise when controlling two diseases. For instance, does the intensity, duration of deployment, or type of intervention most suitable for each disease overlap or clash? We developed a mathematical model to explore these issues for the example of the vector-borne diseases malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Since the causative agents of these diseases are transmitted by the same mosquito species in certain areas, there is clear potential for an integrated approach using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) or larval source management. We found that the transmission potential of both malaria and LF is most sensitive to changes in mosquito survivorship and the duration of the feeding cycle, supporting the usefulness of LLINs. In areas where both diseases occur, malaria elimination was predicted to require high levels of both LLINs and larval source management, whereas either intervention at a low intensity was sufficient to eliminate LF, if maintained for a longer period. This highlights that integrated control programs should be flexible and dynamic in order to accommodate these demands.
