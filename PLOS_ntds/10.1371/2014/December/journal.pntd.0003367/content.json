    "Introduction": "The protozoa parasite, Leishmania donovani, (LD) replicates within the macrophage of the mammalian host [1]. The parasite during their intracellular life cycle causes wide variety of defects in cellular physiology like decrease in membrane cholesterol [2] with concomitant increase in membrane fluidity [3]. LD infectedmacrophage are unable to stimulate antigen specific T cells [3] and display defective IFN\u03b3 receptor 1 (R1) and receptor 2 (R2) subunit assembly [4]. Kala-azar patient showed progressive decrease in serum cholesterol as a function of splenic parasite load [5]. Interestingly, defective T cell stimulating ability and IFN\u03b3R assembly of infected macrophage can be corrected by liposomal cholesterol treatment [2], [4]. Cholesterol is one of the main constituent of the cell membrane and is important for raft assembly [6]. There are controversial reports on cholesterol depletion and membrane protein mobility, in some cases cholesterol depletion suppresses membrane protein mobility [7]\u2013[9] while in others it increases the lateral mobility of the membrane protein [10], [11].\nSeveral studies showed that decreased protein mobility on cholesterol depletion is due to the changes in the architecture of the underlying cytoskeleton [12], [13]. The formation of an immunological synapse between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) is recognized as a key event for activation of T cell [14]andactin cytoskeleton plays an important role in T cell activation [15]. Cholesterol, an important constituent oflipid raft [6], is intimately involved in the dynamics of immune synapse formation [16]. Previously we showed that splenic macrophages of infected hamster are incapable to form immunological synapse while splenic macrophages of liposomal cholesterol treated infected hamsters can form immunological synapse [2]. The duration of contact between T cell and APC is also important for T cell activation. The mature synapse lasts for several hours and is thought to be important for sustained signalling [17]. There is a report that slow moving peptide-MHC complex but not fast moving ones can form immunological synapse [18]. It has been shown in Plasmodium falciparum infection that the lateral mobility of erythrocytes membrane protein is related to the infective stages of the parasite [19].\n1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiestares delta 1 (PLC\u03b41) is a membrane protein that catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3). Using PLC\u03b41 as a representative of membrane proteins,we show that under parasitized condition the lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 is significantly increased coupled with reduced actin polymerization. The increased lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 observed in LD infected macrophages is restored to normal upon liposomal cholesterol treatment. The enhance dynamic of membrane proteins may contribute to the defective signal transduction leading to defective cellular function.",

The protocol number is SDR/SYR/2007.\n\n\nReagents\nLipoFECTAMINE, alexa 488 phalloidin and FCS (Fetal calf serum) were purchased from Invitrogen. Luria-Bertani media purchased from Merck, India. DNA preparation minikit was purchased from Qiagen. Penicillin-streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, sodium bicarbonate, \u03b2 mercapto-ethanol, RPMI-1640, M199, Hoechst 33258were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cholesterol, phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol analogue were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. \u03b2-Actin antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1) and secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse-HRP) were obtained from Santa Cruz and Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India respectively. plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid is a kind gift of Dr. TamasBalla, NIH, USA.\n\n\nCell line\nRAW 264.7 (murine macrophage cell line) was used for in vitro experiments. For convenience RAW 264.7 was defined as macrophages (M\u03a6). The cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (5\u00d710\u22125 M) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\n\n\nMaintenance of Leishmania donovani (LD)\nLeishmania donovani strain AG83 (MHOM/IN/1983/AG83), originally obtained from Indian kala-azar patients, was maintained in Golden Hamsters as described previously [20]. Promastigotes obtained after transforming amastigotes from spleen of infected animals were maintained in culture M199 supplemented with 10% FCS at 22\u00b0C. The culture was replenished with fresh medium every 72\u201396 h.\n\n\nTransfection of RAW264.7 cell line\nRAW 264.7cells (104 cells/well) were platedinto 8 chambered coverslips (BD Bioscience) for 14 h. The non-adherent cells were removed by washing. The cells were transfected with plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid using LipoFECTAMINE following the Invitrogen LipoFECTAMINE kit protocol. After 6 h, the cells were washed and complete medium was added.\n\n\nInfection of RAW 264.7 cell with LD\nRAW 264.7 cells were infected as described previously [4]. Briefly RAW 264.7 cells (105/106) were allowed to adhere coverslips/petri dish for 24 h at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which the non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing with serum-free medium. The adherent cells, after overnight incubation in complete medium, were challenged with stationary phase LD promastigotes at a cell to parasite ratio of 1\u223610 and incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. Excess parasites were then washed off with serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated further for 48 h. At end points the cover slips were washed with PBS, dried, fixed with 100% methanol, and stained with 10% Giemsa. The intracellular parasites were enumerated microscopically and the results were expressed as % infected RAW 264.7 cells as well as the number of parasites/100 RAW 264.7 cells. For convenience, LD infected RAW264.7 cells were defined as I-M\u03a6.\n\n\nLiposome preparation and treatment of LD infected RAW 264.7 cells\nLiposomal cholesterol and liposomal cholesterol analogue were prepared using cholesterol/cholesterol analogue and phosphatidylcholine (PC) at a molar ratio of 1.5\u22361 as previously described [2]. Briefly, 5.8 mg cholesterol/cholesterol analogue (4-cholestene-3-one) and 8 mg PC in chloroform were mixed and a thin film was prepared; subsequently, the film was dissolved in 1 ml saline and sonicated (Microson Ultrasonic cell disruptor with a Misonix 2-mm probe) at 4\u00b0C three times for 1 min each time at maximum output. The LD infected RAW264.7 cells (104 cell/200 \u00b5l) were incubated with 10 \u00b5l liposomes for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and finally resuspended in 10% FCS containing RPMI 1640. For convenience, liposomal cholesterol treated LD infected cells as I-M\u03a6-CL, and liposomal cholesterol analogue treated LD infected cells as I-M\u03a6-AL.\n\n\nConfocal live cell imaging\nThe plc\u03b41-gfp transfected RAW 264.7 cells were visualized under Confocal microscope. The cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33258 solution for 2 minutes and washed off with PBS (Phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2) to visualise the nucleus. The cells were then kept in complete medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS) and live cell images of the cells were taken for 1 minute with 8 seconds interval. GFP was imaged using a wide field microscope (model: Andor Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope, Olympus). The fluorochrome was excited with a mercury arc lamp. For alexa 488 excitation and emission wavelength was488 and 525 nm. For Hoechst 33258 these were 405 and 447 nm respectively. Images, obtained using identical exposure times for cells subjected to various treatments in each experiment, were collected using a 60X1.42 NA Plan-ApoN objective and captured using Andor IXON897EM CCD camera.\n\n\nComputational analysis of spatial distribution of PLC\u03b41-GFP\nThe spatial distribution of the expression of PLC\u03b41-GFP in normal, infected and liposomal cholesterol treated infected cells was computationally analyzed using boundary distance analysis as described previously [21]. Briefly, the differences in the shape and size of the cells were adjusted by normalizing the spatial co-ordinates of the cell. The normalization were done on a one dimensional scale with the following features: (i) the \u2018center\u2019 of the cell has a radial distance of 0 (ii) points on the boundary of a cell to be a radial distance of 1 (iii) points in the interior of a cell have a radial distance between 0 and 1, depending on how close they are to the boundary of the cell (iv) points outside the boundary of the cell have a radial distance of more than 1, with further points having greater distance. The co-ordinate system was computed separately for each cell.\n\n\nMeasurement of mobility of PLC\u03b41-GFP\nDetecting the motion of the PLC\u03b41-GFP at a given location in a cell is a hard problem because we cannot track individual particles over time. From live cell imaging, we obtained a time sequence of images, in a short space of time (1 minute), each of which the expression distribution has changed slightly from the previous one. From this sequence, we measured the temporal flux, in GFP expression, as follows(1.1)Where g(x,y,t) is the expression of the PLC\u03b41-GFP at location (x,y) and timepoint t. The movement (flux) measured, M(x,y) depends on how much the expression level changes from one timepoint to the next. In order to resolve the spatial distribution of movement, we have used the radial mapping concept described in the previous section for (1.1), but this time mapping the movement measure M(x,y) instead of the expression levels. For increased comparability, we again normalized the movement measure by the overall level of expression for each cell.\n\n\nMeasurement of PLC\u03b41-GFP peak level expression\nThe highest level of expression or peak expression of GFP occurs at the membrane for each cell. Thus we calculated P, peak level of expression of GFP for each cell. To compare these measurements across groups, we fitted a model of the form(1.2)Where Pij is the peak expressions of GFP for cell j in study i. The model terms include \u03bc, the baseline mean for N-M\u03a6 and si, an effect due to imaging study i. Since the factors that can influence the imaging study, such as ambient lighting, level of plc\u03b41-gfp transfection etc., are unmeasured, we assume that this effect is random and has a zero mean Gaussian distribution. The main quantity of interest is tij, the effect of infection or treatment and finally \u03b5ij is measurement error, assumed to have an independent mean zero Gaussian distribution. The Parameter estimates and hypothesis tests were carried out by fitting the corresponding mixed effects model using the R computing platform (www.r-project.org).\n\n\nFluorescence Recovery after Photobleahing (FRAP)\nFRAP measurement was done as described [22]. Briefly, GFP was imaged using a wide field microscope (model Andor Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope, Olympus). The fluorochrome was excited with a mercury arc lamp, using excitation wavelength of 488 nm; the emission wavelength was 525 nm. Cells were kept at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber. A 60X 1.42 NA Plan-ApoN objective was used with the confocal pinhole set at 1\u20132 Airy units. Photobleaching of GFP was performed with the 488-nm laser line at 30 mW power in a 32.85 \u00b5m2 rectangular region of interest. Pre- and post-bleach images were monitored at low laser intensity (14 mW). Fluorescence recoveries in the bleached region and overall photobleaching in the whole cell during the time series were quantified using the iQ2.7 software. In the confocal microscope, a prebleach series (usually about 10 images) at low illumination was acquired to measure the fluorescence equilibrium before photobleaching. One or more spots or regions of interest (ROI) were illuminated with high intensity to photobleach the area of interest. Finally, a post bleach image series were acquired to measure the recovery kinetics of fluorescent light intensity. The images were captured continuously (real time) for 30 s. Mobility of the PLC\u03b41-GFP were extracted from equation (1.3).(1.3)where ROI is the Region of Interest, F(t) is the intensity of ROI at time t, F0 is the intensity of ROI immediately after bleach, Ff is the intensity of ROI at saturation, K is the recovery rate constant.\n\n\nConfocal imaging of actin cytoskeleton\nThe cells were permeabilized and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X 100. To visualize actin, the cells were then stained with alexa 488 conjugated phalloidin for 30 min as described by manufacturer. After, washing the cells were mounted on a mounting medium containing DAPI. Alexa 488 fluorescence was imaged using a wide field microscope (model Andor Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope, Olympus). The fluorochrome was excited with a mercury arc lamp. For alexa 488 excitation and emission wavelength was 488 nm and 525 nm respectively. Similarly for DAPI, excitation and emission wavelengths were 405 nm and 447 nm respectively. Images were collected using a 60X 1.42 NA Plan-ApoN objective and captured using Andor IXON897EM CCD camera. These were obtained using identical exposure times for cells subjected to various treatments in each experiment.\n\n\nF-actin fractionation and western blot analysis\nThe cellular F-actin (polymerized form) was isolated by modifying the method described previously [23]. Briefly, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 rpm and resuspended in actin stabilisation-extraction buffer (0.1 M Pipes pH 6.9, 30% glycerol, 5% DMSO, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 \u00b5g/ml antiprotease cocktail, 1 mM EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 20 min and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min [24]. The pellet comprising the F-actin was dissolved in actin extraction buffer (2 mMTris-HCl pH-8, 1 mM Na2.ATP, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM DTT) [25]. For assaying total cellular actin, the cells were lysed with 1X RIPA Buffer from Cell signalling technology, Danvers, MA (20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mMNaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin, with recommended addition of 1 mM PMSF immediately before use) and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min [4]. The protein concentration was estimated by Bradford method using a Protein Estimation Kit (Merck Genei, Mumbai, India). For immunoblotting, equal amounts of protein were loaded to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bangalore, India) in a transfer buffer consisting of 20 mMTris-HCl, 150 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in 5% BSA, probed with primary antibody against \u03b2-actin (1\u22361000 dilution, mouse monoclonal IgG1, Santa Cruz) for 4 h at room temperature, and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1\u22361500 dilution, Genei, Bangalore, India) for 2 h at room temperature. The chemiluminescence signal was detected using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockland, IL). The F-actin and total actin expressions were analyzed by image-J.",
    "Results": "Infection of RAW264.7 cells with Leishmania donovani (LD)\nFor this investigation RAW264.7 cells were used as host cell for infection with LD. The number of intracellular LD and integrity of the nucleus in infected M\u03a6 (I-M\u03a6) were determined by staining with Hoechst 33342 or DAPI. The intracellular parasite number, verified by Giemsa staining (S1 Figure), was \u223c8\u20139/cell, similar to the results obtained by Hoechst 33342 or DAPI stain (Fig. 1). It was clear that the morphology of the cells and the integrity of nucleus did not change upon infection.\nThe expression of PLC\u03b41-GFP (green) is on the cell surface. The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Parasites are marked by blue dot and indicated by arrow.\n\n\nTransfection of macrophage (M\u03a6s) with plc\u03b41-gfp\nNormal M\u03a6s (N-M\u03a6) were transfected with plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid and the distribution of GFP was measured by confocal microscope. It was observed that green fluorescence was localized predominantly on the cell surface indicating cell surface expression of PLC\u03b41 (S2A Figure). N-M\u03a6s were transfected with plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid and then infected with LD. The expression of PLC\u03b41 in I-M\u03a6was found to be localized predominantly on the cell surface (Fig. 1). Similarly expression of PLC\u03b41 in liposomal cholesterol treated infected macrophages (I-M\u03a6-CL) was predominantly localized on the cell surface (S2B Figure).\n\n\nAnalysis of PLC\u03b41 expression\nThe expression of PLC\u03b41 in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL was quantified by computational method. The boundary distance co-ordinates were computed for each cell using the Euclidean distance transform after presmoothing and oversampling of cellular boundaries to normalize with respect to variations in cell shape and size. The general shape profile based on GFP expression in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL were similar (Fig. 2A). An adaptive piecewise linear model is used to compare expression gradients in intra, peri and extra cellular zones.We have considered the center of the cell as \u20180\u2019 and the cell surface as \u20181\u2019 on the x-axis. The distribution of PLC\u03b41 are relatively flat in the interior of the cell (between 0 and 1 on the axis), followed by a sharp rise at the plasma membrane (at 1 on the x-axis) and finally a sharp drop off (points >1 on the x-axis) outside the cell (Fig. 2B). The average expression curves show the same basic spatial distribution in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL: low near the center of the cell, peak near the boundary and then a drop to \u223c\u20180\u2019 some distance outside the boundary (Fig. 3).\nA) Blue line shows cell boundary (radial distance\u200a=\u200a1). Red line show contours of equal radial distance within the cell (radial distance <1). Green lines show contours of equal radial distance outside the cell (radial distance >1). B) Plot of the distribution of PLC\u03b41-GFP expression as a function of distance from center of the cell. The red line shows the average activity as a function of distance, obtained via a smoothing line. The x-axis (radial distance) is truncated at 1.5 to avoid contamination of PLC\u03b41-GFP expression from other cells.\nRAW264.7 cells were transfected with plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid. Average expressions (activity) of the PLC\u03b41-GFP were measured by computational analysis as a function of distance from center of cell. Each line represents a particular cell. Activity is on a scale of 0\u2013255 (arbitary unit, a.u.). A) N-M\u03a6; B) I-M\u03a6; and C) I-M\u03a6-CL.\nDifferences in the highest level of PLC\u03b41expression or peak expression \u201cP\u201d across the cell was analyzed using the model in equation (1.2). There was some variation in the location of the PLC\u03b41 expression peak across cells: this could be due to shape deformable cell movement observed during live cell imaging. The expressions of PLC\u03b41 on the cell surface of N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL were 248.97, 241.76 and 236.04 a.u. respectively (Table 1). It appears that there was no significant difference in the expression of PLC\u03b41 in the above cell type.\n\n\nAnalysis of PLC\u03b41 movement\nWe studied the lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 in LD infection using computational analysis. The radial profile of PLC\u03b41 movement showed that the movement is highest near the cell membrane irrespective of infection status of the cell. The highest movement at the cell boundary is denoted as peak movement or \u201cP\u201d. It was observed that peak movement is higher in the I-M\u03a6 as compared to N-M\u03a6,whereas in I-M\u03a6-CL it was comparable to that in N-M\u03a6 (Fig. 4). To confirm this result, we carried out an ANOVA analysis of PLC\u03b41 movement across cells, as described in equation (1.2). The fitted model indicates that movement of PLC\u03b41 at the cell membrane is significantly higher in I-M\u03a6 as compared to N-M\u03a6 (p-value\u200a=\u200a0.04) and there was no significant difference between N-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL (p-value\u200a=\u200a0.72) (Table 2).\nRAW264.7 cells were transfected with plc\u03b41-gfp plasmid. Average motions of the PLC\u03b41-GFP were measured by computational analysis as a function of distance from center of cell. Each line represents a particular cell. Motion is on a scale of 0\u20136 (arbitary unit, a.u.). A) N-M\u03a6; B) I-M\u03a6; and C) I-M\u03a6-CL.\n\n\nQuantitative analysis of lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 by FRAP\nThe lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 wasstudied in live cells at 37\u00b0C.The cells were bleached and fluorescence recovery of the bleached region was measured up to 30 s (S3A Figure). It was observed that the extent of recovery was similar in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6-CL and I-M\u03a6-AL (S4 Figure) though the rate of recovery was different. The analysis of fluorescence recovery kinetics showed that the diffusion coefficient of PLC\u03b41 in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6-CL and I-M\u03a6-AL was 1.4\u00b10.2, 2.5\u00b10.5, 1.6\u00b10.3 and 2.6\u00b10.5 \u00b5m2 s\u22121 respectively (Fig. 5). The photobleach effect was specific because in the unrelated region, mean fluorescence intensity was constant. To show that the recovery was predominantly from the plasma membrane, cytosolic protein was also bleached as a control. It was observed that the recovery of PLC\u03b41 was very poor almost not detectable (S3B Figure).\nFluorescence recovery after photo bleaching was measured in plc\u03b41-gfp transfected RAW 264.7 cells. The diffusion Coefficient (D) of PLC\u03b41-GFP for N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6-CL and I-M\u03a6-AL was measured using equation (1.3). The data represents average of 7 cells with \u00b1SD. *** represents p<0.0005 and \u2018ns\u2019 means not significant.\n\n\nOrganizational analysis of actin filament\nWe studied the actin cytoskeleton in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL. The integrity of the cytoskeleton protein actin was measured by confocal microscopy after staining with fluorescence label phalloidin, which binds to filamentous actin (F-actin). The actin filamentare clearly visible in N-M\u03a6 (Fig. 6A). However, in I-M\u03a6actin filaments were reduced; insteadpossible actin depolymerisationwas noted (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, I-M\u03a6-CLdid display actin filaments (Fig. 6C). The computational analysis of phalloidin staining showed about 25% decrease in F-actin in I-M\u03a6 and 9% increase in I-M\u03a6-CL as compared to N-M\u03a6. We next quantified F-actin by western blot and the result was expressed with respect to total actin. It was observed that the total actin level was similar in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL (S5B Figure). Though F-actin level was reduced in I-M\u03a6, it reappeared upon liposomal cholesterol treatment (S5A Figure). There is about 30% decrease of F-actin in I-M\u03a6 as compared to N-M\u03a6 and in I-M\u03a6-CL F-actin was comparable (S5C Figure).\nThe actin cytoskeleton change was determined by staining with alex488 conjugated phalloidin (green). Phalloidin binds to F-actin. The nucleus and parasite was stained with DAPI (blue) and visualized by confocal microscopy. A) N-M\u03a6, B) I-M\u03a6, and C) I-M\u03a6-CL.",
    "Discussion": "The relation between cholesterol depletion from the membrane and lateral mobility of the membrane proteins remains a contentious issue. There are reports to suggest that the mobility of membrane proteins is decreased upon cholesterol depletion [7]\u2013[9], which may be due to formation of solid gel-like cluster in the membrane [26]. Again an increase in lateral mobility of membrane proteins like CD44 and wild type-H-Ras is reported after cholesterol depletion (10\u201312). There is an interesting observation in neuronal cells where lateral mobility of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was found to be governed by the receptor composition and local domain and cell type [27].\nHere we studied the lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 as prototype of membrane protein. PLC\u03b41 is a raft associated protein having cytoskeleton interacting ability [28]. It is a well characterized protein in terms of domain sequences and membrane interacting domains. UNIprot entry of PLC\u03b41 from Rattusnorvegicus (ID: P10688) suggests existence of an N terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (region 21\u2013130) followed by two EF-hand domains (region 140\u2013211) and two Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C domains (region 296\u2013609) [29]. The C-terminal end of PLC\u03b41 is also flanked by a C2 domain (region 630\u2013720) [30]. Both PH and C2 domains are known to involve in targeting proteins to cell membranes [31]. The transfection of plc\u03b41-gfp is well known to be specifically localized to plasma membrane with very little localization in the cytosol and nucleus [32].\nThe disease visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by immune suppression. Previously we showed that there is a defective synapse formation between T cells and parasitized M\u03a6 [3]. The T-cell receptor recognizes Peptide-MHC complex in the context of antigen presenting cells (APC) like macrophages and dendritic cells [33]. The duration of contact between T-cells and APCs is critical for T-cell activation. It is an exciting proposition to study the lateral mobility of peptide-MHC complex to explain defective T-cell function in leishmaniasis. But there are issues that tend to discourage undertaking such studies. The infected macrophages show decreased affinity of MHC II towards peptide [34]; thus it will be difficult to interpret the defective T-cell stimulation due to increase in lateral mobility of MHC or lack of immunogenic peptides in association with MHC II protein. Furthermore there is a report on the existence of two species of peptide-MHC complex; the slower complex can form effective synapse but not the faster moving one [18]. It may be recalled that MHC class I when coupled with GFP (GFP-tagged H-2Ld) shows relatively low diffusion coefficient [35]. The diffusion coefficient may be influenced by the protein dimensions [36]. In this context PLC\u03b41 offered advantages as it is a single chain membrane protein as opposed to MHC protein which contains two chains.\nOur study showed that transfection of plc\u03b41 led to over expression of PLC\u03b41 in the membrane of RAW 264.7 cells, similar to that reported in CHO cells by others [37]. In the latter case, despite substantial increase in PLC\u03b41 in membrane, IP3 production was only marginally increased and it still needed a stimulus to generate IP3 [37]; therefore it is unlikely that the lipid composition in transfected cells may be altered in our case.\nTwo complementary techniques have been exploited in this investigation to enhance our understanding in membrane protein dynamics under parasitized condition. It was observed that radial profile of PLC\u03b41 movement showed an increase in I-M\u03a6 which was restored to normal upon liposomal cholesterol treatment (Fig. 4). This methodology has a limitation because we cannot track individual particles over time, as monitoring the motion of PLC\u03b41 at a given location in a cell is not easy [21]. FRAP study also showed an increase in the diffusion coefficient of PLC\u03b41 in I-M\u03a6 as compared to N-M\u03a6 (Fig. 5). The treatment of infected cells with liposomal cholesterol but not with liposomal cholesterol analogue (4-cholestene-3-one) restored lateral mobility of PLC\u03b41 (Fig. 5). The amphiphilic properties of cholesterol are provided by the hydrophilic 3\u03b2-hydroxy group and the hydrophobic tetracyclic ring with the isooctyl side chain at C-17. The reason we have included 4-cholestene-3-one as analogue of cholesterol is because it lacks the OH function of cholesterol which forms hydrogen bond with amide of sphingolipids, important for alignment of cholesterol in the membrane [38]. There was another study from our group where we showed that liposomal cholesterol but not the analogue of cholesterol favors raft assembly in infected macrophages [3]. The importance of 3\u03b2-hydroxyl function was further substantiated from another study by our group where we could show that the assembly of IFN\u03b3 receptor subunits (R1 and R2) on the surface of leishmania infected macrophages could only be restored by liposomal cholesterol, not by cholesterol analogue or DPPC-liposomes [4]. Unlike the exquisite specificity of 3\u03b2-hydroxyl function of cholesterol, side chain modification appears still permissible because cholesterol may be replaced by desmosterol for packing in the membrane [39].\nSeveral studies showed the effect of cholesterol on mechanical properties of a cell through the underlying cytoskeleton [12], [13]. Changes in membrane cytoskeleton adhesion are expected to have a major impact on numerous cell functions [40]. The role of cytoskeleton meshwork as a barrier for lateral mobility of transmembrane proteins was established based on the findings that disorganized cytoskeleton meshwork favors faster lateral diffusion [41]. Kwik and coworkers [42] demonstrated that decrease in membrane protein mobility is associated with changes in architecture of the underlying actin network. F-actin plays an important role in restricting lateral mobility of membrane proteins in neuronal [43] and other cell types [44], which indicates direct or indirect tethering of membrane proteins to the cytosketeton. Quantification of such interaction using optical technique, i.e. TIFR may be of great use as reported by Huhn and Pollard, but such method is restricted to purified actin [45]. Here we show the effect of cytoskeleton actin filament disruption on LD infection and its restoration by liposomal cholesterol treatment (Fig. 6). We quantified F-actin by western blot and the result is expressed with respect to total actin. It was observed that total actin is essentially similar in N-M\u03a6, I-M\u03a6 and I-M\u03a6-CL; F-actin is reduced (30%) only in I-M\u03a6 but is restored upon liposomal cholesterol treatment (S5A\u2013B Figure). The comptutational analysis of phalloidin staining showed that there is about 25% decrease in F-actin in I-M\u03a6 and which is restored to normal in I-M\u03a6-CL. Therefore these two methods are in agreement.\nThe cause of actin depolymerisation in LD infection is unknown. It is tempting to speculate that intracellular LD by some unknown mechanism inhibits actin filament formation. Now the question comes how liposomal cholesterol treatment favors formation of actin filament. Recently we showed that liposomal cholesterol killed intracellular parasites [46]. Thus it may be possible that liposomal cholesterol treatment kills intracellular LD which may favor restoration of actin filament formation. The disruption of actin cytoskeleton may help to release the anchorage between cytoskeleton and membrane protein, making the movement of PLC\u03b41 free of cytoskeletal hindrance in LD infection. It may be recalled that a number of Salmonella strains carry spv virulence locus encoding the SpvB protein, an ADP-ribosyl transferase, which acts during intracellular infection to depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton [47]. There is also a report that Toxoplasma gondii infection changes the actin cytoskeleton of the dendritic cells due to secretion of parasite rhoptry [48].\nIn conclusion, this is the first report to our knowledge on changes in the cytoskeleton protein actin, coupled with increased lateral mobility of membrane protein in LD infected cells, which may have strong implication in altered plasma membrane architecture and defective signal transduction in infected macrophage."
