Schistosomiasis (SCH) is a parasitic infection and one gets infected when bathing or in contact with contaminated fresh water bodies like rivers. It has been shown that people living in poor sanitary conditions and especially school-aged children suffer the most from this infection. Mapping is needed in order to control or prevent the disease. However, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), surveillance of schistosomiasis is lacking. Previous data on distribution of schistosomiasis may have lost relevance since the disease was last mapped 20 years ago. This study was carried out in 2011 in the health zone of Kasansa, DRC. Six primary schools were visited and stool samples were collected from children attending the 3rd class. The stool samples were analyzed for S. mansoni infection. Up to 335 children were recruited and 82.7% were infected. Moreover, in 4 health areas over 91% of the children were infected. Of all infected children, almost half, 112 (43.2%) had light parasite density. These results demonstrate that Schistosoma mansoni infection is a bigger problem than anticipated and there is an urgent need to put effective control measures.
