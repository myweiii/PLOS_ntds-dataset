The successful infection establishment of parasites depends on their ability to combat their host's immune system while maintaining metabolic adaptation to their hosts. The mechanisms of these processes are not well understood. We used the protoscoleces (PSCs) of E. granulosus as a model system to study this complex host-parasite interaction by investigating the role of excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) in the physiological adaptation of the parasite. Using Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis, we predicted 2280 ESPs and analyzed their biological functions. Our analysis of the bioinformatic data suggested that ESPs are integral to the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins within the parasite and/or hosts. We also found that ESPs are involved in mediating the immune responses of hosts and function within key development-related signaling pathways. We found 11 intracellular enzymes, 25 molecular chaperones and four proteases that were highly represented in the ESPs, in addition to 44 antigenic proteins that showed promise as candidates for vaccine or serodiagnostic development purposes. These findings provide valuable information on the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation in parasites that will aid the development of novel hydatid treatment and control targets.
