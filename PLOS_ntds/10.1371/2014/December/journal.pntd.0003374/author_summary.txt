Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. In the present study, we investigated the risk factors associated with death caused by VL identifiable at the time of clinical suspicion. This study was conducted using all VL cases registered in Brazil during 2007 to 2011. The prognostic factors associated with death caused by VL were bleeding, age (1 year or younger and older than 19 years), Leishmaniaâ€“human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, bacterial infection, splenomegaly, edema, weakness, and jaundice. A prognostic scoring system for death caused by VL ranging from 0 to 14 was developed and validated using these risk factors. Patients with scores of 4 or more presented with a worsening prognosis. The scoring system showed good performance in identifying the severe cases. Classification of patients according to their prognosis for death can contribute to improving the clinical management of severe cases and reducing case-fatality rates associated with VL.
