Access to medicines of good quality improves the chances of successful treatment for individual patients and promotes better outcomes for public health in general. At present, the prevailing strategy for improving access to medicines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is drug donation programs. However, the presence of poor quality medicines in the market is a global threat on public health, especially in developing countries by critically risking efforts of treatment and control of diseases in general and the NTDs in particular. Conventionally, medicine quality has been ignored in NTDs, though scattered reports show that serious problems exist. Therefore, we assessed the quality of two commonly used anthelminthic drugs (MEB and ALB) and one antiprotozoal drug (TNZ) in Ethiopia. The analytical results were converted into conclusions using two systems: the traditional dichotomous pharmacopoeial specification-compliance based approach and the risk-based Taguchi quantitative desirability approach. Overall, the results showed high prevalence of poor quality of the three medicines, mainly determined by the country of origin. We conclude that risk-based regulatory quality control procedures should be based on identification of the most critical quality attribute and apply desirability functions to quantify and classify the quality of medicines.
