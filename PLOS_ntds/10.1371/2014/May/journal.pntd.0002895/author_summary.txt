Over the last decade, EV71 has emerged as a major cause of severe hand, foot and mouth disease in the Asia-Pacific region, occasionally leading to fatal brain stem encephalitis in young children. The rapid progression and high mortality of severe EV71 infection makes it vital to identify neutralization epitopes and putative therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. In this study we mapped the first conformational neutralization epitope on the VP3 protein of EV71. This epitope was confirmed by introducing the mutations into reverse genetically engineered viruses which abolished neutralization with monoclonal antibody (mAb)10D3. The importance of this novel neutralization epitope lies in the optimization of putative EV71 vaccines because the VP3 knob could be incorporated together with VP1 into a bivalent subunit vaccine. Further, the universal recognition of a conserved site on EV71 VP3 and not CVA16 makes mAb 10D3 a valuable tool for differential diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease. An additional hope is that mAb 10D3 could be used as a therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
