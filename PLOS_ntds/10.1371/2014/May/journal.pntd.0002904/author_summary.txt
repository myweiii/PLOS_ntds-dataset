Although M. ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), was identified in 1948, its transmission pathways and environmental reservoirs remain poorly understood. The occurrence of M. ulcerans infections in endemic countries in West and Central Africa is highly focal and associated with stagnant and slow flowing water bodies. BU is often described as a disease mainly affecting children <15 years of age. However, taking the population age distribution into account, our recent longitudinal survey for BU in the MapÃ© Dam Region of Cameroon revealed that clinical cases of BU among children <5 years are relatively rare. In accordance with these findings, data of the present sero-epidemiological study indicate that children <4 years old are less exposed to M. ulcerans than older children. Sero-conversion is associated with age, which may be due to age-related changes in behavioural factors, such as a wider movement radius of older children, including more frequent contact with water bodies at the periphery of their villages.
