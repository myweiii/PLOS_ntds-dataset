Fungal infections contribute substantially to human morbidity and mortality. During infectious processes, fungi have evolved mechanisms to obtain iron from high-affinity iron-binding proteins. In the current study, we demonstrated that hemoglobin is the preferential host iron source for the thermodimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides spp. To acquire hemoglobin, the fungus presents hemolytic activity and the ability to internalize protoporphyrin rings. A putative hemoglobin receptor, Rbt5, was demonstrated to be GPI-anchored at the yeast cell surface. Rbt5 was able to bind to hemin, protoporphyrin and hemoglobin in vitro. When rbt5 expression was inhibited, the survival of Paracoccidioides sp. inside macrophages and the fungal burden in mouse spleen diminished, which indicated that Rbt5 could participate in the establishment of the fungus inside the host. Drugs or vaccines could be developed against Paracoccidioides spp. Rbt5 to disturb iron uptake of this micronutrient and, thus, the proliferation of the fungus. Moreover, this protein could be used in routes to introduce antifungal agents into fungal cells.
