We would especially like to acknowledge Vu Sinh Nam and Nguyen Thi Yen whose previous work with the community and support for the Ethical, Social and Cultural (ESC) Project were critical to its successful implementation. Hoang Minh Duc, Brian Kay, Simon Kutcher and Peter Ryan also provided support and advice. Sociologists Ms. Tuyen and Ms. Huong undertook the data collection and engagement. Their experience and sensitivity to the local context were invaluable and played a critical role in the ESC Project. Mr. Nghia and his team from the Pasteur Institute, Nha Trang, also deserve special thanks for the hospitality, introductions, and guidance they provided during each of our fieldwork visits to Tri Nguyen Island. Thanks also go Scott O'Neil, lead scientist on the Wolbachiastrategy (and co-primary investigator on the ESC Project along with Nam and the first author) for his input into this aspect of the project. We would also like to thank Kirsten Bell and the anonymous reviewers for their excellent and timely feedback.
