Lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are tropical parasitic diseases caused by filarial nematodes, which constitute a serious public health issue in tropical regions. Lymphatic filariasis causes debilitating lymphedema and hydrocele, resulting in temporary or permanent disability. Onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness) causes visual impairment and blindness, constituting one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The control of human filarial infections currently depends on strategies predominantly focused at killing microfilariae (larval stage) by the use of ivermectin or diethylcarbamzine, usually in combination with albendazole. It is now generally recognized that the success of filariasis control programs in a reasonable time-frame requires the addition of a macrofilaricide (adult stage) compound. Although flubendazole has demonstrated macrofilaricidal activity in vivo, the approved formulations provide almost no oral bioavailability. The search for alternative pharmaceutical strategies to improve the systemic availability of flubendazole has acquired urgency in both human and veterinary medicine. Searching for improved flubendazole absorption, different flubendazole pharmaceutical preparations were assessed, both in rats and jirds, in the study described here. The work demonstrated that flubendazole pharmacokinetics could be markedly modified by changes in drug formulation. The resulting improved systemic exposure of flubendazole may have a significant impact on its macrofilaricidal efficacy.
