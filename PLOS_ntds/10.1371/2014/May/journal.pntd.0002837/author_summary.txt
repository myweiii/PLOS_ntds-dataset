Schistosomiasis japonica remains a major public health problem in China and Southeast Asia. The long-term of treatments with the only available drug, praziquantel, has raised the concerns about drug resistance. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs), for highly discriminating specificities, are thought to be the innovative targets for a generation of new drugs. The PDZ domain is one of the most important modules for PPIs. A number of compounds screened based on binding specificities of PDZ domains have shown their potential therapeutic power in several disease models with less side effects. Although domain loss events are widespread in S. japonicum, a panel of PDZ domains is conserved in this species. So far, however, little is known about ligand binding specificities and the molecular functions of parasite-derived PDZ domain-containing proteins. In this study, by yeast two-hybrid screening of a random library, we confirmed the ligand binding properties of a multiple PDZ domain-containing protein Scribble of S. japonicum for the first time. Divergent ligand specificities between the homologous PDZ domains of S. japonicum and human Scribble orthologs were revealed. Internal motif recognition and irregular ligand interaction models for the SjScrib-PDZ domains were identified. These results provide an important basis for the rational discovery of anti-schistosomal drugs.
