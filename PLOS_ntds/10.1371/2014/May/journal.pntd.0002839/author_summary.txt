Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and poses a serious public health problem in the America, with approximately 8 million people infected and 200,000 new cases reported annually. The disease has different clinical manifestations. The fact that infections by the same species cause different clinical outcomes is believed to be determined, at least in part, by the genetic background of the parasite (infection by different strains). Previous characterizations of the genetic diversity in Trypanosoma cruzi were carried out on the protein-coding portions of the genome. However, the genetic diversity of non-coding intergenic regions remained unexplored. These regions are particularly important in trypanosomes because they contain essential regulatory sequences that drive the process of mRNA maturation and that ultimately govern the expression of genes. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity present in non-coding regions of the genome, and provide a broad picture of the selective forces acting on this subset of the genome. Based on this analysis we identified a highly conserved core of intergenic regions, that were maintained essentially unchanged over large evolutionary periods of time, as well as a highly divergent set of intergenic regions.
