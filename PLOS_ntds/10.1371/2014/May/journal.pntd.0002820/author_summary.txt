Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease discovered in rural areas of Central China in 2009, caused by a novel bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). The disease usually presents as fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, with case-fatality rates ranging from 2.5% to 30%. By the end of 2012, the disease had expanded to 13 provinces of China. SFTS patients have been reported in Japan and South Korea, and a disease similar to SFTS has been reported in the United States. Here we characterized the epidemiologic features of 504 confirmed SFTS cases in Xinyang, the most severely SFTS-affected region in China from 2011 to 2012, and identified the environmental risk factors. We found the distribution of SFTS cases showed highly significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity, with the majority of SFTS cases being elderly farmers who resided in the southern and western parts of the region, mostly acquiring infection between May and July when H. longicornis is highly active. The shrub, forest, and rain-fed cropland areas were strongly associated with high risk for SFTS.
