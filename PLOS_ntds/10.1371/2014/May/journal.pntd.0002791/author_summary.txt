Despite reaching the global elimination target for leprosy, the need for a diagnostic tool to detect pre-symptomatic disease remains. Transmission has not been completely intercepted despite over 30 years of extensive curative treatment. With limited resources, two new leprosy skin test antigens, MLSA-LAM and MLCwA, suitable for human application were developed and manufactured in a local pilot plant. Requirements for manufacturing and clinical testing were met and an Investigational New Drug was established with the Food and Drug Administration to test both antigens in a phase I clinical trial for safety in a non-endemic region for leprosy and a phase II clinical trial for safety and efficacy in an endemic region for leprosy.
