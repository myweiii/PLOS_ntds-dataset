Schistosomiasis is caused by infection with Schistosoma spp. parasites, for which the main treatment is the drug praziquantel (PZQ). Since PZQ does not prevent reinfection, an anti-schistosome vaccine based on the Schistosoma haematobium enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is being developed. In this study we investigated the GST-specific immune responses of people naturally exposed to schistosomes and the affect that PZQ has on these responses. We cultured blood samples from a schistosome-exposed community with GST before and six weeks after PZQ treatment and measured a range of soluble proteins (cytokines) in culture supernatants as indicators of blood cell activation and phenotype. Before treatment, GST-specific cytokine responses varied with host age, particularly in children with high intensity schistosome infections. Following treatment, GST activated blood samples from more individuals to produce a broader range of cytokines and the combination of GST-specific cytokine responses reflected a more pro-inflammatory immune phenotype than that observed pre-treatment. Post-treatment responses varied according to host age and pre-treatment infection status. Taken together, our study suggests that current and future GST-based vaccine trials should take host age, schistosome infection status and PZQ treatment history into account since these factors influence GST-specific immune activation.
