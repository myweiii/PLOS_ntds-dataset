After the interruption of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission by Triatoma infestans, a new epidemiological scenario emerged in Brazil: the oral route. In the Amazon region, considered as a non-endemic Chagas disease region, T. cruzi is thought to exist as an enzootic parasite of wild animals. Currently, this region comprises approximately 92.3% of human Chagas cases in Brazil, the majority of which are in the Pará state. Its capital, Belém, reports the highest number of acute Chagas disease (ACD) cases (associated with the consumption of açaí juice), despite being an urban environment without the domiciliation of triatomines or an enzootic cycle. Thus, we decided to test the hypothesis that the cases related to the urban area of Belém are derived from infected sylvatic triatomine bugs accidentally transported from the islands that provide the majority of the açaí fruit sold in the metropolitan area. We term this new epidemiological feature “Distantiae transmission,” indicating that the ACD cases in the metropolitan region of Belém are related to infected triatomines transported from the islands. In the Amazon region, food contamination by infected triatomines is the result of the unhygienic manipulation of açaí and is supposed to be controlled by an epidemiological and sanitary surveillance program.
