    "Background": "The new epidemiological scenario of orally transmitted Chagas disease that has emerged in Brazil, and mainly in the Amazon region, needs to be addressed with a new and systematic focus. Bel\u00e9m, the capital of Par\u00e1 state, reports the highest number of acute Chagas disease (ACD) cases associated with the consumption of a\u00e7a\u00ed juice.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "The wild and domestic enzootic transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi were evaluated in the two locations (Jurunas and Val-de C\u00e3es) that report the majority of the autochthonous cases of ACD in Bel\u00e9m city. Moreover, we evaluated the enzootic cycle on the three islands that provide most of the a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit that is consumed in these localities. We employed parasitological and serological tests throughout to evaluate infectivity competence and exposure to T. cruzi. In Val-de-C\u00e3es, no wild mammal presented positive parasitological tests, and 56% seroprevalence was observed, with low serological titers. Three of 14 triatomines were found to be infected (TcI). This unexpected epidemiological picture does not explain the high number of autochthonous ACD cases. In Jurunas, the cases of ACD could not be autochthonous because of the absence of any enzootic cycle of T. cruzi. In contrast, in the 3 island areas from which the a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit originates, 66.7% of wild mammals and two dogs displayed positive hemocultures, and 15.6% of triatomines were found to be infected by T. cruzi. Genotyping by mini-exon gene and PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) targeting revealed that the mammals and triatomines from the islands harbored TcI and Trypanosoma rangeli in single and mixed infections.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "These findings show that cases of Chagas disease in the urban area of Bel\u00e9m may be derived from infected triatomines coming together with the a\u00e7a\u00ed fruits from distant islands. We term this new epidemiological feature of Chagas disease as \u201cDistantiae transmission\u201d."
