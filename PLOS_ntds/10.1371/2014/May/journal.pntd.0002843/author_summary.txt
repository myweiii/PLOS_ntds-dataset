Accurate methods of diagnosis and optimal strategies to sample the population are essential for the reliable mapping and surveillance of infectious diseases. The current standard for detection of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) entails use of the Kato-Katz diagnostic method. Alternative diagnostic methods, such as flotation techniques like the Mini-FLOTAC, have been developed with hopes of achieving greater sensitivity and ease of use. Here, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Kato-Katz method and the Mini-FLOTAC method for detecting STH infection. We use Bayesian latent class modeling to calculate the diagnostic accuracy in the absence of a gold-standard method for STH detection. Stool samples were collected from school-age children using school-based and community-based sampling. We present cost estimates for use of the Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC diagnostic methods in combination with both sampling methods, providing cost data for the various survey scenarios. Sensitivity was comparable between the Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC methods for detection of any STH species over a single day (Kato Katz: 52.0%, Mini-FLOTAC: 49.1%) and consecutive days (Kato-Katz: 76.9%, Mini-FLOTAC: 74.1%). Costs were lowest in scenarios using the Kato-Katz method; cost per child tested and cost per case correctly classified for school-based sampling with the Kato-Katz diagnostic were $10.14 and $12.84 respectively. The lowest cost per case detected was $128.24 with community-based sampling and use of Kato-Katz. Further work is required on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and sampling methods for STH surveys and surveillance of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in various settings. To this end, we provide the model code used in the diagnostic analysis and a costing template for STH surveys.
