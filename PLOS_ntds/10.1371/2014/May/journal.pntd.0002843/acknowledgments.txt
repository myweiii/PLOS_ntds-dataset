We are most grateful to Giuseppe Cringoli (the inventor and patent holder of Mini-FLOTAC and FLOTAC), Laura Rinaldi and Maria Paola Maurelli from the University of Naples for donating the Mini-FLOTAC kits and providing training to TC and technical support. An additional thank you to Bruno Levecke for his comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.
