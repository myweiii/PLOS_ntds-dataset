Vibrio parahaemolyticus has been associated with several epidemics of foodborne diarrheal infection. Recent observations in several counties have shown the emergence of pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus with unique genetic features and their role in diarrheal outbreaks. Unlike other enteric pathogens, the appearance of pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus has not been associated with the economic/hygiene status of the population. The pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus continue to prevail in Kolkata, India since its appearance during 1996. The present communication describes not only the prevalence of pandemic serovars of V. parahaemolyticus, but also the appearance of novel serovars under the pandemic strain category. In addition, the trh gene was detected in some of the pandemic strains for the first time. In the newly emerged serovars genetic changes have occurred, as evidenced from the PFGE analysis. Overall, the antimicrobial susceptibility of pandemic strains remains unchanged for the past 20 years. The observations made in this study re-emphasize the importance of this pathogen and shows the recent genetic and serovar changes in the epidemiology of V. parahaemolyticus-mediated diarrhea.
