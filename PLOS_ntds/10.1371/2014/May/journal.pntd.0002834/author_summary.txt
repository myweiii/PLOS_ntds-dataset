Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by fungi of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii complexes, which live in the soil and affect mainly rural workers in the most productive period of their lives. PCM can relapse after effective treatment because quiescent fungi can reactivate. However, the physician has to differentiate a relapse from another disease. In the diagnosis of relapse, the classical double agar gel immunodiffusion test (DID) and the modern enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting (IB) were evaluated. The frequency of PCM relapse and its diagnosis were the objective of this study. The prevalence of relapse was low and the new serological tests presented a little higher sensitivity than DID. Since the serological tests presented only a moderate sensitivity, direct mycological, cytopathological, and histopathological examinations and isolation in culture for the fungi must be appropriately and routinely performed when the hypothesis of relapse is considered.
