Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness and the World Health Organization plans to eliminate it as a public health concern worldwide by the year 2020. This effort in large part involves mass oral antibiotic distributions to communities. A simplified trachoma grading scale is used to assess presence of active infection. Field workers must be properly trained and certified to perform these eye exams because their findings inform when to start and stop community-wide antibiotic treatments. Certification involves measuring agreement in trachoma grades between a trainee and an experienced grader on a test-set of trachoma photographs. Often, these test-sets have hard-to-grade cases of trachoma removed. We found that removing these borderline cases inflates agreement. Including these borderline cases in the test-set allows a more realistic estimate of agreement, but it is still difficult to assess a trainee's grades for cases which even experts disagree on. We found that reliability error, a measure derived from the decomposition of the Brier score (the mean squared error of a set of forecasts), can be used to assess a trainee's evaluation of these borderline cases.
