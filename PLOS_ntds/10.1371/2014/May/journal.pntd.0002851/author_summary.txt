Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) is the causal agent of one of the most frequent skin tumors found endemically or epidemically associated to HIV in Central and Eastern Africa. This highly variable virus tends to cluster geographically according to specific major subtypes. Its prevalence is high in that area and increases with age. Despite its association to all forms of Kaposi sarcoma and high prevalence described in some low income populations in Cameroon, KSHV arouses limited interest, and only few focused previous studies have looked into prevalence and modes of transmission, especially in families. Extended molecular epidemiology is unknown both in healthy individuals and in Kaposi patients, which led to looking for new insights among Bantu and Pygmy populations from rural villages in three regions of Cameroon sharing a quite similar living environment but yet genetically, socially, and culturally different. The present study is designed to describe variations of molecular subtypes in each of these population groups regarding their geography in rural areas of southern, central, and eastern Cameroon.
