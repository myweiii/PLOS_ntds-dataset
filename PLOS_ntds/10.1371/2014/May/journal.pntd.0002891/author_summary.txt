Flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus 1-4 (DENV1-4), are important arthropod-borne pathogens causing major public health threats worldwide. For example, JEV is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in eastern and southern Asia, affecting over 50,000 patients, and leads to 15,000 deaths annually. DENV is responsible for an estimated 50 million cases of dengue fever and over 450,000 cases of life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) each year. Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapeutics available for flaviviruses. Non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a multifunctional, viral protein that contains a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Both MTase and RdRP are required for replication of the viral genome. A conserved interface between MTase and RdRP was first identified in the full-length NS5 crystal structure of JEV. In this study we used the infectious clones of both JEV and DENV-2 to perform functional mutagenesis analyses and demonstrated for the first time that the recently identified conserved interface between MTase and RdRP is critical for viral replication. In a replicon system, we also confirmed that mutations within the conserved interface greatly affect viral RNA replication during viral infection. Our functional validation of the conserved MTase-RdRP interface consolidated its potential as a novel target for anti-flavivirus drug development.
