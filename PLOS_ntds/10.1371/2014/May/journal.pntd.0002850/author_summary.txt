Research on intracellular parasites require using non-invasive technologies to follow up parasite proliferation inside their natural host cells by staying in the more physiological conditions as possible. High Content Screening (HCS) technology has recently emerged as a powerful image-based approach to screen new anti-parasitic compounds or to test parasite susceptibility to existing drugs in vitro. Nevertheless, such equipments will remain poorly accessible for most of academic and clinical diagnostic laboratories that mostly use more affordable, but laborious, microscopic counting procedures. The current work proposes new image-based, open-source software which provides a fast and accurate solution for investigating intracellular parasite quantification. Through an easy-to-use interface, cells' and parasites' information are dug out from DNA fluorescent images, and host cells' boundaries are extracted from corresponding phase contrast image set. Parasites are then reassigned to their related cells and intra/extracellular parasites are discriminated for each cell. The software further automatically calculates all data required for most of experimental infection studies. INsPECT software is proposed as a free substitute or complement to the available quantification methods for measuring Leishmania infection level in vitro. It may be enlarged, however, to different intracellular trypanosomatids or unrelated parasites such as T. gondii.
