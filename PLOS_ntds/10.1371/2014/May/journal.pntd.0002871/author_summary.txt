Treatment of dermal leishmaniasis is unsuccessful in an important proportion of cases and evidence of loss of susceptibility to antimonial drugs and miltefosine has been demonstrated in some cases of treatment failure with these medications. Despite the variability in the clinical outcome of treatment, little is known about the susceptibility of the different species and diverse populations of these species circulating in areas of high transmission. Based on 402 strains isolated from patients, the susceptibility of the Leishmania species most frequently causing dermal leishmaniasis in Colombia was determined to first and second line medications commonly used in Latin America. The results showed that susceptibility to each drug varied among the species and populations of each species, geographically between regions east and west of the Andes mountain range, during different time periods over 30 years, and within different epidemiological circumstances. The findings provide a comprehensive picture of drug susceptibility of dermal leishmaniasis in Colombia and baseline information for monitoring the emergence of drug resistance.
