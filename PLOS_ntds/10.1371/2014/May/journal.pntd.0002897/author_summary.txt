Scabies is a neglected, contagious skin disease caused by a parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is highly prevalent world-wide, and now recognized as a possible underlying factor for secondary bacterial infections with potential serious downstream complications. There is currently few experimental data demonstrating directly that mite infestation promotes bacterial infections. Due to remarkable similarities in terms of immunology, physiology and skin anatomy between pigs and humans, we developed a sustainable porcine model enabling in vivo studies of scabies mite infestations. Here, we investigated the impact of the scabies mite infection on the normal pig skin microbiota in the inner ear pinnae in young piglets. Samples obtained prior to, during infection and after acaricide treatment were analyzed by sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA. We report that scabies infestation has an impact on the host's skin microbiota. Staphylococcus abundance increased with the onset of infection and remained beyond treatment and healing. A shift from commensal to pathogenic Staphylococci was observed. This study supports the link between scabies and Staphylococcus infections, as seen in humans. It is the first in vivo demonstration of a mite induced shift in the skin microbiota, providing a basis for a similar study in humans.
