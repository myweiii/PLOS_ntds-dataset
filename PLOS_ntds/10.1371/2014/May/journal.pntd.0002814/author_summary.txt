Although the abundance of reports about hemostatic disturbances in snakebites, few studies have addressed how crude snake venoms evoke blood coagulation disturbances in vivo. Snake venoms contain several components that disturb hemostasis, and the prevailing model claims that coagulation disturbances observed in patients are triggered directly by those toxins. However, taking into account the physiological mechanisms that activate the coagulation cascade, tissue factor might also be generated and decrypted during snake envenomation. We investigated herein if tissue factor and protein disulfide isomerase, an enzyme that controls the encryption/decryption of tissue factor, were altered during experimental envenomation in rats. We observed increased activity/expression of tissue factor at the site of venom injection, as well as in lungs, and decreased expression of protein disulfide isomerase at the site of venom injection. Moreover, tissue factor levels were raised in plasma, demonstrating thereby that this via may be crucial to activate blood coagulation in patients, especially in those more severely envenomed. We also noticed that snake venom metalloproteinases accounted for most fibrinogen consumption. Our results clarify the mechanisms that activate blood coagulation during envenomation, evidencing that true intravascular coagulation syndrome, due to increased tissue factor expression, might occur during snake envenomation in human beings.
