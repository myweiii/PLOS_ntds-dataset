Routine sampling of mosquito vector populations is common in dengue-endemic countries worldwide despite doubts about methods used or the correlation between vector density and dengue transmission. This systematic review examined the published evidence investigating associations between vector indices and dengue cases. From a total of 1205 papers identified in database searches, 18 were included for review. A range of designs were seen, particularly in spatial sampling and analyses, and all but 3 were classed as weak study designs. Thirteen studies investigated associations between vector indices and dengue cases: 4 reported positive correlations, 4 found no correlation and 5 reported ambiguous/unreliable associations. Of 7 studies that measured the Breteau Index, 6 reported dengue transmission at levels below the currently accepted threshold of 5. There was little evidence of quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used to predict outbreaks. Furthermore, appropriately designed studies are required to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission. Recommendations include: standardizing study designs, particularly with respect to spatial heterogeneity; vector surveillance programs should sample adult mosquitoes; global values of the Breteau Index are not reliable universal dengue transmission thresholds; and better knowledge of vector ecology is required.
