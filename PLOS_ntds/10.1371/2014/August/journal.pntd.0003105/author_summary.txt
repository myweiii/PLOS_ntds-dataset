Digestive damage due to Chagas disease (CD), which symptoms are non-specific, occurs in 15â€“20% of patients as a result of peristaltic dysfunction. The results of this study with 71 individuals with T. cruzi infection and 18 without it coming from Latin American countries and performed in a non endemic setting showed that the prevalence of digestive chronic CD was 20.8% in T. cruzi infected patients. Dysphagia is a non-pathognomonic symptom of CD, but a good marker of early esophageal involvement. Manometry could be a useful diagnostic test in selected cases, mainly in patients with T. cruzi infection and dysphagia in whose situation barium swallow does not evidence alterations. Constipation is a common but non-specific symptom that can be easily managed. Testing for CD is mandatory in a patient from Latin America with constipation or dysphagia, and if diagnosis is confirmed, megacolon and esophageal involvement should be investigated.
