Fifty percent of all visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases globally occur in India, where up to 90% of cases occur in the state of Bihar. There are also an estimated 300,000 people in Bihar living with HIV/AIDS. Patients with HIV who are treated for VL typically have much worse outcomes than VL patients who are HIV-negative, yet there exists very little evidence suggesting more effective treatments for this group. Between 2007–2012, with support of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated 8,749 VL patients in Bihar using liposomal amphotericin-B (AmBisome). Here we describe the characteristics and long-term outcomes of a subgroup of 159 HIV-VL co-infected patients treated within this program over the 5-year period. Their estimated mortality risk was 14.3% at six months after treatment, 22.4% at two years and 29.7% at four years. Estimated risk of relapse was 16.1% at one year, 20.4% at two years and 25.9% at four years. We conclude that treatment of HIV-VL co-infected patients with 20–25 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin-B is well tolerated and relatively effective. However, HIV-VL co-infection is a complex chronic disease with high early mortality and much worse outcomes than VL alone, and requires a multidisciplinary long-term management strategy.
