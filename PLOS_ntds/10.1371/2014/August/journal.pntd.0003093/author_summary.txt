Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is endemic in 88 countries, primarily located in tropical and subtropical regions, that affects more than 12 million people worldwide. Leishmaniasis treatments are currently based on pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B; however, these drugs result in numerous adverse side effects and variable efficacy. In addition, the drugs are expensive, and parasite resistance to these drugs has been observed. The lack of affordable therapy necessitates the development of novel antileishmanial therapies. We investigated the antileishmanial activity of EGCG in vitro and in vivo and described the mechanism of EGCG action against Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. EGCG reduced promastigote viability and the infection index in a time- and dose-dependent manner with a selectivity index of 149.5. This effect was reversed by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-catalase, suggesting that ROS production is a mechanism of action in promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. Additionally, EGCG reduced ΔΨm and intracellular ATP concentrations in promastigotes. Furthermore, EGCG treatment was also effective in vivo, demonstrating oral bioavailability and reduced lesion sizes and parasitic load (92% of reduction) without altering serological toxicity markers. Additional studies should be conducted to determine the ideal dose and therapeutic regimen.
