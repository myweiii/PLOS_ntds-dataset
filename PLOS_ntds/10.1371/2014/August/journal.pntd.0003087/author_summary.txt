Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, has been targeted for elimination in many countries since the introduction of mass drug administration (MDA) programs using two-drug combinations along with improved diagnostic methods. Sensitive molecular methods detecting parasite DNA in pools of mosquitoes, along with efficient mosquito collection methods, can help identify sites of continuing LF transmission that may require further treatment after MDA has eliminated transmission in most areas. We tested mosquitoes from villages throughout American Samoa after the conclusion of a series of annual MDAs. Widespread but low prevalence of parasite DNA in mosquitoes from two of the five islands suggested continued occurrence of LF. In this study, parasite DNA detection in mosquitoes helped identify areas where human infections exist and additional treatment may be needed. In the future, development of more efficient mosquito collection methods for local species would facilitate larger sample sizes and more precise estimates of prevalence. In addition, developing a better understanding of the epidemiological significance of parasite DNA prevalence in the local mosquitoes will increase the operational value of those estimates for LF elimination programs.
