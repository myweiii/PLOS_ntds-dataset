Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, which is a major cause of septic death in endemic areas of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. This range now appears to be expanding, and with the increased incidence of diabetes, which is a major predisposing factor for B. pseudomallei infections, it is believed these cases will continue to increase. This organism is also categorized as a Tier 1 select agent with great potential for misuse as a bioweapon. Thus, there is great interest in developing vaccines and other immunotherapies for melioidosis. To better design these treatments, it is essential to understand which immune cells are capable of controlling B. pseudomallei, particularly during early stages of infection, and which immune mediators are required for these cells to optimally eradicate these bacteria. In this work, we identified that both macrophages and neutrophils were capable of internalizing and killing B. pseudomallei, but required different immune mediators to allow these effects. Complement and antibody-mediated opsonization was sufficient to promote uptake and killing of B. pseudomallei by neutrophils, whereas these opsonins could only enhance uptake by macrophages; macrophage-mediated killing required IFNγ. These findings suggest that successful therapies must elicit complement-activating antibodies and IFNγ to eradicate/prevent melioidosis.
