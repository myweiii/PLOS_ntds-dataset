    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs have been shown to contribute to a repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral infection. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA-30e* (miR-30e*) directly targeted the I\u03baB\u03b1 3\u2032-UTR and disrupted the NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB\u03b1 negative feedback loop, leading to hyperactivation of NF-\u03baB. This current study investigated the possible role of miR-30e* in the regulation of innate immunity associated with dengue virus (DENV) infection. We found that DENV infection could induce miR-30e* expression in DENV-permissive cells, and such an overexpression of miR-30e* upregulated IFN-\u03b2 and the downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as OAS1, MxA and IFITM1, and suppressed DENV replication. Furthermore, suppression of I\u03baB\u03b1 mediates the enhancing effect of miR-30e* on IFN-\u03b2-induced antiviral response. Collectively, our findings suggest a modulatory role of miR-30e* in DENV induced IFN-\u03b2 signaling via the NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether miR-30e* has an anti-DENV effect in vivo."
