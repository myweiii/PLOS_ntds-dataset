Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases; though it is caused by the Dengue virus (DENV) in tropical/subtropical areas, it has shown tendency toward becoming a global public health concern, with estimated annual numbers of 50–100 million dengue infection cases and 500,000 people with severe disease who require hospitalization worldwide. Thus far no licensed vaccine or specific anti-DENV treatment for dengue is clinically available. Understanding the interaction of DENV with their human hosts is key to identifying potential therapeutic targets. In this work, we found that microRNA miR-30e* significantly suppressed DENV replication by promoting NF-κB-dependent IFN-β production. Our findings identifies miR-30e* as a possible restriction host factor for DENV infection, via positively modulating the antiviral innate immune response. Thus, this work broadens the understanding of the pivotal roles of miR-30e* in the interaction between DENV and the host.
