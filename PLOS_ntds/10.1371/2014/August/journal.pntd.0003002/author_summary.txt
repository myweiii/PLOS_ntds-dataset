A rapid and sensitive serodiagnostic assay for strongyloidiasis based on a 31-kDa recombinant antigen from Strongyloides stercoralis (NIE) was developed using a novel diffraction-based optical biosensor technology. Assay performance was tested using retrospectively collected sera from patients with parasitologically confirmed strongyloidiasis (n = 54) and control sera from healthy individuals (n = 7) or those with other parasitoses including schistosomiasis, trichinosis, echinococcosis or amebiasis (n = 40). If we consider the control group as the true negative group, the assay readily differentiated S. stercoralis-infected patients from controls detecting 96.3% of the positive cases, and with no cross reactivity observed in the control group. These results were in excellent agreement (κ = 0.98) with results obtained by an NIE-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A further 44 sera from patients with suspected S. stercoralis infection were analyzed and showed 91% agreement with the NIE ELISA. This test provides high sensitivity detection of serum IgG against the NIE Strongyloides antigen. The assay is easy to perform and provides results in less than 30 minutes, making this platform amenable to rapid near-patient screening with minimal technical expertise.
