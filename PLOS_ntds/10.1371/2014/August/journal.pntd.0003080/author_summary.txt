In the developing world, over 207 million people are infected with blood-dwelling parasitic Schistosoma worms. Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni are the most widespread species. In Africa, they often occur together in the same area, with many people carrying both species. Yet, little is known about the differences in immune response that the human host develops against these two species. It is also unknown whether the presence of one species may affect the immune response to the other. We here investigated 200 people from an area in the north of Senegal where both species occur. They were examined for Schistosoma infections, as well as for immune responses to the two species. We observed that both infections were characterized by very similar cytokine responses. However, S. haematobium antigens induced higher levels of cytokines than S. mansoni. This suggests that S. haematobium may give rise to stronger immune responses, and may help to explain differences between the two most important Schistosoma species regarding the occurrence of infection and morbidity.
