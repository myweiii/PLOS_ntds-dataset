Many details of the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, an infection caused by the intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi that is endemic in Southeast Asia, have remained unclear until today. In this study, we present an experimental self-healing mouse model of scrub typhus based on footpad skin inoculation of the human pathogenic Karp strain of O. tsutsugamushi that shares many features with human infection. We established a novel quantitative PCR with increased sensitivity for the measurement of bacterial organ loads of infected mice. It was thereby shown that O. tsutsugamushi initially accumulated in the regional lymph node and subsequently spread to many organs with the highest bacterial loads found in the lung. The predominant host cells in the lung were macrophages located in the parenchymal interstitium, rather than endothelial cells. Our data also show unexpected organ-specific differences in the dynamics of macrophage activation. This mouse model will help to advance our understanding of scrub typhus pathogenesis.
