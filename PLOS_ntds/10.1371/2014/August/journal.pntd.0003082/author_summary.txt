Toxocarosis, a typical neglected and underestimated human health problem, is caused by the ascarid nematodes Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, which primarily infect dogs and cats, respectively. Previous studies have reported an increased risk for Toxocara infection in humans worldwide, especially in children and psychiatric patients. This pilot study was aimed to investigate the Toxocara serology in clinically healthy individuals, pregnant women and psychiatric patients in Shandong Province, eastern China using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The overall Toxocara seroprevalence among the study population (n = 2866) was 12.25%, and a significantly higher seroprevalence in psychiatric patients (16.40%, 73/445) than that in clinically healthy individuals (13.07%, 187/1431) and pregnant women (9.19%, 91/990) was revealed. Keeping dogs at home, contact with cats and dogs, and exposure with soil were found to be associated with Toxocara infection. Our findings indicate that human infection with Toxocara is common in eastern China, posing a significant public health concern.
