Schistosomiasis, caused by schistosomes, is one of the most prevalent parasitic infections, and often results in chronic hepatic fibrosis. The induction of HSC apoptosis reverses schistosome-induced hepatic fibrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that soluble egg antigens (SEA) from schistosomes could inhibit HSC activation and induce apoptosis in vitro. Here, we found that SEA could induce apoptosis in LX-2 cells by upregulating p53 and DR5 and downregulating p-Akt. SEA-induced HSC apoptosis could be decreased by p53-specific siRNA or DR5-specific shRNA. In addition, GW501516, which enhances the expression of Akt, could also reduce the HSC apoptosis induced by SEA. Our data suggest that SEA can induce HSC apoptosis by downregulating Akt expression and upregulating p53-dependent DR5 expression.
