Buruli Ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans infection. It has been recognized for many years that BU pathogenesis is mediated by the potent exotoxin mycolactone; however, the molecular action of this toxin on the host cell biology that drives its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we present a proteomic-based study that explores the molecular action of mycolactone on host cells biology. Our results provide further molecular evidence for the cytoskeleton-disarrangement induced by mycolactone, and unveil its impact on cytoskeleton-dependent cellular functions. Moreover, we extend the field of action of this toxin to the biosynthesis of collagen, implicating mycolactone on the decrease of dermal collagen found on BU lesions. Given the dependence of M. ulcerans virulence on its toxin, these findings on mycolactone's molecular action on host cells and tissues are of major importance for the understanding of BU pathogenesis.
