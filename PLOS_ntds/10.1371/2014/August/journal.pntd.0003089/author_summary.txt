Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and has been detrimental to millions of people in Latin America since the early 1900s, and now this disease is having a global impact. Decades later, there is still no vaccine for this disease. Scientists have used the adenovirus vector in gene therapy as well as vaccine therapy for many diseases. In this study, adenovirus is used as the host vector for a potential vaccine against Chagas disease in a non-traditional way. Instead of the antigen being expressed as a transgene product, the antigen is incorporated on the capsid of the adenovirus to evoke an enhanced humoral immune response against T. cruzi. This study highlights the modified adenovirus' ability to elicit a strong anti-T. cruzi humoral response as well as providing protection against Trypanosoma cruzi infection. These findings illustrate the true potential of generating an effective T. cruzi vaccine by means of unique gene therapy-based techniques.
