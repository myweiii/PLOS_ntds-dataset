Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous, worldwide-distributed mycosis, endemic in some areas and is caused by dimorphic fungi from the complex Sporothrix schenckii. Its association with zoonotic transmission remains a relevant public health problem in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, affecting a large at-risk population, which includes HIV-infected individuals. A comprehensive search of a National reference institute for infectious diseases' database retrieved information regarding 48 patients with sporotrichosis-HIV co-infection (group 1), as well as 3,570 patients with sporotrichosis (group 2), registered from 1987 through March 2013. Group 1 mainly comprised young, non-white men, while group 2 was predominantly comprised of white middle-aged women. HIV infection aggravates sporotrichosis, as seen with patients from group 1, who presented more severe disseminated sporotrichosis, a higher need for hospitalization and risk of death due to this mycosis. Due to its aggressive presentation, sporotrichosis elicited HIV testing and subsequent diagnosis in 19/48 patients. Underserved populations, among whom sporotrichosis has propagated, have been affected by different transmissible (e.g., HIV) and non-transmissible diseases. These populations should be targeted by community development programs and entitled to integrated management and care of their superimposed burdens.
