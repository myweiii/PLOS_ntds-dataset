Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are intestinal parasites that infect over 2 billion people in the world. Children infected with STHs often experience growth delays and perform poorly in school. However, the specific effects of STH infections on school absenteeism in children are not well understood. In this study, the authors followed Grade 5 students from 18 different schools, for four months. Students from all 18 schools were administered drugs at baseline to treat STH infections. Students from nine randomly selected schools then received weekly lectures and were given booklets on STH prevention, in an effort to prevent re-infection. Using a post-trial non-randomized analysis, the authors found that, while this health education intervention had no effect on overall absenteeism rates, Grade 5 students who had been re-infected during the four months following treatment had higher absenteeism rates than students who were uninfected after four months. These results contribute to a better understanding of the negative impact of STH infections on child health, showing that STH infections do increase the risk of absenteeism. These results also show that health education interventions, while powerful tools in the fight against STH infections, likely need to be implemented over longer periods of time to impact overall absenteeism rates. These findings are of interest to decision makers looking to implement and evaluate STH-targeted education programs.
