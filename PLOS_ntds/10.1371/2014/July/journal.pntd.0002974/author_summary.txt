The blood-dwelling fluke Schistosoma haematobium produce eggs which can inflict lesions both in the urinary and genital tract. Lesions in the female genital tract have been hypothesised to confer higher risk of contraction of HIV and other genital infections. These epithelial genital lesions are visibly different and three types can be observed; rubbery papules, homologous sandy patches and grainy sandy patches. Like other helminths, active S. haematobium infection is associated with eosinophilia. Therefore eosinophil granule proteins might be useful markers for active inflammation related to female genital schistosomiasis lesions. This study identifies the rubbery papules as a potential early-stage inflammatory lesion type associated with high levels of eosinophil granule proteins in vaginal lavage. It may be advantageous to identify female genital lesions relatively early after infection as chronic inflammation stage lesions might not respond to praziquantel treatment.
