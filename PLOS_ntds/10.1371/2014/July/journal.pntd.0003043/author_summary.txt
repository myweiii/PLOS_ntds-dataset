Tropical diseases consist of a group of debilitating and fatal infections that occur primarily in rural and urban settings of tropical and subtropical countries. While the primary indices of an infection are mostly the presentation of clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes due to an infection with tropical pathogens are often unspecific. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention, appropriate and adequate treatments, and patient management to prevent development of sequelae and transmission. Although, multiplex assays are available for the simultaneous detection of tropical pathogens, they are generally of low throughput. Performing parallel assays to cover the detection for a comprehensive scope of tropical infections that include protozoan, bacterial and viral infections is undoubtedly labor-intensive and time consuming. We present an integrated lab-on-chip using microfluidics technology coupled with reverse transcription (RT), PCR amplification, and microarray hybridization for the simultaneous identification and differentiation of 26 tropical pathogens that cause 14 globally important tropical diseases. Such diagnostics capacity would facilitate evidence-based management of patients, improve the specificity of treatment and, in some cases, even allow contact tracing and other disease-control measures.
