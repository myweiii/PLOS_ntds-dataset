West Nile virus (WNV), frequently transmitted to humans and other susceptible species via bites of infected mosquitoes, is a significant global public health threat. Limited information is available on WNV epidemiology in Turkey, located in the endemic zone of the agent around the Mediterranean Sea. This study was performed to reveal WNV activity in potential hosts and vector mosquitoes, involving 11 provinces in Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus during 2011â€“2013. Our findings indicate virus exposure in humans and various animals in previously unexplored regions as well as a high rate of virus circulation in equine blood samples during the mosquito season. Field-captured mosquito specimens demonstrated the presence of major WNV vectors among 15 species identified. WNV infection was detected in 1.9% of the pooled mosquito specimens. Molecular characterization of the individual mosquitoes of the infected pools revealed Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. perexiguus species, important WNV vectors where Culex quinquefasciatus not previously known to exist in Turkey. Partial viral genome sequences obtained from infected hosts were characterized as lineage 1, the predominant pathogenic WNV strain circulating in Europe as well as the American Continent.
