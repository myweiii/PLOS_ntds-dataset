The disease Kala-azar is caused by Leishmania donovani (LD). The disease is characterized by the depression of cellular immune response. In the Indian subcontinent LD parasites are mostly resistant to commonly used antileishmanial drug, like sodium antimony gluconate (SAG). It is known that infection with pentavalent antimony (Sb)-resistant parasites induces aggressive pathology- the cause is still not known. Sb-resistant parasites endowed with unique glycan which may also play an important role in the pathogenesis as following removal of terminal sugar of glycan these parasites behave like sensitive parasites. The diagnosis of the disease is possible after the disease sets in and therefore limited information is available on the host-parasite interaction at the onset of disease. As a surrogate of in vivo scenario we studied the interaction between normal human PBMC with Sb-sensitive and Sb-resistant parasites. The Sb-resistant parasites upon interaction with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro produced two distinct inhibitory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-Î². Similar experiment with Sb-sensitive LD induced much less amount of above cytokines. Thus aggressive pathology induced by Sb-resistant LD, may be, in part attributed to production of dual inhibitory cytokines where surface glycan of the parasite may play a decisive role.
