Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused several life-threatening epidemics in children in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. EV71 has one single serotype as measured using hyper-immune animal antisera but can be phylogenetically classified into three major genogroups (A, B and C) and eleven genotypes (A, B1–B5, and C1–C5). Recently, epidemiological studies in the Asia-Pacific region have found that large-scale EV71 epidemics occurred cyclically with different genotypes. This observation of genotype replacement, in conjunction with the observed antigenic variations among different EV71 genogroups in human studies, has kindled the interest to establish animal models to monitor the antigenic variations of EV71. In this study, we developed a rabbit model to monitor antigenic variations of EV71, which could be further integrated into national enterovirus surveillance systems.
