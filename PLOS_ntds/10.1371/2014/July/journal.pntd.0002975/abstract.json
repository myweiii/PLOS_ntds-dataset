    "Background": "Treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, praziquantel. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop additional therapeutics against schistosomiasis. The antimalarial drug mefloquine shows antischistosomal activity in animal models and clinical trials, which calls for further investigations.",
    "Methodology": "We comparatively assessed the efficacy and tolerability of the following treatments against Schistosoma haematobium in school-aged children in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: (i) praziquantel (40 mg/kg; standard treatment); (ii) mefloquine (25 mg/kg) combined with praziquantel (40 mg/kg); and (iii) mefloquine-artesunate (3\u00d7 (100 mg artesunate +250 mg mefloquine)) combined with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) (treatments administered on subsequent days). Two urine samples were collected before, and on days 21\u201322 and 78\u201379 after the first dosing.",
    "Principal Findings": "Sixty-one children were present on all examination time points and had complete datasets. No difference in efficacy was observed between the three treatment groups on either follow-up. On the 21\u201322 day posttreatment follow-up, based on available case analysis, cure rates of 33% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11\u201355%), 29% (95% CI 8\u201350%), and 26% (95% CI 5\u201348%) were observed for praziquantel, mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel, and mefloquine-praziquantel, respectively. The corresponding egg reduction rates were 94% and above. On the second follow-up, observed cure rates ranged from 19% (praziquantel) to 33% (mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel), and egg reduction rates were above 90%. Praziquantel monotherapy was the best tolerated treatment. In the mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel group, adverse events were reported by 91% of the participants, and in the mefloquine-praziquantel group, 95% experienced adverse events. With the exception of abdominal pain at moderate severity, adverse events were mild.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The addition of mefloquine or mefloquine-artesunate does not increase the efficacy of praziquantel against chronic S. haematobium infection. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effect of the combinations against acute schistosomiasis."
