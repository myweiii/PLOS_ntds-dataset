Infection of humans and non-human primates (NHPs) with Ebola virus (EBOV) can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, an acute systemic illness which can lead to death. The high case fatality rates (25%â€“90%) make EBOV a virus of significant concern from a biodefense perspective. To date, there are no FDA-approved post-exposure treatments for human use, and there are no standard assays to predict how infected individuals will fare after becoming infected. We have analyzed how circulating immune cells respond to EBOV infection under conditions where NHPs either survive viral infection, or succumb to it. This analysis identified genes that are correlated with, and predictive of, survival following lethal EBOV infection in NHPs. Our results demonstrate that small gene sets and transcriptional regulatory networks can be used to identify individual markers associated with survival following EBOV infection.
