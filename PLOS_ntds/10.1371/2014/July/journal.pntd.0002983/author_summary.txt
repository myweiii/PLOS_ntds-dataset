Children from the developing world are often burdened with intestinal worms due to poor water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. However, the assessment of the burden due to intestinal worms is difficult, and thus, the benefits of deworming are unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of deworming on the physical fitness and strength of 9- to 12-year-old children in Yunnan, China, where intestinal worms are common. Children were treated with triple-dose albendazole or placebo and monitored over a 6-month period. Stool samples were collected for the diagnosis of intestinal worm infections. Physical fitness was estimated with a 20-m shuttle run test and physical strength was assessed with grip strength and standing broad jump tests. Children receiving triple-dose albendazole scored slightly higher values in the primary and secondary outcomes than those children who were given placebo. However, the differences were not significant. We also found that children infected with intestinal worms performed significantly worse in the physical fitness and strength tests than their non-infected counterparts. In particular, the negative impact of whipworm infection on physical fitness warrants further investigation.
