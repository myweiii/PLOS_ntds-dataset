Tropical diseases, such as paracoccidioidomycosis, are the most common type of neglected diseases. From 1980 to 1995, 3,181 deaths from paracoccidioidomycosis occurred in Brazil, representing the eighth most common cause of death from predominantly chronic or recurrent types of infectious and parasitic diseases, showing considerable magnitude and low visibility. Paracoccidioidomycosis is traditionally assumed to be caused solely by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, but a new species, Paracoccidioides lutzii, was discovered in the Central-Western region of Brazil. Thus, new antigenic preparations and tests for an accurate differential diagnosis between these two species appear to be needed. This study aimed to develop new antigenic preparations from P. lutzii isolates to improve the diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis. We used patient serum samples predominantly from the Central-Western region of Brazil. Various antigenic preparations were tested, and a cell free antigen derived from P. lutzii was an excellent antigen for serological diagnosis and able to diagnose 100% of sera from patients with PCM due to P. lutzii.
