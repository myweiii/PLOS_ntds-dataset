Schistosome parasites are the cause of human schistosomiasis and infect more than 240 million people worldwide. Schistosome larvae, termed cercariae, are a free-swimming mobile developmental stage responsible for host infection. These larvae produce enzymes that degrade human skin, allowing them to pass into the human host. After invasion, they continue to evade the immune system and develop into adult worms. The transition from free-swimming larvae in freshwater to invasion into a warm-blooded saline environment requires that the parasite regulate genes to adapt to these changes. Heat shock factor 1 is a well-characterized activator of stress and heat response that functions in cellular nuclei. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed non-nuclear localization for anti-Heat shock factor 1 signal in the secretory glands necessary for the invasive function of schistosome larvae. This observation expands the potential mechanistic roles for Heat shock factor 1 and may aid in our understanding of schistosome host invasion and early development.
