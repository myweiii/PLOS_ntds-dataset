The oral cholera vaccination campaign was the result of a collaborative effort of many individuals and organizations. The authors acknowledge the Haitian Ministry of Health, Amanda Schiff, Claude Santiague, and Rose Makie Joseph for their tireless dedication to the project. We thank our Partners In Health and Zanmi Lasante colleagues and volunteers, especially J Gregory Jerome, Charles Patrick Almazor, Ralph Ternier, Matthew Peckarsky, Zibiao Zhang, Mark Goodrich, and Alexandra Bradbury, for their guidance, support, and technical assistance. We also wish to thank community members, leaders, and residents of Bocozel and Grand Saline, whose support made this project possible.
