In Coast Province, Kenya, infections with Schistosoma haematobium, Plasmodium spp., filarial nematodes, and geohelminths are common, resulting in high levels of both single infections and polyparasitism. The long-term effect of these infections, separately or in combination, has a major impact on human health and on the economic welfare of affected populations. The transmission dynamics of these parasitic infections can be linked to shared risk factors that often overlap in space. We studied human and environmental factors driving transmission and the resulting spatial pattern of infections in six communities, using cross-sectional, socio-economic and entomological surveys. Single and co-infections were widespread in the communities, and were associated with environmental, demographic and socio-economic risk factors, including distance of community from the coast, sanitation and human age and crowding. The spatial patterns of single and co-infections were heterogeneous among and within communities, with overlapping clusters of single and multiple infections in areas where houses with lower socio-economic status and more crowding were located. The heterogeneities among and within communities can provide important insights when designing surveillance and intervention strategies when planning appropriate surveillance and control strategies targeting polyparasitism.
