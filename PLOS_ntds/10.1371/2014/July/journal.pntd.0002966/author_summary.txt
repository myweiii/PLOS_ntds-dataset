Scrub typhus is a disease found in Southeast Asia that infects over 1 million people each year. This disease is caused by the intracellular pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi transmitted by the bite of chigger mites. Scrub typhus is characterized by pulmonary disease and in severe cases, multiorgan system failure. The current research model utilizes an intraperitoneal route of inoculation of mice to study the host response to Orientia infection. Infection via this route results in severe peritonitis that does not occur in human scrub typhus. The development of animal models that accurately portray human disease is an important step toward understanding and managing disease. In this manuscript we describe a new mouse model that results in scrub typhus-like pathology following intravenous inoculation of mice. This model presents dose-dependent mortality with scrub typhus-like pathology that parallels human disease. Utilization of this model will provide a valuable research tool for characterizing the immune response and pathogenesis induced by O. tsutsugamushi allowing development of better treatment and an effective vaccine.
