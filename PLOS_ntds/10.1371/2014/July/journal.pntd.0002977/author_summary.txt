Chronic infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes progressive damage to the heart and other organs that is fatal in about 30% of cases. Known as Chagas disease, this is a major public health problem in Latin America. The existing medicines were developed over forty years ago and are not widely used because of toxicity and unreliable effectiveness. To discover better treatments, we screened a collection of existing drugs for growth inhibitory activity on Trypanosoma cruzi. Several dozen orally administered drugs were discovered, but when used by themselves they were not strong enough to cure the infection in an animal model. We tested a set of 24 of these drugs in every two-way combination and identified eight synergistic partners. At least two of these combinations were able to substantially lower parasite levels in the mouse model of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Thus, finding pairs of FDA-approved drugs that can be used in combination may be a pragmatic and effective strategy for designing new therapies for Chagas disease.
