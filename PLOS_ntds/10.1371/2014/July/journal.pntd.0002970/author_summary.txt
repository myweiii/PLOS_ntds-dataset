Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has recently re-emerged from Africa to cause disease outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and more recently the Caribbean. The virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes a disease that is characterized by high fever and incapacitating joint pain that can cause great personal and economic loss. At present, no approved vaccine or antivirals are approved against CHIKV. In this study, we developed a novel CHIKV vaccine that is vectored by Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an attenuated vaccine vector which has been shown to be safe in humans and induce a strong immune response. The vaccine expresses the E3 and E2 proteins of CHIKV, the latter of which is thought to be the main mediator of protection. The vaccine was effective in two mouse models and protected against all markers of disease tested despite the absence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies, the gold standard of protection. Depletion of CD4+ T cells from vaccinated mice resulted in loss of protection, implicating these cells in the protection induced by the vaccine.
