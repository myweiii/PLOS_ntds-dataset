Syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, can progress to affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause damage in the brain and spinal cord, which is called neurosyphilis. While many neurosyphilis patients may not have any symptoms, some patients develop severe symptoms which can be life-threatening. Th17 cells are a subset of CD4+ T helper cells producing the hallmark cytokine IL-17, which are essential for effective antimicrobial host defense and are also involved in tissue damage. In this study we conduct a comparative analysis of Th17/IL-17 in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of syphilis patients without neurological abnormalities, and neurosyphilis patients with or without symptoms. Th17 frequency in peripheral blood was significantly increased in neurosyphilis. CSF IL-17 was increased in neurosyphilis patients, especially in those with symptomatic neurosyphilis. Levels of CSF IL-17 in neurosyphilis patients were positively associated with CNS damage. Notably, neurosyphilis patients with undetectable CSF IL-17 had better outcome upon treatment. These findings indicate that the Th17 response may be involved in central nervous system damage, clinical symptoms and prognosis of treatment of neurosyphilis patients.
