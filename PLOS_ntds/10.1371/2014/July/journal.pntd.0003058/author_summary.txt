Tungiasis (sand flea disease), a parasitic skin disease, causes important morbidity, and eventually leads to mutilation of the feet. Hitherto, the only effective treatment is the surgical extraction of embedded sand fleas. In the endemic areas this is done using inappropriate sharp instruments and causes more harm than good. We identified the three last abdominal segments of Tunga penetrans which protrude through the skin and through which the parasite breathes, defecates, and expels eggs - as an Achilles heel of embedded sand fleas. In a proof-of-principle study we investigated whether this Achilles heel is vulnerable to dimeticone with a low viscosity and a high creeping property. We randomized the left and the right feet to either receive a topical application of KMnO4 (the standard treatment in Kenya) or of dimeticone. The major outcome measure was the absence of viability signs of the treated sand fleas. The study shows that the topical application of a mixture of two dimeticones (NYDA) effectively kills embedded sand fleas within seven days. Since dimeticones are considered to be wholly non-toxic and are not expensive the new treatment could become a means to control tungiasis-associated morbidity on the population level.
