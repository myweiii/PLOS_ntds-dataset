Enteroviruses (EVs) are among the most common viruses infecting humans. The circulation and diversity of EVs infecting humans have been extensively studied in most parts of the world but those infecting Non-Human Primates (NHP) are still poorly documented. As most African countries, Cameroon houses a wide range of Old World primates' species including apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) and at least 28 species of Old World monkeys. In this study, we investigated the diversity of EV types and species from the stool specimens obtained from captive and wild-living apes and monkeys in Cameroon. We found that captive chimpanzees and gorillas were primarily infected by EV types having a worldwide distribution in humans, thus confirming that close contacts can promote cross-species transmission of EVs between humans and NHP. We also found proposed new EV types infecting wild NHP that were genetically distinct from all known EVs. Given the potential cross-species transmission of at least some EV types and the increasing contacts between human and NHP, EVs infecting NHP could serve as a source of new emerging human viral pathogens with unpredictable symptomatology.
