This year the 2014 FIFA World Cup will be hosted by Brazil, a country that has reported a higher number of dengue cases annually than any other country worldwide over the last decade. About 600,000 foreign tourists are expected and may be at risk for this disease. Games will be played in 12 different cities across the country and teams will stay in 27 different basecamp locations. We used weekly dengue surveillance data from previous years (2001â€“2013) and the first 19 weeks in 2014 to estimate the risk of dengue during the World Cup in each location and found that the expected incidence rates were relatively low. We also found interesting differences across estimation methods. Based on current ticket allocations, we expect that between 26 and 59 dengue cases will occur among tourists and none among teams. Quantitative risk estimates based on historical data should be made routinely for mass gathering events.
