Pathogens of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although it is well accepted that host-derived leishmanicidal molecules mediate resolution of Leishmania infection, some Leishmania species/stages are relatively resistant to host cell antimicrobial activity. These intracellular pathogens have developed evasive strategies to subvert host antimicrobials, and promote pathogen survival within the harsh intracellular environment. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that L. amazonensis, an agent of persistent infection in humans and non-healing skin lesions in mice, antagonize macrophage antimicrobial activity. The superb ability of the amastigote form to survive within host cells is related to its increased expression of a tryparedoxin peroxidase isoform that confers resistance to the cytotoxicity of host-derived antimicrobial molecules. Parasites induce higher expression of the TXNPx in response to iNOS activity during infection of macrophages, indicating that parasites can “sense” the microenvironment of host cells and regulate the expression of relevant virulence factors accordingly. Our investigations are consistent with a model by which Leishmania amastigotes utilize TXNPx to defend against host-derived molecules thereby promoting their intracellular survival and persistent infection.
