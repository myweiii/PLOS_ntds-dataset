Sand flies are blood-sucking insects that transmit various human pathogens, including parasitic protists of the genus Leishmania and several viruses, such as the phlebovirus Toscana (TOSV). TOSV infections typically result in flu-like symptoms, but in some patients, the infection can affect the central nervous system (CNS) or even be fatal. Due to climatic and environmental changes associated with human activity, it is likely that sand flies and the pathogens they transmit will spread beyond current boundaries. However, the specific sand fly species that transmit TOSV are not well understood. Therefore, it is essential to identify vectors that are involved in the circulation and transmission of the virus. In our study, we found that the range of potential TOSV vectors is broader than previously thought and that individual virus strains may influence vector competence. Specifically, we demonstrated that Phlebotomus tobbi and P. sergenti, two sand flies common in Mediterranean area and Middle East, are susceptible to TOSV and likely transmit this virus in nature.
