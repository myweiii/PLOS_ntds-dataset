We evaluated whether the impacts of Shigella on linear growth among children in low-resource settings were reflected in sustained effects of Shigella infections on biomarkers of environmental enteropathy. The effect of Shigella on environmental enteropathy biomarkers was in fact transient, with myeloperoxidase concentrations returning to baseline within one month following the index Shigella infection. Therefore, myeloperoxidase and other EE biomarkers unlikely to be good markers of the sustained impact of Shigella on EE and growth.
