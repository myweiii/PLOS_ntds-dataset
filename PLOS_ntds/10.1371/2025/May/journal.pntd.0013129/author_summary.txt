Surveillance of mosquito vectors has always been an indispensable component in the prevention and control of mosquito-borne viral and parasitic diseases. However, traditional mosquito surveillance methods like human landing catches, human-baited double net traps, BG-Sentinel mosquito traps are labor-intensive and provide limited data. In particular, the method of human landing catches is easily influenced by human and environmental factors, posing infection risks. We deployed an internet-based vector mosquito monitor called MS-300 to continuously track vector populations at ten locations in Zhejiang province over eight months. The data revealed variations in mosquito vector activity across different regions and seasons, likely influenced by population structure. The initial stages of mosquito vector identification primarily relied on morphological methods; however, inaccurate identification remains likely due to phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability. To enhance species identification, we have developed a multiplex PCR system targeting key vectors including Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, which transmit Dengue virus or Zika virus, as well as Anopheles sinensis known as a malaria vector. This approach not only reduces the manpower requirements for mosquito vector control but also provides continuous and accurate data that offers crucial support for the prevention and management of mosquito-borne diseases.
