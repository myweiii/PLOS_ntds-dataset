Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions worldwide, yet treatments for this neglected tropical disease are far from ideal. Benznidazole, the standard treatment, is poorly tolerated and shows variable efficacy in chronic infections. Optimizing benznidazole dosing regimens requires a better understanding of how its plasma exposure relates to its activity against T. cruzi parasites. We used bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to monitor T. cruzi infection in mice treated with various benznidazole dosing regimens, allowing us to assess its antiparasitic activity. We also developed a model to describe the drug’s pharmacokinetic behavior in mice. Our analyses revealed that higher doses of benznidazole were absorbed more slowly, and drug exposure in plasma—such as total exposure, peak concentrations, and time above a threshold concentration—was strongly linked to the probability of curing the infection. This study is the first to characterize the dose-response relationship for benznidazole in mice using BLI. Our findings highlight the complexity of identifying efficacy drivers due to high collinearity among exposure metrics, suggesting the need for further research. Given the lack of reliable markers for cure in humans, this translational research is crucial for advancing drug development and improving treatment strategies for Chagas disease patients.
