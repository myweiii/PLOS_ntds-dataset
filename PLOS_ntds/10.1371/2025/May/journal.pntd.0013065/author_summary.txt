Human angiostrongyliasis is an emerging parasitic disease endemic in developing countries. It is commonly caused by the rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is currently a public health concern in Dali, Yunnan Province, People’s Republic of China, as well as other places in Asia and the Pacific. Our study examines the epidemiology and control measures from 2007 to 2021, during which 125 cases (92 diagnosed, 33 suspected) of human angiostrongyliasis were reported in Dali. Patients experienced many clinical symptoms, with the most common ones being headache, muscle pain, neck stiffness, paresthesia, fever, and nausea. Standardized laboratory tests revealed abnormal cerebrospinal fluid protein levels in all patients tested (n = 72), with the majority of patients showing elevated blood eosinophil levels. In addition to humans, Pomacea spp. snails sold in a local Dali market, were screened for A. cantonensis infection, with 373 of the 49,970 snails testing positive for infection. Analysis of the monthly averages of angiostrongyliasis cases and Pomacea spp. infection prevalence revealed a similar trend, with the highest incidence occurring during the spring months (February to May). Human angiostrongyliasis outbreaks in Dali has prompted the implementation of public health interventions, leading to enhanced monitoring and control efforts.
