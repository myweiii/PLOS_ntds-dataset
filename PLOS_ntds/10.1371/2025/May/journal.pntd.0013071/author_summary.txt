Control of schistosomiasis centers around regular district-wide preventive treatment based on prevalence surveys of the district using standard microscopy methods. As schistosomiasis is a focal disease, these broad prevalence surveys can lead to over- or undertreatment, particularly of communities with a prevalence close to the 10% threshold that indicates mass-treatment. Precision mapping surveys that target treatment to the sub-district level could refine the use of mass treatment, providing for more efficient use of resources. Using a mathematical model, we compared the impact and cost of a novel rapid diagnostic test for schistosomiasis to that of standard microscopy and evaluated its use in a precision mapping strategy. We show that a rapid diagnostic test with comparable performance metrics to microscopy would be cost saving when used in a precision mapping approach and could lead to less over- and undertreatment at the sub-district level compared to traditional surveys.
