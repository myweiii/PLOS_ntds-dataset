Blastocystis is a common intestinal protist found in humans and animals, but its role in health and disease remains unclear. Some studies suggest that Blastocystis colonization is associated with healthier lifestyles and diverse gut microbiota, yet little is known about how its colonization and intensity influence bacterial and eukaryotic gut communities. This study analyzed 88 samples from a rural community in southwest Colombia to explore these associations. Using DNA sequencing, we compared bacterial and eukaryotic microbiota between Blastocystis-positive and -negative individuals and across varying colonization intensities. Blastocystis-positive individuals exhibited distinct bacterial profiles, characterized by higher abundances of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, and Prevotella. Higher colonization intensity was associated with Lachnospira and Alistipes, while lower intensities correlated with Akkermansia, a bacterium linked to gut health. Among eukaryotes, Blastocystis-positive individuals showed distinct profiles, including Entamoeba coli, while Blastocystis-negative individuals had higher levels of fungi, such as Candida albicans. These findings suggest that Blastocystis plays a role in shaping gut microbiota, potentially contributing to microbial balance. By uncovering these relationships, this study provides new insights into the ecological and health implications of Blastocystis, particularly in rural populations where its prevalence is significant.
