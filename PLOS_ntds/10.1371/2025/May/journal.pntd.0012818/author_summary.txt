Noma is a severe and deadly gangrenous disease that affects the mouth and other tissues of the face. It is often associated with poverty and is currently prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. More cases have been described in northern Nigeria than in any African region. However, the incidence of noma and its clinical presentation in this region is unknown from data available from different states. In this study, we retrospectively collected data from the only dedicated specialist hospital for noma intervention in Nigeria between 1999 and 2024 to calculate noma incidence within this period. Then the incidence of noma was calculated using a method proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This study estimates an incidence of 87.8 cases per 100,000 within the study period (26 years) and an annual average and median incidence of 3.4 and 1.6 cases per 100,000. Of note, the incidence of noma with gangrene (stage 3) was higher than the incidence of oedema (stage 2) or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (stage 1). These results highlight the importance and impact of noma in northern Nigeria and underscore the need for noma awareness and screening programs for population education and detection of early noma disease which are reversible with cost-effective interventions.
