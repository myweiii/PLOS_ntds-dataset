Talaromycosis, caused by Talaromyces marneffei, is an opportunistic fungal infection in people with a weakened immune system. The number of cases increased immediately after the HIV epidemic. HIV infection weakens the immune system by destroying CD4 + T cells, which are among the most important components of the immune system to protect against T. marneffei. However, with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the number of cases in people with HIV/AIDS (PWHA) has declined. Recently, we have found a group of patients whose immune system is weakened by autoantibodies against interferon-gamma. In these patients, CD4 + T cells are normal, but the cytokine cascade cannot fight the fungus due to antibodies against interferon-gamma (anti-IFN- γ AAbs), a major cytokine in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade. In this study, the clinical features of talaromycosis were compared between PWHA and patients with anti-IFN- γ AAbs. We found that patients with anti-IFN- γ AAbs had more diverse types of skin and subcutaneous lesions including macule, papules, nodules, abscesses, and Sweet’s syndrome, as well as bone and joint infections, while PWHA were more likely to have constitutional symptoms, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, splenomegaly, and umbilicated skin papules. Our paper highlights the different clinical characteristics of talaromycosis in these two populations.
