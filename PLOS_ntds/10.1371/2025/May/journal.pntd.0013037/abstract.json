    "Background": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced public trust in vaccines, particularly those authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In light of the recent monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, the primary aim of this study is to uncover how experiences with the COVID-19 vaccination have shaped public trust in hypothetical EUA vaccines for mpox.",
    "Method": "A nationwide cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted across six regions in China. Trust in future EUA vaccines, influenced by the COVID-19 vaccination experience as well as other attitudinal and behavioral factors associated with the willingness to receive an EUA-authorized mpox vaccine, was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).",
    "Results": "The overall willingness to receive an EUA-authorized mpox vaccine across all regions is 67.9%. The less economically developed Northeastern and Northwestern regions, with willingness rates of 84.9% and 81.8%, respectively, showed higher intention to be vaccinated than the more affluent Eastern region, which reported a willingness rate of 71.2%. There is a generally positive influence of the COVID-19 vaccination experiences on trust in future EUA vaccines, with a combined total of 61.8% (41.5% reported a somewhat increased level of trust and 20.3% reported a significantly increased level of trust). This trust emerged as the strongest determinant of vaccination willingness (β = 0.441, p < 0.001). Other factors influencing willingness include fear of the disease (β = 0.096, p < 0.001), knowledge (β = 0.064, p = 0.017), and prevention practices (β = 0.066, p = 0.005). Additionally, significant but smaller effects were noted for education (β = 0.059, p = 0.005) and urban-rural locality (β = -0.053, p = 0.012).",
    "Conclusion": "Findings underscore the importance of bolstering public trust in EUA vaccines, as well as addressing related attitudinal and behavioral factors, to enhance acceptance of mpox vaccines. This requires transparent communication about the rigorous approval process, continuous safety monitoring, and real-world effectiveness of EUA vaccines."
