The COVID-19 pandemic has shaped how people view vaccines, especially those approved quickly for emergencies. This study explores how these experiences affect trust in a potential mpox vaccine in China. A nationwide survey of 2,000 people found that about 68% were willing to get an mpox vaccine if one became available. Willingness was higher in less wealthy regions, like the Northeast and Northwest, compared to richer areas. Trust in emergency-approved vaccines, influenced by COVID-19 vaccination experiences, was the biggest factor driving peopleâ€™s willingness to get vaccinated. Fear of mpox and taking preventive measures, like handwashing and avoiding close contact, also played a role. While many people said their trust in emergency vaccines increased after COVID-19, some still worried about how quickly these vaccines are approved and their long-term safety. The study suggests that clear communication, addressing concerns, and ensuring fair access to vaccines are key to building trust and acceptance for future health emergencies like mpox.
