Cryptosporidiosis is a major cause of diarrhea in children and young animals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Despite its impact, effective drugs or vaccines are lacking. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) in Cryptosporidium parvum are promising therapeutic targets due to their unique structures. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses have identified at least eight CpCDPKs in C. parvum. Our study focuses on CpCDPK2A, which is expressed in all intracellular stages and plays a crucial role in both asexual and sexual replication. Deletion of CpCDPK2A significantly reduces infection intensity and pathogenicity without affecting host cell invasion. These findings suggest that CpCDPK2A may be a viable target for the development of prevention strategies against cryptosporidiosis. Further research is needed to explore its vaccine potential and action mechanism.
