Clonorchiasis, caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, triggers chronic inflammation and bile duct damage. Pro-inflammatory macrophages are implicated, but their exact role was unclear. In this study, we removed liver macrophages in mice using clodronate liposomes. Donor macrophages (BMDMs) were activated to a pro-inflammatory state using C. sinensis-derived extracellular vesicle (CsEVs) or treated to block a key miRNA (Csi-let-7a-5p) to reduce inflammation (InCsEVs-BMDM). These macrophages were transferred into mice lacking their macrophages. We found that CsEVs-activated macrophages caused severe bile duct damage and inflammation. Blocking Csi-let-7a-5p (InCsEVs-BMDM) reduced inflammation and damage. The parasiteâ€™s particles (CsEVs) drive bile duct injury by overactivating pro-inflammatory macrophages.
