The studied lakeside communities in Uganda have limited knowledge about the transmission and prevention of schistosomiasis while simultaneously being aware of the significance of the disease. This study was conducted in preparation for the introduction of a paediatric praziquantel formulation and an associated community sensitisation campaign. Therefore, we explored parentsâ€™ knowledge of the disease in preschool-aged children and their preferred information channels through interviews, focus group discussions and observations. We talked to various other stakeholders important to the community or involved in health campaigns. Due to the remoteness of the studied regions, broadcast media such as television were barely named as information sources. Instead, parents relied on community health workers, health professionals and the village leaders. Newspapers or other written material did not play a role, given that the population was highly illiterate. Moreover, high population movements (fisher communities, refugees) and the use of several languages pose challenges to continuous health information. We identified several fears, for example that mass treatments could be a hidden population reduction strategy. Considering these findings, we suggest that control programmes and their information campaigns take local socio-cultural and structural factors carefully into account and be adjusted to support health programmes effectively.
