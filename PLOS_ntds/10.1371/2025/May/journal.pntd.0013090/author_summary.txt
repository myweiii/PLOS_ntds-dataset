Scrub typhus (ST) is a serious infectious disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi transmitted through mite bites. It is particularly dangerous for children, and predicting its severity is critical for timely intervention. This study aimed to develop a simple, user-friendly tool to predict severe ST in children. Through a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 256 ST patients, we identified six critical factors—hemoglobin count (Hb), platelet count (PLT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB(CK-MB) and hypoproteinemia—that can predict disease severity. Based on these six factors, we developed a nomogram tool to assist healthcare providers in quickly assessing the risk of severe ST in children. The validation of the nomogram demonstrated its accuracy and utility in clinical decision-making. Our findings suggest that this nomogram could serve as a valuable tool in pediatric healthcare, aiding physicians in identifying children at higher risk for severe ST and making more informed treatment decisions.
