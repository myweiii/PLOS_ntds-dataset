Aedes aegypti is of great public health concern due the viruses they transmit. The vector is highly invasive and is expanding to new geographic regions, quickly adapting to new environment. This study focuses in understanding the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in cities along the northern transport corridor in Kenya, which are at risk of vector invasion. We analyzed Ae. aegypti populations using a panel of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) markers distributed across the genome. Our analysis shows admixture population in the coastal region between Aaf and Aaa, with Asian mosquitos being the putative source of Aaa ancestry, while the western populations are more related to African Aaf. This research provides a broad picture of the nature and dynamics of the Ae. aegypti populations across Kenya and sets the bases for further genetic studies focused on improving vector control strategies and developing novel mosquito control methods.
