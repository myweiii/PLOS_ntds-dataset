The Haemaphysalis doenitzi is an important vector tick harvested from the body surface of sheep in Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, China, and is capable of transmitting a variety of zoonotic diseases. In recent years, its distribution has been expanding and it has been found in many parts of China, which further exacerbates public and animal health risks. Previous studies have found that protein vaccines show great potential for tick control and that cystatin protein vaccines are effective against ticks of the same genus. This vaccine effectively protects livestock from ticks, which could improve the safety of meat products and reduce the potential risk of tick-borne diseases. We systematically explored the mechanism of action of cystatin antibodies on the ovaries of H. doenitzi and found that cystatin antibodies significantly reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and impaired the detoxification capacity of the tick. Understanding the mechanisms of tick ovarian development is critical to understanding the ecological characteristics of ticks and the patterns of tick-borne disease transmission.
