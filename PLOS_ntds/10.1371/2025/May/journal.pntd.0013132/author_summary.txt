Schistosomiasis poses a significant public health challenge, especially in tropical and subtropical areas, greatly impacting patients’ well-being. Our investigation focuses on the immunological mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis. We emphasize the vital role of cytokines like IL-22 in shaping the immune response. Although Th2 responses are critical for controlling the parasite, they can also result in considerable liver damage and complications, such as portal hypertension. Gaining a better understanding of how to modulate these immune responses could lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent liver fibrosis, ultimately enhancing patients’ quality of life. The clinical relevance of our research is substantial. Currently, there are no effective treatments for liver fibrosis associated with schistosomiasis. Our findings could provide a scientific foundation for developing targeted treatment options, thereby improving disease management.
