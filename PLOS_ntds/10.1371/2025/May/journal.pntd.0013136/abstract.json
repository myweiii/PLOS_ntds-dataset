    "Background": "Strongyloidiasis is endemic in many remote Indigenous communities in Australia. Early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of chronic strongyloidiasis can prevent life-threatening clinical complications and decrease transmission in these endemic communities. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of a primary healthcare strategy designed to measure and reduce the prevalence of strongyloidiasis in four remote communities in northeast Arnhem Land.",
    "Methodology": "The primary healthcare strategy was a prospective, longitudinal, health-systems intervention designed to integrate serological testing for chronic strongyloidiasis into the Indigenous preventive adult health assessment utilising the electronic health-record systems in four Aboriginal health services. Positive cases were recalled for treatment, and opportunistic follow-up serology after six months. Results were tracked using Strongyloides reports generated by the electronic health-record system. This paper describes the changes in prevalence, effectiveness of treatment, and reinfection during the implementation phase, 2012–2016. An improved Strongyloides electronic report was developed to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention to the end of 2020.",
    "Principal Findings": "During the entire period 2012–2020, 84% (2390/2843) of the resident adults in the four communities were tested for strongyloidiasis at least once. Prevalence was reduced from 44% (1056/2390) ever-positive to 10% (232/2390) positive on their last test. Of positive, treated cases with a follow-up serology test, the last test was negative in 85% (824/967) of individuals. Point prevalence continued to decrease in each community four years after the end of the implementation phase.",
    "Conclusions": "The results provided practice-based evidence of a significant decrease in the prevalence of strongyloidiasis attributable to the strategy which could be replicated in other health services utilising electronic health-record systems. The final evaluation demonstrated the sustainability and ongoing benefits for endemically infected communities, and the key role that health services can play in strongyloidiasis prevention and control programs."
