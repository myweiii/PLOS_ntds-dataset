This primary healthcare strategy originated in an Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation in remote Northern Territory communities in Australia where strongyloidiasis is endemic. The goal was to prevent clinical complications and reduce prevalence of strongyloidiasis. Serological testing for chronic strongyloidiasis was integrated into the preventive adult health assessments in four Aboriginal health services. Positive cases were recalled for treatment, then follow-up serology after six months.
Data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system during the implementation phase, 2012–2016, measured changes in prevalence, treatment effectiveness, and reinfection. An evaluation in 2020 used an improved Strongyloides report to extract data from 2012–2020. This showed that 84% of the adult population in the four communities were tested for strongyloidiasis, with prevalence decreasing from 44% to 10%. Of treated cases with follow-up tests, 85% had negative results.
These results showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of strongyloidiasis, highlighting the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention. The Strongyloides report provided a monitoring and ongoing surveillance tool that was accessible to clinicians, as well as de-identified reports for the local health board and communities. This research highlights the important role of health services in prevention and control programs for strongyloidiasis in endemic communities.
