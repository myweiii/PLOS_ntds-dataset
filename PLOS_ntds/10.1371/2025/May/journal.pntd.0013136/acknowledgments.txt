We thank the board of Miwatj Health Aboriginal Corporation, the staff and community members for their encouragement and support. We also thank Petra Buettner, Steve White, and Jenny Shield for their expert contributions. We honour our teacher the late Emeritus Professor Rick Speare who inspired us with the vision for a national strongyloidiasis control program to eliminate strongyloidiasis in remote Indigenous communities in Australia.
