Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. Hemorrhagic manifestations are highly prevalent in SFTS patients and are significantly associated with fatal outcomes. It is well established that abnormal coagulation function is closely linked to hemorrhagic manifestations. Understanding the intricate mechanisms by which coagulation dysfunction contributes to viral bleeding is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of serum coagulation parameters and investigates the dynamic changes of APTT and their association with mortality in SFTS patients. Our study demonstrate that SFTS patients exhibit significant coagulation dysregulation. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified prolonged APTT as an independent predictor of mortality. Kinetic analysis revealed that APTT levels in the survival group showed a declining trend during hospitalization and returned to the normal range by the 6th day, while it gradually increased, reaching its peak on the 3rd day and then gradually decreased in the non-survival group. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of coagulation dysregulation in SFTS, paving the way for further research in this field.
