This study focuses on the structural and functional analysis of a recombinant sigma class 24-kDa GST from T. solium (rTs24GST), the worm responsible for human neurocysticercosis, an important neglected tropical disease. Using advanced techniques such as crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, we determined the high-resolution structure of a rTs24GST, providing new insights into how this enzyme interacts with glutathione, an essential molecule for cellular protection and regulation of immune response. Our findings reveal that the presence of glutathione significantly stabilizes the enzyme, reducing its fluctuations. This suggests that the enzymeâ€™s activity may be influenced by its interaction with glutathione, offering potential avenues for developing new inhibitors or therapeutic strategies targeting neurocysticercosis. Although rTs24GST shows lower activity than other GSTs, its structural flexibility analysis suggests that it may have evolved to interact with a broader range of substrates. This evolutionary adaptation could indicate that this enzyme performs additional functions beyond traditional detoxification processes. These structural insights could prove valuable for the development of new treatments for neurocysticercosis, benefiting affected populations worldwide.
