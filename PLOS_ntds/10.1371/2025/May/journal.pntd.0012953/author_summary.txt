African trypanosomoses (AT), is caused by single celled parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. These have plagued the African continent for centuries, affecting both humans and animals. Its principal vector, tsetse flies, can be found across sub-Saharan Africa. Vector control represents an efficient way to reduce the burden of AT. In Mozambique, control campaigns reshaped tsetse fly distribution to what it is today, with four species presently found: Glossina brevipalpis, G. pallidipes, G. morsitans and, G. austeni. Additionally, G. brevipalpis can be observed in two National parks, Gorongosa National Park in the Centre and Maputo National Park in the South, with an 840 km wide tsetse-free zone between them. In the present work, we have analysed the genetic variation of this tsetse fly within and across these two parks. We found that these two zones behave as strongly isolated subpopulations, only exchanging a few individuals per year. Within parks, average dispersal appeared to reach 30 km per generation. To explain this finding, we suggest the existence of undocumented pocket populations between the two parks. In the absence of such pockets, the most probable explanation is the accidental translocation of tsetse flies during human-driven animal transportation. If eradication were to be attempted, re-invasion of the tsetse via motorized human transport should be considered in conjunction with the exploration of other sites within a 30 km radius to validate that no sources of re-invasion exist around these parks.
