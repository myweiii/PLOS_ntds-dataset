Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a significant public health challenge in Latin American countries. This study focused on blood donors from a region in Argentina where T. cruzi infection is highly prevalent. It analyzed antibody responses and their relationship to parasitemia as measured by PCR on lysed whole blood. We observed a clear bimodal pattern in antibody levels across four sensitive and widely utilized serological tests. Positive results on a T. cruzi PCR test were significantly associated with high antibody levels, regardless of the test used. Our analysis allowed us to set threshold values that distinguished two groups: individuals with high antibody levels likely to have persistent parasitemia and those with low antibody levels who appeared to control or eradicate the infection. Additionally, during follow-up, individuals with initially low antibody levels experienced more pronounced declines in these levels over time. These findings highlight the potential to identify individuals at greater risk of persistent parasitemia who may benefit most from targeted treatment. This work may contribute to more effective diagnosis and management of T. cruzi infection in endemic regions.
