Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) rabies vaccine is recommended to people at risk. We conducted a phase III, open-label study (NCT02545517) as an extension of the NCT01662440 study, where we assessed immune responses elicited by different primary PrEP regimens (accelerated [one-week] or conventional [four-week]) with PCEC rabies vaccine administered alone or concomitantly with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine. In the extension study, we evaluated the long-term immunogenicity and boostability of the PCEC rabies vaccine after PrEP administration in the parent study, over a period of 3–10 years from primary vaccination. At study end, 58–62% of unboosted participants had an adequate response to vaccination based on antibody levels. During the follow-up period, 68.6% of all participants did not require a booster dose and most low/non-responder vaccinees (132/144) needed a single booster dose to reach adequate antibody levels. The administration of a booster dose of PCEC rabies vaccine did not raise any safety concerns. The PCEC rabies vaccine provides immunity lasting for up to 10 years regardless of the primary schedule applied or if being administered alone or concomitantly with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine.
