    "Background": "Rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended to individuals at risk for exposure to rabies. Three intramuscular doses of the purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) rabies vaccine can be administered according to a conventional (four-week) or an accelerated (one-week) regimen.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This phase III, open-label study (NCT02545517) was an extension of the NCT01662440 study where immune responses of different primary PrEP regimens with PCEC rabies vaccine and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine were assessed. Adults who had completed the parent study and received three doses of rabies PrEP regimens, concomitantly with a JE vaccine or alone (i.e., Rabies+JE-Accelerated, Rabies+JE-Conventional, and Rabies-Conventional groups) were enrolled in this extension study. Here we evaluated the long-term (up to 10 years after completing the primary vaccination) immunogenicity and boostability of PCEC rabies vaccine, and the safety of booster dose(s). Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations, and titers ≥0.5 international units (IU)/mL were considered adequate for protection. Participants with RVNA concentrations <0.5 IU/mL were eligible for receiving PCEC rabies vaccine booster(s). Of the 459 participants enrolled in this study, 77.6% completed the trial. At the study end, the probability of detecting adequate RVNA concentrations in unboosted participants was 57.8%, 60.2%, and 62.0% for the Rabies+JE-Accelerated, Rabies+JE-Conventional, and Rabies-Conventional groups, respectively. Overall, 68.6% of all participants had RVNA concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL at any timepoint and did not require a booster dose during the study follow-up period. Of the 144 participants with RVNA concentrations <0.5 IU/mL at any timepoint, 132 needed one booster dose throughout the follow-up period (Years 3–10) and 12 needed multiple booster administrations. No safety concerns were identified.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The PCEC rabies vaccine administered alone/concomitantly with the JE vaccine provides adequate immunity for up to 62% of unboosted participants at study end."
