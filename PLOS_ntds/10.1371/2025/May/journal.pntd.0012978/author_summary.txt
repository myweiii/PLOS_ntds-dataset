Dengue (DENV) is a mosquito-borne disease endemic in Pakistan, with seasonal outbreaks often triggered by monsoon rains and flooding. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of laboratory-confirmed Dengue patients and those with Dengue-like illness using qRT-PCR. Molecular diagnostics detected a significant proportion of cases with diverse clinical presentations, underscoring the limitations of conventional screening tests. Our findings highlight the evolving clinical spectrum of Dengue, which is frequently missed during initial screening. Accurate clinical decision-making remains challenging in the absence of highly sensitive diagnostic tools. Strengthening viral diagnostic modalities is essential for improving patient management and disease surveillance. Among the detected serotypes, DENV-2 was the most prevalent in non-severe Dengue cases, particularly during monsoon-driven outbreaks in Pakistan.
