Accurate cholera surveillance is necessary for disease control and prevention, yet many regions struggle with timely and precise reporting. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been introduced as a faster, cost-effective screening tool with the potential to enhance public health surveillance. The RDT Implementation Strategy and Evaluation (RISE) project in Nepal was the pilot study for nationwide integration of RDTs for cholera surveillance. Findings demonstrated that the use of RDTs improved outbreak detection, however, gaps in training, awareness, and reporting limited their full impact. These barriers mirror broader challenges in global disease surveillance, where underutilization of diagnostic tools, misconceptions about test validity, and discordance in health system infrastructure hinder early outbreak responses. Addressing these challenges is essential, not only for cholera control efforts but for strengthening global public health preparedness against emerging infectious threats. With increasing vaccine shortages and climate-driven disease spread, improving real-time disease tracking through accessible, decentralized diagnostic tools is more urgent than ever. The findings from this study underscore the need for strategic planning, investment in training, and robust health system integration to ensure that RDTs—and other diagnostic tools—can fulfill their potential in guiding timely, data-driven interventions to mitigate the burden of infectious diseases worldwide.
