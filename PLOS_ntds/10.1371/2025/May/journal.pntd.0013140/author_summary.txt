Buruli ulcer (BU), a Neglected tropical Disease has been shown to harbour polymicrobial pathogens that can cause secondary infection and delay wound healing. Despite this, there is no guideline for managing these secondary infections and data on the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of frequently isolated pathogens remain limited. To assess the AMR burden in BU, we longitudinally profiled antimicrobial resistance in patients from four endemic districts in Ghana using the VITEK 2. Our findings showed a concerning prevalence of multi drug resistant, ESBL and MRSA pathogens before, during and even after BU specific treatment. Notably, there was an increased presence of MRSA post BU treatment. These findings underscore the urgent need for the development of an integrated guideline on the surveillance and treatment of secondary infections in BU. Additionally, training programmes on wound management and infection control techniques for both healthcare providers and patients, and the provision of free dressing materials for patients could help mitigate the risk of wound infections. Further molecular studies are warranted to characterize resistance mechanisms and inform targeted interventions.
