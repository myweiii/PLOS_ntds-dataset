Vaccination is widely recognized as the most effective and safest strategy for rabies control, serving as a cornerstone of prevention efforts. Since all current commercialized rabies vaccines are inactivated virus formulations, preserving the structural integrity of viral particles in the final product is a key indicator of production quality; thus, particle integrity analysis constitutes a critical component of vaccine quality control. Traditional electron microscopy-based methods used for assessing particle integrity have notable limitations and fail to meet the demands of contemporary vaccine production quality standards. To address this, we developed a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) that enables real-time, quantitative analysis of rabies virus particle integrity in human vaccines, through detection of exposed nucleoprotein within disrupted particles. This method may help bridge the current gap in quality control by enabling simple and reliable real-time quantitative evaluation of rabies virus particle integrity.
