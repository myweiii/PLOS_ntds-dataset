Fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an acute infectious disease caused by SFTS virus, and 12%-30% of patients die of multi-organ failure, in which the extreme inflammatory response induced by SFTS virus plays a key role in the pathogenesis. Previous studies on the clinical prognosis of SFTS have focused on inflammatory indicators such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, but their specificity and sensitivity are poor. Serum ferritin, as an acute inflammatory protein, has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis of viral infectious diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, and dengue fever, but the relationship with the prognosis of SFTS is unclear. Here, we systematically evaluated the relationship between serum ferritin and in-hospital mortality in patients with SFTS by constructing different proportional risk models. Our results showed a significant linear relationship between serum ferritin on in-hospital mortality in SFTS patients, and serum ferritin showed good specificity and sensitivity in predicting death in SFTS, especially, when serum ferritin levels exceed 10,000â€‰ng/ml, the in-hospital mortality rate of SFTS patients was significantly higher. The above results were further validated by Propensity score matching and linear trend test.
