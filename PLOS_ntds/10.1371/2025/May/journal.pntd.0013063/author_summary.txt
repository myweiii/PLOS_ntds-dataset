Oxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic intracellular parasite and is Serious threaten for immunodeficient patients including those with uremia and solid organ transplantation recipients. However, Toxoplasma seroprevalence in these patients remains unclear, and the risk factors of post transplantation T. gondii infection were not well defined in China and globally. Therefore, Toxoplasma infection is still a neglected problem, and clinical screening and monitoring should be pay more attention. This study suggested that kidney recipients and those uremia patients in the waiting list are susceptible to T. gondii infection. Immune status and keeping cats are associated with the seroprevalence in those patients.
