Cutaneous ulcers are a significant public health concern, particularly among children in tropical regions of the Pacific, Southeast Asia, West and Central Africa. These lesions are primarily caused by HD, the etiological agent of chancroid, and Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, responsible for yaws. To eliminate these infections by 2030, WHO advocates mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin, a more effective and less invasive alternative to benzathine penicillin. However, HD infections persist in endemic areas despite these efforts. In this study, we explored the potential role of environmental and animal reservoirs in sustaining HD transmission. Our findings confirm the presence of HD in flies and on clothing, suggesting that these may act as mechanical and passive vectors, respectively, contributing to the persistence of ulcers even after antibiotic treatment. These results underscore the need for complementary strategies, including improved hygiene measures, to effectively achieve eradication.
