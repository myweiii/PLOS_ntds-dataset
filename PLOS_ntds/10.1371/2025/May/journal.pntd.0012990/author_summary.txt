Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne illness that has rapidly spread across tropical and subtropical regions, presenting a substantial public health threat. The infection with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes acute symptoms such as high fever and intense joint pain, but many patients suffer long-term effects, including chronic pain and disability, severely impacting their quality of life. Despite its socio-economic burden, chikungunya has received less attention than other mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and malaria. Our study highlights the financial strain on healthcare systems due to direct costs like hospitalizations, treatments, and medications, while indirect costs—primarily from lost productivity due to illness—further compound the economic impact. Furthermore, the chronic nature of chikungunya in many patients leads to lasting physical impairments and a profound reduction in quality of life, particularly in those suffering from chronic joint pain. By bringing attention to the substantial costs and quality of life reductions associated with chikungunya, our study calls for targeted strategies to reduce its socio-economic toll and improve outcomes for affected populations.
