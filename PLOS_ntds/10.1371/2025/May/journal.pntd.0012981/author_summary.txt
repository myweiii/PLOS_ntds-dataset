Heart failure is the most well-known manifestation of Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Less studied are symptoms attributed to the central nervous system. Previous studies have shown some degree of cognitive impairment in individuals affected by Chagas disease. It remains unclear whether the disease itself directly causes the cognitive deficits observed in patients with Chagas disease or if they result from heart failure, as it can lead to reduced blood flow to the brain and inflammation, contributing to cognitive decline. To better understand this relationship, we studied the cognitive function of 518 patients diagnosed with heart failure, both with and without Chagas disease, assessing memory, as well as executive and visuospatial abilities. Through this study, we concluded that cognitive impairment was more common in individuals with Chagas disease, particularly in aspects related to memory and visuospatial abilities. Furthermore, the relationship between Chagas disease and cognitive impairment was independent of the presence or severity of heart failure, suggesting that other competing mechanisms such as chronic inflammation may be present.
