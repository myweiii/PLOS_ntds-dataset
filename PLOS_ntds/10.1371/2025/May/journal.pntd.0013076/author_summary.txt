Leprosy multidrug therapy (MDT) efficacy is threatened by the rise of drug resistance. New hope arises with new antituberculous drugs targeting the electron transport chain (ETC). In this study, we evaluated the bactericidal activity of telacebec (TCB), a phase 2 drug candidate for tuberculosis, alongside known ETC-targeting antibiotics, bedaquiline (BDQ) and clofazimine (CFZ), as monotherapy or in combination. We used the leprosy proportional bactericidal mouse footpad model. Four hundred and ten mice were inoculated with M. leprae and randomized into control groups (untreated or MDT-treated) and treated groups (TCB, BDQ, CFZ, or combinations). Only TCB monotherapy exhibited bactericidal activity comparable to that of MDT. All combination therapies were as effective as MDT, except the combination TCB + CFZ, possibly due to an antagonism between these two drugs. The unprecedented potency of telacebec against M. leprae highlights its potential for further evaluation in preclinical models to guide the design of future clinical trials.
