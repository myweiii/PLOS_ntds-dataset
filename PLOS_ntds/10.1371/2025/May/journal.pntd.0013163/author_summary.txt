We did a comparative study using mouse strains immunocompetent and hyporesponsive to tlr4. The data shows that tlr4 competent strains (C3H/HeN and C57BL/6) developed clinical and molecular signs of sublethal leptospirosis not much different than tlr4 hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ. Thus, competent recognition of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni FioCruz factors by murine TLR4 does not determine susceptibility to leptospirosis.
