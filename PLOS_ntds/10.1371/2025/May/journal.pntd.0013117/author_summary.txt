Cryptosporidium spp. are zoonotic pathogens that have a significant impact on both human and animal health, commonly causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even dehydration leading to death. To investigate the infection rate and genetic characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents of a specific region, we gathered samples from the northern foothills of the Dabie Mountains in southeast Henan Province. A total of 267 rodents were sampled, revealing an infection rate of 21.3%. Notably, we mark the first identification of Cryptosporidium viatorum in Niviventer lotipes and Apodemus agrarius, as well as the detection of Cryptosporidium occultus in Rattus nitidus. Furthermore, we uncovered two novel Cryptosporidium genotypes and introduced a new subtype family within C. viatorum. We observed that wild rodents exhibited a higher infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. during autumn and in field habitats, suggesting a close correlation between geographical environment and climate with the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium spp.
