Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease estimated to infect 51.4 million individuals worldwide. Given the efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2030, there is an increased need for improved diagnostics capable of identifying active infections and infection recrudescence. Current diagnostics rely on the ability to detect circulating filarial antigen or antibodies against previously identified immunogenic filarial antigens, including Wb123. Neither of these current tools can serve as reliable markers of active infection, making it difficult to detect the resurgence of infections early. To address this, we screened for antigens present in Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi that were enriched in the microfilarial and L3 stage of the parasite and identified one antigen, Wb5, that is specific to lymphatic filariasis infections. We developed IgG4-based immunoassays that, when used in combination with assays already using IgG4 antibodies to Wb123, modestly increase the sensitivity of detection. Utilization of Wb5 in addition to other markers will aid lymphatic filariasis elimination efforts by allowing for earlier detection of infection resurgence and transmission in post mass drug administration surveillance and support the idea of elimination by 2030.
