Existing methods for evaluating the long-term prognosis of advanced schistosomiasis were inadequate and needed improvement. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with six-year all-cause mortality and to develop a predictive model using data from a large population-based cohort. We identified ten factors linked to an increased risk of death in patients with advanced schistosomiasis. Using these variables, we constructed a predictive model and validated its performance through various statistical measures, including ROC, AIC, NRI, and IDI, in both internal and external validation cohorts. The model that included all ten variables outperformed the reduced models. These findings highlight key indicators associated with six-year mortality in patients with advanced schistosomiasis, and the predictive model demonstrated strong performance through validation. This model may assist clinicians in making more informed decisions and developing personalized follow-up plans, potentially improving survival outcomes for patients with advanced schistosomiasis.
