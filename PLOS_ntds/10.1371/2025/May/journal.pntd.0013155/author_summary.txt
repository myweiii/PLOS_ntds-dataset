By analyzing the prevalence and DALYs associated with trachoma across China, the global population, and five distinct SDI regions, this study found a marked decline in both prevalence and DALYs over time. These findings suggest that the implementation of the World Health Organizationâ€™s recommended SAFE strategy has achieved substantial progress toward the elimination of trachoma. The rate of decline in China was notably faster than in other regions, with middle- and low-SDI regions also experiencing more pronounced reductions. In addition, In addition, a comparison was made between the gender, age group, and the number of cases and DALYs of trachoma patients in China and global. It was found that the number of trachoma cases and DALYs in China increased with age, and the number of cases and DALYs in women of all age groups during the same period was higher than that in men. Although the prevalence of trachoma in China is continuously decreasing, as an infectious eye disease, there are still sporadic cases of trachoma, and small-scale outbreaks may occur again in areas with poor sanitation and economic backwardness. It is still necessary to continue to popularize trachoma prevention and control knowledge and prevent the recurrence of trachoma outbreaks.
