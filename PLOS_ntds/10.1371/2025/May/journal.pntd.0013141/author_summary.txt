Ascariasis (roundworm) predominantly impacts people living in low- and middle-income countries and poses a significant global threat to human health across the age-spectrum. While both adults and children can be infected with Ascaris worms, children harbor higher worm burden which leads to end-organ disease including liver and lung pathology, malnutrition, and growth restriction. However, the reason for this age-related difference in parasite burden is unclear. Here, we found that repeated Ascaris infection in mice resulted in lower worm burden compared to single infection models, suggesting that with repeated exposure, the mice acquired protection against high worm burden. We also found that this protection was a result of cellular changes to the gastric mucosa following repeated infections and was not associated with immunologic learning. These findings highlight the importance of the gastric mucosa as a barrier site for parasite infection and provide a critical foundation for understanding the role of Ascaris infection in other gastric pathologies.
