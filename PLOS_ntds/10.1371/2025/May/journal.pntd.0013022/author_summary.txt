Calcified lesions are the most common image finding of neurocysticercosis (NCC) in endemic areas, are considered potential epileptogenic foci and contribute to the pathophysiology of seizure activity in human NCC. A better understanding on the pathophysiological mechanisms of residual calcification in NCC and its association with seizure development are essential. Our findings suggest that the calcification procces is dynamic and can be properly induced by antiparasitic treatment (APT) in naturally infected NCC pigs, as demonstrated by ex vivo computed tomography (CT) scan, histopathology, and scanning–electron microscopy. We also suggest that eight months after APT is an optimal time point for assessing residual calcification. These results provide a reliable animal model for the study of calcified NCC and for assessing controlled interventions in pre–clinical studies aimed to reduce the occurrence of residual calcification.
