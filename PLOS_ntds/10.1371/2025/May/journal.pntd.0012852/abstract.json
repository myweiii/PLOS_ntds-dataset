    "Abstract": "Anthrax remains a neglected zoonotic disease of critical public and animal health significance in Zambia, particularly in regions with active human-wildlife-livestock interfaces such as the Western, Southern and Eastern provinces of Zambia. This study explores the socio-ecological drivers of anthrax transmission and examines the role of legal and illegal wildlife trade value chains in sustaining outbreaks. Secondly, the study explores the methodology used to investigate community knowledge, perceptions, and the impacts of anthrax through focus group discussions (FGDs) and a hybrid approach combining traditional thematic analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The research was framed within the interpretivist paradigm, aiming to understand shared experiences and socio-cultural contexts. The study utilized focus groups to encourage interaction and generate rich, collective insights. The hybrid approach allowed for data analysis that combined researcher-led reflexivity with AI-driven thematic analysis."
