Anthrax is a zoonotic disease of significant public health, veterinary, and ecological concern in Zambia, particularly in regions where human-wildlife-livestock interactions are frequent. This study focuses on understanding the socio-ecological factors driving anthrax transmission in communities near Game Management Areas. Using a combination of focus group discussions and an innovative hybrid data analysis approach that blends traditional qualitative methods with artificial intelligence tools, the research explores community knowledge, perceptions, and the impacts of anthrax. Key findings reveal diverse levels of awareness about anthrax, widespread misconceptions, and the influence of cultural beliefs on health behaviours. Communities often link anthrax outbreaks to interactions with wildlife and the illegal game meat trade, highlighting the complex interplay of ecological, economic, and behavioural factors in disease dynamics. Additionally, the study underscores the socioeconomic toll of anthrax, including livestock losses, disrupted livelihoods, and food insecurity, compounded by inadequate public health and veterinary responses. The insights gained from this research emphasize the need for multi-sectoral interventions tailored to the specific needs of these communities. These include strengthening disease surveillance, promoting culturally sensitive education and awareness campaigns, improving veterinary services, and addressing systemic drivers such as poverty and food insecurity. Adopting a One Health approach, this study provides actionable recommendations to mitigate anthrax risks and enhance resilience in affected communities, contributing to sustainable public and animal health outcomes.
