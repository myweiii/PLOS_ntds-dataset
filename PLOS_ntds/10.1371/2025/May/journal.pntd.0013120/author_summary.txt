Orthobunyaviruses are a diverse group of segmented RNA viruses responsible for severe diseases in humans and animals. Despite their potential to cause significant public health and veterinary outcomes, the molecular mechanisms driving their evolution through reassortment remain largely unexplored. This study leverages Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and Batai virus (BATV) as models to investigate reassortment dynamics. Our comprehensive approach, combining reverse genetics, pathogenesis, and a novel RNA-FISH assay, demonstrated the viability of all six possible BUNV-BATV reassortants and revealed distinct pathogenic profiles in interferon-deficient mice. These findings are critical for understanding how reassortment can alter viral transmissibility and virulence, offering valuable tools and insights for future studies. Understanding the reassortment process is essential for anticipating and mitigating the risk posed by novel reassortant viruses.
