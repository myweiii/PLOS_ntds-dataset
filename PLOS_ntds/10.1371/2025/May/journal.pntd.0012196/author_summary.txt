In a system with different types of animals, the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), depends on the animals mosquitoes choose to feed on. A behaviour called “fidelity”, where mosquitoes tend to feed on the same type of animal after their first blood meal, can influence how pathogens spread. Using a mathematical model, we explored how this behaviour affects the transmission of JEV, a pathogen that relies on pigs to amplify the virus, while some other animals, like cattle, serve as dead-end hosts that do not contribute to its spread. Our results show that mosquito fidelity can sustain JEV transmission even when pigs are scarce compared to cattle. This behaviour could create localised transmission cycles when fidelity is sufficiently high, as mosquitoes feeding on pigs are more likely to return to them for future meals.
