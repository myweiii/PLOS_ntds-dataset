The Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is responsible for a severe hematological malignancy and a chronic low limb disabling disease. The HTLV-1 transmission can occur through transfusion, prolonged infant-breastfeeding, and during unprotected sexual intercourse. Around 5â€“10 million people are infected worldwide, and the sub-Saharan region of Africa is one of the most endemic areas for HTLV-1 Infection. In Gabon, about 7.3 to 8.7% of adult populations are infected and HTLV-1 associated diseases are not properly reported; probably lesser than the reality. Thus, applying serological and molecular tools as well as assessing clinical and biological outcomes, we aimed to investigate facts and prevalences of HTLV-1 associated diseases among patients, frequently attending the main teaching hospital of Gabon. We report 7.39% of overall HTLV-1 prevalence (26/352) and 3.7% of HTLV-1 associated diseases (10/272) observed in this hospital. Equally, a great concern arose related to HTLV-1 diagnosis, with the observance of 5/8 HTLV-1 associated diseases, and those diseases remain underdiagnosed. Both, the birthplace and being a female were identified as determinant risk-factors associated with HTLV-1 infection. Our findings point out the need of strategies to prevent and effectively manage this infection in Gabon.
