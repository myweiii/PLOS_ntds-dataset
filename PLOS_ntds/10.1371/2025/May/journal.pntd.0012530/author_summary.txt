Dengue and Zika are caused by arthropod-borne orthoflaviviruses, and spread primarily through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Most research on DENV and ZIKV transmission has primarily focused on Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus while other Aedes species are overlooked, thus the epidemiology of transmission might be underestimated. With climate change together with species-specific mosquito population reduction interventions these neglected Aedes species could become increasingly important in sustaining virus transmission. In this study, we examined Aedes scutellaris, a mosquito species that co-habitats with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, to assess its ability to transmit DENV and ZIKV using a combination of blood feeding and intrathoracic injection methods. Our findings show that although Ae. scutellaris had lower initial infection rates due to smaller blood meals, DENV and ZIKV were able to replicate and transmit at levels comparable to Ae. aegypti when exposed to similar virus loads. This highlights the need to study a broader range of species to improve virus control and outbreak prevention strategies.
