Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites, which undergo complex developmental stages transitioning between insect vectors and mammalian hosts. While considerable research has focused on understanding protein-coding genes and their role in parasite survival and host adaptation, the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating these processes remains poorly explored. In this study, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide characterization of ncRNAs across 16 Leishmania species, integrating comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and co-expression network analyses. We uncovered a diverse repertoire of ncRNAs, including conserved and species-specific molecules, and identified key ncRNAs co-expressed with genes involved in critical processes such as stress response, membrane dynamics, and cytoskeleton organization. Notably, we revealed ncRNAs potentially regulating the expression of genes like aquaglyceroporins, surface proteins, and heat shock proteins, highlighting their role in parasite survival and stage-specific differentiation. This study underscores the importance of ncRNAs in parasite development, survival, and host adaptation. Our findings open new perspectives for exploring ncRNAs as potential targets for therapeutic interventions against leishmaniasis.
