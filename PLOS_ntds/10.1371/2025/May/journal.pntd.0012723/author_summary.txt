Dengue continues to pose a major public health challenge in Taiwan, where the government promotes prevention through nationwide messaging. However, repeated exposure to these messages can lead to message fatigue, resulting in diminished attention to prevention efforts. This study analyzes trends and associations between demographic factors (age, sex, education, and job) and perceived risks (optimistic bias, perceived prevalence, and perceived severity) in relation to message fatigue in high- and low-risk dengue regions. We surveyed 814 adults across Taiwan and analyzed message fatigue in two dimensions: feeling overwhelmed by excessive messaging and feeling exhausted by repeated information. In high-risk areas, individuals with lower education levels were more likely to feel exhausted by dengue messaging, indicating that current strategies may not effectively address their needs. In low-risk areas, males, individuals with lower education levels, and those with an optimistic perception of risk were more likely to find dengue messages excessive and redundant, suggesting that existing communication efforts may not resonate with these groups. These findings indicate that dengue prevention messaging should be tailored to different audiences in varying risk areas. High-risk areas may benefit from more localized and specific guidance, while low-risk areas may require adjusted messaging strategies, such as more engaging formats or personalized communication, to better align with their target audiences. Adapting health communication to reduce fatigue could help sustain awareness and encourage preventive behaviors.
