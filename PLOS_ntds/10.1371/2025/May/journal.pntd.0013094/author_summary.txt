Liver fibrosis (LF) represents a grave pathological condition with the potential to progress to liver failure. It stems from diverse etiologies, encompassing chemical injury and parasitic infestations. In our investigation, we delved into the therapeutic implications of transplanting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in the management of LF. By employing two distinct mouse models—one induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and another by Echinococcus multilocularis infection—we observed a marked decrease in liver scarring and collagen accumulation following ADSCs transplantation. Notably, our research uncovered a mechanism by which ADSCs exert their beneficial effects: they induce senescence in activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs), the primary drivers of fibrosis. Senescence in aHSCs reduces collagen synthesis, thereby facilitating the reversal of fibrosis. The present study enriches the understanding of ADSCs-mediated antifibrotic mechanisms and holds promise for the development of novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes for patients with fibrosis-related diseases.
