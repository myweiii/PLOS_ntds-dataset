Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common viral childhood illness with more than 1 million cases reported annually in China. It is caused by enteroviruses including EV-A71, coxsackieviruses, etc. While HFMD is mostly self-limited, it can lead to severe or even fatal complications in a minority of patients. Our prospective study in a tertiary children's hospital in central China demonstrated that over half of inpatient HFMD cases with CNS complications were caused by non-EV-A71 enteroviruses, but children with non-EV-A71 enteroviruses were less likely to develop clinical severe cases compared with EV-A71. Children with CV-A2 and CV-A4 were less likely to have rashes on hands, feet, or buttocks and more likely to develop high fever, while those with EV-A71 were less likely to have lesions in mouths. Our study identified several non-CNS-specific symptoms (cold limbs and vomiting) and routine clinical tests (blood globulin, platelet, serum chloride and neutrophil counts), which can be used to alert clinicians of CNS complications. Among children with HFMD, non-EV-A71 EVs can also cause severe diseases, but those with EV-A71 infection are more likely to suffer CNS complications and other severe manifestations. Continuous surveillance of emerging enteroviruses and their clinical severities is essential.
