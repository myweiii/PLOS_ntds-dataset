Soil-transmitted helminthiasis and Schistosoma mansoni (S.mansoni) infections are among the most prevalent parasitic infections in children, typically occurring in communities that lack proper sanitation and hygiene. In Mizan-Aman Town of southwestern Ethiopia, despite seven years of a government deworming program, it remains highly prevalent among schoolchildren. The present study tested stool samples using the specialized laboratory techniques (Kato-Katz technique) from 615 children, revealing that 50.7% had soil transmitted worm infections, and 25.4% were infected with S. mansoni. While most cases showed low worm burden in the infected children, but some infected children had high worm burden. Risk factors involved in acquiring soil transmitted worm infection include going to a public school, drinking river water, not washing hands regularly, eating unwashed fruits, and frequently contact with soil. While S. mansoni infections were more predominant among boys and those who had the habit of river swimming or bathing in contaminated rivers. These findings outline that medication alone cannot help people fight against these diseases. While the deworming programs reduced the number of severe infections (high worm burden), the persistently high prevalence speaks loudly about the urgent need for comprehensive interventions. Thus, improvement in access to clean water and sanitation with hygiene is very crucial. Meanwhile, equal effort should go into constructing safe water facilities and hygiene education with proper toilets and hand-washing stations within the school. If these challenges addressed simultaneously, they may lead to a very significant reduction in infection and overall improvement of health and well-being in children.
