    "Background": "Soil-transmitted helminthiasis and Schistosomiasis are major public health problems mainly among school-age children. Despite the seven years of implementing elimination program, the ongoing prevalence and intensity of both diseases have not been assessed in the study area. Hence, this study aimed to determine the parasitological indicator (prevalence and intensity) of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma mansoni infections after seven years of preventive chemotherapy among school-age children in Mizan-Aman town.",
    "Methods": "A cross-sectional study was conducted among 615 school-age children from January to February 2022 in Mizan-Aman Town. Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Sociodemographic and associated factors were collected using a structured questionnaire. The stool samples were collected and processed using the double-slide Kato-Katz technique. The parasitological indicator was evaluated based on the thresholds set by the elimination program.",
    "Results": "The overall prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infection was 50.7% (95% CI: 46.8-54.8); with 2.4% moderate and heavy intensity, and Schistosoma mansoni infection prevalence was 25.4% (95% CI: 22.1-28.6), with 3.3% heavy intensity infection. School-age children in public schools; AOR: 3.92, (95% CI: 2.33-6.60), drinking river water; AOR: 1.79, (95% CI: 1.08-2.98), irregular handwashing before meals; AOR: 3.18, (95% CI: 1.24-8.35), eating unwashed fruits; AOR: 2.47, (95% CI: 1.56-3.92), and habits of soil contact; AOR: 2.48, (95% CI: 1.69-3.62), were associated factors for soil-transmitted helminths infection, whereas river swimming habits; AOR: 3.46, (95% CI: 2.18-5.50), bathing in the river; AOR: 3.29, (95% CI: 2.18-5.50), male gender; AOR: 1.72, (95% CI: 1.15-2.58), and school-age children in public schools; AOR: 2.36, 95% CI (1.19-4.68), were predictors of Schistosoma mansoni infection.",
    "Conclusion": "Despite the preventive chemotherapy that has been implemented in the study area, the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma mansoni infections persist at a high level. Hence, the preventive chemotherapy implementation could be revised and integrated with other control strategies for elimination."
