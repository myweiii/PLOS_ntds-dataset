Streptococcus suis is an emerging pathogen causing zoonotic infection in humans. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics such as penicillin, macrolides, and tetracyclines has emerged in S. suis-infected swine. S. suis human infection can cause severe disease among healthy populations, and conventional penicillin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for several decades. However, AMR among zoonotic S. suis strains causes a critical concern for human infection and antimicrobial treatment options. Our study demonstrated S. suis commonly causes bacteremia, meningitis, and endocarditis in humans, and only one-third of cases had apparent exposure to swine before the onset. Multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) is the leading cause of fatal outcomes. In contrast to previous studies, S. suis exhibited 48.2% penicillin susceptibility with an increasing trend of penicillin MICs. Our findings underline a reconsideration of the appropriate antimicrobial agent to treat this infection.
