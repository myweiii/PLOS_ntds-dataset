Schistosomiasis is a highly significant parasitic disease. Control programmes administering the drug praziquantel on an annual basis to school age children, and to adults in areas of high-risk, aimed primarily to prevent severe morbidity through significant reduction of the burden of infection (morbidity control). Despite success in many communities, it has been systematically shown that infection persists in others despite good treatment coverage rates by the control programmes. These communities are known as persistent hotspots. In response WHO recommends increasing treatment frequency to twice per annum; though caveats of limited evidence both in the definition used for hotspot detection, and in the likely success of the twice per annum strategy, particularly for Schistosoma mansoni, exist. The FibroScHot trial aimed to assess this twice per annum strategy but also a more intensive 4x per annum strategy. Crucial to interpretation of the trial results will be establishment of whether or not the trial was undertaken in persistent hotspots. Evidence presented here indicates that one trial site but not the second meets the current definition of a persistent hotspot, despite neither having met the threshold of morbidity control.
