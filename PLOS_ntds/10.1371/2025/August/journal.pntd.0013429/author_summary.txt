Schistosomiasis is a widespread disease caused by parasitic trematode flatworms, and affects millions of people, especially children in Africa. Detecting this disease is challenging because current methods require the microscopic identification of parasite eggs in urine; which is time-consuming and is not always accurate, especially in mild cases. Our study aims to improve diagnosis by discovering new host biomarkers that indicate parasite infection. We used proteomic method to screen urine samples from children in Zanzibar to identify infection-dependent host proteins. Machine learning methods emphasized five key host-derived proteins as candidate biomarkers. These proteins were validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), confirming their potential for diagnosis of schistosomiasis. Our findings could lead to simpler and accurate tests that do not require microscopy. This would be a significant step forward in detecting and monitoring this disease, especially in high-risk communities. By improving diagnosis, we hope to reduce the burden of schistosomiasis and improve public health outcomes.
