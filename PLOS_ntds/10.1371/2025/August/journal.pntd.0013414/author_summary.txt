Remote Pacific islands are home to many indigenous species, but they are also vulnerable to invasive species due to global travel and trade. One of the invasive species, Aedes albopictus, is the Asian tiger mosquito known to spread pathogens like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. This region has experienced increased mosquito-borne viral disease outbreaks in the past decade. In this study, we examined the genetic relatedness of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes collected from Guam, Hawaiian Islands, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, along with samples from America and Asia. Our results showed that Aedes albopictus in each region have distinct genetic signature, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Guam populations likely came from Hawaii and North America, respectively. This finding helps to understand how this mosquito spreads across the Pacific region, which can improve biosecurity strategies. Furthermore, genetic information of each island population could contribute to the development of biogenetic mosquito control programs, helping to prevent future outbreaks in the Remote Pacific islands.
