The dengue virus and its mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, have historically been considered an urban problem in South America. Since its reemergence following the continent-wide eradication campaign in the mid-1900s, Ae. aegypti has predominantly infested urban areas, leaving rural areas relatively unaffected by the arboviruses it transmits. This study provides strong evidence that this paradigm is shifting in the Peruvian Amazon. We identified Ae. aegypti infestations in 29/30 sites spanning a spectrum of urbanization, from villages to cities. Infestation metrics (proportion of infested houses and average number of adult Ae. aegypti per house) were higher in some villages than certain cities. We observed a repeated pattern of Ae. aegypti populations clustered near village ports, suggesting that the invasions often occur when adult mosquitoes fly off boats at port and subsequent generations spread house-by-house inland from the entry point. This pattern also indicates that some rural communities are experiencing ongoing invasions, and that rural infestations of Ae. aegypti will likely continue to expand as newly invaded populations become fully established. This shift in Ae. aegypti ecology in the Peruvian Amazon will have severe public health implications, increasing the risk of dengue and other arboviruses for remote villages with limited access to healthcare.
