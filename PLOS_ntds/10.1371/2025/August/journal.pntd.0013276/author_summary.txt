Our study reveals the long-term health consequences of Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in survivors, demonstrating that over 60% develop persistent symptoms such as memory impairment, arthralgia, and visual decline, with some laboratory abnormalities lasting up to a decade. Key risk factors include high viral load, acute-phase encephalitis, and corticosteroid use, while antiviral treatment (e.g., favipiravir) may reduce certain sequelae. These findings highlight SFTS as not only an acute infection but also a chronic condition requiring long-term monitoring and tailored rehabilitation strategies. Our results emphasize the need for improved survivor care and cautious therapeutic approaches during acute illness to mitigate lasting health impacts.
