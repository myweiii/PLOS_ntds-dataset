Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are causes of diarrhea, particularly in infants. We sequenced and analyzed the genomes of EPEC from recent epidemiological studies in southwestern Nigeria. Majority of the isolates lacked the bundle-forming pilus genes that are used to categorize EPEC as typical and belonged to subtypes rarely or never reported in the literature. Our data show that three unrecognized outbreaks occurred in the course of the epidemiological surveys and that the largest one was caused by a poorly defined lineage. Genomic methods are needed to fully understand the epidemiology of EPEC Nigeria and nearby African countries.
