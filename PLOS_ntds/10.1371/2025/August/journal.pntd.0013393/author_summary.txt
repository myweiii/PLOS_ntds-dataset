Shigella infection is a leading cause of diarrhea worldwide and is annually responsible for over 81,000 deaths among children under five. Its burden and growing antibiotic resistance has led the World Health Organization to identify Shigella as a priority pathogen for vaccine development. There are many open discussions surrounding the development and rollout of a Shigella vaccine, including the pathogen serotypes that a vaccine should target and the age group by which complete immunization should be achieved. While the burden of Shigella cases and deaths has been shown to be highest in Africa and Asia, less is known about the burden of Shigella in the Americas. With this systematic review we aimed to synthesize the burden of Shigella diarrhea among children five years and younger in the Americas region to inform vaccine research, development, and regional policymakers. Our findings include gaps in what is currently known about the distribution of Shigella in the region and suggest approaches to improve data collection and reporting moving forward.
