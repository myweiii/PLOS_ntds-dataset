    "Introduction": "Shigella infection is a leading cause of diarrhea worldwide. In 2021, this Gram-negative bacterium was estimated to be responsible for over 81,000 deaths and over 7.3 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in children under five per year [1]. It is also estimated to contribute an additional 13,600 deaths annually due to malnutrition and stunted growth attributed to Shigella’s inflammatory and intestinal destruction mechanism of action [2]. Beyond its population health impacts, Shigella diarrhea is also associated with high household and healthcare system expenditure, which can exacerbate poverty and place significant demands on healthcare systems [3–6].\nWhile the burden of Shigella cases and deaths has been shown to be highest in Africa and Asia, recent multi-site studies have also shown considerable burden in the Americas [7–11]. In 2018, the Global Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance (GPDS) Network found that while rotavirus was the most common cause of diarrhea hospitalizations globally, Shigella was the leading cause in Central America, with an attributable fraction of 19.2% (95% CI: 11.4 – 28.1), and the third most common cause in South America with an attributable fraction of 11.8% (95% CI: 9.3 – 14.9), compared to 19.2% (95% CI: 12.7 – 28.8) in the Western Pacific and 15.4% (95% CI: 9.1 – 25.1) in South East Asia [12]. In 2012 the Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) study found a Shigella diarrhea incidence rate of 6.8 cases per 100 child years (95% CI: 3.4 – 11.5) in Brazil and 42.3 cases per 100 child years (95% CI: 32.5 – 53.0) in Peru [13]. Comparatively, between 2000 and 2004 a six country multi-center surveillance study in Asia found an incidence rate of 1.32 cases per 100 child years between 2000 and 2004 in children under five years of age [14]. In the United States, the burden of Shigella diarrhea is lower, with an estimated incidence of 18.15 cases per 100,000 children in the 1–4 year old age group [15]. Across the Americas, the burden of Shigella is particularly concerning given documented multi-drug resistant strains, including in the United States [16,17]. Data from 2014 to 2022 indicated that more than 80% of Shigella sonnei and flexneri isolates in the Americas were resistant to ampicillin, and there has been an increase in resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and increased non-susceptibility to ciprofloxacin from 0.2% to 5.7% within the same period [18,19].\nWith its increasing antibiotic resistance and continued high-burden, Shigella is a priority pathogen for vaccine development as evidenced by its moving up in priority ranking of the WHO Bacterial Priority Pathogens List, from 25th in 2017 to 8th in 2024 [20,21]. Several Shigella vaccines are in clinical development for the target population of young children with a Phase 3 trial underway and more anticipated in the coming years [22–26]. As policymakers in the Americas eventually consider whether a Shigella vaccine is appropriate for their setting, establishing an evidence-base on the burden estimates of Shigella diarrhea is critical [20]. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the burden of Shigella diarrhea among children under 72 months (six years) in the Americas region. We gathered information on prevalence, incidence, and attributable fraction of Shigella-related diarrhea in this population, which is essential for informing vaccine research and development, regulation, and immunization-related policy making.",
    "Methods": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to summarize the burden of Shigella diarrhea among children under 72 months of age in the Americas, excluding the U.S., Canada, and Greenland. Children in the low- and middle- income countries of the region were the focus due to the likelihood of a vaccine only being considered for pediatric routine vaccination in those contexts [27]. The protocol for this review was registered on Prospero (ID=CRD42024587471) and the PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews can be found in the supporting information (S1 Table) [28].\n\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nWe searched published and pre-print articles from PubMed, Embase, SciELO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, and Web of Science for this review. Articles written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French available in these databases from January 1, 2000 through July 23, 2024 were considered. Publications reporting only on data prior to 2000 were excluded to narrow the scope of this review to more recent burden estimates that can inform future policy. The search incorporated terms related to Shigella and diarrheal disease in children under 72 months of age (see S2 Table for complete search terms). We considered all interventional and observational study designs that enabled estimation of prevalence (proportion of diarrhea cases, hospitalizations, or deaths in which Shigella was identified), incidence (number of Shigella-specific diarrhea episodes per unit of person-time), and/or attributable fraction (the proportion of diarrhea episodes attributed to Shigella based on culture positivity, or molecular detection via PCR/qPCR) [29].\nWe restricted our inclusion to studies that confirmed Shigella infection by laboratory methods (culture, PCR, or qPCR) and that were conducted in countries of the Americas, excluding the U.S., Canada, and Greenland. Studies also had to report disaggregated data specifically for children aged under 72 months with symptomatic diarrheal disease to be included.\nAfter removing duplicate articles, each title and abstract were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers (MLS, AR, AM, PP) using Covidence systematic review software [30]. A third independent reviewer resolved any discrepancies between the two initial reviewers. Articles that could not be evaluated based on the abstract were automatically moved to full text review. Articles selected for full text review were screened utilizing the same dual review method described for titles and abstracts. At the full text review stage, the reason for exclusion of each ineligible article was recorded within Covidence. Reasons for exclusion were applied hierarchically beginning with incorrect geography, followed by data collection prior to 2000, study population without diarrhea, lack of laboratory confirmation of Shigella, absence of data disaggregated for children under 72 months, and insufficient information to calculate the required metrics.\nData were extracted from included articles utilizing a pre-specified data extraction template embedded in Covidence. Information on study design and methodology (e.g., follow-up duration and inclusion criteria), study location, number of overall children and/or stool samples and those with Shigella detected, key clinical descriptors (i.e., diarrhea definition), antibiotic use, and laboratory detection methods were extracted. Outcomes (prevalence, incidence, attributable fraction) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted for the overall study population and any relevant subgroups reported by the manuscript authors such as disaggregated age groups, serotype, antibiotic resistance, healthcare setting, and study site urbanicity.\nPublication quality was assessed using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) assessment tool (S3 Table) [31]. Quality assessment and data extraction occurred simultaneously using Covidence. All data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by a single reviewer and quality controlled by a second reviewer in Covidence.\n\n\nData analysis\nDescriptive tables were compiled to summarize the characteristics of all included studies. Forest plots of prevalence, attributable fraction, and incidence estimates were created to display data across studies according to key subgroups of interest, such as detection method and health care setting. Studies were categorized based on what was explicitly stated in the published article. If the authors did not specify a subgroup, for example urbanicity of the study site, the study would not be included in any category for that subgrouping. For studies that estimated prevalence using qPCR detection methods, we accepted their reported values regardless of the lower-limit of detection, quantitative threshold employed to assign detection, or the test manufacturer. In instances when only raw numbers were reported (such as number of Shigella cases and number of children presenting with diarrhea), Shigella prevalence estimates were calculated by the review team. For all prevalence estimates, the review team calculated 95% CIs using R, assuming a binomial distribution to standardize confidence intervals across studies. All incidence estimates were standardized by the review team to the rate of cases per 100 child-years. For all prevalence and attributable fraction outcome metrics, random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each subgroup of interest when relevant data from at least two studies in any subgroup were present using the “Meta” package in R [32]. A meta-analysis was not conducted across incidence estimates due to notable variability in estimation techniques throughout the literature, limiting comparability across estimates.",
    "Results": "Literature search results\nOur final search yielded 848 articles from all databases described previously. After removing duplicates, 486 articles remained for title and abstract screening. Of these, 338 titles/abstracts were excluded leaving 148 articles that met eligibility criteria for full-text review. During the full-text assessment, 114 studies were excluded resulting in a final 34 articles included in the review (Fig 1). Quality assessments of the 34 included studies can be found in S1 Fig.\nKey characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1, with a summary of study-level characteristics in Table 2. The data on the burden of Shigella infections originated from 14 countries, with Brazil and Peru contributing nine publications each (26.4%, respectively) (Fig 2). Among the included studies, 22 (64.7%) were cross-sectional studies. Nine studies (26%) used PCR/qPCR as a method of detection with the remaining using culture-based detection. The four studies that used qPCR specified varying cycle threshold (CT) value cutoffs/ lower limits of detection of less than 30 [53], less than 35 [12,13], and less than 38 [42] for Shigella detection, but did not report copies per milliliter. Studies used variable case definitions for diarrhea, with two explicitly excluding cases of bloody diarrhea [53,40]. Among those that included cases of bloody diarrhea, the reported proportion of such cases among all samples ranged considerably from 2.6% up to 30.8%.\nMade with public domain data from Natural Earth.

The pooled prevalence among the 7 studies that used PCR/qPCR molecular methods for detection (using a variety of detection cut-offs) was more than five times higher at 16.5% (95% CI: 11.1 –24.0, I2: 94.6%). Among the culture-based studies, Diniz-Santos et al. (2005) [39] estimated the highest prevalence of 27.5% (95% CI: 20.3 – 36.1) among children <48 months in Brazil between 2002 and 2003 [39]. A few culture-based studies estimated a prevalence of zero from sites in Argentina, Haiti, and Uruguay in 2005, 2013, and 2015, respectively [56,62,66]. The highest prevalence estimate among PCR-based studies came from Honduras in 2017–2018 with 37.8% (95% CI: 31.3 – 44.8) among children 6–35 months while the lowest came from Ecuador in 2003–2005 at 1.5% (95% CI: 0.4 – 5.3) among children <60 months (Fig 3) [65].\nA subset of culture-based studies reported the prevalence of Shigella specific to serotypes (n = 5). The pooled Shigella flexneri prevalence was 2.4% (95% CI: 1.0 – 5.5, I2: 74.7%) compared to 2.3% (95% CI: 0.6 – 7.9, I2: 92.8%) for Shigella sonnei. In Brazil, the prevalence of Shigella flexneri was lower than that of Shigella sonnei, while the opposite was true for Argentina and Peru [57,61,67] (Fig 4).\nAfter disaggregating studies by healthcare facility type, the highest pooled prevalence estimates among culture-based studies came from four studies enrolling from health centers/posts (4.8%, 95% CI: 1.5 – 14.8, I2: 92.1%), followed by eight hospital-based studies at 3.8% (95% CI: 1.3 – 10.3, I2: 91.5%), five from a mix of facilities (3.1%, 95% CI: 1.4 – 6.6, I2: 68.9%) and four with active case finding in communities (2.6%, 95% CI: 0.3 –14.7, I2: 97.5%) (Fig 5). Among the culture-based hospital studies, a subset (n = 7) explicitly defined their population as either inpatient or outpatient cases and two reported for both inpatients and outpatients. Among the four studies with inpatient populations by culture, the pooled prevalence was 2.6% (95% CI: 0.9 – 6.9, I2: 88.5%), compared to 2.4% (95% CI: 0.9 – 5.8), I2: 65.3% among the five studies with outpatient hospital cases. PCR-based GPDS data for inpatients from six countries and one other study in Peru had an overall high prevalence of 20.8% (95% CI: 15.5 - 27.4, I2: 86.3%) (Fig 6).\nSixteen culture and four PCR-based studies explicitly described the study setting as urban, peri-urban, or rural. While pooled prevalence estimates suggest that the burden of Shigella is generally lower in urban settings compared to rural settings, heterogeneity across studies resulted in large overlapping confidence intervals. Among culture-based studies, the pooled prevalence from urban studies was 4.0% (95% CI: 1.8 – 8.7, I2: 95.0%) while it was 12.0% (95% CI: 6.9 – 19.9, I2: 96.1%) among rural studies (Fig 7).\nStudies used an array of age categories, most commonly by year (every 12 months). Other studies reported different intervals such as every two years, with three studies disaggregating ages less than 12 months old. Among culture-based results, the pooled prevalence estimate for children <12 months was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1 – 7.7, I2: 78.1%) compared to 4.6% (95% CI: 1.2 – 15.4, I2: 90.2%) for children ≥12 months. Among PCR-based studies, the pooled prevalence estimate for children <12 months was 11.9% (95% CI: 5.9 – 22.3, I2: 84.0%) compared to 26.7% (95% CI: 19.5 – 35.4, I2: 78.8%) for children ≥12 months (Fig 8).\n\n\nAttributable fraction results\nOnly four studies (two of which from the same surveillance network) reported the burden of Shigella in terms of attributable fraction. Across the two culture-based estimates, the pooled attributable fraction was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3 – 6.4, I2: 0.0%) [60]. Three PCR studies presented estimates across several countries, for which the pooled attributable fraction was 11.9% (95% CI: 9.7 – 14.6, I2: 48.8%) (Fig 9) [12].\n\n\nIncidence results\nFewer studies reported incidence of Shigella diarrhea than prevalence and they used a variety of incidence method calculations ranging from direct ascertainment in a cohort study to facility-based studies that estimated incidence. Two studies conducted in Iquitos, Peru showed particularly high incidence of 37.0 per 100 child-years (95% CI: 33.0 – 42.0) from Kosek (2008) [44], which was a culture-based study, and 42.3 per 100 child-years (95% CI: 32.5 – 53.0) from Platts-Mills (2018) [60], a PCR-based study (Fig 10) conducted in the same study area.",
    "Discussion": "This review aimed to describe the burden of Shigella among children five years and younger with diarrhea in the Americas to inform surveillance efforts, vaccine research and development investments, and ultimately aid policymakers with vaccine adoption decision-making. The Americas will be an important region to target for eventual Shigella vaccines due to its high burden and history of rapid vaccine adoption. Across the 34 studies reviewed, we found notable high prevalence, attributable fraction, and incidence estimates of Shigella diarrhea highlighting the burden of this Gram-negative bacteria among children living in the Americas.\nThis systematic review disaggregated all identified study estimates by detection method, given well known discrepancies between culture and PCR/qPCR-based sensitivities. Among culture-based studies, our meta-analysis identified a pooled Shigella diarrhea prevalence of 2.4%, which is slightly lower than estimates from systematic reviews in other regions. Namely, a systematic review of the prevalence of Shigella in Africa, which did not disaggregate by detection method, found a pooled prevalence of 5.9% [11]. Another systematic review in Southeast Asia, again without detection-disaggregated estimates, identified a pooled prevalence of 5% among children <5 years [68]. Within the Americas region, there are clear differences across burden estimates, however no clear patterns by country emerged that could indicate geographic vaccination priorities.\nPCR/qPCR methods consistently result in burden estimates several times higher those from culture in the literature [69]. Our meta-analysis of Shigella prevalence from studies that used qPCR or PCR showed estimates more than five times higher than those by culture, with a pooled prevalence of 16.5%. Although a concern with PCR/qPCR methods is the detection of inactive DNA, culture-negative/molecularly identified Shigella cases appear to have similar severity of diarrhea and similar improvements with antibiotic treatment to culture-confirmed Shigella suggesting similar clinical relevance [70,71]. De-tuning quantitative PCR/qPCR methods, such as by choosing a higher-quantity infection threshold for Shigella detection based on cut-offs that distinguish diarrhea case from asymptomatic control status, may successfully distinguish clinically relevant Shigella cases from asymptomatic carriage at the individual case level. At a population level, attributable fraction calculations have been used to account for asymptomatic carriage estimates in controls. Only one molecular detection-based study (of nine) in this review used a de-tuned detection threshold [53], therefore the pooled PCR/qPCR molecular estimates in this review may be overstating the true Shigella-attributed diarrhea burden . Alignment on the threshold for the number of copies of the ipaH gene warranting likely attribution of diarrhea to Shigella across research studies would be an important step to minimize methodological heterogeneity between studies using molecular methods.\nA small subset of studies reported prevalence of Shigella serotypes, specifically the two leading serotypes, S. flexneri and S. sonnei. It is hypothesized that serotype distributions shift from S. flexneri to S. sonnei predominance with economic development as well as water and sanitation infrastructure improvements. This shift is hypothesized to be due to the reduced presence of Plesiomonas shigelloides in contaminated water, a Gram-negative bacterium that shares some antigens with S. sonnei conferring immunity against S. sonnei [15,51,52,54,55]. Our meta-analyses of culture-based estimates show that the overall burden of both serotypes across the region are comparable. At the country level, in 2013 this trend held true for Brazil while Argentina and Peru had higher prevalence of S. flexneri in 2007 and 2002, respectively. The overall lack of Shigella serotype data in published literature makes it difficult to discern these trends over time and contribute to discussions about serotype targeting for vaccine development.\nWe further disaggregated prevalence study estimates into other subgroups of interest, while maintaining separation by detection method, including the type of health facility from which the study population was identified, and whether the study facilities were in urban or rural settings. Our meta-analysis found higher prevalence of Shigella in health center and hospital settings compared to community-based active case finding studies (see S2 Fig for the health facility subgroup forest plots with attributable fraction and incidence estimates). That Shigella diarrhea is more severe than other causes and that care-seeking tends to identify more severe diarrhea is consistent with other studies [1]. We found a lower pooled prevalence of Shigella among studies conducted in urban settings compared to rural settings, which aligns with findings from other studies that have similarly suggested higher prevalence of Shigella in rural settings, such as in a surveillance-based study of Shigella over 20 years in Bangladesh [72,73]. Uncertainty in pooled estimates with few rural prevalence estimates or differences in infrastructure between settings may explain the heterogeneity.\nAge of optimal Shigella vaccine introduction remains an open discussion with general agreement that full protection would ideally occur prior to 12 months of age [74–76]. However, an increasingly crowded infant vaccine schedule may prove challenging. To explore variations in burden, we disaggregated pooled burden estimates by age and found that the prevalence of Shigella was higher among children above 12 months of age compared to younger children, consistent with other studies [77]. However, the majority of the data is cross-sectional and therefore does not explain how much Shigella diarrhea could be averted by a vaccine introduced at different ages. The MAL-ED study [60] ascertained age of first infection across seven countries, including Peru, and found the median time of first infection with Shigella to be 14 months of age [77]. Only two culture-based studies disaggregated the prevalence of Shigella among children <6 months compared to those 6–12 months old. While Manrique-Abril et al. [47] found comparable prevalence across these two groups, Perales et al. [57] demonstrated a burden more than twice as high among 6–12 month-olds compared to children <6 months old, a finding consistent with age-stratified Shigella prevalence in MAL-ED [47,57,77]. These data suggest that studies reporting Shigella burden in 0–12-month-old children may mask a notable burden among the 6–12-month sub-group. The one included study that presented age-stratified Shigella diarrhea incidence rates (Kosek 2008)[44] reported a peak Shigella diarrhea incidence of 50 cases/100 child-years in 12–23 month-olds but also noted a non-negligible burden in 6–11 months-olds (22 cases/100 child-years) [44]. Given uncertainty about precise timing of Shigella vaccine introduction, future studies should disaggregate their reporting of Shigella burden data in 3–6-month age categories, particularly among children under two years of age.\nIncidence rates were less commonly reported in studies, likely due to the additional complexity of enumerating a population at risk and ensuring all possible cases are accounted for [29]. In the two studies that utilized a standard prospective cohort study design with active diarrhea episode ascertainment, including that which did not lead to care-seeking, incidence rates of Shigella diarrhea were exceptionally high compared to other incidence estimates, irrespective of detection method [44,59]. Incidence rates provide a better understanding of disease burden as they are unbiased by health care seeking and social exclusion, which affect ascertainment in health care centers, particularly in highly marginalized populations [78].\nIncidence studies that focused on health-facility ascertainment of cases, both outpatient and inpatient, and exclusively inpatients, had lower incidence rates, consistent with rarer, but costly, more severe disease [12,43]. Health care system costs, and costs averted by introduction of a Shigella vaccine by preventing outpatient and inpatient visits, will be key factors for country decision makers to consider when faced with a potentially effective and available Shigella vaccine (see S2 Fig for forest plot of attributable fraction estimates among only inpatient populations). The cost of an eventual Shigella vaccine will also be an important factor for policy-makers. Larger vaccine markets help to drive down prices through initiatives like pooled procurement, making vaccines more accessible for the lowest income settings. This review highlights that Shigella diarrhea appears to be distributed across the Americas and expanding surveillance in the region may further demonstrate a universal and notable Shigella burden throughout the region.\nBeyond cost-effectiveness, vaccine developers must also consider that country immunization programs are becoming saturated, which is reflected in the number of vaccination visits and shots per visit, where the same number of health workers are asked to manage increasingly complex vaccination schedules [74]. As such, combination vaccine strategies based on identified and validated regional priority vaccine targets have been raised as the way forward for Shigella vaccines [74,79]. This review may further inform regional decision makers on the relative burden of Shigella and therefore its relevance to the research and development of a combination vaccine.\nThe majority of studies included in this review were conducted from populations within Brazil and Peru, with minimal representation in the rest of the Americas region resulting in limited generalizability of results. In addition to data from more countries, sub-national data is needed to inform a better understanding of Shigella epidemiology in the Americas. The high burden in Iquitos, Peru, confirmed by multi-country studies including sites in Asia and Africa, has led some to believe the Amazon region is a particularly high-risk place for Shigella compared to the rest of the Americas due to infrastructure- and climate-related factors that may promote bacteria growth [44,59]. Few studies estimated the burden of Shigella in other communities within the Amazon region, limiting the ability to generalize the burden observed in Iquitos to other areas of the Amazon in Peru, as well as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador (see S4 Table for all burden estimates from study sites in the Amazon region). It is also noteworthy that incidence rates from sites selected for research studies may not reflect the true population-based incidence in the region because areas with known high disease burden are more likely to be selected for study and intervention. Conversely, children in the lowest resourced and most isolated settings who generally have the lowest access to state-of-the-art diagnostics may not be represented in the research studies reported in this review.\nBeyond limited variation in the geographic scope of studies in the region, another limitation of our systematic review is the overall heterogeneity of reporting practices across articles, resulting in the exclusion of valid and useful data across various subgroup analyses, for example, prevalence by age. In some cases, the lack of data available for comparison across studies resulted in reduced power of the meta-analyses to estimate pooled metrics and thus produced imprecise corresponding confidence intervals. Some studies excluded children with previous antibiotic use and/or children with co-infections which further limited comparability across studies. Regarding seasonality of Shigella, this review did not restrict study inclusion by duration of recruitment, which could result in comparison of specific seasonal burden estimates to those from year-round data collection. Finally, most of the studies included in this review (n = 27) were facility-based thus limiting understanding of the burden of Shigella to the region’s health systems, rather than that of the general population. Despite the overall limited number of studies that met inclusion criteria and the varying data collection and reporting practices of those included studies, we were able to produce several informative meta-analyses to identify pooled burden estimates across key subgroups relevant to vaccine development and eventual deployment considerations.\nOverall, our findings on the burden of Shigella in the Americas emphasize the need to further study Shigella incidence and prevalence. Importantly, data would be most useful with a standardized detection methodology, such as a uniform qPCR platform with a de-tuned threshold, across a variety of geographic settings, including throughout the Amazon region, and to report data disaggregated by subpopulations of interest to contribute to key vaccine discussions. These findings may incentivize investment in Shigella surveillance and contribute to accelerating Shigella vaccine development, and eventual uptake, in consideration of regional preferences, including multi-pathogen vaccine development strategies."
