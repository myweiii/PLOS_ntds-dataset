Taenia solium neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the main cause of preventable acquired epilepsy particularly in endemic settings Tanzania included. The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the primary health facilities, towards control and prevention of NCC-induced epilepsy in northern Tanzania. Early detection of tapeworms’ carries and treatment using effective anthelmintics (albendazole, praziquantel) are ideal for interrupting the lifecycle of the T. solium, and eventually control and prevent NCC-induced epilepsy. Our study established knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and poor practices about the prevention and control of NCC-induced epilepsy among HCWs in the study area. Most of the interviewed HCWs were not aware that NCC could cause epilepsy in humans, and more than half did not know that NCC in people with epilepsy could be treated. Further, the majority of HCWs didn’t know the diagnostic techniques and recommended drugs for NCC and NCC-induced epilepsy. Public health intervention programs aimed at preventing, controlling, and eradicating endemic poverty-related zoonotic diseases in many endemic areas should target both communities and HCWs in place. One Health approach is needed to promote better KAP among HCWs towards the prevention and control of acquired epilepsy in Tanzania.
