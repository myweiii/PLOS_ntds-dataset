LF is one of the significant NTDs, and if left untreated, it can lead to severe complications such as lymphedema. As a leading cause of disability, it results in restricted mobility, loss of income, impaired well-being and social stigma. Even after eliminating the condition in 2023, over 70 million people remain at risk in high-endemic areas of Bangladesh. This study was conducted in two districts with high prevalence rates of LF in northern Bangladesh to explore healthcare-seeking behaviour, stigma, and challenges faced by people with LF. In-depth interviews and key informant interviews were conducted with individuals with LF and key stakeholders. Most affected individuals delayed seeking care or could not afford formal care; others relied on traditional healers. Females with LF encountered heightened stigma and exclusion, leading to emotional distress. The key challenges identified in this study included lack of awareness, limited access to healthcare, and the financial burden of treatment. Our findings highlighted the importance of providing accessible, available, and affordable healthcare infrastructure, as well as the need for inclusive well-being-related services for people with LF. A multi-sectoral approach is needed to design culturally acceptable interventions to ensure holistic care and support for LF.
