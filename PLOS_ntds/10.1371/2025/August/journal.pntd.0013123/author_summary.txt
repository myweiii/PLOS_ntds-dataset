Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic skin disease affecting over a million people annually, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Current treatments rely on pentavalent antimonials, which are often associated with severe side effects and limited accessibility in endemic communities. Seeking safer alternatives, we explored the use of a topical tincture derived from Arnica montana, a medicinal plant known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this formulation against Leishmania parasites in laboratory and animal models, along with high skin retention and low systemic absorption, which are key characteristics for a topical therapeutic. We conducted a phase Ib/II clinical trial in Colombia to assess the safety and therapeutic response of Arnica tincture in adults with parasitologically confirmed, uncomplicated CL (NCT05094908). Participants were randomized to receive treatment for either 30 or 45 days. Of the 16 individuals enrolled, 12 completed the full 180-day follow-up, and all achieved complete lesion healing. No severe adverse effects were reported; only mild, localized reactions such as erythema or burning were observed. Our findings suggest that AT may be a safe and effective topical alternative for treating CL. Although these results are promising, further clinical trials with larger populations and comparison to standard treatments are necessary to confirm its efficacy and potential role in public health strategies.
