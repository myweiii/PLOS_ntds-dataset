Taenia solium (also known as the ‘Pork tapeworm’) is a neglected zoonotic parasite that causes infections in humans and pigs; taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans, and porcine cysticercosis in pigs. Ingesting the pork tapeworm eggs (normally due to open defecation by a tapeworm carrier) results in cysticercosis in both pigs and humans. A form of human cysticercosis where the pork tapeworm cysts lodge in the brain (neurocysticercosis) is the leading cause of adult-onset epilepsy in endemic areas. To reduce the burden of this debilitating disease, the World Health Organisation (WHO) included T. solium cysticercosis in the 2021–2030 Roadmap for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This roadmap recommends the implementation of control interventions within ‘hyperendemic’ areas. A cross-sectional study was conducted in this area covering four districts to validate the geospatial risk maps which identified hyperendemic areas within northern Uganda and to determine the prevalence and risk factors of porcine cysticercosis. The area was found to be hyperendemic for the pork tapeworm with a prevalence of 17.4% and pigs were more likely to be positive if they were free roaming, their household had no toilet, or the pigs were provided with borehole water.
