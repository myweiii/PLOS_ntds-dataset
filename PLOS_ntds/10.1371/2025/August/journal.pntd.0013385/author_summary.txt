West Nile virus (WNV) infection in crocodilians has been associated with disease and skin lesions known as “pix.” These lesions result in significant economic losses for the crocodile farming industry in Australia, the USA, and Africa. In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms that may lead to lesion development following WNV infection. Through experimental infection, we confirmed the presence of the virus and its replication in various body systems, including the digestive and urinary systems. Our findings suggest that the virus primarily replicates in the kidneys and digestive system, which leads to shedding through the cloaca. However, the mechanism behind the development of skin lesions still requires further investigation.
