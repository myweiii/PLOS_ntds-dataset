Schistosomiasis remains a persistent public health challenge, particularly among school-aged children in endemic regions. Conventional health education approaches often fail to translate knowledge into sustained practices change. This study evaluated two innovative educational approaches—curriculum-integrated infiltration and stepwise progressive approaches—against traditional methods in a schistosomiasis-endemic area near Poyang Lake, China. Sixth-grade students were divided into traditional intervention, infiltration, and stepwise intervention groups. Validated questionnaires assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) pre- and post-intervention. Both intervention groups outperformed traditional intervention in knowledge gains, with practices knowledge showing the most significant improvement. Attitudinal improvements were limited due to high baseline rates. The infiltration approaches, requiring minimal resources, proved ideal for practices reinforcement in low-resource settings, while the stepwise approach excelled in rapid knowledge dissemination. Findings advocate for context-adaptive, multisectoral frameworks to bridge the knowledge-practices gap, aligning with WHO goals for neglected tropical disease elimination. This study provides actionable insights for optimizing school-based interventions in endemic regions globally.
