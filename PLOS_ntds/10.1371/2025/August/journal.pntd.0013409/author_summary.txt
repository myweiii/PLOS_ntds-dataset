Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a significant global health concern, affecting an estimated 10 million individuals worldwide, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. This virus can lead to severe diseases, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a range of inflammatory conditions. One such condition is HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/spastic paraparesis and others include HTLV-1 associated inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and dermatomyositis. These diseases are characterized by skeletal muscle weakness, myalgia, and inflammation, resulting in functional impairment and increased morbidity.
The prevalence of HTLV-1-associated polymyositis varies widely across endemic regions. For instance, studies have shown a high prevalence in Jamaica (63â€“85%) but a lower prevalence in Japan (approximately 30%). In this study investigated the prevalence HAIM in a large cohort of people living with HTLV-1 in an endemic area of this infection in Brazil. We found that polymyositis was the main cause of HAIM. We recommend that patients infected with HTLV-1 who show clinical signs of myopathy should be promptly screened for HAIM.
