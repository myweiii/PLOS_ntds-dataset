Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. It poses a significant public health challenge in both Central and West Africa and Southeast Australia—Buruli ulcer causes stigmatising disfigurements and disabilities which often lead to personal economic instability. Despite this, the transmission mechanisms of M. ulcerans to humans remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective control and prevention strategies. In Australia, researchers identified that mosquitoes and possums play a role in M. ulcerans transmission to humans, however, the complete transmission cycle is not understood. In Central/West Africa, the transmission vector remains unconfirmed. Given this knowledge gap, mathematical models have been developed with the aim of clarifying infection mechanisms. Our study presents the first systematic review of such models. We analysed various model structures and their relevance to observed transmission patterns and found crucial gaps—there were no mosquito models for Africa and no human models for Australia. Additionally, we found that most studies did not validate their model with real-world data. Our review of M. ulcerans transmission models highlights important avenues for future research, both in the context of Buruli ulcer and for other diseases with complex environmental interactions or multiple transmission routes.
