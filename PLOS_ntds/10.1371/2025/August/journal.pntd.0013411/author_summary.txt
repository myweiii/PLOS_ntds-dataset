Preliminary assessments have identified blackfly biting activity at Erin-Ijesha and Arinta waterfalls in Southwest Nigeria, predisposing first-line communities to a high risk of onchocerciasis. These blackflies make use of fast flowing rivers for the development of their immature stages and the adult fly transmits the parasite Onchocerca volvulus that causes severe skin and eye disorder. The disease is particularly prevalent in communities near suitable river systems. Erin-Ijesha and Ipole-Iloro, two first-line communities near the waterfalls, have been involved in mass ivermectin distribution programs for years. However, this study reveals a striking lack of knowledge among residents regarding the bioecology of blackflies, severity of onchocerciasis and the importance of ivermectin uptake. This knowledge gap has contributed to suboptimal treatment coverage, with some individuals refusing to participate in annual mass drug distribution. Given the high-risk status of these communities, these findings highlight the urgent need for the federal and state ministries of health and the NTD implementing partners to intensify on community sensitization efforts before and during mass drug administration campaigns to address misconceptions, improve public health awareness and optimize treatment program outcomes.
