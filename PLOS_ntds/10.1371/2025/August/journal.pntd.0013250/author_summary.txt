Dengue and Chikungunya are the most common arboviral illnesses affecting more than half of the worldâ€™s population. Both viral diseases have overlapping symptoms, which poses a challenge for accurate differential diagnostics in low-resource settings. Infection with one or more different serotypes of DENV results in a phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), wherein antibodies against one serotype, instead of protecting against DENV infection caused by other serotypes, aid in the viral uptake by the host immune cells, resulting in severe dengue. Rapid antigen tests targeting NS1, and IgG/IgM are the most common methods used to detect DENV and CHIKV infections. However, there are several limitations of serological assays: a) ELISA cannot differentiate DENV serotypes, and b) depending on the stage of infection, ELISA-based tests often provide false positives or false negatives. This warrants a need for a reliable molecular method that can differentiate between DENV serotypes and across Dengue and Chikungunya with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Bengaluru has the highest dengue burden in Southern India and experiences year-round transmission of all four DENV serotypes, facilitated by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus infestations. However, reliance on ELISA-based testing often underestimates disease prevalence. To bridge this gap, we developed DENCHIK, a cost-effective multiplex qRT-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of all four DENV serotypes and CHIKV. The sensitivity and specificity of the DENCHIK assay were evaluated across different time points from the onset of symptoms and compared with ELISA and two commercially available qRT-PCR kits. We recommend integrating molecular diagnostics like DENCHIK assay into urban health centers to enhance case detection, provide more accurate estimates of disease burden, and improve clinical management of Dengue and Chikungunya throughout the year.
