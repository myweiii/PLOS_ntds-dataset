Cryptosporidium is a significant cause of diarrheal diseases and associated malnutrition in young children in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Despite its importance as a leading cause of diarrheal illness, there is limited published data on the prevalence and factors influencing the spread of Cryptosporidium in this region, with most published studies focusing on populations living with HIV. This study aimed to contribute towards filling this gap by investigating the prevalence and factors associated with Cryptosporidium infections among diarrheic children under five years of age in Eastern Ethiopia. Among the 756 children studied, we found a 15.2% prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection, diagnosed using auramine-phenol staining and light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy. We identified key factors associated with infection, including the wet season, lack of exclusive breastfeeding, inadequate handwashing after toileting, and the use of toilet paper following defecation. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions that address these factors in order to reduce the burden of Cryptosporidium infections and improve child health outcomes in the region.
