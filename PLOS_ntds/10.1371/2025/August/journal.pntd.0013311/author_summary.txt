Chemical control of Chagas disease has been focused on the use of pyrethroid formulations for over 40 years. New insecticides and formulations are available but have not been sufficiently evaluated for Triatomine control. This study reports the efficacy of the residual application of a new microencapsulated formulation for the control of T. dimidiata in the rural community of Tekik in Yucatan, Southeast Mexico. We surveyed 120 residences and randomly allocated them in a 1:1 in treatment (residual spray) and control (no residual spray) groups. Then, we carried out one application of pirimiphos-methyl in a microencapsulated formulation using manual compression sprayers at a dose of 1g/m2. We measured triatomine prevalence and abundance monthly from a random sample of ten houses from each group. Post-intervention entomological surveillance showed that domestic infestations by T. dimidiata were only detected in the control group and that the peridomestic infestations were significantly reduced in the treatment group with an estimated efficacy of 65% for 6 months post-intervention. This study provides evidence that Actellic 300CS can reduce T. dimidiata infestations and is an alternative for the control of triatomines in Mexico.
