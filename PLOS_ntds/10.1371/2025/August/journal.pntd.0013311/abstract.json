    "Background": "Triatoma dimidiata, the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi throughout South Mexico and Central America, infest domiciles and peridomestic ecotopes of rural and semi-rural communities. This study reports the effect of the residual application of the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl in a microencapsulated formulation (Actellic 300CS) for the control of intradomiciliary and peridomestic T. dimidiata in the community of Tekik de Regil (hereafter Tekik) in Yucatan, Southeast Mexico.",
    "Methods": "From March to October 2022, a two-arm, unblinded entomological trial was performed in Tekik. Timed Manual Collections (TMC) characterized house and peridomicile infestation by T. dimidiata prior (baseline) and after the residual spraying (RS) (post-intervention) of a microencapsulated formulation. A total of 120 premises were surveyed (60 positive and 60 negative for T. dimidiata), randomly allocated 1:1 to treatment (RS with Actellic 300CS) and control (no RS) arms. Monthly post-spraying entomological surveys (May-October) with TMC were carried out in a random sample of ten houses from each arm. We analyzed the association between the treatment and post-intervention infestations using chi-square contingency tables. The estimated efficacy of the intervention with the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was calculated with the efficacy formula, using the Odds Ratio (OD) calculated from a binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) from the positive premises in the baseline survey and post-intervention, using time as a random effect.",
    "Results": "Domestic infestations post-intervention were only detected in the control group (2/60 houses, 3.3%). Cumulative peridomestic infestation was significantly higher in the control arm (31.7%; 19/60) compared to the treatment arm (11.7%; 7/60) (X2 = 0.007, p < 0.01). The cumulative 6-month estimated efficacy of the intervention (% reduction in treatment versus control arm) was 65% (95% CI: 14%-79%).",
    "Conclusions": "A single application of Actellic 300CS reduced T. dimidiata infestations by more than 60% for up to 6 months and provides evidence of an alternative formulation suitable for triatomine control in Mexico."
