The parasite Schistosoma mansoni causes intestinal schistosomiasis in humans, resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. In the municipality of Sumidouro, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in addition to human transmission, we found wild rodents infected by S. mansoni. In this work, we described and compared the genetic diversity of S. mansoni isolates from wild rodents and humans at two localities in Sumidouro. We did not observe genetic differences between S. mansoni isolates from rodents and humans, indicating the sharing of the parasite. However, we observed two genetic clusters corresponding to the two localities. These results reveal the importance of wild rodents in maintaining the parasite cycle in the Sumidouro region, which contributes to transmission in humans.
