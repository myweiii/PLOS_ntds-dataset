    "Background": "The fluke Schistosoma mansoni is the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, and remains prevalent in certain regions of Brazil. In the municipality of Sumidouro, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a low-endemic area for S. mansoni, water rats (Nectomys squamipes) are naturally infected by this trematode. The S. mansoni populations infecting humans and water-rats in Sumidouro exhibit distinct patterns of cercarial emergence (chronotypes) and phenotypic differences between hosts. Previous studies have shown that the adaptation of S. mansoni populations to human hosts (diurnal chronotype) and water rats (nocturnal chronotype) could result in prezygotic isolation. To test this hypothesis, we employed the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (MT-CO1) and microsatellite loci as genetic markers.",
    "Principal findings": "We assessed the population structure between the definitive host species and geographically distant isolates collected from two endemic localities (Pamparrão–PAM and Encanto-Soledade–ENC-SOL) in Sumidouro. Additionally, we evaluated the phylogenetic relationships between S. mansoni from Sumidouro and those from other countries. Five haplotypes of the MT-CO1 gene were identified, with haplotypes 3 and 4 exclusive to ENC-SOL, and haplotypes 1, 2, and 3 were shared between humans and water rats. Haplotype 1 was also shared with other Brazilian localities, South American countries and a single locality in West Africa. The remaining haplotypes were exclusive to Sumidouro, indicating local genetic diversity. Population structure analysis revealed no genetic differentiation associated with host species but rather geographical structuring, probably due to the sedentary habits of rodents and the limited movement of humans between localities. This finding indicates that S. mansoni populations with different chronotypes are not genetically isolated and that significant gene flow occurs between them.",
    "Conclusions": "In conclusion, our findings confirm that wild rodents contribute to the maintenance of the S. mansoni life cycle in Sumidouro and can serve as indicators of local transmission hotspots."
