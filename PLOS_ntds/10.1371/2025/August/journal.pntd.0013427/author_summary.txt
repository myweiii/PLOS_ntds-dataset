Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira bacterium, primarily affecting individuals in warmer climates. The World Health Organization estimates over a million cases and nearly 59,000 deaths annually worldwide. Individuals typically contract the disease through contact with urine from infected animals or urine-contaminated water, soil, or food. Symptoms can resemble other illnesses, complicating diagnosis, and while many cases are mild, 10–15% can lead to severe, life-threatening conditions.
This manuscript describes trends in leptospirosis cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2014 to 2020, following its reinstatement as a nationally notifiable disease. The findings indicate an increase in reported cases and a high percentage of cases requiring hospitalization and dying. Most cases were reported in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, with males aged 40–69 years being the most affected demographic. The study highlights a shift in risk factors, with recreational and avocational exposures becoming more common than occupational ones.
The report emphasizes the need for improved surveillance and public health interventions, particularly considering climate change projections of increased flooding and warmer temperatures, which may exacerbate the spread of leptospirosis. Enhanced awareness among healthcare providers and the public is crucial for early detection and treatment.
