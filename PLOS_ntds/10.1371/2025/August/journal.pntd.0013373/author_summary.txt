Vector control strategies are usually based on hierarchical systems, resulting in the limited capacity to adapt to particular epidemiological scenarios or adjust to routine stressors. In Arequipa, Peru, despite successful control of the insects that transmit Chagas disease, challenges to sustain vector surveillance and control activities are numerous. We examined the barriers to sustained vector control by conducting in-depth interviews and focus groups with multiple stakeholders at different levels of the system. We identified significant barriers at each step of the passive and active surveillance processes, resulting in limited potential to respond to infestations and loss of information. At the individual level, barriers to reporting infestation included difficulties in capturing the vector and uncertainty about where or to whom to report it. At the operational level, we identified barriers regarding the quality and consistency of house inspections, as well as competing priorities, such as multiple tasks assigned to vector control specialists. At the system level, the use of an inadequate Health Information System (HIS) with no structure to record relevant information related to vector control activities. At the policy level, establishment of quotas on the number of houses to inspect without considering appropriate sampling. Development of resilient health systems is a collective endeavor involving affected communities, health staff and actors from multiple sectors. It is urgent to review strategies to better design resilient control systems for vector-borne diseases.
