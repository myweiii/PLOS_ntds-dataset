North Carolina has one of the highest rates of tick-borne diseases in the U.S, including spotted fever rickettsiosis (SFR) and ehrlichiosis. Understanding where cases of these diseases cluster across the state can improve disease prevention and resource allocation. This study analyzed thousands of SFR and ehrlichiosis cases reported in NC from 2010 to 2019, examining patterns of disease incidence and severity.
Ehrlichiosis clustered primarily in north-central NC and coastal Tidewater areas throughout the decade. SFR incidence was high and increased across the state over the study period, with even greater numbers of clusters in similar areas (north-central, Tidewater). Severe ehrlichiosis clusters overlapped with high-incidence areas, whereas severe SFR cases were more widely distributed.
Severe SFR was linked to known tick attachment and delayed treatment. Severe ehrlichiosis was not associated with exposure awareness, however, longer treatment delays for ehrlichiosis were associated with lower severity. This unexpected finding is possibly due to testing and treatment patterns unique to ehrlichiosis, which is less well-known than SFR.
These results highlight the need for targeted public health efforts in north-central NC and parts of the Tidewater region. Exposure awareness efforts should continue, emphasizing outdoor activities and the importance of checking for attached ticks.
