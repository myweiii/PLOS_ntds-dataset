Onchocerciasis (River blindness) is a neglected tropical disease targeted by the World Health Organization for elimination of transmission in 12 endemic countries by 2030. There is a need for field-friendly, acceptable and affordable tools to monitor progress towards elimination. In Ghana, the SD BIOLINE Ov16 rapid diagnostic test (Ov16 RDT) has been used in several epidemiological surveys, but its usability, acceptability, and cost have not been assessed. We studied 6 endemic communities with persistent infection after nearly three decades of ivermectin treatment. The proportion of seropositivity by Ov16 RDT was twice the positivity of skin-snip microscopy positivity and four times the positivity of nodule-palpation positivity. The Ov 16 RDT was acceptable to both study participants and technicians because it was less painful and invasive, and yielded results more quickly. The cost of skin-snip microscopy would be thrice that of Ov16 RDT when testing 400 individuals. Ov16 RDT is more acceptable and less costly than skin-snipping for surveillance activities in transmission hotspots in Ghana.
