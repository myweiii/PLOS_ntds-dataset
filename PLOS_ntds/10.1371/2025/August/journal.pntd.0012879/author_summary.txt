Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that impacts hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Patients with Schistosoma haematobium shed parasite eggs in their urine, which can be used as a diagnostic marker of disease. However, identification of those eggs in patient samples normally requires a microscope and trained microscopist. In this work, we show that machine learning models trained on two imaging contrasts, brightfield and darkfield, can improve performance of automated schistosomiasis diagnosis. Using a mobile phone-based microscope (the SchistoScope), we captured brightfield and darkfield images of patient samples during two visits to Côte d’Ivoire and then trained models to detect eggs in the images. When training on images from one visit (n=349 patients) and testing on images from the other visit (n=375 patients), we found that the darkfield model and combinations of brightfield and darkfield outputs improved the diagnostic performance compared to brightfield alone. When evaluated at a threshold that led to a specificity of 96.5%, sensitivity for the brightfield models was 76%, while sensitivity for darkfield and for combined models was 81%, meeting the WHO’s target metrics for monitoring and evaluation of schistosomiasis control programs. This use of multi-contrast machine learning with a mobile microscope has the potential to improve diagnostic testing for schistosomiasis and could be extended to other neglected tropical diseases.
