The most medically important snake species in West Africa, Echis ocellatus, was recently taxonomically partitioned into E. ocellatus sensu stricto and E. romani, yet the differences in toxin activities between the venoms and their neutralisation by existing antivenoms remain to be determined. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed several antivenoms were raised against E. romani venom rather than E. ocellatus s. str venom, and the toxin activities differ between the venoms of these two species. Our data shows that whilst all three tested antivenoms recognised and bound to both E. ocellatus s. str. and E. romani venoms, there were neutralising differences between the antivenoms in different in vitro functional assays, and murine preclinical efficacy assays. These findings provide preclinical evidence and highlight potential differences in the efficacy of three antivenoms in neutralising the preclinical lethal effects of medically important E. ocellatus s. str. and E. romani venoms. Clinical evidence is required to confirm these findings, but this work suggests that all three antivenoms may be effective against both species despite their recent taxonomic reclassification.
