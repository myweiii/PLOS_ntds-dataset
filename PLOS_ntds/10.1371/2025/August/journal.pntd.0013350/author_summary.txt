Rabies remains endemic in Kenya due to low vaccination coverage and limited public awareness. A mass dog rabies vaccination campaign was implemented in Machakos County between 2021 and 2024, but coverage has remained sub-optimal. To help increase vaccine uptake, we co-created vaccination announcement posters and educational materials with community members. We began by conducting key informant interviews and focus group discussions with dog owners to understand the value they place on their dogs. These insights then informed co-creation workshops where the materials were developed collaboratively. Our findings highlight that dogs serve both tangible and intangible roles in the community. Tangible roles included protecting homes, livestock, and crops, while companionship was identified as the most important intangible role. Notably, participants viewed friendship as a prerequisite for dogs to provide meaningful service. The co-creation process allowed community members to reflect on the value of dogs, improved awareness of rabies, and increased motivation to vaccinate. We recommend incorporating co-creation approaches into public health interventions, as they build trust, enhance awareness, and support community engagementâ€”factors critical to the sustainability of One Health initiatives.
