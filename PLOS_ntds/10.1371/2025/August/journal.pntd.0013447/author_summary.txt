Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile fever, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, historically confined to tropical regions, are now emerging in the Mediterranean basin. Identifying where and when these diseases pose the greatest transmission risk is essential for effective public health planning. We addressed this challenge using a One Health approach that integrates multiple ecological factors: mosquito species distribution, bird community dynamics that influence virus circulation, and temporal patterns of imported human disease cases. Our analysis revealed that West Nile virus transmission risk is not uniformly distributed across the landscape. Instead, risk concentrates in natural and rural environments such as wetlands and rice fields, where mosquitoes and bird communities overlap. For dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, we identified peak transmission risk in late summer, when tourists return from endemic countries infected with these viruses. These findings have important implications for disease prevention because they demonstrate how ecological data can inform targeted public health interventions.
