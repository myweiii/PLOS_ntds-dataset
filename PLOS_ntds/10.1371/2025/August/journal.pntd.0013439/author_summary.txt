The Arabian saw-scaled viper (Echis coloratus) is a venomous snake of high medical relevance found in the Middle East and North Africa. However, the compositional and functional properties of its venom remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated both the composition and effects of this speciesâ€™ venom by combining protein analysis with biological assays that measure venom activity. We identified approximately 200 venom-related proteins across 17 different families, with two families accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total venom. We observed strong activity from enzymatic compounds typically associated with disruption of the blood system and tissue damage. Interestingly, effects on blood clotting factors and red blood cells were very weak. We also saw that, at high concentrations, the venom could kill a high percentage of mammalian cells in culture. Our findings provide a clearer picture of the complexity and potency of Arabian saw-scaled viper venom, which may help to improve medical treatment for people affected by bites from this species.
