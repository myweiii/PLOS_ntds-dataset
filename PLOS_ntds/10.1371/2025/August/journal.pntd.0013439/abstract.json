    "Abstract": "The Arabian saw-scaled viper (Echis coloratus) is among the snakes of highest medical relevance in the Middle East and North Africa. However, to date, its venom has been investigated in a very limited number of studies, and much remains unknown regarding its compositional and functional properties. By integrating proteotranscriptomics with bioactivity profiling, we present a comprehensive transcriptome-level catalogue of E. coloratus venom components and their associated biological activities. Our analysis identified 183 venom components belonging to 17 distinct protein families. Relative toxin abundances revealed that 92% of the venom proteome is composed of C-type lectin and C-type lectin-related protein (CTL), L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), snake venom serine protease (SVSP), and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP), with CTL and PLA2 alone accounting for 73% of the total composition. Bioassays targeting key aspects of viperid envenomation demonstrated potent protease and PLA2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, Factor Xa-like, plasmin-like, and haemolytic activities were negligible. Marked cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentration tested (i.e., 25 Î¼g/ml) in the mammalian cell lines MDCK II and Calu-3, whereas cytotoxic effects were minimal at lower concentrations. These findings highlight the complexity and potency of E. coloratus venom, and provide a valuable foundation for improving our understanding of envenomation caused by this species."
