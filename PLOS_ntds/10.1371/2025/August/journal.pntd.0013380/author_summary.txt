Strongyloidiasis, a parasitic disease transmitted percutaneously from soil, mainly affects the small intestine. Diagnostic delays may worsen prognosis because the disease can become severe in immunosuppressed hosts, resulting in disseminated strongyloidiasis or hyperinfection. However, few studies have investigated the diagnostic delay associated with strongyloidiasis. This study examined the relationship between diagnostic delay and strongyloidiasis prognosis as well as factors associated with diagnostic delay at a single general hospital in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Fifty-five inpatients with strongyloidiasis were included from 2013 to 2023.
Patients with strongyloidiasis diagnosed in ≥30 days showed more frequent in-hospital deaths (55.6% versus [vs.] 19.6%, P = 0.037), more frequent sepsis, and longer hospital stays with the characteristics of older age (median age: 86.5), anemia, and normal eosinophil counts compared with those diagnosed in <30 days. Patients without eosinophilia were older than those with eosinophilia (76 vs. 84.5 years, P = 0.005). Strongyloidiasis should be considered in older individuals from endemic areas even if blood eosinophil counts are normal. In Japan, patients born before 1960 are screened for strongyloidiasis.
