The worms from the genus Trichostrongylus are ubiquitous in distribution and are of high relevance to food animal production and human health due to their zoonotic potential. Rapid emergence and spread of anthelmintic resistance genes in farm animals have markedly compromised the efficacy of existing anthelmintic drugs, a mainstay of parasite control strategies in food animal production. Breeding for resistance to worms represents a cost-effective strategy to mitigate parasitic diseases. However, molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain largely unknown. Here we took advantage of unique sheep populations bred for resistance and susceptibility. We identified 319 genes with significant differences in abundance between the two phenotypes as well as many correlated gene pairs unique to resistance or susceptibility. We uncovered multiple clusters of genes that were significantly correlated with parasitological traits. Our findings provided insights into the regulatory control of host resistance. Sheep farmers will benefit from this study by having biomarkers indicative of resistance for selective breeding.
