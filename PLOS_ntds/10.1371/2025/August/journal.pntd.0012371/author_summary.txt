This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms.
Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets.
Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.
