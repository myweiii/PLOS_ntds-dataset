This work is dedicated to the memory of Professor emeritus Dr. Günter Willuhn (1934 – 2023), formerly University of Düsseldorf, Germany, who dedicated a major part of his scientific life to research on the genus Arnica, its chemical constituents and pharmacological activity. We are sure he would be delighted to see his favorite medicinal plant help to cure such a serious disease.
