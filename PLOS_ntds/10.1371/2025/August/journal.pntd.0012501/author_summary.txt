Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Surveillance systems are crucial for dengue prevention and control. Unfortunately, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, nowcasting methods are needed to estimate underreported cases, enabling more timely decision-making. This study evaluates how Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords can complement official dengue data to improve nowcasting of dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare the performance of various nowcasting approaches that incorporate Google Trends data with other approaches that rely solely on official reported cases data, assessing their accuracy and uncertainty in nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March 2024 to January 2025 across Brazilian states. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts offering valuable insights into dengue activity levels. The study demonstrates the potential of digital data sources in enhancing traditional surveillance systems for better-informed decision-making.
