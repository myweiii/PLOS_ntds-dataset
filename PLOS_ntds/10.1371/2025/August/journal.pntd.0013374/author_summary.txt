The study of leprosy in human remains from archaeological sites has the potential to improve our understanding of the disease in the present day. Our review presents a summary of bone changes caused by leprosy in ancient skeletons, based on studies conducted mainly in the region of modern-day Europe. We found that changes to the skull corresponding to a severe form of leprosy were very common, affecting 4 out of 5 skeletons, irrespective of whether the skeleton was excavated from a leprosarium (leprosy hospital) or from a public cemetery or other burial site. The relatively small numbers of remains excavated over a wide geographical area and a long time period, and the focus of archaeological studies on skeletons already identified as having leprosy, mean that it is difficult to prove or disprove theories that aim to explain the decline and eventual disappearance of leprosy as a disease in Europe. Newer techniques such as those that test for genetic evidence of the bacteria that causes leprosy or that look at microscopic bone changes have the potential to provide information about how the disease progresses in people affected by leprosy in countries where it still occurs today and about how leprosy is transmitted from infected animals to the human population and the role of this ‘zoonotic’ transmission of the disease in sustaining leprosy as a major public health problem in countries such as Brazil.
