Balantioides coli, a zoonotic ciliate protozoan, poses significant challenges in molecular epidemiology due to limitations of conventional subtyping methods targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. In this study, we developed a nested PCR assay focusing on the β-tubulin gene, validated across 56 fecal samples from pigs, cattle, sheep, and guinea pigs. The assay demonstrated 100% detection efficiency and superior specificity compared to ITS-based approaches. Phylogenetic analysis delineated three β-tubulin genotypes: genotype III exhibited strict guinea pig host specificity, while genotypes I and II displayed cross-species transmission potential among pigs, cattle, and sheep. High genetic diversity and frequent recombination events underscored evolutionary adaptability. Non-synonymous mutations in genotype III correlated with reduced trophozoite motility, suggesting host-specific adaptation. This β-tubulin-based method overcomes ITS multicopy heterogeneity, enabling precise resolution of transmission clusters and host specificity patterns. Our findings advance surveillance strategies for B. coli in veterinary and public health frameworks, highlighting the utility of functional gene markers in combating neglected zoonotic pathogens.
