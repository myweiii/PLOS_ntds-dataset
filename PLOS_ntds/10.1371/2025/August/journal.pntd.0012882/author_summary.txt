Trypanosome parasites are transmitted by infected tsetse flies and cause the neglected tropical disease human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and the similar African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), which is one of the largest impediments to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. Taurine (Bos taurus) and indicine (Bos indicus) cattle shared a common ancestor more than 150,000 years ago, and in the intervening period significant genomic differences have evolved between the two groups. Importantly, several African B. taurus populations have evolved an adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites. Trypanotolerant African taurine and trypanosusceptible indicine cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern of the number of trypanosome parasites in the blood. Transcriptional profiling of these tissues highlighted genes related to the multiple facets of the immune system; notably, for peripheral blood, differences observed for genes relating to coagulation and iron homeostasis support the existing hypothesis that control of both parasite number and anaemia is an important feature of the trypanotolerance trait and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
