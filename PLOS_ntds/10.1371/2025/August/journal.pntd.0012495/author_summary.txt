Onchocerciasis is a disease that affects humans and is transmitted by bites of Onchocerca volvulus infected black flies. Nigeria accounts for the highest onchocercal blindness in sub-Saharan Africa. Collaborative effort by various stakeholders in Kaduna State, Nigeria yielded remarkable achievement of successful interruption of onchocerciasis transmission in year 2018 through annual mass administration of medicine (MAM). However, our study established the ongoing transmission of onchocerciasis in some areas of Kaduna State five years after a stop-MAM decision. Kaduna State Government, partners and stakeholders should urgently take actions to mitigate the ongoing transmission of onchocerciasis in the State to safeguard the achievements attained after years of MAM. We recommend the following; assessment of entire Kaduna State to determine the extent of the spread of the recrudescence; in-depth analysis of annual therapeutic coverage rates; community-driven slash and clear approach for vector control; review of the monitoring and evaluation system across all levels; using Esperanza Window Trap at black flies breeding sites to complement the slash and clear approach; modelling the approaches to determine the most appropriate frequency of treatment with ivermectin.
