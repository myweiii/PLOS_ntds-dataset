This systematic scoping review addresses the critical public health concern of antimicrobial resistance in Ethiopia, specifically focusing on the emergence of XDR and PDR bacteria, including Pre-XDR and XDR-TB. The review, adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, synthesized findings from 25 studies published between 2010 and 2025. Results indicate that among 5620 bacterial isolates, 22.9% were XDR and 9.1% were PDR. Klebsiella species, E. coli, Acinetobacter species, and P. aeruginosa were the most common XDR and PDR bacteria identified. Additionally, pre-XDR-TB was found in 3.4% and XDR-TB in 1.5% of TB confirmed cases. Inappropriate antibiotic use, inadequate sanitation, and agricultural antibiotic use are key contributing factors. The emergence of these highly resistant strains poses a significant threat, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in Ethiopia. The authors highlight the urgent need for national surveillance, genomic detection of resistance mechanisms, and strengthened antimicrobial stewardship programs to combat this escalating crisis and inform future research and policy development.
