Leprosy is still a health concern in many countries, but how the bacteria that cause the disease are transmitted is not fully understood. We wanted to help fill this gap in knowledge. Through the Research to Stop Transmission of Neglected Tropical Diseases (R2STOP) fund, supported by two non-profit organizations, we provided funding to scientists around the world to study how leprosy spreads. We focused on several key areas, including human-to-human transmission, the role of animals and the environment, and how the bacteria interact with human hosts. After a careful selection process, six research projects were funded. These projects uncovered new insights into how leprosy continues to spread in places like the Comoros islands, possible involvement of soil and ticks, the presence of antibiotic resistance in India, and efforts to grow the bacteria in the laboratory. In addition to scientific discoveries, this program helped train 24 graduate students and resulted in 29 published studies. Our work highlights the importance of targeted funding to improve understanding of leprosy transmission, which is essential for developing better strategies to control and eventually stop the spread of this disease.
