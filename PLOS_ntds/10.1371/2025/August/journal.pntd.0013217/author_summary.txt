Mycetoma is a neglected, devastating disease that frequently affects populations in tropical and subtropical regions. This infectious disease can be caused by a wide range of fungi, causing eumycetoma and bacteria, causing actinomycetoma. Mycetoma can cause severe disability if not appropriately treated. Despite this substantial impact on patient health and community well-being, the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are still poorly understood. In this systematic review, we included 72 studies that cover 29,328 mycetoma cases, aiming to characterise the sociodemographic patterns, clinical features, and geographic distribution of the causative organisms. We found that mycetoma predominantly affects males residing in rural areas, especially farmers, and that the lower limb is the most affected body part. The outcome of these cases varied; some were cured, experienced recurrence or underwent amputation, which reflects the complexity of the disease treatment. We also observed that eumycetoma was reported more commonly in Africa, and actinomycetoma was more prevalent in India and Mexico. This systematic review provides a foundation for future research and contributes to a better understanding of the disease epidemiology.
