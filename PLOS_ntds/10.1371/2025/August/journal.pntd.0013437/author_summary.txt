We report the functional characterization of TsNas14, a zinc metalloprotease critical for Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) invasion. This secretory protein features an Astacin catalytic domain flanked by two ShK toxin-like domains, with high evolutionary conservation across Trichinella species. TsNas14 was highly expressed specifically during the adult stage, and this expression pattern was highly consistent with the intestinal invasion stage of the parasite. To clarify the biological function of TsNas14 during the host invasion process, we successfully achieved the recombinant expression of this protein and verified its enzymatic activity. Recombinant TsNas14 demonstrated potent proteolytic activity against intestinal tight junction proteins and disrupted intestinal barrier models, mechanistically explaining its role in breaching host defenses. Crucially, RNAi silencing of TsNas14 reduced larvae and adult worm burdens in vivo. In conclusion, this study has for the first time revealed the key role of TsNas14 in the pathogenic process of T. spiralis. This discovery not only expands the understanding of the mechanism of parasitic invasion but also provides a new molecular target for the vaccine development and targeted therapy of T. spiralis.
