Since the start of microcephaly epidemic in 2015, knowledge has accumulated regarding the spectrum of clinical manifestations resulting from congenital Zika virus infections and the frequency with which they occur. However, it remains unclear how much higher the risk of abnormalities is among children born to women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy when compared with children born to women who were not infected during pregnancy. We compared these two groups and found prenatal ZIKV exposure was associated with markedly increased risks of microcephaly (RR, 95%-CI: 3.61, 1.70 to 7.63, AR 72%), neurological abnormalities (RR, 95%-CI: 5.64, 3.04 to 10.47; AR 82%),), audiological deficits (RR, 95%-CI: 9.20, 2.59 to 32.69; AR 89%), and neuroimaging alterations (RR, 95%-CI: 22.06, 2.90 to 167.5; AR 95%). We found that at least 41% of cases of microcephaly, 67% of cases with neurological alterations and 65% of the cases with CNS imaging alterations among children born to exposed mothers may be attributed to the prenatal ZIKV infection. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of continuing the follow-up of these children to evaluate the long-term consequences of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and reinforce the need to rapidly develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent congenital ZIKV infections.
