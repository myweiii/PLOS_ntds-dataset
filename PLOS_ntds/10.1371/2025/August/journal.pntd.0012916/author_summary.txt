A study conducted in and around Debre Berhan, central Ethiopia, analyzed samples from poultry farms for Campylobacter spp. and their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The highest prevalence of Campylobacter was found in poultry cloacal swabs, followed by human stool and poultry house floor samples. Poor farm biosecurity and management practices were linked to the occurrence of Campylobacter in poultry, while human infections were associated with raw milk consumption and inadequate hygiene practices by farm workers on poultry farms. The study emphasizes the zoonotic risks of Campylobacter and the need for a One Health approach to address its spread. Campylobacter isolates showed high resistance to commonly used antimicrobials, with many classified as multidrug-resistant. Co-occurrence of C. jejuni in poultry, farm workers, and the environment, all with similar multidrug-resistant patterns, suggests possible transmission among them. These findings highlight the widespread antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter from poultry farms and the urgent need for responsible antibiotic use to limit the emergence of resistant strains. Given the serious implications of antimicrobial resistance, the zoonotic importance of Campylobacter, and the frequent human-animal-environment interactions in Ethiopia, it is crucial to implement a national plan for surveillance, prevention, and control, along with promoting rational antimicrobial use through a One Health approach.
