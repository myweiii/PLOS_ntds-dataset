Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a vector-borne zoonotic pathogen that poses substantial threat to animal and human health in Rwanda. Since its confirmation in the country in 2012, the virus has caused sporadic cases in livestock almost every year, and the first large outbreak occurred in 2018 with suspected human deaths. This study was carried out in rural areas of Eastern Rwanda, 3 years after the 2018 outbreak, to estimate the magnitude of human exposure to RVFV, as well as interview surveys to identify risk factors associated with infection. Understanding the seroprevalence of RVFV and its associated risk factors is essential for developing an effective disease control strategy. The study found an overall seroprevalence of 9.6% with exposure rates ranging between 6.8% and 12.9% across five different study districts. A history of slaughtering animals and milking were risk factors significantly associated with increased risk of RVFV infection in the region.
