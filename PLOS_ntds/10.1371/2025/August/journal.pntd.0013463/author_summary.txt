Brucellosis is a widespread disease that spreads from animals to humans, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming, such as Xinjiang, China. While previous studies have focused on the biological aspects of the disease, we still lack a clear understanding of how environmental factors, such as climate and vegetation, influence its spread. In this study, we used advanced statistical models to analyze how weather conditions and land cover affect brucellosis outbreaks over time and space. Our findings reveal that factors like temperature fluctuations and vegetation density have complex, nonlinear effects on disease transmissionâ€”initially increasing risk but eventually decreasing it under extreme conditions. By combining two modeling approaches, we were able to predict high-risk areas and identify critical time lags between weather changes and disease outbreaks. This work helps public health officials better anticipate and control brucellosis by understanding the environmental drivers behind its spread.
