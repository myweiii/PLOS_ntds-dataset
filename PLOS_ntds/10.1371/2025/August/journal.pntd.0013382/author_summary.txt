Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis transmitted between dogs and livestock, while humans are accidental dead-end hosts, becoming infected through ingestion of viable parasite eggs shed with the feces of infected dogs. Since hygiene measures aiming to prevent the ingestion of eggs by humans constitute the only human-targeted primary prevention activities, identifying the main routes of transmission in endemic areas could optimize targeted, pragmatic health education messages. CE is mainly described as a food/waterborne zoonosis or deriving from “contact with dogs”. However, evidence about parasite contamination of different materials is scarce and published data suggest that environmental contamination could be one of the main sources of infection for humans. We evaluated parasite contamination of different materials in two villages of Chile and Peru, comparing contamination of different materials in households with and without active CE cases diagnosed during an ultrasound-based population study. Materials collected in public areas were also analysed for contamination. We found that materials from public areas were more contaminated than those from households and there was no difference in risk of contamination according to materials. These results suggest the need for considering CE an environmental-borne infection with a “community risk” to which people are exposed.
