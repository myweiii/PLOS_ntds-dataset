The integration of genomic surveillance with spatial and temporal data offers a powerful approach to reconstruct viral transmission patterns across both geographic and temporal dimensions. Whole-genome sequencing is essential for elucidating the complex dynamics of viral evolution, genomic epidemiology, and the transmission pathways of emerging pathogens. Hantaan virus (HTNV) and the related genotypes classified under the species Orthohantavirus hantaense, primarily hosted by Apodemus species, are well-documented causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), posing a substantial global public health concern. Current evidence suggests that HTNV associated with A. chejuensis is the likely etiological agent responsible for HFRS cases on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea (ROK). This study conducted extensive HTNV surveillance, sampling 50 small mammals from five locations in Seogwipo-si and Jeju-si on Jeju Island between 2022 and 2023. Nine complete HTNV genomes were sequenced from lung tissues of A. chejuensis, constituting the first comprehensive genomic characterization of HTNV from Seogwipo-si (Hogeun-dong) and Jeju-si (Sangdae-ri). Phylodynamic analyses suggest evolutionary divergence and phylogeographic diversity, with four distinctive amino acid substitutions identified in HTNV genomes from Seogwipo-si. These findings contribute to our understanding of orthohantavirus genomic diversity and evolutionary dynamics, providing useful insights to inform public health strategies aimed at controlling HFRS outbreaks in the ROK.
