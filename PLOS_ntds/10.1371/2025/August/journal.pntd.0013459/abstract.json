    "Background": "Hantaan virus (HTNV), hosted by Apodemus spp., is a well-recognized causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and poses a crucial global public health concern. Based on the current evidence, HTNV carried by A. chejuensis is proposed as the likely etiological agent of HFRS on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea (ROK).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In this study, 50 small mammals were collected from five locations in Seogwipo-si and Jeju-si on Jeju Island, ROK, during 2022â€“2023. Serological and molecular analyses revealed HTNV prevalence rates of 34% (16/47) and 27.7% (13/47), respectively. Using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based nanopore sequencing approach, nine complete HTNV genomes were sequenced from the lung tissues of A. chejuensis, representing the first comprehensive genomic characterization of HTNV from Seogwipo-si (Hogeun-dong) and Jeju-si (Sangdae-ri). Phylodynamic analyses suggest evolutionary divergence and phylogeographic diversity, with four unique amino acid substitutions identified in HTNV genomes from Seogwipo-si.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "This study provides important insights into the genomic surveillance, genetic diversity, and evolutionary dynamics of orthohantaviruses, which are essential for guiding effective public health strategies to control and prevent future HFRS outbreaks in the ROK."
