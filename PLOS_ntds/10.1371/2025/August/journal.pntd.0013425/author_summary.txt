The geographical distribution of the Schistosoma spp. is determined by the habitat of the snail intermediate host, specific for each species. Authors present a case of Schistosoma japonicum diagnosed in Ethiopia, in a patient with no history of travel out of the country, living in an S. mansoni endemic area that, from more than 10 years, receives regularly population from China. The finding implies the presence of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate snail for S. japonicum, not noticed in Africa. The fact that this snail is amphibious, can survive for long periods, tolerates a wide range of temperature and keeps long time its ability for transmitting schistosomiasis after being carried to non-permissive areas would support the hypothesis that this finding might not be an isolated case, and that transmission of S. japonicum could be going unnoticed, in the context of a continuous migratory movement of Chinese population to the African continent. Awareness on that possibility will avoid adding challenges for schistosomiasis control programs in endemic African countries that receive migrants from S. japonicum prevalent areas.
