India has targeted the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) by 2027, three years ahead of the global goal. To accelerate LF elimination, India introduced strategies of triple-drug regimen during mass drug administration (IDA-MDA) and Mission Mode MDA at the block level. IDA is more efficacious in clearing microfilaria (Mf) with fewer effective (coverage ≥65% among total population) MDA rounds (2–3) has been implemented in 63 districts as of December 2023 in India. A total of 138 districts have stopped MDA after clearing the first Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) or IDA Impact Surveys (IIS), and seven others have qualified for TAS/IIS following the detection of less than 1% Mf prevalence during pre-TAS/Epidemiological Monitoring Surveys (EMS). Here we report the findings from an EMS conducted in two health blocks to make decisions on stopping or continuing IDA-MDA. Both health blocks failed to qualify for the EMS, necessitating the continuation of MDA. The evidence generated will help the national programme to make decisions on continuing MDA in health blocks. Further, it will help to efficiently plan strategies that address the challenges faced during MDA to ensure effective coverage in areas at the highest risk of failing pre-TAS/ EMS.
