Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is a rare but potentially fatal disease that is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The symptoms can progress quickly from fever, headaches and neurological dysfunction to neuropathy, coma, and death. Within Australia, MVEV is considered a condition of urgent public health priority, with most State Health Departments managing mosquito surveillance programs to provide an early warning system to detect Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and other mosquito-borne viruses of public health significance and deploy integrated mosquito management principles to control mosquito populations and protect public health.
This study documents the impact of the environmental and climatic conditions that led to the first outbreak of MVEV disease in Victoria in 50 years. Sudden and significant rainfall along the Murray River, led to flooding along the Victorian/New South Wales border aligning with the development of mosquito populations in the peak summer months creating the “perfect swarm” for disease amplification, transmission and ‘spill-over’ into human populations. Confirmation of the G1A MVEV lineage, previously recorded in northwest Australia, although sharing a common ancestry with early Victorian isolates, suggests migratory waterbirds as the vehicle for movement of MVEV from endemic to non-endemic regions of Australia.
