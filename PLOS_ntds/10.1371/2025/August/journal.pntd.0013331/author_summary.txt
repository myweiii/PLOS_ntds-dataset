Trichinella spiralis is a parasitic disease that affects both humans and animals. Probiotics, beneficial bacteria that support gut health and immune function, have emerged as promising alternative or complementary therapies. In this study, we investigated the protective and therapeutic effects of two novel probiotic strains, Lactobacillus brevis PQ214320 and Bacillus subtilis PQ198038, in mice infected with T. spiralis. Mice receiving L. brevis PQ214320 before and after infection showed the most significant reductions in parasite burden and improvements in immune responses, particularly through enhanced Th1 immunity (elevated IL 12 and IFN-Î³) and stronger adaptive responses (higher IgG levels). Histopathological observations revealed that both probiotics alleviated intestinal and muscular damage caused by the parasite and helped restore the integrity of tissue barriers. However, L. brevis PQ214320 demonstrated protective effects compared to B. subtilis PQ198038. Our findings suggest that probiotics, especially L. brevis PQ214320, may serve as effective adjunct therapies for Trichinella infection by modulating the immune response and reducing parasite load. These results provide new insights into probiotic-based interventions for parasitic infections, offering potential benefits for both human and veterinary medicine.
