Preventing vector-borne diseases, such as American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) and Chagas disease (CD), requires understanding why some households adopt protective measures while others do not. In this study, we surveyed 204 households across 12 rural communities in Coclé Province, Republic of Panama, to explore how factors like wealth, disease knowledge, people’s feelings towards insects, and perception of their health outcomes influence preventive behaviors for disease vectors. Our findings suggest that individuals more sensitive to insect presence are more likely to use protective measures like repellents, while those with a stronger sense of control over their health may be less inclined to take precautions to touch a CD vector. Additionally, households with a greater number of consumer goods and appliances are more likely to implement structural barriers in their houses to prevent contact with disease vectors, whereas a history of ACL cases in the household is linked to peridomestic environmental conditions that could influence insect presence. These results highlight the complex relationship between individuals’ feelings, perceptions, household conditions, and vector-borne disease prevention behaviors. Disease control strategies that consider local knowledge, cultural values, and more comprehensive household contexts can improve vector control efforts and reduce the burden of vector-borne diseases.
