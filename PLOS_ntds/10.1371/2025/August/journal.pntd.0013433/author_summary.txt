Fascioliasis is a highly pathogenic parasitic disease caused by liver flukes and transmitted by freshwater snails from animals to humans. Despite the presaged global warmingâ€™s impact on its transmission, only a few studies have tried to verify it. This might be because assessing this impact is extremely challenging, as this disease presents a worldwide distribution. In the Americas, the disease is widespread throughout the continent, except in its southernmost extremity in the Patagonia region, which was believed to be due to the too low temperatures. Though, recent reports indicate that the disease is spreading into more southern latitudes. We analyzed the long-term evolution of climate factors to assess if their impact might have been the cause of the southward expansion of fascioliasis in this extreme South American region. Our detailed analyses demonstrated a remarkable climatic change in the Patagonia region and allowed to clarify the southern spread of the disease. This is the first study linking the consequences of a changing climate with the spread of fascioliasis to extreme latitudes, warning about how the distribution and transmission of snail-borne diseases may be modified due to influences of climate change in other world regions in the immediate future.
