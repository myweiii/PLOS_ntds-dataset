Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC) is still a tough consequence of a parasitic infection from T. cruzi and may present with a high incidence of cardiovascular events in a portion of infected patients. Mortality may be secondary to a pleomorphic cardiovascular presentation, varying from ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, or even thromboembolic events, such as stroke. However, identifying who will be these patients at high risk is still a challenge. There is a non-invasive tool from a very available cardiac examination, the echocardiography, named Speckle Tracking, measuring myocardial deformation (strain) with one variable named global longitudinal strain (GLS). This variable is a predictor of myocardial fibrosis and related to prognosis in several cardiac conditions. However, the prognostic value of Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) in CCC is not well established.
In this prospective analysis of CCC, patients were separated into tertiles of GLS in groups: (1) GLS ≤ -18.4%, (2) GLS > -18.4% and <-13.8%, and (3) GLS ≥ -13.8%. We studied the primary outcome as a composite of death, hospitalization, sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT), new heart failure, and embolic events. GLS was an independent predictor of outcomes adjusted for age, gender, and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with CCC.
