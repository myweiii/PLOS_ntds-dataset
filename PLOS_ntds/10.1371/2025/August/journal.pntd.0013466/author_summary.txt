JEV is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis, the most prevalent viral encephalitis in Asia. Emerging evidence indicates that JEV infection can also lead to PNI, highlighting its broader neurotropic potential. We aimed to investigate whether the increased incidence of JEV-associated PNI is attributed to the epidemiological shift of JEV GI as the dominant genotype or is specifically linked to the pathogenic characteristics of the NX1889 strain. Furthermore, we investigated the potential role of the interaction between JEV and SCs in the pathogenesis of JEV-associated PNI. We elucidated this by a comparative study regarding the PNS-specific impacts of JEVs with respect to viral susceptibility, virulence, and the antiviral inflammatory response using in vivo and in vitro model systems. Our findings revealed that, JEVs exhibited distinct capacities to induce PNI, with the observed variations primarily attributed to the strain-specific characteristics of NX1889 rather than the genotype-specific features of JEV GI. In addition to its well-established central nervous system (CNS) tropism, the PNS was also a vital site for JEV NX1889 replication, and the direct invasion of SCs by JEV NX1889 contributes to peripheral demyelination pathology.
