Trachoma is a contagious infection of the eye and the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The neglected tropical disease road map 2021â€“2030, set its new target for global elimination of trachoma from 2020 to 2030. Despite significant progress in fighting trachoma in Kenya, challenges persist, evident in the prevalence of the disease among nomadic communities and the Maasai cattle corridors. These communities engage in frequent migration, which poses unique obstacles for disease control due to the need to optimize scarce resources, especially pasture and water. MDA has been widely applied to eliminate or interrupt the transmission of trachoma in endemic regions without requiring individual diagnosis. It is safe, effective and inexpensive. This qualitative study aimed at assessing contextual, social and environmental barriers to participation and access to MDA for trachoma elimination.
