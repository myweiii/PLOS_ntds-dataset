Snakebite envenomation caused by Bothrops atrox is a significant health issue in the Amazon region, where access to healthcare is often limited. Antivenom therapy is effective in neutralizing systemic venom effects and may also help reduce local damage, such as pain, swelling, and muscle injury. However, local symptoms often persist, and accessible, low-cost adjunctive therapies could play a complementary role in improving patient care. In this study, we evaluated whether cold and hot compresses, when used alongside antivenom therapy, could further reduce local effects of envenomation. We conducted a clinical trial in the Brazilian Amazon involving 94 patients who received antivenom therapy and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: cold therapy, hot therapy, or control (antivenom therapy alone). While cold compresses helped reduce pain during the first 24 hours, neither cold nor hot compresses had a significant impact on swelling and muscle damage. These findings suggest that cold therapy offer early pain relief. This study highlights the need for further research on supportive care for snakebite patients.
