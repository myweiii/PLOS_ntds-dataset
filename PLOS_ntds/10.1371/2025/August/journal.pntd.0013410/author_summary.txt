Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease that humans can get by breathing tiny spores from soil or animal droppings. The fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, grows in nutrient-rich environments and is often linked to bats and birds. However, little is known about how it persists in wildlife in Ecuador. In this study, we collected tissue samples from small wild mammals across Ecuadorâ€™s Coast, Andes, and Amazon regions. Using DNA-based methods, we detected Histoplasma in several species, with most positive animals being bats, followed by rodents and opossums. We also analyzed environmental conditions and identified regions of Ecuador where the fungus is most likely to survive. Our findings show that Histoplasma is widespread in different mammal species and ecosystems, which highlights the importance of wildlife monitoring to better understand where this fungus lives and to reduce the risk of disease in people living in endemic areas.
