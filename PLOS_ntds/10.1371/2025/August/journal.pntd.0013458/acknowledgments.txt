We are grateful to the patients who agreed for their pictures to be used. We also want to thank the clinicians for participating in this photograph-based CL classification and providing their justification. We also acknowledge dr. Seid Getahun who was the PI of the original study in Boru Meda for facilitating collection of the patient data.
