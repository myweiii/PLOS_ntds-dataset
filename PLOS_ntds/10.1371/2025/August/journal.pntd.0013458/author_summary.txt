Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) appears in different forms and is commonly classified into three major forms called localized CL, muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL)and diffuse CL (DCL). The decision how to treat and the expected treatment outcomes are also thought to vary depending on the type of lesion. We found out that health care providers have conflicting approaches in categorizing CL lesions into these different subgroups. We showed this difference systematically by asking experts to classify pictures taken from Ethiopian CL patients selected purposefully because of potential classification issues. Experts could not agree on classification of a single patient, with maximum agreement of 80% (10/13) for ten of the 26 cases. As consistent classification helps for comparison and experience-sharing between different CL endemic regions, and therefore healthcare providers need to be trained to harmonize the care practices. Rather than producing more complicated classification systems, such systems are ideally simple, easily applicable by clinicians and linked to clinical decision-making.
