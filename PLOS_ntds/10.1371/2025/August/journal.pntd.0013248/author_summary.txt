Talaromycosis is an invasive fungal disease endemic in Southeast Asia, and has emerged as a leading opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV disease and other immunocompromising conditions. The current diagnosis relying on isolation of Talaromyces marneffei in culture is insensitive, takes a median of five days to result, and often requires invasive sampling. Antigen-detection tests have the potential to improve outcomes from talaromycosis by reducing the time-to-diagnosis, but their clinical utility is limited by a lack of commercial options. We previously developed an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) which detects the Mp1p antigen of T. marneffei in minimally-invasive clinical specimens like urine and plasma. Our Mp1p EIA demonstrates higher sensitivity than blood culture, and has been developed as a commercial platform. In this study, we evaluated the comparative diagnostic performance of the commercial Wantai Mp1p EIA (Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) and our in-house Mp1p EIA in 424 individuals with advanced HIV disease, including 224 cases of culture-proven talaromycosis and 200 randomly-selected controls without clinical and culture evidence of talaromycosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the Wantai and in-house Mp1p EIA were comparable in plasma (sensitivity: 95% vs 92%, specificity: 96% vs 93%), urine (sensitivity: 92% vs 87%, specificity: 95% vs 97%), and combined testing of plasma and urine (sensitivity: 96% vs 96%, specificity: 94% vs 93%). Both the Wantai and in-house Mp1p EIAs provided substantially higher sensitivity than blood culture detection (96% and 96% vs 79%, respectively). The Wantai Mp1p EIA offers a standardized commercially-available tool for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis.
