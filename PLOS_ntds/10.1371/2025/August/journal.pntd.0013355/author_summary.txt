This study investigates the perceptions of cattle owners concerning the risk of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) transmission through the consumption of raw milk. Bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium Bovis, is a zoonotic disease that poses a serious risk to the health of cattle and humans. Despite the known dangers, the consumption of raw milk remains a common practice in Ethiopia.
Through a series of structured interviews and surveys, we explored cattle ownersâ€™ awareness and attitudes toward BTB and their milk consumption habits. The findings reveal gaps in awareness about the disease and its spread. Many cattle farmers are unaware that drinking raw milk can lead to BTB infection in humans. Furthermore, despite the risks, gender and marital status were significantly associated with raw milk consumption.
The study highlights the need for comprehensive, targeted education programs to increase awareness of BTB and promote safer milk consumption habits. By addressing these knowledge gaps, we can reduce the incidence of bovine TB transmission from cattle to humans and improve public health outcomes in affected communities.
