Historically, several arboviruses have been identified in South Africa, however, some of this surveillance was performed more than 40 years ago. In this study mosquito populations from a major metropolitan area, eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal Province were screened for arboviruses from the families Togaviridae, Phenuiviridae and Peribunyaviridae. Wild caught mosquitoes were collected from seven sites, between October 202 and July 2021, throughout the metropole and a subset (1831) were screened using in-house nucleic acid amplification assays and primers targeting conserved genes for each viral genus. Arboviral RNA was detected from 15/261 mosquito pools and amplicons sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION. The positive samples included a Sindbis virus isolate, three isolates of Witwatersrand virus, and 11 isolates of Bunyamwera virus. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequence data suggested that none were newly introduced but closely related to isolates previously detected in the country. The results highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to monitor arbovirus circulation. In addition, we report the presence of Wyeomyia mitchellii, a New World species, as an introduced species in South Africa. Identification of circulating viruses and raising the awareness of the presence of these viruses is important for early detection and determining the public health significance.
