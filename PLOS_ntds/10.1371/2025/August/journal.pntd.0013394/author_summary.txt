Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease of global concern caused by a wide range of human enteroviruses (EVs). In recent years, the predominant serotypes of HFMD have been continuously changing, but only the EV-A71 vaccine for HFMD has been approved in China. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 513,143 reported HFMD cases. Additionally, we collected 432 serum samples from healthy individuals to assess antibodies against coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10), coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). We identified the genotypes of the main serotypes through VP-1 sequencing. Other EVs, primarily represented by CV-A6, have become the primary pathogens of HFMD in Guizhou Province since 2019. The seroprevalence rates of CV-A6, CV-A10, CV-A16, and EV-A71 were relatively high among healthy individuals, and more than 70% of individuals had neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) against at least two serotypes of these enteroviruses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop multivalent vaccines for other EVs, which could effectively target the primary pathogens associated with HFMD. Furthermore, it is essential to comprehend the epidemiology and antibody characteristics of the main serotypes associate with HFMD in order to formulate national vaccination policies for the future.
