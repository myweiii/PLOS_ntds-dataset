Worm infections, like soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH), continue to affect people of all ages in Rwanda. Despite efforts to control these infections through regular treatment programs, more up-to-date information on how common they are and what increases the risk of getting them is needed to improve control measures. This study examined the current situation across people aged 1 year and above in Rwanda.
We carried out a nationwide survey in all 30 districts of Rwanda, testing 17,360 people for worm infections. The results showed that 38.7% of people had intestinal worms, with adults being the most affected (46.1%) and preschool-aged children the least affected (30.2%). The percentage of infected people varied widely between districts, ranging from 8.6% to 85.1%. Among the worms, roundworms were the most common (27.0%), followed by whipworms (11.6%) and hookworms (10.7%). Most infections were mild, with fewer cases of moderate-to-heavy infections, which are of greater concern due to their severe health consequences.
For schistosomiasis, the percentage of people infected ranged from 0% to 38.3% using the standard testing method and up to 74.6% when results from a newer method were included. Heavy intensity infections were rare, with only a small percentage (0.1%) of cases showing higher levels of infection.
We identified certain groups that were more likely to have these infections. For intestinal worms, a higher likelihood was seen among single people, those without education, those using treated human excreta as manure, relying on unsafe water sources, and living near marshy areas. On the other hand, people with higher education, clean water, better sanitation, and certain job types were less likely to have infections. For schistosomiasis, the likelihood of infection was higher for those who were single, without education, lived near lakes or rice farms, used human excreta as manure, and lived far from water sources.
Intestinal worms and schistosomiasis remain significant public health challenges in Rwanda. This study highlights the need for continued treatment programs, improved water, sanitation, and hygiene services, and targeted interventions to protect high-risk groups and areas. These measures are essential for reducing the burden of these infections and working toward their elimination.
