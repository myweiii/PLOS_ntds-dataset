Soil-transmitted helminths (STH), commonly known as intestinal worms, are responsible for diseases known as soil-transmitted helminthiases. As part of annual STH control program activities in Thailand, test and treat (TnT) followed by mass drug administration (MDA) within 6 months, have been implemented among school-age children (SAC), with the aim of alignment with the global campaign to eliminate STH. Although this routine annual control strategy has reduced the prevalence of STH infections in many settings in Thailand, the reduction in prevalence has slowed, putting the goal of reducing prevalence levels to less than 5% by 2026 at risk. New strategies are therefore needed. We developed a mathematical model to explore different control programs that could help to achieve Thailandâ€™s STH elimination goals. Our model predicted that by continuing to deploy the current control program or switching to biannual TnT, we would not reach the 2026 target. However, the target could be achieved with biannual MDA, especially if MDA is to be administered at least among adults as well as school-age children. These findings provide useful guidance for developing appropriate control strategies for eliminating STH in Thailand.
