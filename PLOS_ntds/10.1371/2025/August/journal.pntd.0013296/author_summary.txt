Rattlesnake venoms exist in two forms: hemorrhagic (Type I) and neurotoxic (Type II). In South America, neurotoxic venoms are predominant; however, evidence of hemorrhagic venoms in rattlesnakes from northern Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela raises concerns about treating snakebite patients in the region. This study details the presence of both hemorrhagic and neurotoxic venoms in Crotalus durissus ruruima, the rattlesnake found in Roraima State, Brazil. Type I and Type II venoms differ in their toxin composition, which explains the specific toxicity of each type. In experimental models, antivenoms indicated for treating rattlesnake envenomation (Crotalus antivenom) showed a high antibody titer and neutralized toxic activities of both venom subtypes; however, it did not reduce the hemorrhagic activity induced by Type I venoms, which was diminished by Bothrops antivenom. Our data support previous indications that Bothrops-Crotalus antivenoms could be the preferred treatment for patients in northern Brazil. However, clinical studies reporting the benefits of the combined antivenoms remain underreported, and clinical studies in Roraima to assess patient outcomes and the effectiveness of Bothrops-Crotalus versus Crotalus antivenoms for this envenomation are strongly recommended.
