Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease that significantly endangers public health and hinders socioeconomic development. Sichuan Province is a mixed endemic area of cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), and it has one of the most severe epidemics of echinococcosis in China. Identifying spatiotemporal hotspots is critical for targeted interventions. We analyzed 12 years (2013–2024) of surveillance data from Sichuan’s Echinococcosis Control Program, covering 35 endemic counties and 3,215 newly diagnosed patients. Spatial autocorrelation (global/local Moran’s I) and spatiotemporal scan statistics (SaTScan) were applied to detect clustering patterns. The overall detection rate declined significantly, but CE predominated until 2021, after which AE surpassed it. Persistent “high-high” clusters were concentrated in northwestern counties, while southeastern areas showed “low-low” clustering. Significant spatiotemporal aggregation occurred during 2013–2016 for total/CE cases and extended to 2018 for AE. Key drivers included ecological factors, limited healthcare access, and socioeconomic practices. The Sichuan-Tibet Plateau remains a high-risk epicenter requiring prioritized control. We recommend precision strategies: dog management and rodent control in AE-endemic clusters, AI-enhanced diagnostics, dynamic spatial warning systems, and differentiated interventions for high/low-risk zones. These approaches align with Healthy China 2030 goals.
