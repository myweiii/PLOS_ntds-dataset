Rabies remains a serious public health problem in Asia and Africa, which covers a population of over 3 billion in endemic areas. According to the World Health Organization's estimation, approximately 59,000 people die from rabies worldwide each year. Rabies is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by the Rabies virus (RABV), mainly transmitted by infected animals through saliva bites. Under normal circumstances, after a person is attacked and infected by an animal carrying the rabies virus, the incubation period may range from several days to several years. At present, rabies is mainly prevented and intervened through rabies vaccination before or after exposure. The rabies vaccines currently available on the market cannot provide 100% protection in post-exposure prophylaxis due to their varying quality and the long time it takes to produce neutralizing antibodies. Some rabies virus-infected individuals still experience the virus entering the central nervous system, leading to death. Consequently, the development of novel rabies vaccines characterized by reduced production costs, simplified immunization schedules, and enhanced immunogenicity remains a critical strategy for rabies prophylaxis and post-exposure management. This investigation proposes an innovative framework for creating new vaccine candidates that integrate these optimized characteristics.
