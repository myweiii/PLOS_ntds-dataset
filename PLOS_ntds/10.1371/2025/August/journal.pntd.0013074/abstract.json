    "Background": "Fasciolosis is a parasitic disease caused by liver flukes of the genus Fasciola, predominantly Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. This zoonotic disease significantly impacts both livestock and human populations, particularly in areas with extensive agriculture and poor sanitation. Ethiopia, one of Africa’s leading sheep and goats producers, is highly affected by fasciolosis. However, despite its economic and public health importance, there is a lack of comprehensive and up-to-date evidence on the prevalence and risk factors of small ruminant (sheep and goats) fasciolosis. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) is to estimate pooled prevalence and identify risk factors of fasciolosis among small ruminants in Ethiopia.",
    "Methods": "This SRMA was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive systematic review was performed across five electronic databases (Google Scholar, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect), with all database searches and registers inquiries finalized on November 26, 2024. A random-effect model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of fasciolosis in sheep and goats. Heterogeneity was assessed, and the source of variation was analyzed using subgroup, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. Publication bias assessment and sensitivity analysis were also performed to ensure the robustness of the review. Funnel plots and Egger’s asymmetry tests were used to investigate publication bias.",
    "Results": "A total of 33 studies containing 9,578 small ruminants were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of fasciolosis was 32.25% (95% CI: 25.97–38.86%) with substantially high between-study heterogeneity (inconsistency index (I2)) = 97.3%, p < 0.01). Among the variables analyzed for heterogeneity, species, publication years, season of data collection, and regions of the study were significant predictors of heterogeneity The sub-group analysis showed that the prevalence of fasciolosis among sheep and goats was 37.18% (95% CI; 31.06–43.51%) and 12.76% (95% CI; 4.06–25.19%), respectively. According to the region-based subgroup analysis, studies taken from Amhara region had the highest prevalence of fasciolosis among small ruminants (43.99% (95% CI: 31.83–56.52%)).",
    "Conclusion": "This study highlights fasciolosis as a significant threat to Ethiopian small ruminants. Policymakers and veterinarians should prioritize evidence-based control programs in regions with high disease burden, through seasonal deworming, pasture rotation to disrupt snail ecology, and improved veterinary access in underserved areas."
