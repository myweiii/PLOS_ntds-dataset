Fasciolosis is a neglected parasitic disease caused by liver flukes and affects both animals and humans. In Ethiopia, fasciolosis poses a significant burden to animal health and agricultural livelihoods. Despite this, there has been no recent national-level summary of the diseaseâ€™s prevalence or factors contributing to its occurrence in small ruminants. In this study, we systematically reviewed 33 published studies and conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the overall burden of fasciolosis in small ruminants (sheep and goats). Our findings indicate that nearly one in three small ruminants (32.25%) is infected with fasciolosis, with infection rates being significantly higher in sheep (37.18%) than in goats (12.76%). The highest burden was observed in the Amhara region, with a prevalence of 43.99%.These findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated disease control efforts, including regular parasite monitoring, targeted treatment strategies, and improved management practices. Addressing fasciolosis requires collaborative action from veterinarians, livestock owners, policymakers, and researchers to mitigate its impact on food security, rural income, and animal welfare in Ethiopia.
