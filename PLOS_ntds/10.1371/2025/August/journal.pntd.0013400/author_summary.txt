Rheumatic heart disease is a serious heart condition that develops as a consequence of throat infections caused by a common type of bacteria. While this disease is preventable and now rare in many parts of the world due to better healthcare and early treatment, it continues to cause significant illness and death in Malawi, especially among children and adolescents. In this study, we reviewed existing research on rheumatic heart disease in Malawi to understand how common it is, the challenges people face accessing healthcare in the country, and what solutions may be feasible to improve the situation. We found that many patients first present to hospital when the disease is already advanced. Additionally, there is a shortage of trained healthcare workers and limited access to the medications needed to treat and prevent the disease. However, we also found that efforts to increase training for nurses and other healthcare professionals have shown promise, particularly in rural areas where resources are scarce. By highlighting these findings, our goal is to support future work to reduce the burden of this treatable disease and improve access to care in Malawi.
