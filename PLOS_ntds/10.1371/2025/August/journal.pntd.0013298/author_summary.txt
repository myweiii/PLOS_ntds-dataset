Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness in humans and animals. Identifying the different stages of its life cycle is essential for understanding the disease and its progression, but this process often requires skilled experts and high-quality microscope images. In our study, we developed an automated method using artificial intelligence to classify the two main forms of the parasite—slender and stumpy—based on microscope images. Our approach combines a powerful segmentation tool called Cellpose with a deep learning model to analyze thousands of individual parasite images. Importantly, our method works well even with lower-resolution images, which are common in resource-limited settings. This makes the tool especially useful in labs that may not have access to advanced imaging equipment. By offering a fast, reliable, and objective way to analyze parasite forms, our work supports better disease monitoring and research. It also opens the door for similar approaches to be used in studying other microscopic organisms.
