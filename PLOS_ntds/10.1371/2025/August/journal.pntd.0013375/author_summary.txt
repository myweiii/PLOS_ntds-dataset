Rift Valley fever virus and C. burnetii are priority pathogens that cause severe febrile illnesses with overlapping symptoms, yet their burden in Ethiopia remains poorly understood. This study investigated the prevalence of these infections among 402 febrile patients in Eastern Ethiopia. The detected seroprevalence was 5.2% for RVF virus and 21.4% for C. burnetii infection. No RVF virus RNA or C. burnetii DNA was detected, which is likely attributable to the delayed healthcare-seeking behavior and low pathogen levels at presentation. Notably, none of the seropositive febrile patients were clinically suspected to have these infections before testing. Risk factor analysis revealed that older febrile patients (â‰¥35 years) had significantly higher odds of RVF virus infection. Conversely, female sex, rural residency, and handling dead animals increased the odds of C. burnetii infection, suggesting that occupational exposure is a key risk factor. These findings suggest that the true burden of RVF virus and C. burnetii infections is underestimated in this region. Active surveillance and enhanced clinical awareness are needed to increase detection and reduce the impact of these neglected pathogens.
