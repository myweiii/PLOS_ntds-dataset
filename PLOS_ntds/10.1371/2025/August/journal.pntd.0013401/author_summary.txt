Babesia divergens parasites infect and destroy red blood cells (RBCs), causing severe babesiosis in humans and cattle. The in vitro model used to study B. divergens is based on culturing the parasite in human RBCs. Using this model, we have identified and characterized a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, BdP50. This protein localizes on the surface of free merozoites (the infective stage) and extracellular vesicles (Bd-derived EVs) secreted by B. divergens infected RBCs into the medium. In addition to BdP50, Bd-derived EVs contain abundant parasite and human proteins and interact with RBCs to prepare them for parasite invasion and growth. As BdP50 is capable of binding to RBCs, it is a strong candidate for mediating merozoites and EVs interactions with RBCs and for promoting invasion. Indeed, anti-BdP50 antibodies block 88% of merozoite invasion into RBCs at 12 hours post-invasion. However, parasite growth returns to normal within hours, suggesting an adaptive response. It is plausible that Bd-derived EVs, a key product secreted by parasites in vitro, play an important role in modulating the extracellular environment, to favor parasite propagation and to attenuate the blocking effect of antibodies, thereby promoting parasite survival. This study identifies BdP50 and Bd-derived EVs as key elements in the life cycle of B. divergens, shedding light on babesiosis and offering new insights into potential therapeutic interventions.
