Trachoma remains a significant public health concern in many rural communities with high rates of poverty and limited access to healthcare. The surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene (SAFE) strategy was designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a means of accelerating trachoma elimination. Delivery of antibiotics through mass drug administration (MDA) is effective in reducing prevalence of active trachoma and prevention of disease transmission. However, achieving adequate treatment coverage during MDA in challenging environments, such as pastoral and conflict-affected regions, remains a challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-participatory approach in improving trachoma treatment coverage in Loyamorok Ward, Baringo County, a region characterized by a nomadic lifestyle, intercounty border movements, and low MDA uptake. The study employed a pre- and post-intervention design, utilizing a systematic random sampling of households to collect quantitative data. Key interventions, including enhanced communication, optimized drug distribution, timely MDA implementation, and capacity building, were implemented during the intervention phase. The results demonstrated a significant increase in MDA uptake and improved awareness of trachoma and its prevention. These findings suggest that the community-participatory approaches can be a valuable tool in addressing the challenges of trachoma elimination in similar settings.
