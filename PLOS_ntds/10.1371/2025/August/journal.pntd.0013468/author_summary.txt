When mosquitoes bite host animals, they secrete hundreds of salivary proteins. These proteins serve as a bridge for interactions between mosquitoes and their hosts. Numerous studies have shown that mosquito salivary proteins facilitate viral infection at the bite site. In addition, mosquito salivary proteins are highly immunogenic and can stimulate both non-specific and specific immune responses in the host. Symptoms such as wheals and itching caused by mosquito bites are manifestations of skin allergic reactions induced by these salivary proteins. The specific IgE antibodies against mosquito salivary proteins produced in the host are key mediators of mosquito allergy and are important for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of mosquito allergic reactions. However, detection of mosquito salivary protein-specific IgE is challenging, mainly due to interference from mosquito salivary protein-specific IgG present in host serum. Here, we report a capture ELISA-based method for detecting mosquito salivary protein-specific IgE. Compared with traditional methods, this assay offers higher sensitivity and specificity, allows for quantitative analysis, and thus provides an efficient approach for detecting mosquito salivary protein-specific IgE in mouse or human serum.
