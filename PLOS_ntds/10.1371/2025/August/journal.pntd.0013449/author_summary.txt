The Brugia Test Plus (BT+) is a new rapid diagnostic test for Brugia species that detects human IgG4 antibodies directed against the Brugia protein BmR1. BT+ was evaluated in the field using a variety of samples, including whole blood, plasma, and dried blood spots (DBS) from people living in Belitung Timur, an endemic area for Brugia malayi in Indonesia. Night blood samples were collected from residents of four endemic villages, and day blood samples for DBS were obtained from schoolchildren in same villages. The sensitivity of BT+ was determined by comparing its results to a microscopic test for microfilaria (Mf). BT+ â€‰had a sensitivity of 84.9% with whole blood in the field and 95.9% with EDTA plasma in the lab. Specificity was not evaluated in B. malayi endemic area. Overall, the BT+ was found to be straightforward to perform and interpret, and its analytic performance is well suited for measuring the impact of the brugian-filariasis elimination program.
