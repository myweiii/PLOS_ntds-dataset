Leprosy is a disease that has been eliminated in higher income countries but persists in lower income countries. This qualitative study explores the reasons that leprosy persists in Bolivia, by learning from the lived experiences of leprosy patients and medical professionals. 17 interviews were conducted in total; 12 with leprosy patients and 5 with medical professionals. The study also explored the role that Active Case Finding (ACF) plays in eliminating leprosy. ACF is a method of finding leprosy cases that can involve medical professionals examining high risk groups and searching for signs of leprosy. The study gave rise to a range of reasons that leprosy remains in Bolivia, termed “barriers to leprosy elimination” in the study, including (1) health system factors; (2) health service factors; (3) individual-related factors; (4) governmental neglect and NGO dependency; (5) weaknesses of the National Leprosy Programme and current leprosy control strategies; (6) societal stigma; and (7) lack of public knowledge. The study also found that ACF is an important strategy that must be prioritised to ensure that leprosy is eliminated in Bolivia.
