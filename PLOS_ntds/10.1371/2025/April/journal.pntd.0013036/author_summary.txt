The risk of Chagas disease has historically been limited to continental Latin America, though the presence of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomine vectors across the southern United States has prompted concerns about the risk of local transmission. In California, records of triatomines infected with T. cruzi date to the early 20th century, but few locally acquired cases have been documented statewide. To better understand the burden of Chagas disease in California and assess the risk of local transmission, we summarize eleven years (2013â€“2023) of triatomine submission and human case data reported to the California Department of Public Health. Almost one-third of triatomines tested positive for T. cruzi, though none were linked to human cases. Most of the 40 human cases had plausible exposure in Latin America. The human cases for which local transmission could not be ruled out were missing the demographic information needed to assess local transmission criteria. Despite the presence of triatomines, T. cruzi, and human cases in California, the risk for local transmission is low. More complete reporting of demographic information of cases would improve our understanding of local transmission risk and disease burden.
