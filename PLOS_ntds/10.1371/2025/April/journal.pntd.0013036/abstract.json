    "Abstract": "Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is carried in the guts of triatomine insects. Transmission typically occurs when infective trypomastigotes in triatomine feces encounter mucous membranes or bite wounds, though it is also possible by food-borne, transplant- and transfusion-mediated, and congenital routes. Most transmission occurs in rural and peri-urban parts of continental Latin America where triatomines often inhabit human dwellings. Triatomines infected with T. cruzi are also present across the southern United States, yet relatively few locally acquired infections have been documented. Rather, most reported cases have plausible exposure in Latin America. In California, the widespread distribution of T. cruzi-infected triatomines suggests a potential risk of local transmission. Here, we summarize triatomine submissions and human case reports made to the California Department of Public Health between 2013 and 2023. Of 226 triatomines tested, 63 (28%) were positive for T. cruzi via PCR; none were linked to any of the 40 human T. cruzi cases reported in the same period. Human cases were assessed for likelihood of local transmission. Country of birth, travel history, and location of primary residence suggested non-local transmission for 31 (78%) cases. Local transmission could not be ruled out for the remaining nine (22%) cases. Information on country of birth and travel history were missing from these case reports and prevented full assessment of local transmission criteria, though most of these patients resided within 400 meters of potential triatomine habitat. Despite the presence of triatomines, T. cruzi, and human cases in California, statewide data indicates the risk for locally acquired Chagas disease is low."
