Yellow fever (YF) is a viral disease that can be severe and has caused thousands of deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America. Humans are infected by Haemagogus mosquitoes in forests and savannahs, and in urban areas by the Aedes aegypti, which also transmits dengue and Zika. These viruses belong to the same genus of the YF virus, and their similarities may confound antibody test results. Protection by vaccines is correlated to antibody levels, which inform about the duration of immunity. Cases of YF in vaccinated individuals are uncommon and result from waning of immunity. Bites by infected mosquitoes boost post-vaccination immunity, while averting disease. Follow-up of vaccinated individuals in a population free from interference of natural YF infection has shown that 30â€“45 days after vaccination adults had high YF antibody levels, which decreased substantially after one year. In children, post-vaccination antibody levels were lower than in adults and decreased substantially after one year. Waning of immunity was not affected by previous infections with dengue or Zika. These results support the recommendation of a booster dose in populations at risk of YF, especially in children. Routine mass testing after vaccination is not feasible, whereas revaccination is cheap, safe and effective.
