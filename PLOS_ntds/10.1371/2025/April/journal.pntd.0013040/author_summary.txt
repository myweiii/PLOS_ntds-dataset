Carrion’s disease is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella bacilliformis, characterized by fever and anemia in the acute phase and skin lesions in the chronic phase. However, a case with symptoms similar to Carrion’s disease has been reported, where Bartonella rochalimae was identified as the causative agent. Five B. rochalimae strains were isolated from human samples (one from Ancash, one from Cajamarca, and three from Huanuco). Phylogenetic and genetic analyses suggest that dogs could be part of the circulation of B. rochalimae, and that this bacterium may play a role in the development of outbreaks.
