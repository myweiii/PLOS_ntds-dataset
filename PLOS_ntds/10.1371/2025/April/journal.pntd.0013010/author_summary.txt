Rabies causes approximately 59000 deaths every year world-wide. It is also among one of the neglected tropical diseases aimed to achieve ‘Zero by 30’ as per the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030. Rabies is a preventable disease both by pre- and post-exposure vaccination. One of the key requirements of successful vaccination is the induction of a robust neutralizing antibody response against the glycoprotein G, a key viral protein that facilitates the virus infection. The level of antibodies against the protein is considered as a surrogate marker of protection against rabies. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a minimum serum level of 0.5 IU/mL of neutralizing antibodies to consider a person to have adequately seroconverted following vaccination. In high risk groups such as animal handlers, forest officials, pet owners and veterinarians, ensuring protective levels of anti-rabies antibodies post-prophylactic vaccination is of paramount importance. Also, population level screening of protective antibody response as part of rabies control programs in high-risk communities as well as in persons undergoing post-exposure vaccination may be essential. However, the gold-standard assays currently recommended by WHO such as RFFIT are cumbersome to perform due to multiple reasons. The present study attempts to address these issues and reports a novel assay that can overcome these difficulties. The effort is to expand public health accessibility to anti-rabies antibody testing to ensure efficacy of rabies immunization, thereby contributing to global rabies control and elimination.
