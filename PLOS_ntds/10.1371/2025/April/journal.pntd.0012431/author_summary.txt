Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represent a global public health problem with great socioeconomic impact. Using digital health technologies to provide medical care remotely can be an important strategy for reducing inequalities. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and summarize international evidence on the use of telemedicine in the clinical care of patients with NTDs. A total of 8 articles were included for data collection as they met all our search criteria, half of them published after 2021 (n=4). Most telemedicine interventions in NTDs involved Primary Health Care teams (n=5). Studies that evaluated the accuracy of remote diagnosis demonstrated good effectiveness for leprosy, trachoma and complications of neurocysticercosis. There was a reduction in the need for specialized face-to-face medical consultations with telemedicine to treat dengue fever and some dermatological NTDs, and an improvement in the quality of clinical monitoring of cutaneous leishmaniasis through mobile health was reported. Although we have seen a recent small increase in academic research on the topic, there is a gap in recommendations for the clinical management of NTDs through telemedicine in literature, revealing that this resource is still largely underutilized.
