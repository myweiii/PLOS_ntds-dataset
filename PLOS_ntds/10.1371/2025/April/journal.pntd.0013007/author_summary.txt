The fluorescent recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technique is a state-of-the-art method for isothermal DNA amplification, utilizing a portable instrument and lyophilized reagents. This innovative approach allows for on-site testing using a portable fluorescence detector, significantly enhancing its utility in field settings. In our study, we evaluated 287 samples obtained directly from the field. The conventional semi-nested PCR assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 96.4%. In contrast, the newly developed fluorescent RPA assay exhibited superior performance, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 91.1% for detecting N. americanus infection. These findings highlight the potential of fluorescent RPA as a more sensitive method for identifying N. americanus. Moreover, our research suggests that the established fluorescent RPA could play a crucial role in various applications, such as surveillance and epidemiological and clinical investigations related to N. americanus. Further studies are warranted to explore its full potential and optimize its implementation in practical settings. This advancement represents a significant step forward in the field of diagnostic techniques for parasitic infections.
