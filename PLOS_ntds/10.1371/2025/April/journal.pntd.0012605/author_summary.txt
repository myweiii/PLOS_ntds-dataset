In this study, we investigated the ecological and epidemiological dynamics of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and their natural infection with DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in Colombia. An entomological survey conducted across four municipalities revealed distinct environmental and human-related factors influencing the distribution and abundance of these species. Ae. aegypti was more abundant in urban environments, favoring areas with lowest precipitation and a range of household conditions, while Ae. albopictus was more common in rural areas with higher precipitation and poorer household conditions. Both species were naturally infected with DENV and CHIKV, with Ae. albopictus showing the ability to disseminate, as indicated by their presence in the legs and salivary glands. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding species-specific ecological characteristics and incorporating social characteristics, particularly in regions where both species coexist and contribute to arbovirus transmission.
