Campylobacteriosis is a major FBD with significant public health and economic impact. BoD studies, particularly those using the DALYs metric, are essential for quantifying the impact of Campylobacter infections. However, variations in methodologies across studies complicate comparisons and hinder effective policy decisions.
This systematic review examines existing Campylobacter BoD studies, focusing on differences in how DALYs are calculated. We identified 23 studies, most of which were based in high-income countries, with limited representation from LMICs. Our findings reveal discrepancies in key methodological aspects, such as DW assignments, health state classifications, and life expectancy tables, all of which influence burden estimates. These methodological variations complicate efforts to harmonise disease burden assessments across regions.
Addressing these discrepancies is vital for producing more consistent and reliable estimates of Campylobacterâ€™s global burden. Standardizing methodological approaches across studies will not only improve the precision of these estimates but also ensure their comparability across regions and populations. Harmonizing these methodologies will strengthen the robustness of future assessments, providing more reliable data to guide the development of informed and effective public health strategies and interventions.
