    "Abstract": "Neuroangiostrongyliasis is characterized by eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with a robust onset of severe neurological symptoms, by which immunological factors and peripheral metabolites have been postulated to affect the course of the disease. The gut-brain axis provides a bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system, and therefore, understanding the gut microbiome may provide us with a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified an increase in the abundance of different Lactobacillus species in Angiostrongylus cantonensis-infected mice, which was correlated to the disease severity. However, attempts to inoculate L. johnsonii into A. cantonensis-infected mice surprisingly revealed an improvement in neuroinflammation and prolonged survival. RNA sequencing suggested an immune-modulatory effect of L. johnsonii, which was confirmed by ELISA, showing increased levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and MCP-1 in the brain. Nevertheless, L. johnsonii-associated improvements were not associated with microbiome-related metabolites, as UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed no change in short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids. Our results suggest that while intestinal L. johnsonii appears to be linked to the progression of neuroangiostrongyliasis, these bacteria are likely attempting to modulate the dysregulated immune response to combat the disease. This is one of the first studies to investigate the gut microbiome in mice with A. cantonensis infection, which extends our knowledge from the microbiome-point-of-view of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis and how the body defends against A. cantonensis. This work also extends to possible treatment approaches using L. johnsonii as probiotics."
