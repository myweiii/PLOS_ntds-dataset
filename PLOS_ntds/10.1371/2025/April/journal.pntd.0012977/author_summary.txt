The gut-brain axis provides a bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system and, therefore, is related to multiple disease pathogenesis. This research aimed to analyze the microbiome change of mice with Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection. Our results suggested an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus in A. cantonensis-infected mice, which was initially thought to be correlated with the disease severity. However, oral supplementation of Lactobacillus johnsonii surprisingly improved the disease and the survival of A. cantonensis-infected mice. Further analysis suggested that gavage of L. johnsonii increased IL-10 and decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and MCP-1 levels in the brain. Our results provide evidence of how the gut microbiome affects angiostrongyliasis and support that Lactobacillus may represent a potential probiotic that may improve angiostrongyliasis and may serve as a new treatment approach.
