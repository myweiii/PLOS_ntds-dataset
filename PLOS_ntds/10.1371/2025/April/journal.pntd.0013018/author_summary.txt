Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) is a nematode parasite threatening the lives of millions of people in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Because of its autoinfective potential, this parasite can live in its host for many years, producing larvae that mature into adult worms within the host without the need for reinfection. Diagnosis of this parasite is challenging, relying on the detection of larvae in stool. Alternatively, serology has been very useful through the detection of antibodies produced against this parasite. The present study evaluates the diagnostic performance of 2 new lateral flow tests (Strongy Detect Rapid Tests) in comparison with the now commercially available Strongy Detect ELISAs. We used stored serum samples from Ss positive individuals, healthy controls and subjects infected with other helminth parasites. These lateral flow assays were very accurate at identifying Ss-specific antibodies in samples known to have the infection. There was an excellent agreement between these new lateral flow tests and the commercially available ELISAs. The excellent performance of these new tests makes them good diagnostic tools for use at point of care and in laboratory settings.
