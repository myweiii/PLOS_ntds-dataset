Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a zoonosis disease with a high fatality rate in East Asia including Republic of Korea (ROK). Although the fatality rate of SFTS has increased since its first discovery, there are no available vaccines or treatments for SFTS. In the present study, we developed mRNA vaccine candidates encoding the glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) of the SFTS virus (SFTSV), which are major targets for neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated the efficacies of SFTS mRNA vaccine candidates (2 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg of VER-001) using C57BL/6 and IFNAR-/- mice. VER-001 showed induction of high immunogenicity and complete protective efficacy without body weight loss in the immunized mice. Therefore, our study showed that all doses of VER-001 effectively induce antibody formation and inhibit lethal SFTSV infection and are potential vaccine candidates.
