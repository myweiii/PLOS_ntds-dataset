Brain infections due to the fungus Cryptococcus are estimated to kill over 100,000 persons infected with HIV annually. To detect disease early, it is recommended to screen the serum of individuals with low (≤200 cells/µl) blood CD4+ T cell counts for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) and then preemptively treat those who test positive for presumed cryptococcosis. Unfortunately, flow cytometric CD4 assays are not readily available in many low-resource settings. To get around this limitation, we devised a strategy to test subjects with known HIV infection in Monrovia, Liberia, with a point-of-care lateral flow assay (LFA) which detects low blood CD4+ T cell counts. Those with low counts were then tested for serum CrAg using a second LFA. Of the 500 HIV+ Liberian study subjects tested, 201 had low blood CD4+ T cell counts. These subjects were further tested for serum CrAg; 82/201 tested CrAg+. Many of these subjects were then found to have cryptococcal meningitis. All subjects who were serum CrAg+ were treated with antifungal drugs. Thus, use of inexpensive, sequential point-of-care LFA testing enables early diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcosis. These lifesaving tests should be made widely available in resource-poor settings.
