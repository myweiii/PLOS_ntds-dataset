In this study, we examined the response of pediatric patients with paragonimiasis, a parasitic infection, to treatment for moderate to large pericardial effusion, a frequent complication of the disease. Our findings revealed that many children who were treated with oral praziquantel and low-dose corticosteroids experienced complete resolution of the effusion without requiring surgery, contrary to prior recommendations that advocated for surgical intervention in such cases. These results suggest that early non-surgical management can serve as an effective alternative to surgery for children with pericardial effusion due to paragonimiasis, particularly in cases that do not involve life-threatening complications. This study offers valuable new insights into the management of a serious condition, presenting a more cost-effective and less invasive treatment approach.
