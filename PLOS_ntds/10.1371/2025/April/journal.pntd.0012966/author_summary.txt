Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira spp. bacteria for which urban rats are a known reservoir. We tested 328 rats across Boston for Leptospira spp. and analyzed the results in relation to the genetic population structure of rats and found that rat population dynamics influence Leptospira spp. transmission in Boston, US. We also found evidence of a strain of Leptospira isolated from rats that closely matches a strain isolated from a human with leptospirosis in the area. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of understanding rat ecology, population structure and movement in reducing risk of Leptospira spp. transmission to novel rat populations and to humans.
