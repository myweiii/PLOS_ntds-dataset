Mycetoma is still a neglected infectious disease present in Mexico. The diagnosis and identification of the etiological agents have relied on the use of conventional methods for decades. The application of modern DNA-based molecular biology methods has allowed us to identify the etiological agents with similar microscopic and histopathologic appearances. Since mycetoma is caused by many fungal and bacterial agents, they may share certain biological characteristics that enable them to grow in the human host. Comparative genomic analysis may help us study these otherwise cryptic organisms. In this work, we identify a new Actinomadura species from a human mycetoma case and analyze its genomic composition through whole-genome analysis.
