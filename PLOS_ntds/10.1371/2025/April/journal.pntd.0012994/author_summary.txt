Rabies virus infections in humans are almost always fatal if left untreated due to a lack of a protective immune response. Dendritic cells play a crucial role in initiating an antiviral immune response, so our study investigated their response to exposure to three different rabies virus strains. We discovered that two of the three strains could infect a small proportion of dendritic cells. The third strain did not activate the cells, while exposure to the other two strains led to only minor signs of activation. This response was insufficient to trigger a significant immune reaction. Despite exposure to the virus, the dendritic cells retained their ability to respond to additional stimuli. Our findings provide insight into how rabies virus interacts with a crucial part of the initial immune response and highlight the need for further research into boosting immune activation by targeting dendritic cells.
