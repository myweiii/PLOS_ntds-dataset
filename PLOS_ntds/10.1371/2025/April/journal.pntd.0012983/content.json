    "Introduction": "Snakebite envenoming listed as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) in 2017 is a disease of the rural poor. Every year, it causes worldwide a substantial number of deaths and permanent disability in survivors, including restricted mobility, amputation, blindness, and psychological effects [1–6]. Snakebite and snakebite envenoming is reviewed by Gutiérrez et al [7], Warrell [8], and for Africa by Chippaux [9]. The WHO Snakebite information and data platform is a continuously updated resource [10].\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, reliable data on the burden, prevention and management of snakebites remains scarce. Mostly, crude population and institution-based estimates have been reported [9,11,12]. The latter are biased since most patients do not reach health facilities and, additionally, are not systematically reported.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, the annual incidence estimates are 56 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 45–68/100 000) based on hospital data and 204 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 172–237/100 000) based on household surveys with a case fatality rate between 2.8% and 11.6% depending on whether antivenom was used. The incidence of sequelae may be in the range of 5% and amputations 3% [12].\nSnake bite deaths are estimated at 20 000 – 32 000 people per year, most likely a cross underestimation [13].\nHigh at-risk groups are rural agricultural workers, pastoralists, fishermen, hunters, children, people living in poorly constructed houses, and those with limited access to education and healthcare [9,14]. The shared environment of humans and venomous snakes and its implications has been described [9]; very detailed for the most important venomous snake in West Africa the saw scaled viper (Echis carinatus) [15].\nThe primary prevention measures, supportive and specific (antivenom) treatment are poorly developed across sub-Saharan Africa [9]. Guidelines for the prevention and management of snakebite envenoming have been published by WHO in 2010 [16].\nIn West Africa at least 3500–5350 deaths happen annually, equivalent to 1.2 deaths/100 000 population per annum (95% CI: 0.9–1.4/100 000) [17]. The underestimation of the snakebite burden in West Africa has been assessed by Habib et al [17].\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, a national household and health center-based epidemiological snakebite survey was carried out in 1979 and published in 2002, estimating the annual incidence of snakebites in rural areas at greater than 200 bites per 100,000 inhabitants, higher in forest areas (195 per 100,000 inhabitants) than in savannah areas (130 per 100,000 inhabitants).\nThe fatality rate was higher in savannahs (3.1%) than in forests (2.0%). More than half the bites occurred in men aged between 15 and 50, with a significantly higher risk among farmers [18]. Tiassalé health district, to which Taabo Health Demographic and Surveillance System (HDSS) belongs, was leading the snakebite case fatality rate (8.25%) in the national survey [18].\nThe Ahondo Health Area where our wound management project “Prevent, identify & treat wounds early: An integrated sectoral community-based approach” is carried out since 2019, is located in Taabo HDSS [19,20]. We found a substantial proportion of wounds which were most probably caused by snakebites. They were neither linked to snakebite by patients nor diagnosed as snakebite wounds by health staff in patients presenting to the health services. This observation prompted us to add an in-depth snakebite study to our wound management project.\nThe objective of the study was to estimate the annual snakebite incidence and to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of snakebites in the HDSS setting of Ahondo Health Area (AHA).",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThis study is part of the humanitarian and research project entitled “Prevent, identify & treat wounds early: An integrated sectoral community-based approach” carried out in the Taabo Health Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). The study protocol was approved by the National Health and Life Sciences Ethics Committee (CNESVS) of Côte d’Ivoire (N/Ref: 025–22/MSHPCMU/CNESVS-km, dated March 03, 2022) and by the Ethical Review Board of the University Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany (N˚ 2021_EKHA.91, dated September 02, 2021). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants aged 18 years and older, or from parents, or legal representatives of persons younger than 18 years.\n\n\nStudy area\nThe study took place in the Ahondo Health Area (AHA) including Ahondo and Sahoua villages. AHA is part of the Taabo Health Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) located in the Tiassalé health district (Fig 1).\n26], https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004327.g001).\nThe Taabo HDSS is a research station of the Centre Suisse de Recherche Scientifique en Côte d’Ivoire (CSRS) located in south-central Côte d’Ivoire, approximately 150 km northwest of Abidjan. Since its creation in 2009, research on integrated control of water-related diseases, such as schistosomiasis, malaria, and Buruli ulcer, etc., have been carried out. The Taabo HDSS covers an area of approximately 980 km2 located between latitudes 6°0’ and 6°20’ N and longitudes 4°55’ and 5°15’ W. The area is mainly rural and comprises 13 villages as well as an urban settlement (Taabo-Cité) [21].\nThe annual rainfall ranges between 600 and 2000 mm per year, with four distinct climatic seasons [22]. In Taabo, a hydroelectric dam of about 69 km2 was built on the Bandama River in the late 1970s. In 2019, AHA had a population of around 4,200 people representing 10% of the Taabo HDSS population. The livelihood mainly depends on agriculture. Ahondo Health Center (AHC) is the largest center in the health area and is located 15 km from the Taabo district hospital. Since December 2019, the Sahoua Health Center (SHC) has become active. The socio-sanitary situation of the Taabo HDSS in general and the AHA in particular is characterized by a high prevalence of wounds and Skin NTDs [19], communicable diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis [23,24] and limited access to primary healthcare and safe drinking water [25]. In Ahondo, on the banks of the Bandama River, bananas are cultivated in plantations employing people of the villages. The banana plantation company is responsible for significant migrant worker movement in and out of AHA. The population of the AHA is diverse and representative of the Ivorian population composition.\n\n\nStudy design, definition of a “snakebite” case and rationale for the presented groups\nWe conducted a cross-sectional exhaustive survey based on the entire population of the Ahondo health area which is part of the Taabo HDSS. There were no exclusion criteria.\nWe capitalized on the HDSS infrastructure where demographic, health, socioeconomic, environmental, etc. data are routinely collected to analyze snakebite envenoming in its context.\nDefinition of a ‘snakebite’ case and rational for the presented groups\nDefinition of a ‘snakebite’ case:\n\nA person reporting a snake/ the local name of the snake inflicting the bite.\nsigns & symptoms interpreted as being caused by a snakebite based on the features described in the syndromic approach to snakebite envenoming in Sub-Saharan Africa [27,28].\nFormal identification of the offending snake by an expert familiar with the venomous snakes of the region.\nGroup 1: Persons in AHA reporting a snakebite as defined above between October 2, 2022 and October 2, 2023.\nAssuming a low recall bias for snakebites (a dramatic event) within the previous 12 months, the annual snakebite incidence is calculated from Group 1 and the epidemiology and circumstances of the bites described.\nGroup 2: Persons in AHA reporting a snakebite as defined above before October 2, 2022.\nThe data of group 2 are used to get a broader insight into the regional snakebite problem accepting a higher recall bias compared to group 1.\n\n\nData collection\nThe household survey was carried out in AHA between October 2 and December 22, 2023, by a team consisting of two interviewers from the Taabo HDSS, trained in data collection using the Open Data Kit (ODK) software, a Community Health Worker (CHW), a physician, a sociologist, and an epidemiologist.\nThe snakebite survey is part of an ongoing project to assess the wound burden, and the impact of the community-based wound management model implemented in 2019. Since the project had just started replacing paper questionnaires/ CRFSs by ODK, the data was collected by two interviewers with an ODK tablet and a paper-based questionnaire to capture and correct data entry errors. To minimize absences from households, the survey was carried out in the evenings between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., after household members had returned from their daily activities.\nOnce in the household, the interviewers explained the purpose of the survey to the head of the household and asked each household member if they had been a victim of snakebites at any time in their live with particular emphasis on snakebites they experienced in the past twelve months prior to the household survey. People temporarily absent from the household during the survey were systematically revisited the next day by the investigators. In households, in which a victim of snake bite was identified, a specific questionnaire was administered directly to the person of 10 years old or older and to the parents if the victim was less than 10 years old and after written informed consent of the victim had been obtained from adults (≥18 years old) or the parent/legal guardian if the victim was a minor (<18 years old). For the only fatal case, a teenager who died following a snakebite, the questionnaire was administered to his mother using the verbal autopsy method [29,30].\nData collected on snakebite victims included socio-demographic characteristics, environmental and social risk factors, and clinical characteristics (Table 1).\nIn addition, an interview was conducted with two nurses of AHA, a doctor of Taabo General Hospital and the manager of Taabo pharmacy. These interviews focused on\n\nthe medical treatment of snakebite;\nthe use of antivenom;\nthe availability of antivenom in Taabo pharmacy.\n\n\nData management and analysis\nData was entered and uploaded using Open Data Source (ODK central v2023) and exported to a Microsoft Excel CSV file. R software (version 4.3.1) was used for data analysis. The annual incidence of reported snakebites per 100,000 population for the AHA population was calculated from snakebites reported for the period October 2, 2022, to October 2, 2023, of Group 1. The proportions of sociodemographic, clinical and environmental variables were calculated for both groups. Results of group 1 and 2 are separately tabulated. The Fisher test statistics was used to compare the proportions of categorical variables at the 5% threshold. The interviews were analyzed to identify the main elements of interest of our study.",
    "Results": "Demographic and epidemiological data of the snakebite survey\nDuring the survey, 795 households were enumerated, 4,474 people were counted, and 3,924 people surveyed. 519 people had out-migrated, and 31 people had died. A total of 11 snakebite cases were reported in the AHA population for the period October 2, 2022, to October 2, 2023 (Group 1), and 51 people currently living in the AHA suffered snakebites before October 2, 2022 (Group 2). The annual snakebite incidence per 100,000 population calculated from group 1 was 280.3 per 100,000 (CI: 140.0 - 501.0). The AHA snakebite case-fatality rate calculated from group 2 was 2.0% (95% CI: 0.05 - 10.5) (Table 2).\n\n\nSocio-demographic characteristics of snakebite victims\nThe demographic characteristics of snakebite victims in AHA Group 1 are summarized in Table 3.\nIn AHA, the annual incidence of snakebites was significantly higher in the camps (3296.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) than in the villages (208.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The median age of snakebite victims was 43 years. For variables such as sex, age, nationality, profession, marital status and level of education of snakebite victims, there was no statistically significant difference between the different incidence classes at the 5% threshold.\nThe characteristics of the households of group 1 snakebite victims are presented in Table 4. Except for the “type of wall” variable in the households of group 1 snakebite victims, there was no statistically significant difference between the incidence categories of the other variables in the characteristics of the households of group 1 snakebite victims at the 5% threshold.\n\n\nReported clinical characteristics and socio-environmental risk factors\nClinical characteristics of snakebite victims.The clinical characteristics of the snakebite victims are presented in Table 5.\nMost victims reported signs and symptoms of envenoming. The majority of cases the bite occurred at the lower limb.\nSwelling and bleeding at the bite site were most commonly observed.\nMore than half the cases applied a tourniquet after the snakebite. Nearly a third of snakebite victims consulted a health center, while more than half of cases a traditional healer.\nNone of the patients received antivenom according to health staff: “No snakebite victims treated in rural health centers receive antivenom, because we don’t have any. Patients are treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories and given anti-tetanus serum”.\nVictims attributing a local name to the snakebite experienced mentioned Poponé (Vipera sp.), Woblé (Naja sp.) and Mamba vert (Dendroaspis sp.) as culprits. None of the culprits have been formally identified by an expert.\n\nSocio-environmental findings of snakebites and snakes involved.Socio-environmental findings reported by snakebite victims are presented in Table 6. Snakebites occurred most often during the main activity periods of the day and at night, most frequently in the fields during farm work.",
    "Discussion": "The snakebite study conducted in the general population of the Ahondo Health Area (AHA) provides, for the first time, population (HDSS) based epidemiological and clinical characteristics of snakebites in southern Côte d’Ivoire. The snakebite survey is part of a research project assessing the wound burden and clinical epidemiology and evaluating the impact of a community-based wound management model implemented in 2019 and monitored since then [19,20]. The repeated wound surveys cover the entire AHA population.\nWe divided the data collected into two groups. To minimize recall bias for the calculation of the annual snakebite incidence, we used the data of the last 12 months (October 2, 2022, and October 2, 2023) prior to the time when the survey was conducted (group 1). For all other variables we merged the two data sets. On comparison, group 1 and group 2 data were interestingly very consistent.\nThe annual incidence of snakebites in AHA calculated from the group 1 data was 280.3 (CI: 140.0 - 501.0) per 100,000 inhabitants, exceeding the estimate for rural Côte d’Ivoire based on data of the 1970ies with 200 bites per 100,000 inhabitants [18].\nIn the AHA, the incidence of snakebites was significantly higher in the “camps” - agricultural areas where people periodically live and do seasonal field work - than in and around villages.\n80% of snakebite victims identified in the 12 months preceding the survey (group 1), were aged between 15 and 54, an age range which was also reported by others [18,31,32].\nThe low incidence of snakebite victims aged under 15 years could be explained by the fact that children in this age range are under the close care of adults or are attending school and are therefore not overly involved in the agricultural working activities that are the main cause of snakebites.\nThe snakebite fatality rate in AHA group 2 was 2.0%. The snakebite case fatality rate found in our study corresponds to previous estimates of 2% in the forest areas, where the Taabo HDSS is located, and 3% in the savannah zone [18].\nThe snakebite death recorded in our study concerns a 13-year-old boy of the village Ahondo, He had been bitten several times on the head by a snake after climbing a coconut tree. “Coming down from the coconut tree and shouting that he had been bitten by a green snake, this child died after a few hours at the village health center”, according to the parents of the deceased. The teenager’s death can be attributed to a green mamba (Dendroaspis sp.), an elapid that has well adapted to humanized environments [33]. The very fast snake, with its powerful neurotoxic venom, is a major cause of fatal envenoming in Sub-Saharan Africa. The death of this teenager demonstrates two problems at the health services level: (i) the lack of knowledge on immediate supportive treatment such as ventilation of the patient and, (ii) the lack of access to antivenom.\nIncidence figures, the affected population and the physical environment where snakebites were reported confirmed that envenoming is clustered in rural hotspots and in specific segments of the population [34].\nSnakes are mostly not or only vaguely seen when the bite occurs. Surprisingly, between 60 and 70% of the snakebite victims of our study claimed that they had observed the snake. Consistent between group 1 and 2, the proportion of the offending snakes (local names) were attributed in similar proportions to “Poponé” (Vipera sp.), “Woblé” (Naja sp.) and “Mamba vert”, (Dendroaspis sp.) as the main culprits [35]. Snakebites occurred mainly during working hours (70%) and at night (27%), in farms and at home. The high proportion of snakebites among housewives (39%) could be explained by the fact that they are the first to get up in the morning for daily household activities, work in the gardens and in the fields. The risk of snakebites in and around the house at night, when snakes are most active, is high due to lack of lighting.\nBites occurred mainly at the lower extremities (90%) which is expected.\nThe clinical signs reported by most snakebite victims were swelling at the bite site (70%) and bleeding from the bite site (around 75%). In most cases reported clinical signs resolved without specific treatment leading to the wrong conclusion that the measures applied suffice in envenomed patients. The resolution indicates, instead, that only a small quantity of venom was injected if it was a venomous snake or the clinical signs observed were wrongly attributed to a venomous snake. The latter is a well-known reporting bias in incidents where a snake has not been unequivocally observed. This is especially a problem at night or in thick undergrowth away from footpaths. Dry bites which are in the range of 50% of venomous snake bites are additionally contributing to misinterpreting the danger on venomous snakes.\nThe fact that signs and symptoms of envenoming are often neither attributed to a snakebite by the victim nor, initially, by health staff has been confirmed in our wound management study.\nBetween May 2019 and July 2024, the wounds of thirteen out of more than three hundred patients with complicated or severe wounds treated at Taabo District Hospital were attributed to snakebite envenoming by the medical team of our wound management project (see Fig 2).\n(A). The patient was not aware of the snakebite and the health services he had attended did not suspect a snakebite as the cause. The course of events the patient reported was highly suggestive of a snakebite, most likely a spitting cobra (Naja sp.). Within 2 months of wound care healthy granulation tissue had developed (B). Final result after skin grafting (C).\nThe evolution and the time course of large soft tissue necrosis around cytotoxic snakebites distinguishes them clearly from other causes. One of the snakes responsible for predominately local tissue damage in the study area are spitting cobras (Naja sp.) [36–38]\nIn a case series from Nigeria all 14 patients bitten by the spitting cobra Naja nigricolis reported developed swelling at the bite noticed after an interval of between three minutes and three hours. In most patients, the swelling was extended reaching its maximum within 36 hours of the bite. Transient local bleeding from the bite was noticed in five patients. Local tissue necrosis was detected in 10 patients within 5 days after the bite and complete breakdown followed quickly [36].\nFirst aid is poorly established in Cote d’Ivoire. Black stones were used in 31% of snakebite victims in our study. Black stones are ineffective and there is very strong advice against their use [27]. Alarmingly 82% of the snakebite victims incised the skin at the bite side. Also, dangerous – particularly in regions with venomous snakes causing clotting disturbances - and, entirely ineffective. Between 50 and 60% applied tourniquets. Again here, a problem with first aid measures. If applied too tightly they cause significant local damage, if applied only loosely, they are useless.\nIn our study more than 60% of snakebite victims primarily consulted traditional healers. The high involvement of traditional healers in snakebite patients is one of the reasons why snakebite victims present late to the health services or not at all. At the same time, it is an opportunity if traditional healers could be convinced to cooperate and to be trained in snakebite prevention and professional referral to Health Centers and hospitals [39–41].\nA snakebite management plan, equipment and materials, including very importantly antivenoms, are, however, preconditions for the cooperation and the development of trust in the health services. In our study none of the snakebite victims treated at Ahondo Health Center and Taabo District Hospital received antivenom. Most snakebite victims attending Ahondo Health Center and Taabo District Hospital were treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and received tetanus prophylaxis. Interviewed health staff commented: “This protocol for treating snakebite victims was put in place due to the lack of antivenom”. “High cost, low demand, the expiry date of antivenom and power cuts in Taabo are the main reasons for not ordering antivenom”.\n\nStudy limitations\nThe main limitation of the first snakebite study within the framework of our longitudinal population (HDSS) based wound management project is the size of the study population of around 4,000 inhabitants surveyed. Considering the size of the population it is remarkable that the main features of snakebite envenoming (clinical, environmental and persisting managerial deficits) of the region are captured, and the annual incidence found is within the range of previous estimates. Despite the small population we survey, we could clearly demonstrate in this first snakebite study in Taabo HDSS that snakebite is a problem in the Taabo HDSS area and that it is unattended. The wound management project is close to rollout in a larger population the entire Taabo HDSS with 78.000 inhabitants which will present an opportunity for a more representative population sample with the methodology well established in the present study.\nEstimating the incidence of snakebites and capturing the data on the circumstances of the bite, the culprit, the clinical presentation and course of events including first aid and treatment are hampered by a range of problems:\n(a) snakebite vs snakebite envenoming: Counting snakebites is illusive; most snakebites go unnoticed. Studies on snakebites mainly capture snakebite envenoming. Patterns of signs and symptoms depending on the venom composition of the offending snake help to diagnose patients who experienced clinically relevant venom injections. Regionally, the envenoming pattern can be fairly reliably attributed to snake genus [27,42]. (b) recall bias: We minimized the recall bias, in particular to not underestimate snakebite (snakebite envenoming) incidence, by only using data of the past 12 months prior to the survey. Snakebite envenoming if substantial is traumatic and remembered even for longer periods of time. (c) observation bias: We cannot rely on patients attributing the right cause to the accident they experienced. This happens in both directions. Fast developing necrotic wounds as described above is an example of not attributing a snakebite to the clinical findings. To the contrary, snakebites are regularly blamed for a wound which in fact had been caused by a thorn etc. the patient stepped in. In our study also staff of health services did not attribute snakebites to wounds which most likely had been caused by envenoming.\nIn summary, the study results reveal information and figures on snakebite envenoming and not snakebites in general. Inquiring a short period of time (12 months) in an HDSS setting as in our study is as close as possible to robust estimates of snakebite envenoming incidence and outcomes. An underestimation is likely due to a bias towards more severe envenoming and due to an observation bias attributing the clinical finding to other causes. This may be partly balanced by an overestimation due to an observation bias attributing other causes of the clinical findings to a snakebite.\nDespite limitations, the results of this first study of snakebites in the Taabo HDSS are valuable to guide prevention, first aid and clinical management strategies and informing future research, as widely recommended [3,9,45].\nIn conclusion, the results of our study show that the snakebite burden in rural Southern Côte d’Ivoire remains in the range of what had been recorded in the second half of the last century and continues to be a significant health threat to the rural population at work and at home. First aid measures and clinical diagnosis and management including antivenom availability in the health services are entirely inappropriate. The dominant role of traditional healers cannot be converted into cooperation under these circumstances. A countrywide effort is urgently required to mitigate the threat of snakebite envenoming. The main points are (a) creating awareness and educating communities in snakebite prevention, first aid and recognition as an emergency requiring immediate referral to the health services, (b) training staff of health services in diagnosing and managing snakebite envenoming, (c) providing life-saving equipment (e.g., to manage respiratory failure), (d) stocking antivenoms and instruct its application (d) securing follow-up and rehabilitation including mental problems."
