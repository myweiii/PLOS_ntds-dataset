Snakebite envenoming is an important health threat to rural communities in many parts of the world. In Sub-Saharan Africa reliable data on the burden, clinical epidemiology and management of snakebites remain scarce. In our wound management project “Prevent, identify & treat wounds early: An integrated sectoral community-based approach” we found a substantial proportion of wounds which were most probably caused by snakebites. They were neither linked to snakebite by patients nor diagnosed as snakebite wounds by health staff in patients presenting to the health services. This observation prompted us to add an in-depth snakebite study to our wound management project estimating the burden and describing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of snakebites. The annual incidence of snakebites in our study area was 280 cases per 100,000 population unchanged since the 70ies of the last century. The death of a 13-year-old teenager bitten by a green mamba is a very sad avoidable death due to the lack of education in snakebite prevention and first aid at the community and training and resources including antivenom at the health services level.
