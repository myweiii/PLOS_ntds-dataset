    "Background": "The recent surge in incidence and geographic spread of OROV infections poses an escalating threat to global public health. However, studies exploring the clinical signs of OROV infection remains exceedingly limited.",
    "Methods": "We searched for OROV studies published until June 17, 2024, in several electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library.",
    "Results": "In total, 15 studies involving 806 patients with OROV infection were eligible for inclusion. General symptoms with fever and headache were the most common. Gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and odynophagia were also prevalent, along with ocular symptoms, mainly retro-orbital pain, photophobia, and redness. Respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and nasal congestion, are present, and skin-related issues like rash, pruritus, and pallor were also identified.",
    "Conclusion": "Overall, this study provides a foundational understanding of OROVâ€™s clinical manifestations to guide diagnosis, management, and public health interventions against this neglected tropical disease."
