In the realm of life sciences, understanding the full scope of infectious diseases is crucial for protecting public health. Oropouche virus (OROV), a relatively under-studied pathogen, has been showing an alarming increase in both incidence and geographical spread recently. Despite its growing threat, our knowledge of the clinical symptoms it causes has been severely lacking. Our study is the first of its kind to comprehensively review and analyze available research on OROV-related symptoms. By pooling 15 studies involving 806 patients, we’ve uncovered a range of symptoms from common fever and headache to less-known ocular, gastrointestinal, and skin - related issues. This new understanding is vital. For scientists, it lays the groundwork for further research into OROV’s biology and disease mechanisms. For non-scientists, it helps in early recognition of the disease, which is key to getting proper medical care and preventing its spread.
