Mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel is an important tool to combat several diseases, including taeniasis caused by the adult form of Taenia solium. The larvae of T. solium frequently infects the central nervous system of humans, causing neurocysticercosis. Since praziquantel is active not only on the adult form of the parasite, but also on its larval form, there are risks of neurological adverse events (seizures or symptoms of intracranial hypertension) if individuals who are treated for possible taeniasis, have neurocysticercosis. These adverse events are infrequent but can be life-threatening if not managed promptly in a correct manner. In Madagascar we set up a program to minimise those neurological adverse events, quickly identify them if they occurred, and to manage them appropriately. Following the implementation of this program, two MDA campaigns were carried out. A total of 280,305 people received treatment, with 10 experiencing neurological side effects. All cases were well managed, and all are now in good health. Here we describe our experiences, as we believe they can be useful to other programs using praziquantel in T. solium endemic areas.
