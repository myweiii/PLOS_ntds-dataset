The frequency of leishmaniasis, a group of diseases caused by sand flies, is influenced by various factors such as climate change, environmental factors, living conditions, individual characteristics, and large-scale human movements. In this systematic review, leishmaniasis cases detected and published in immigrants coming to Turkey for various reasons, primarily due to the Syrian civil war, one of the countries with the highest number of foreign migrants, have been compiled.
In this review, articles including immigrant patients were chosen covering over four thousand leishmaniasis cases have been documented, with 70% of these cases being migrants. This finding contributes to the creation of data that can be used in various fields. Additionally, it should not be overlooked that patients who have been diagnosed and treated may also be present in areas outside of the centers where the publications were conducted.
The arrival of patients with the same disease from abroad to a country where suitable vector species exist and where the disease is already present increases the risk of transmission from a public health perspective. It is believed that combining and analyzing studies conducted on this specific group of patients is important for providing epidemiological data and to see the picture above on this vector-borne disease.
