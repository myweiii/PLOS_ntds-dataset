Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, has recently been detected in commensal hosts across cities where kissing bug vectors can be rare or absent. This suggests that a different mode of transmission is sustaining the parasite in cities. Here we show that T. cruzi is being passed from mother to offspring in natural populations of Norway rats, black rats, and house mice in New Orleans, Louisiana (USA). PCR-based testing of embryos from infected mothers showed that about a quarter of offspring were infected with T. cruzi. Molecular diagnostics also provided evidence of mixed infection in individual embryos, indicating that vertical transmission can contribute to T. cruzi infection prevalence and diversity in urban reservoirs. These findings set new baselines for determining risks posed by T. cruzi to humans in cities and other areas where it is widespread.
