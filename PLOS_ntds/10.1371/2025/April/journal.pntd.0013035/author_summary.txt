We report a middle-aged farmer from West Sudan who had an orbital mycetoma. He had a mass in his right upper eyelid that was getting bigger but not hurting. The patient had a long and difficult medical journey because they were first given the wrong diagnosis of a lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenoma. It wasnâ€™t until a large local excision at a specialized center that the exact diagnosis of Actinomadura madurae actinomycetoma was made. Orbital mycetoma is a serious condition that should be thought about as a possible diagnosis, especially in places where it is common, to make sure that the right treatment is given at the right time.
