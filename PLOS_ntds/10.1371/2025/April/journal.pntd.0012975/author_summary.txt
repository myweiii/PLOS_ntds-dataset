This study aims to evaluate the impact of diabetes on the severity of venomous snakebites, a significant but often overlooked public health issue. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 537 snakebite patients treated at eight hospitals in Fujian Province between December 2019 and December 2023. The Snakebite Severity Score was used to assess severity, and both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify contributing factors. The results showed that diabetes was a significant independent predictor of increased snakebite severity, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.51. Other factors influencing severity included the time from snakebite to hospital and the bite site. Subgroup analysis revealed notable sex differences, with females with diabetes having a much higher risk of moderate-to-severe outcome than males. Additionally, diabetes was associated with longer hospital stays, higher medical costs, increased complication rates, and a higher likelihood of requiring debridement surgery. These findings highlight diabetes as an important risk factor for worsened outcomes in patients with venomous snakebites, emphasizing the need for more focused care and intervention in this population.
