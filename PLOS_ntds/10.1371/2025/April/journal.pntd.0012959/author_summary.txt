Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of twenty complex diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect marginalised populations, causing severe health, social, and economic hardships. These diseases are characterised by interconnected biological, social, and environmental factors, often involving animal reservoirs, which complicates their prevention and control programmes. Addressing these challenges requires innovative and inclusive approaches. This scoping review explores the potential of transdisciplinary research (TDR) and participatory approaches in addressing the multifaceted challenges of NTDs. TDR brings together knowledge from multiple disciplines, while participatory methods actively involve affected individuals and communities in the co-creation of solutions. Together, these approaches encourage collaboration, improve public awareness, and address the broader social and environmental contexts influencing NTDs. By improving screening programmes and implementing effective control measures, TDR and participatory approaches can contribute to addressing the complexities of NTDs and reduce their burden. This review emphasises the value of involving diverse perspectives to create sustainable, community-centred interventions that improve the well-being of affected populations and provide actionable insights for researchers, practitioners and policymakers.
