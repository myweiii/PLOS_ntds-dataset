    "Introduction": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) comprise a group of twenty diverse diseases or conditions that pose significant public health challenges and adversely impact the quality of life of affected individuals. NTDs are characterised by interconnected biological, social, and environmental factors, which complicate their effective management and eradication. Collaborative research, such as transdisciplinary research (TDR) and participatory approaches that engage scientific, societal, and non-academic stakeholders in co-creating action-driven solutions offer promising strategies to address NTDs. These approaches bridge scientific research with community practices, ensuring evidence-based, contextually relevant interventions. Despite their potential, the application of these approaches in addressing NTDs remains underexplored. This scoping review explores the utilisation of TDR and participatory research approaches to address NTD-related challenges.",
    "Methods": "A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL, following the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Data extraction and analysis were performed using JBI SUMARI software, focusing on peer-reviewed published literature reporting the use of TDR and participatory approaches in NTDs, with an emphasis on individual and community perspectives.",
    "Results": "The review examined seventeen articles from Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia, highlighting the increasing use of TDR and participatory approaches to address common NTDs such as leprosy, schistosomiasis, rabies, Buruli ulcer, and trypanosomiasis. These approaches engaged diverse stakeholders to develop practical, community-oriented solutions. Key strategies included enhancing public awareness, improving screening programmes, and implementing measures to control NTDs. However, challenges such as fragmented strategies and weak health systems hindered efforts to reduce the burden of NTDs.",
    "Conclusion": "TDR and participatory approaches contribute to a holistic approach in addressing and managing NTD-related challenges by engaging diverse stakeholders and fostering a comprehensive understanding of community needs and on-the-ground realities. The findings demonstrate their effectiveness in translating evidence-informed knowledge into actionable interventions to benefit affected individuals and their communities."
