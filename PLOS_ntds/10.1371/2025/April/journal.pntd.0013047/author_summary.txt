Dengue is a growing concern and alarming public health problem in Bangladesh. Previously the dengue was endemic in Dhaka, Chattogram and Khulna divisions. But gradually it has spread throughout the country with higher incidence of deaths. Though, the government of Bangladesh advertising using Bangladesh television (BTV) channel about the sources of dengue, environment, transmissibility and availability of services and supports, people are still unaware about the associated factors thus causing dengue. On the other hand, government interventions such as destroying of breeding places and infected mosquitos, waste management and disposal, distribution of mosquito repellents, frequency of advertisement using most of the TV channels, accommodating optimum patients for both urban and rural community and overall health systems are not strong enough to prevent and control of dengue in Bangladesh. Furthermore, certain socio-demographic and behavioral factors are not being properly evaluated by government health wing. So, authors tried to extract the associated factors to provide recommendations to national and regional policy makers to develop awareness strategies and necessary actions to prevent and control of dengue in Mymensingh region, Bangladesh.
