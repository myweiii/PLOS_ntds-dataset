Neurocysticercosis (NCC) happens when the larvae from the pork tapeworm infect the central nervous system, especially the brain. About 30% of occurrences of epilepsy that are preventable in places where this parasite is prevalent are caused by this disease. Brain scans and blood testing are typically used in the diagnosis of NCC. The most effective blood test for this is unclear, though, and our area doesn’t often employ the available tests. Our goal in doing this study was to see how well brain scans and blood tests correlate for the diagnosis of NCC in people with epilepsy living in regions of Tanzania where the parasite is prevalent.
Based on our findings, combining several blood tests improve the precision of identifying individuals without NCC and lowers the possibility of false negative results. To ensure that diagnostic tests are effective in diagnosing the ailment, it’s critical to assess them using several methodologies.
