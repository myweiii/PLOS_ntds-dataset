Dengue Fever (DF) is a typical tropical disease transmitted via mosquito bites. COVID-19 lockdowns have altered human-mosquito contact patterns that impacted DF transmission. Additionally, lockdowns caused short-term environmental changes that affected DF vector breeding. In fact, during the COVID-19 period, the normal prevention and treatment of DF in many DF-endemic countries was negatively affected due to the sweep of COVID-19, such as strained allocation of medical resources and misreporting of cases. Therefore, this offers a unique chance to study the indirect impact of COVID-19 on DF transmission, guiding targeted and reasonable prevention measures. We used a series of analytical approaches including time series analysis, space-time scan statistics, and distributed lag non-linear model to compare the differences in DF transmission patterns and its exposure-response relationships with four environmental variables (average monthly precipitation, average monthly relative humidity, monthly maximum temperature, and monthly minimum temperature) before and during COVID-19 in three Southeast Asian (SEA) countries: Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand at the province scale. We found that the DF transmission pattern and its relationship with the environmental variables changed differently. For instance, seasonality and infections heightened in Singapore during COVID-19 and peak relative risk between max temperature and DF has rose significantly in Northern Thailand.
