    "Abstract": "The enforcement of COVID-19 interventions by diverse governmental bodies, coupled with the indirect impact of COVID-19 on short-term environmental changes (e.g., plant shutdowns lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions), influences the Dengue Fever (DF) vector. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on DF transmission and generate insights for targeted prevention measures. We aim to compare DF transmission patterns and the exposure-response relationship of environmental variables and DF incidence in the pre- and during-COVID-19 to identify variations and assess the indirect impact of COVID-19 on DF transmission. We initially visualized the overall trend of DF transmission from 2017-2022, then conducted two quantitative analyses to compare DF transmission pre-COVID-19 (2017–2019) and during-COVID-19 (2020–2022). These analyses included time series analysis to assess DF seasonality, and a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to quantify the exposure-response relationship between environmental variables and DF incidence. We observed a notable surge in Singapore during-COVID-19, particularly from May to August in 2020 and 2022, with cases multiplying several times compared to pre-COVID-19. All subregions in Thailand exhibited remarkable synchrony with a similar annual trend except 2021. Cyclic patterns remained generally consistent, but seasonal variability in Singapore has become increasingly pronounced. Monthly DF incidence in three countries varied significantly. Exposure-response relationships of DF and environmental variables show varying degrees of change, notably in Northern Thailand, where the peak relative risk for the maximum temperature-DF relationship rose from about 3–17, and the max RR of overall cumulative association 0–3 months of relative humidity increased from around 4–40. Our study is the first to compare DF transmission patterns and their relationship with environmental variables before and during COVID-19, demonstrating that the pandemic has affected DF transmission and altered the exposure-response relationship at both national and regional levels."
