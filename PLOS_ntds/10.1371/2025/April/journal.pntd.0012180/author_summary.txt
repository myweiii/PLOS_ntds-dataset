Malaria patients experience financial barriers when seeking care, despite free access to universal care in Malaysia. In some areas of Southeast Asia, multiple species of malaria can be present within the same setting, including recently emerged knowlesi malaria, which is spread from monkeys to humans via mosquitos. The economic burden of illness due to multiple species of malaria has not previously been estimated in the same setting. We collected data on the cost of illness to households in Sabah, Malaysia, to estimate their related total economic burden during the elimination phase of human-only malaria. Medical costs and time off work and usual activities were substantial in patients with the four species of malaria diagnosed during the time of this study. This research highlights the financial burden which households face when seeking care for malaria in Malaysia, despite the free treatment provided by the government.
