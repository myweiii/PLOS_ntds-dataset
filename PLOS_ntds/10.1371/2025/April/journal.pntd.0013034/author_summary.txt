Dengue has emerged as a significant global public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The escalating rate of DENV infections in endemic areas underscores the urgent need for studies involving larger datasets that integrate viral genomic information with clinical data to better understand patient outcomes and disease severity. Therefore, we conducted a clinico-genomics study using serum samples from dengue patients in the National Capital Region of Delhi, India, with the goal of understanding the evolution and genomic variability of the dominant serotype, DENV-2. By sequencing the whole genome of DENV-2, we identified a wide range of SNVs within the virus. We also captured key clinical features of the patients and integrated this clinical data with genomic information to explore how specific genomic variants may be linked to different disease severities, including mild, moderate, and severe forms of dengue. Our analysis revealed a significant burden of SNVs in DENV-2 genes, with specific hotspots in the E, NS4B, and NS5 regions being strongly associated with clinically severe disease outcomes. This integrative approach provides valuable insights into how viral genetic variations contribute to disease severity and can help improve future dengue surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies.
