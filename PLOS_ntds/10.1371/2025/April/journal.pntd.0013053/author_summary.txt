In this study, we explored the impact of left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) on survival in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of heart failure in Latin America and is increasingly recognized globally due to migration. We found that patients who experienced positive reverse remodeling (PRR), defined as an improvement in heart function, had a 55% lower risk of death or heart transplantation over a 15-year period compared to those with negative reverse remodeling (NRR). Notably, patients with larger left ventricular diameters, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and prior initiation of triple therapy were less likely to achieve PRR, suggesting a subgroup of non-responders to standard heart failure treatments. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection and tailored therapies to promote heart recovery in CCC patients. This research provides new insights into managing this challenging condition and underscores the need for further studies to explore novel treatments that could improve outcomes for these patients. By focusing on therapies that enhance heart recovery, we hope to reduce mortality and improve quality of life for individuals living with CCC and HFrEF.
