    "Background": "Chagas disease is a major health issue in Latin America and is now spreading globally because of migration. Chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) leads to heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR), defined as an improved LVEF, is associated with improved outcomes in patients with other HFrEF etiologies. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between LVRR and survival in CCC patients with an LVEF<40%.",
    "Methods": "This retrospective, single-center study included patients diagnosed with CCC and LVEF<40% between January 2006 and September 2021. Patients were divided into two groups: positive RR (PRR; LVEF≥40% or an absolute LVEF increase of ≥ 10%) and negative RR (NRR). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to account for baseline differences, and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to determine independent predictors of mortality and heart transplantation.",
    "Results": "A total of 1,043 patients were evaluated; 221 (21.2%) were classified as having PRR, and 822 (78.8%) were classified as having NRR. PRR status was associated with a 55% lower risk of all-cause mortality and heart transplantation over 15 years (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that predictors of total mortality and heart transplantation included NRR status, a worse NYHA class, lower serum sodium levels, larger LV dimensions, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The PRR predictors were smaller LV dimensions, less mitral regurgitation, and the absence of triple therapy at baseline. NRR patients were more likely to be on triple therapy at baseline.",
    "Conclusions": "PRR improves survival in CCC patients with HFrEF. Identifying patients with potential for LVRR, alongside early therapeutic interventions, may reduce mortality in this population. Future research should focus on therapies that promote LVRR in patients with CCC."
