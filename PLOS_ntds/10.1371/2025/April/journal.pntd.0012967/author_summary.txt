The epidemiology of strongyloidiasis – a neglected infection caused by the soil-transmitted nematode, Strongyloides stercoralis – remains largely understudied in remote tropical communities due to the lack of practical and sensitive diagnostic tests. Serology has been increasingly used for diagnosis at the individual and population levels, but few longitudinal antibody datasets are currently available. Here, we characterize the dynamics of anti-Strongyloides IgG antibody response among 426 residents in farming settlements in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. The overall seropositivity rate was 51.8% and rose from 45.9% in 2010 to 61.1% in 2013, with an average of 24.5 seroconversion events per 100 person-years of follow-up, consistent with an intense exposure to new infections over four years. Specific IgG responses persisted for at least 12 months in most seropositive study participants, especially among those with high baseline antibody levels, but one-third of low-level antibody responses were transient in the absence of specific anthelminthic treatment with ivermectin. The overall seroreversion rate was 18.1 events per 100 person-years of follow-up. We suggest that repeated antibody testing can be useful for identifying new S. stercoralis infections and monitoring epidemiological trends of human strongyloidiasis in remote populations.
