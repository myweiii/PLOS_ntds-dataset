Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a significant public health concern in Zambia, particularly among cattle farmers who handle and consume raw milk and undercooked meat. The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey among cattle farmers, abattoir workers, cattle businessmen, human doctors, and veterinarians. Quantitative data found that cattle farmers demonstrated poor awareness of bTB transmission, with 75.3% of males and 70.3% of females expressing inadequate knowledge. A significant proportion (85.7%) of cattle farmers lacked formal education, contributing to low knowledge levels. Human doctors and veterinarians exhibited excellent knowledge (100%) of bTB, while abattoir workers demonstrated good knowledge (78.3%) and cattle businessmen showed fair knowledge (96.4%). Qualitative data found that people in the study areas consume unpasteurized milk. It was further, revealed that they handle meat with bare hands, sell uninspected meat, and consume undercooked meat.
Therefore, the researchers, suggested that there is a need to launch public awareness campaigns through various media channels to educate the general public about bTB risks and prevention measures. Integrate bTB awareness into the curriculum of local schools to educate young people about the disease, and strengthen the enforcement of meat inspection regulations to ensure that all meat sold in markets is inspected and certified by veterinary authorities.
