HIV-associated Talaromyces marneffei fungemia (HTMF) is a severe fungal infection with high mortality rates in people living with HIV (PLWH). Current guidelines recommend amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) as the standard induction therapy. However, its use is often limited due to serious side effects such as kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances. Voriconazole, a newer antifungal drug, has been considered as an alternative due to its broader antifungal activity and fewer side effects. Our study, involving 315 patients across multiple centers, suggests that AmBd is superior to voriconazole in reducing 180-day mortality rates of HTMF. Early initiation of AmBd or early switch from voriconazole to AmBd significantly improved survival, despite the higher incidence of side effects. Our research highlights the need to balance drug efficacy with side effect management in treating severe Talaromyces marneffei infection.
