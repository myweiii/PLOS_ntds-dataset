Parasites communicate with their host via small membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can shuttle cargo and thus information between cells. The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica releases EVs but not much is known about their role in the interaction with the host immune system. Infection with E. histolytica can lead to amebic liver abscess (ALA) formation. Innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, contribute to liver damage by releasing microbicidal factors. Men have a more severe ALA pathology as the result of a stronger monocyte immune response. In this study, we analyzed the effect of EVs from differently virulent E. histolytica clones on monocytes to better understand their interaction. EVs of both clones were similar in size and quantity but differed in their cargo, which provides information on factors potentially involved in pathogenicity. Monocytes responded to EVs of both clones in a pro-inflammatory manner that reflected the immune processes occurring during ALA in vivo, including the bias towards the male sex. Only EVs of amebae with low pathogenicity, and not those released by the highly pathogenic clone, elicited secretion of the granular enzyme myeloperoxidase, which plays a protective role during ALA. Overall, our data suggest that EVs may contribute to liver injury.
