    "Abstract": "The parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs), but so far little is known about their function in the interaction with the host immune system. Infection with E. histolytica trophozoites can lead to formation of amebic liver abscesses (ALAs), in which pro-inflammatory immune responses of Ly6Chi monocytes contribute to liver damage. Men exhibit a more severe pathology as the result of higher monocyte recruitment and a stronger immune response. To investigate the role of EVs and pathogenicity in the host immune response, we studied the effect of EVs secreted by low pathogenic EhA1 and highly pathogenic EhB2 amebae on monocytes. Size and quantity of isolated EVs from both clones were similar. However, they differed in their proteome and miRNA cargo, providing insight into factors potentially involved in amebic pathogenicity. In addition, EVs were enriched in proteins with signaling peptides compared with the total protein content of trophozoites. Exposure to EVs from both clones induced monocyte activation and a pro-inflammatory immune response as evidenced by increased surface presentation of the activation marker CD38 and upregulated gene expression of key signaling pathways (including NF-ÎºB, IL-17 and TNF signaling). The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in EV-stimulated monocytes and more so in male- than in female-derived cells. While EhA1 EV stimulation caused elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) release by both monocytes and neutrophils, EhB2 EV stimulation did not, indicating the protective role of MPO during amebiasis. Collectively, our results suggest that parasite-released EVs contribute to the male-biased immunopathology mediated by pro-inflammatory monocytes during ALA formation."
