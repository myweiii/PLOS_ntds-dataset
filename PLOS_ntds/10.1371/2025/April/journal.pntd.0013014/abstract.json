    "Abstract": "The 2023–24 epidemic of Oropouche fever in the Americas and the associated ongoing outbreak in Cuba suggests a potential state shift in the epidemiology of the disease, raising questions about which vectors are driving transmission. In this study, we conduct a systematic review of vector competence experiments with Oropouche virus (OROV, Orthobunyavirus) that were published prior to the 2023–24 epidemic season. Only seven studies were published by September 2024, highlighting the chronic neglect that Oropouche virus (like many other orthobunyaviruses) has been subjected to since its discovery in 1954. Two species of midge (Culicoides paraensis and C. sonorensis) consistently demonstrate a high competence to transmit OROV (~30%), while mosquitoes (including both Aedes and Culex spp.) exhibited an infection rate consistently below ~20%, and showed limited OROV transmission. Further research is needed to establish which vectors are involved in the ongoing outbreak in Cuba, and whether local vectors and wildlife communities create any risk of establishment in non-endemic regions."
