Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is a spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax-like disease in mammals. Utilizing the New Zealand white (NZW) rabbit inhalation model, this study demonstrates that aerosol exposure to Bcbva Cameroon (CA) or Cote dâ€™Ivoire (CI) spores results in anthrax-like disease and mortality similar to that observed for Bacillus anthracis. The inhalational median lethal doses of Bcbva CA and CI, times to signs of disease, expression of virulence factors, and terminal bacterial burden were similar to that reported for B. anthracis. Biological samples taken during the course of infection and plated on agar media indicated that Bcbva CA and CI had variations in colony morphology depending on the sample time post-exposure. The time to a significant increase in body temperature (SIBT) and death was dependent upon inhaled dose, with SIBT predictive of death in all animals challenged with either strain. Anthrax medical countermeasure (MCM) efficacy was also evaluated in the aerosol exposure model. Pre-exposure vaccination with Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed and post-exposure prophylaxis with levofloxacin (7-day treatment) with or without vaccination were effective treatments for Bcbva anthrax-like disease. This study will enhance our understanding of Bcbva, the anthrax-like disease that it causes, and inform treatment options.
