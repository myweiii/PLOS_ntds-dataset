Melioidosis, a disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, represented a significant health risk in tropical and subtropical regions due to its high mortality rate and sudden outbreaks. This study explored the hypothesis that climate and geography affected the spread of melioidosis in southern Taiwan. We found that specific environmental conditions, such as heavy rainfall and strong winds in certain hilly areas, increased the risk of exposure to airborne B. pseudomallei. Higher infection rates were linked to riverbank repairs following severe typhoon-induced flooding. Outbreaks often occurred when rainfall exceeded 200â€‰mm and wind gust speeds surpassed 20 m/sec, conditions commonly associated with typhoons. Wind direction also influenced bacterial spread, as seasonal southwesterly winds shifted to typhoon-driven northwesterly winds, but the hills served as a barrier, limiting the spread of aerosolized bacteria beyond these regions. Seropositivity to B. pseudomallei was higher in populations north of the hills than in those to the south. These findings highlighted the importance of environmental monitoring in controlling infectious diseases affected by climate and geography, especially in areas prone to extreme weather.
