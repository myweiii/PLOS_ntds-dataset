Invasive Non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) can cause serious, life-threatening, and invasive infections, posing great challenges to public health. We have provided a comprehensive and latest evaluation of the global burden of iNTS infections based on Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2021. Among all age groups, the global burden of iNTS infections was most notable in childhood. The global burden of iNTS infections was more significant in the low- and low-middle SDI quintiles. Changes in the iNTS burden were primarily driven by population growth and epidemiological changes. SDI-related inequalities across countries were relieved over time. The findings underscore the substantial challenges in managing and controlling iNTS-associated diseases, notably the increasing number of cases and the global disparities in its distribution. These insights can guide the development of public health policies and effective allocation of medical resources, and highlights the imperative for the development and implementation of age- and regionally-targeted interventions to ameliorate the global iNTS-associated burden.
