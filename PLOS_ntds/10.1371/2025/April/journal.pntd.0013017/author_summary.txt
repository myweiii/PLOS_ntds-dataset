Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a neglected tropical disease, is the second leading cause of disability globally after leprosy. It is endemic in resource-poor regions with inadequate sanitation and weak vector control measures, significantly impairing the physical, mental, and social well-being of affected populations while exacerbating poverty. Since the Global Programme for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000, several Asian countries have successfully eliminated LF as a public health problem. However, a small number of countries continue to face a high risk of infection.
This study analyzed LF prevalence, disease burden, and demographic variations across different countries and regions, considering age, sex, and geographic disparities. The findings suggest that while substantial progress has been made in eliminating LF globally and nationally, the disease burden remains concentrated in underdeveloped regions. Moreover, the study identified priority endemic areas for intervention, providing a valuable foundation for developing effective health policies and intervention strategies.
