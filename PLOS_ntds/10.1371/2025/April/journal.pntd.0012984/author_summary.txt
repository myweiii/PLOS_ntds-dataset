Urban arbovirus transmission exhibits spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Focusing on dengue, we employed statistical models that account for spatiotemporal variability to provide a realistic assessment of transmission dynamics. By using dengue case data from Natal, RN (2015â€“2018) and incorporating entomological, climatic, and sociosanitary indicators, we forecasted case counts for the following four weeks. Our analysis identified significant correlations between increased dengue risk and key factors: reported cases in the previous week, the Aedes egg positivity index, and mean daytime temperature from preceding weeks. High-risk neighborhoods with persistent dengue transmission were pinpointed, emphasizing areas for targeted interventions. This Bayesian space-time approach supports operational control efforts by identifying priority areas and clarifying how various factors influence dengue transmission. The findings have significant public health implications, enabling more precise, proactive strategies to mitigate the incidence and impact of urban arboviruses.
