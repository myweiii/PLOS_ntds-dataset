Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic subcutaneous infection caused by black fungi such as Fonsecaea monophora (F. monophora), known for its low cure rate, high recurrence, and prolonged treatment. Neutrophils, key players in innate immunity, play a crucial role in defending against fungal infections. This study investigated the function of neutrophils in host defense against F. monophora using a neutrophil-depleted mouse model and in vitro experiments. Results showed that neutrophil depletion impaired fungal clearance and prolonged inflammation in infected tissues, emphasizing their critical role in controlling F. monophora infection. Histopathological analysis revealed extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, particularly macrophages. Neutrophils also inhibited the fungal transition from conidia to hyphae and sclerotic-like cells. Notably, the F. monophora morphology was also associated with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in vitro experiments. These findings reveal the importance of neutrophils in early fungal clearance and morphology regulation, offering insights into immune mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies targeting neutrophil-mediated responses for CBM.
