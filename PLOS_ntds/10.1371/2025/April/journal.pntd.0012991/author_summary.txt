Urogenital schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that can substantially harm the urinary tract. Growing availability of ultrasound data in regions where urogenital schistosomiasis is prevalent indicates that the disease causes relevant urinary tract pathology already in very young children. In our study, we used ultrasound and urine microscopy to investigate 105 patients across age groups with urogenital schistosomiasis in Lambaréné, Gabon. We found thickening of the urinary bladder wall in a high proportion of preschool-age children. Damage of the upper urinary tract (kidneys or ureters) was detected in children as young as three years old. Infection intensity, measured by urine egg count, was highest in preschool-age children, and patients with higher egg counts were more likely to show pathology of the urinary tract. In some patients, pathology persisted three months after antiparasitic treatment. Our findings show that very young children can be affected by urogenital schistosomiasis and therefore require special attention in disease control programs and individual patient care.
