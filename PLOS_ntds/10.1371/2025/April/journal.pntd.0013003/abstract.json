    "Background": "Pythiosis caused by Pythium insidiosum, is a rare but deadly infectious disease that is often underrecognized. The disease has high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in vascular forms where surgical resection is necessary. A previous study demonstrated low awareness and knowledge of vascular pythiosis among Thai medical personnel. There is an urgent need to improve disease recognition given that vascular pythiosis is very prevalent in Thailand.",
    "Methods": "This study aimed to enhance knowledge and disease recognition about vascular pythiosis among Thai medical personnel and the public through a self-paced, asynchronous, open-access online course. The course included seven video lessons and was available from February to July 2023. Participants’ knowledge was assessed using pretest and posttest analysis.",
    "Results": "A total of 428 participants completed the course. Participants showed significant knowledge improvement, with mean posttest scores substantially higher than pretest scores, 6.77 vs. 3.46 (p-value < 0.01). Higher educational level had a positive impact with higher pretest and posttest scores, but the delta scores between the posttest and pretest of all groups were comparable. Moreover, 80% of participants demonstrated knowledge gain. However, participants of all groups scored the lowest on the posttest in diagnostic investigation field.",
    "Conclusions": "Very low pretest scores underline the neglected problem of vascular pythiosis. This asynchronous online course successfully enhanced participants’ knowledge about vascular pythiosis. Future efforts should focus on collaborative initiatives at the government and university levels to emphasize disease recognition."
