Human pythiosis is an infectious disease caused by a fungal-like organism, Pythium insidiosum. The vascular form is the deadliest manifestation compared to cutaneous and ocular pythiosis. Thailand has reported the highest number of vascular pythiosis cases globally. However, vascular pythiosis remains primarily recognized by medical personnel in specialized fields. Achieving a definitive diagnosis remains challenging, and rapid diagnostic tests are currently under the research. This reflects a bidirectional dilemmaâ€”diagnostic challenges contribute to high case fatality rates, while under-recognition further delays diagnosis. This study aimed to enhance disease recognition and knowledge of vascular pythiosis among both medical professionals and the general public in Thailand through a self-access online course, conducted by experts with clinical and research experiences in the disease. The online course serves as a foundation step in addressing the knowledge gap and establishing an educational resource on vascular pythiosis in Thailand. Knowledge gain was assessed through a pretest-posttest comparison. The results highlighted the issue of neglect and provided valuable data to support the development of future educational initiatives, with contents adaptable to different target audiences.
