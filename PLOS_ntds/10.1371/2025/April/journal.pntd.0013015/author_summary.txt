Cysticercosis is a significant foodborne zoonotic parasitic disease, and it is also a neglected disease. It has excellent immune evasion ability and complex evasion mechanisms (antigen simulation and camouflage, plasma membrane isolation, immunosuppression, etc.), which is one of the important reasons why the disease is still prevalent. This study investigated the possible roles of Cysticercus cellulosae Annexin B1 and Annexin B2 in the invasion of hosts and immune evasion by Cysticercus cellulosae. We found that its coagulation function showed inconsistent effects compared to previous studies. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of an invertebrate annexin facilitating plasma membrane repair. This has opened up new ideas for the prevention and control of Cysticercus cellulosae, as well as for the development of drug targets. In conclusion, this study provides new perspectives and valuable clues for further elucidation of the invasion mechanism of Cysticercus cellulosae.
