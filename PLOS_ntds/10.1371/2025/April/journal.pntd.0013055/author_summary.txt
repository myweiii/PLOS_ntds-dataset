Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a parasite that infects multiple host species and is present in a wide range of environments. The Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo (FPZSP), current Coordenadoria de Fauna Silvestre (CFS), is located in a large and preserved fragment of the Atlantic rainforest in one of the largest metropolis in the world. The premise of four T. cruzi autochthonous cases in captive animals led us to investigate the infection not only in captive fauna, but also in wildlife mammals and vectors in the surrounding area through parasitological, serological and molecular tests. Almost all examined kissing bugs, half of the captured Didelphis aurita opossums and approximately a quarter of the FPZSP/CFS captive animals tested were infected by T. cruzi and two distinct genotypes of the parasite (TcI and TcII) were identified. The autochthonous cases (animals born in captivity and with no history of displacement) and the high infection rates confirm local transmission of T. cruzi. The interaction between kissing bugs and infected free-living opossums from the surrounding areas with the FPZSP captive mammals is the main hypothesis that explains the infection in the zoo mammals.
