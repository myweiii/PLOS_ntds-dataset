Onchocerciasis remains a public health concern in Tanzania, despite over two decades of mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. This study examines the MDA coverage in Ulanga District and identifies factors influencing drug uptake. Using a cross-sectional survey of 502 participants, we found that treatment coverage varied across villages, with some failing to reach the WHO-recommended 80% threshold for transmission interruption. Key barriers to MDA participation included younger age, recent migration, certain occupations (e.g., students, small business workers), and lack of awareness about MDA benefits and scheduling. Fear of ivermectin’s side effects and misconceptions further reduced uptake. However, individuals who believed in ivermectin’s preventive benefits were significantly more likely to participate. Our findings highlight the need for improved health communication, targeted engagement strategies for young and migrant populations, and consideration of alternative treatments to expand coverage to excluded groups such as pregnant women and children under five. Addressing these challenges through enhanced community mobilization and tailored interventions is crucial to achieving onchocerciasis elimination. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing MDA programs in Tanzania and other endemic regions striving to meet elimination targets
