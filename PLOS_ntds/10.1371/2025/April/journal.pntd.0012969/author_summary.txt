Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms, affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The drug praziquantel is the frontline treatment for this disease, but alternative therapies are needed to address the potential emergence of drug resistance. In this study, we revisit an old antischistosomal compound, meclonazepam, which belongs to a chemical series (benzodiazepines) which have promise for further development as schistosomiasis therapies. Following meclonazepam treatment we were able to observe biochemical readouts of worm death (pro-apoptotic caspase activation), indicating effective schistocidal activity. Drug-evoked changes in gene expression were then measured, showing that many transcripts affected by meclonazepam exposure are unique to parasitic flatworms. Many gene products with differential expression also have putative direct or indirect interactions with the host immune system. Finally, we tested meclonazepamâ€™s ability to kill both praziquantel-susceptible and praziquantel-resistant populations of schistosomes. The drug was equally effective at killing both groups of parasites, suggesting that benzodiazepines could be developed as valuable alternative therapies in the fight against schistosomiasis.
