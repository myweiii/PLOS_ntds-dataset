Despite the decline in leprosy cases in recent years, the incidence rate has stagnated, indicating that the transmission has not yet been broken. New approaches to reducing the number of cases and curbing disease transmission, such as early case detection, clinical contact examination and chemoprophylaxis, are now being recommended. In leprosy control, rifampicin chemoprophylaxis for contacts of patients is a preventive intervention that can prevent the transmission of infection among household members. We report here the experience of an intervention-oriented study in four leprosy-endemic localities in Benin. We first assessed the leprosy contacts knowledge of the disease, the acceptability and feasibility of single-dose rifampicin (SDR) before administering it to those who gave informed consent. Of these contacts, 58.6% agreed to receive chemoprophylaxis and were willing to take the necessary time for treatment and travel long distances to take the drug as often as possible. However, contacts who lived alone who werenâ€™t educated and had little knowledge of leprosy were more likely to refuse chemoprophylaxis with SDR. It is therefore important to improve education and knowledge of the disease to contribute to the acceptance of chemoprophylaxis.
