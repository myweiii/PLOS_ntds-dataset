Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has emerged as a significant public health concern in Zhejiang province, with cases rising from 9 in 2011â€“1,103 in 2022. The incidence exhibited clear seasonality, peaking between April and August. Additionally, the cases also showed spatial clustering, particularly in the hilly regions of eastern Zhejiang. Our study identified key ecoclimatic factors such as mean temperature of the wettest quarter and annual precipitation as significant contributors to SFTS occurrence using boosted regression trees (BRT). The model accurately predicted high-risk areas, including Daishan County, Linhai City, and Tiantai County, aligning with reported cases. These findings underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and preventive measures, particularly in western, southern, and northern Zhejiang, to mitigate the growing threat of SFTS.
