Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae, which primarily spreads through contaminated water. It remains a global health issue, especially in regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean drinking water, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Although a lot of research has been done, it is still unclear how new pathogenic strains emerge from the environment and persist in endemic areas. Most studies focused on O1 and O139 serogroups associated with pandemic outbreaks, leaving a knowledge gap about non-O1/O139 strains and their role in cholera transmission and genetic evolution. In this study, we conducted genomic analysis of non-O1/O139 V. cholerae isolated from environmental water sources in Northern Cameroon. Our findings reveal that these strains are genetically diverse and closely related to environmental and clinical strains from Kenya and Argentina, suggesting transmissions across different geographical regions, possibly through human carriers. The presence of conserved virulence genes, including the tcpA gene closely related to the O1 Classical type, indicates their potential to cause infections. This study highlights the importance of expanding cholera surveillance to include non-O1/O139 strains, as they may play a bigger role in cholera transmission than previously thought.
