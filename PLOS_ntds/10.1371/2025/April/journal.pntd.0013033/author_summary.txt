Our study investigates the auditory outcomes of prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure, with a specific focus on hearing loss in children exposed to ZIKV during fetal life. Over a longitudinal follow-up of four years, this study evaluated children from a well-characteri cohort in Pernambuco, Brazil, who had normal neonatal hearing screening through auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing. We did not find evidence of late-onset sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) among children with prenatal ZIKV exposure. Transient hearing impairments observed were attributed to middle ear conditions, such as effusions, rather than to persistent or progressive sensorineural damage. These results emphasize that children exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy, particularly those without microcephaly, are not at increased risk of long-term auditory deficits, providing evidence for refining clinical follow-up strategies.
