Uveitis comprises a broad group of intraocular inflammatory diseases that can be infectious or non-infectious. Together, they can cause up to 20% of legal blindness in first-world countries and even more in developing countries. Ocular toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious posterior uveitis. Atypical presentations of ocular toxoplasmosis, such as PORT, may often be misdiagnosed, which can cause severe ocular complications that negatively impact the patientâ€™s quality of vision and life. The aim of this paper is to emphasize that ocular toxoplasmosis may present in typical or atypical variants. Even though atypical presentations are less frequent, they can be equally or even more dangerous than the classic variant if not diagnosed and treated promptly.
