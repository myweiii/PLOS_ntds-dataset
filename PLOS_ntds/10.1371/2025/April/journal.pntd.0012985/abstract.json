    "Background": "The identification of B-cell epitopes (BCEs) is fundamental to advancing epitope-based vaccine design, therapeutic antibody development, and diagnostics, such as in neglected tropical diseases caused by parasitic pathogens. However, the structural complexity of parasite antigens and the high cost of experimental validation present certain challenges. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven protein engineering, particularly through machine learning and deep learning, offer efficient solutions to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce experimental costs.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Here, we present deepBCE-Parasite, a Transformer-based deep learning model designed to predict linear BCEs from peptide sequences. By leveraging a state-of-the-art self-attention mechanism, the model achieved remarkable predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately 81% and an AUC of 0.90 in both 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing. Comparative analyses against 12 handcrafted features and four conventional machine learning algorithms (GNB, SVM, RF, and LGBM) highlighted the superior predictive power of the model. As a case study, deepBCE-Parasite predicted eight BCEs from the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) protein in Fasciola hepatica proteomic data. Dot-blot immunoassays confirmed the specific binding of seven synthetic peptides to positive sera, validating their IgG reactivity and demonstrating the modelâ€™s efficacy in BCE prediction.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "deepBCE-Parasite demonstrates excellent performance in predicting BCEs across diverse parasitic pathogens, offering a valuable tool for advancing the design of epitope-based vaccines, antibodies, and diagnostic applications in parasitology."
