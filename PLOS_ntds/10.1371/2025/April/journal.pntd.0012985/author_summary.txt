Antigen-antibody interactions are critical events in the humoral immune response, facilitating the recognition and neutralization of invasive parasites. BCEs, defined as surface-exposed clusters of amino acids recognized by B-cell receptors or antibodies, play a critical role in initiating a humoral immune response. This study focuses on the identification of parasite BCEs, which serve as promising targets for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostic tools. To this end, we developed a deep learning model, termed deepBCE-Parasite, which was rigorously benchmarked against and integrated with traditional machine learning models. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI techniques, these models enable rapid and precise BCE identification directly from amino acid sequences, rendering it particularly suitable for large-scale epitope screening. As a proof-of-concept, we applied these AI-driven models to predict BCEs in F. hepatica, a globally distributed parasite responsible for fascioliasis, a neglected tropical disease. Utilizing available proteomics data of this trematode species, we identified peptides exhibiting high specificity for antibody binding. This work highlights the potential of AI in advancing epitope prediction within parasitology, providing a rapid, scalable, and cost-effective strategy for discovering immune targets.
