To combat soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis a school-based preventive chemotherapy program has been operating since 2013 and 2014, respectively, in the Angolan provinces of Huambo, Uige and Zaire. The program was informed by a prevalence survey conducted in 2014 followed by an impact assessment in 2021. This analysis sought to develop spatial risk predictions of STHs and schistosomiasis using data collected from the 2014 and 2021 surveys, in conjunction with environmental and climatic factors, to improve understanding of how the epidemiology of STHs and schistosomiasis has changed in the context of the program. Our study shows that there have been slight reductions in higher-risk areas for schistosomiasis and STH infections in Huambo. However, there is a concerning trend for expanding areas of high STH infection risk throughout Uige province and the evolution of co-endemic schistosomiasis and STH infection hotspots in Zaire that should be prioritized for targeted interventions.
