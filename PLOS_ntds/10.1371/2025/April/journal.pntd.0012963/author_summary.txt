Typhoid fever, a deadly disease linked to contaminated water and inadequate sanitation, poses a serious threat in Pakistan. This threat has been exacerbated by the spread of an extensively drug-resistant typhoid strain that emerged in Sindh Province through acquisition of a resistance gene that severely limits antibiotic treatment options. Bacteria like Salmonella Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, often attach to surfaces and aggregate to form protected communities known as biofilms. In water environments, biofilm can entrap other pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms and can intermittently detach from surfaces, potentially releasing large doses of bacteria into water systems. Little is known about the existence of Salmonella Typhi in environmental biofilm; therefore, we investigated whether Salmonella Typhi was present in drinking water, wastewater, or associated biofilm and determined the prevalence of the resistance gene associated with the extensively drug-resistant strain. We detected Salmonella Typhi in drinking water biofilm and wastewater. We also detected the gene associated with the extensively drug-resistant typhoid strain in all sample types. Our findings underscore the potential role of biofilm as a reservoir for typhoid bacteria and multidrug resistance genes and highlight the urgency of addressing biofilm-related transmission routes to combat typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases.
