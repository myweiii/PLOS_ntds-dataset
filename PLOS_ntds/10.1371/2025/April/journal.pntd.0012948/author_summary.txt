Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease that has been classified as a neglected tropical disease. In Chile, there are epidemiological situations of high, medium and low endemicity, with an increase in incidence towards the south of the country, where more than 50% of sheep population is concentrated. The disease mainly affects individuals residing in rural settings. The migration of rural human populations, together with small flocks of sheep, to peri-urban areas has led to an expansion in the geographical distribution of the disease. The present study employed mathematical modeling and computer simulations to investigate the impact of dog, sheep and human mobility on the transmission and spread of cystic echinococcosis. Our findings indicate that the number of dogs, sheep and humans infected in the domestic cycle of the disease is higher when considering their mobility between peri-urban, urban, and rural areas. Our model provides insights into the role of host mobility in the transmission and spread of cystic echinococcosis, which could inform strategies for controlling infection in dogs and sheep and reducing human infections.
