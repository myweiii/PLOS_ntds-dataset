Brucellosis is a serious zoonotic disease affecting people worldwide, and its diagnosis has always been challenging. Traditional diagnostic methods typically rely on lipopolysaccharides (LPS) antigen, which are not only complex and costly to prepare but also may present issues with cross-reactivity. In this study, we utilized bioinformatics techniques to predict the immunogenic epitopes of Brucella outer membrane proteins and designed a multi-epitope fusion protein. By conducting indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) on 100 positive and 96 negative serum samples, we evaluated the performance of this fusion protein in the diagnosis of brucellosis and found that it significantly outperforms traditional LPS antigen in reducing cross-reactivity. This not only saves time but also avoids the preparation of LPS antigen, making the diagnostic process safer and more convenient.
