Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected disease that mainly affects the most vulnerable populations in tropical and subtropical countries. The disease causes lesions on the skin and mucous membranes that can lead to physical effects, functional impairment and loss of productivity, as well as psychological and economic impacts on individuals. Although the disease is common in some regions, there are few treatment options, many of which are toxic and require monitoring. Many patients are referred to specialised services that receive patients from different regions to diagnose and treat the disease. In this study, patients at a referral centre were asked about the out-of-pocket expenses they have to pay while receiving treatment for CL that are not covered by the health system, such as transport, food, medicines, services and absence from work. The results of these studies will be important in measuring costs from the patientâ€™s perspective and understanding the impact that costs during treatment for CL can have on family income.
