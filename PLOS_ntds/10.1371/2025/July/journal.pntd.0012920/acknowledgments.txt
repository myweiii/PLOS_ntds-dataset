We would like to thank our community scientists from Texas and Florida who participated in the program. We would also like to thank our lab volunteers from Florida: Bernardo Peniche, Sebastian Botero, Stephanie Katircioglu, Yasmin Tavares, Joshua Demetrius, Elizabeth Garcia, Madison Heisey and public community members for all their hard work and assistance in triatomine collections during our active manual searching in the field. We would also like to thank Bernardo Peniche for taking photos included in this paper.
