Triatomines, which can spread Chagas disease to humans and other animals, are found throughout many U.S. states. Little is known about triatomines in Florida â€“ our study aimed to learn more about where triatomines can be found in Florida, how often they are infected with the parasite that causes Chagas disease, and which animals triatomines feed on in Florida, including humans. From 2013-2023, utilizing our own field work and community science programs, we collected 310 triatomines from various regions in Florida. Both adult and immature triatomines were found, and about one-third of the triatomines were found inside human homes (35%). About 30% of the triatomines tested were infected with the Chagas disease parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. Blood-fed triatomines mostly fed on mammals (60%, including humans), amphibians (27%), and reptiles (11%), but not on birds. Nearly a quarter of bugs (23%) had fed on human blood. Our research raises concerns for possible transmission of Chagas disease to humans from triatomines in Florida.
