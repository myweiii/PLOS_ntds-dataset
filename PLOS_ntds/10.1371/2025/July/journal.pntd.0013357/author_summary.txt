Mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika pose growing public health challenges in many parts of Africa, but limited surveillance makes it difficult to assess their true burden. We conducted a serosurvey in Dire Dawa, a city in eastern Ethiopia that has experienced outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya. Blood samples from 339 individuals were tested for antibodies to dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. We found high levels of prior exposure to dengue (76%) and chikungunya (44%), and observed apparent Zika virus antibodies in 38% of participants. Since antibodies can cross-react between related viruses, we interpret the Zika findings with caution and consider them hypothesis-generating. In contrast, we found low evidence of exposure in a separate sample from Addis Ababa, a city with no known history of arbovirus outbreaks. These results highlight the importance of community-based serosurveillance for detecting overlooked transmission and guiding targeted prevention strategies in urban African settings.
