Dengue has dramatically spread globally, which occurs almost every year, especially in the topical areas. In Thailand, the outbreak of dengue occurs almost every year. The spatial distribution of the outbreak of the areas on a small scale has not been investigated in the southernmost provinces. Using the concept of the combination of occurrence and intensity of the disease is an effective method to capture the hot spot areas by understanding the pattern of spreads and also the areas that need to be focused on by health experts to eliminate the spread of the disease. The results from this study revealed that the occurrence decreased with age, but the intensity was high in adolescents and the elderly. During the period of 2008â€“2021 three episodes occurred. Most of the hot spot areas were the urban districts in Songkhla and Narathiwat with some districts in the border. The study suggests that identifying high-risk areas and monitoring dengue cases can help healthcare departments develop effective public health strategies for dengue control.
