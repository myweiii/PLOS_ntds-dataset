The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus Orthoflavivirus, which causes severe encephalitis in humans, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. JEV is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected female Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes and can be classified into five different genotypes (GIâ€“GV) that are closely related by envelope gene sequences. Little is known about the evolution, geographical distribution, and epidemiology of these genotypes in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the potential implications for public health. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of mosquito populations and investigated the epidemiology of JEV genotypes in the ROK between 2017 and 2022. While Cx. tritaeniorhynchus is widely recognized as the primary vector of JEV in Asia, the western Pacific, and other regions, the detection of genotype V (GV) in several mosquito species in this study suggests a potential shift in vector dynamics. Furthermore, these findings indicate the possible re-emergence of GV in Asian countries following its initial isolation in Malaysia in 1952. Consequently, it is imperative to enhance vector surveillance for JEV detection and develop more effective diagnostic tools for genotype V-associated Japanese encephalitis are imperative.
