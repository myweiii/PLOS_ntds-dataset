This study investigated the application of wastewater surveillance for detection of S. Typhi. Wastewater surveillance is of increasing interest for public health as a potential lower-cost alternative or complement to clinical surveillance. As well as confirming if S. Typhi is present in a sample, obtaining sequence information would allow the genotype and antimicrobial resistance present to be determined. Culturing S. Typhi from wastewater samples is difficult, preventing the application of traditional sequencing approaches using culture isolates. We therefore developed an amplicon sequencing protocol with a primer scheme targeting known genotype-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms and AMR genes that we tested on samples in south India.
This was implemented as a targeted multiplex PCR using four primer panels, with sequencing of the products performed on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION. We were able to identify the genotype and AMR profile for 8 of 110 samples previously shown by quantitative PCR to contain S. Typhi gene targets (ttr, staG, and tviB).
The results from this study show promise for the application of targeted next-generation sequencing to characterise S. Typhi in wastewater.
