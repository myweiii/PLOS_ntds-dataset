    "Background": "Estimates of the burden of typhoid fever due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) rely on data from clinical surveillance, which is rarely done in low income settings and is also limited by the poor sensitivity of the assays used and the reliance on health seeking by patients. Environmental surveillance for S. Typhi shed by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in wastewater offers a sensitive surveillance tool that could help to inform burden estimates. Sequencing S. Typhi direct from wastewater concentrates has the potential to identify circulating genotypes and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, supporting public health interventions such as vaccination and antimicrobial usage.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "We designed a multiplex targeted amplicon sequencing protocol for genotyping and determining AMR in S. Typhi from wastewater samples, targeting SNPs that identify genotypes of interest and both chromosomal and plasmid-borne AMR. PCR products were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION, and genotypes and AMR identified using the GenoTyphi program.",
    "Conclusions": "In this study, we provide proof of concept data for amplicon sequencing of S. Typhi in wastewater which with further optimisation could be used to complement clinical surveillance data or provide data on S. Typhi presence in the absence of clinical surveillance. This information can inform public health interventions, and the concept could be applied to other pathogens of interest for genotyping from environmental surveillance samples."
