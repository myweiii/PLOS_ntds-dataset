    "Abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with neurological and cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, arrhythmias and thrombotic events. This study evaluated the thrombotic and oxidative responses induced by ZIKV in cardiac cells and immunocompetent mice. Cardiac (H9c2) and vascular smooth muscle (A7r5) cell lines were infected with ZIKV and analyzed for viral replication, cytopathic effects and oxidative stress. In vivo, female FVB/N mice were inoculated with ZIKV and cardiac tissue was analyzed for markers of myocardial damage, prothrombotic enzymes and oxidative stress. H9c2 cells demonstrated higher viral replication and cytopathic effects than A7r5 cells. ZIKV-infected cells exhibited increased lactate dehydrogenase release and oxidative stress markers, including elevated protein carbonylation and reactive oxygen species. In vivo, infected mice displayed significant increases in cardiac troponin T levels, indicative of myocardial injury. Analysis of cardiac tissue revealed elevated thrombin and Factor Xa activities and reduced plasmin, indicating a prothrombotic state. Oxidative stress was marked by increased activities of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD) and reduced glutathione levels, alongside heightened protein oxidation. This study demonstrates that ZIKV infection disrupts cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing myocardial injury, prothrombotic state and oxidative stress. These findings underscore the potential of ZIKV to affect the cardiovascular system beyond its established neurotropism, highlighting the need for further investigation into its systemic impacts."
