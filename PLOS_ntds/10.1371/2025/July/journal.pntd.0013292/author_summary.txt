Zika virus (ZIKV) is widely known for its neurological complications, especially in newborns. However, this study reveals that ZIKV can also cause significant effects on the heart. Researchers investigated the impact of ZIKV infection on cardiac cells and healthy immunocompetent mice. They found that the virus is able to replicate in heart cells, leading to cellular damage and oxidative stress, a harmful chemical imbalance in the body. In infected mice, clear signs of heart muscle injury were observed, along with increased levels of clotting-related enzymes, suggesting a higher risk of thrombotic events such as heart attacks or strokes. The study also detected elevated antioxidant responses, indicating the body’s attempt to counteract virus induced stress. These findings demonstrate that ZIKV infection can disrupt cardiovascular function, causing myocardical injury, a prothrombotic state, and oxidative stress. This work expands our understanding of ZIKV’s effects beyond the nervous system and highlights the need for further research into the virus’s systemic impact on human health.
