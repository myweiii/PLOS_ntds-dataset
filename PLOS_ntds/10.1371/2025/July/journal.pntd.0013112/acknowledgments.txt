Conducting this study, “A Mixed-Method Study to Improve outcome of Mass Drug Administration in Two TAS failed Districts of Uttar Pradesh, India,” during COVID-19 has been truly interesting and challenging. PATH is indebted to many people and institutions, without whose help completion of this study would have been a near-impossible task—specifically, Dr. Neeraj Dhingra, ex-director of the National Center for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC); Dr. Nupur Roy, additional director of the NCVBDC; and Dr. Chhavi Pant Joshi, joint director of the NCVBDC, for their oversight.
We are especially thankful to our data collection agency, DevInsights, and to the entire team, for their untiring efforts in managing the study during this challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team had worked to provide exceptional data quality and rigorous data analysis and submitted an insightful report on time.
We express our sincere thanks to the HH respondents, community members, the drug administrators, ANMs, Block Medical Officers, District Malaria Officers, Chief Medical Officers, and key informants from various institutions that were covered under the study for their patience and cooperation through the numerous study questions.
