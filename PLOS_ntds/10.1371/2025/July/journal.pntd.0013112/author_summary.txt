Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a debilitating mosquito-borne disease, continues to affect millions globally, with India bearing the highest burden. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is a key public health strategy to eliminate LF, but many districts in Uttar Pradesh have struggled with low drug consumption rates despite repeated MDA rounds. This mixed-method study addresses that challenge by examining why people don't take the LF drugs and testing a tailored intervention package (IP) in two under performing districts, Varanasi and Chitrakoot.
Using household surveys, interviews, and ethnographic methods, the study identified critical barriers to drug uptake—fear of side effects, lack of awareness, and mistrust in health workers. Based on these insights, a targeted IP was developed and piloted. Post-intervention, both districts showed marked improvements in drug coverage and community awareness, with Chitrakoot’s awareness levels nearly doubling.
This work is important because it offers an evidence-based model for improving MDA outcomes through community-centered and system-level changes. For scientists, it contributes to implementation science in disease elimination. For broader audiences, it highlights how tailored, empathetic public health strategies—grounded in local realities—can accelerate progress against neglected tropical diseases and improve health equity in underserved populations.
