Dengue fever is one of the most significant mosquito-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical regions. In June 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) Pathogens Prioritization framework identified Orthoflavivirus denguei as a priority pathogen in all six WHO regions. In 2014 and 2019, China experienced severe dengue outbreaks. This study employs climate and environmental-economic variables in China in 2014, 2019, 2023 and 2030 to explore the main influencing factors of mosquito-borne transmission and the trend of habitat expansion and contraction, with the goal of assessing the risk areas for future dengue outbreaks in China. Research shows that the main factors that influence the distributions of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti are the annual mean temperature, annual precipitation and urban/industrial/residential land. Aedes albopictus is the main vector of dengue fever transmission in China, and its suitable habitat will expand to the north and be widely distributed in Shandong Province by 2030. The suitable habitats of Ae. aegypti were mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Hainan and Yunnan Provinces. The results of this study provide a scientific basis and early warning system for identifying and predicting potential high-risk areas for dengue fever epidemics in China in the past 10 years and in the future in 2030.
