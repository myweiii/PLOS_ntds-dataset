Schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are parasitic diseases affecting children across Tanzania. The Tanzanian Ministry of Health addresses these infections by providing annual preventive medications to school-aged children through the National Neglected Tropical Diseases Control Program (NTDCP). After five or more years of treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends evaluating program effectiveness to address remaining infection challenges. This study assessed infection prevalences and related factors for schistosomiasis and STH among children in five selected districts. The study included 2,250 children from 75 schools, each provided urine and stool samples. Researchers also collected data on children’s living conditions, hygiene practices, and water access. The results showed the prevalence of any STH infection was 3.4%, with the highest prevalence observed in Tanganyika DC (7.1%), and lowest prevalence in Iringa DC (0.7%). Based on WHO decision tree for determining the frequency of PC distribution for STH, four out of five districts which fall in the category of prevalence between 2 to <10.0%, will require annual distribution of PC for 5 years. For schistosomiasis the overall prevalence of any schistosome infection was 9.3%. Nanyamba TC reported the highest prevalence at 21.8%, while Iringa DC recorded the lowest at 2.0%. According to WHO decision tree for determining the frequency of PC distribution and impact assessment for schistosomiasis all surveyed districts will require annual distribution of PC for the entire population (aged ≥2 years) for 5 years.
