Opisthorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by an infection with the foodborne liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. The parasite is a group one carcinogen, and chronic infection leads to an aggressive cancer of the liver, cholangiocarcinoma, which is generally fatal. A prerequisite for the prevention of cholangiocarcinoma in O. viverrini endemic regions is, therefore, accurate screening and treatment to prevent and treat liver fluke infections and reduce community-wide transmission. Mass screening for opisthorchiasis typically relies on microscopic detection of parasite eggs in stool, which is known to have a low sensitivity. Hence the observed prevalence is likely to be underestimated in parasitological surveys. Here, we applied a novel and sensitive worm antigen assay to urine samples and compared the results against the standard fecal egg examination to assess the endemicity of opisthorchiasis in Thailand. Our survey results showed a markedly higher prevalence of O. viverrini by urine assay (50.3%) compared with fecal examination (12.2%). Both diagnostic methods yielded similar prevalence profiles when stratified by the participantâ€™s age and sex, with a higher risk of infection among men and in older age groups. We found agreement between the two diagnostic methods for the quantitative intensity of infection, and the urine assay detected more cases than fecal examination when the intensity of parasite infection is low, which constitutes the majority of currently infected people in Thailand. As providing urine samples is generally more acceptable among the public than stool sample collection, the antigen assay has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic tool for mass screening of opisthorchiasis, leading to improved disease prevention and control.
