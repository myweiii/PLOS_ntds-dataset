Dengue infection has shown a significant increase over the last decade, with 2024 marking a record number of cases across Latin America. Although dengue is considered an endemic disease in the region, the magnitude of reported infections in recent years is unprecedented. In Mexico, this trend reflects the regional surge reporting an unprecedentedly elevated number of cases for 2024. Despite typically having low rates of severe illness and case fatality, dengue outcomes can be exacerbated by the presence of underlying noncommunicable diseases. Furthermore, Mexico is facing growing prevalences of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Having a noncommunicable disease as an underlying condition triggers severe illness, including bleeding disorders and higher mortality. This study provides information about the association between the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and the presence of three different clinical outcomes in dengue-confirmed cases. These findings emphasize the critical necessity of addressing the syndemic interplay between dengue and noncommunicable diseases in Mexico.
