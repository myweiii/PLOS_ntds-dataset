Cobra bites in Malaysia are common but rarely studied. The study included over 500 cases of bite injuries caused by Naja species across a 4-year period. It reported on the frequency, symptoms, treatment, and outcomes. Naja sumatrana and Naja kaouthia were the two cobra species indigenous to Malaysia, with different geographical distribution in the country. Most of the diagnosis were classified as undifferentiated Naja species based on the clinical features. The median time of bite to arrival at a healthcare facility was 1 h. The lower limb was the most common part of the body involved with pain and swelling, being the most common local symptoms. Local envenomation had better prognosis than systemic envenomation. Antivenom was utilized in 30.7% of cases with the median door to first antivenom was 12 h. Four deaths were reported throughout the study period. This study highlights the importance of adhering to the national guidelines for snakebite envenomation management supported by consultations from experts in the field for optimal care and outcome.
