In Rio de Janeiro, efforts to control diseases like dengue and chikungunya involve a myriad of approaches, including targeting breeding sites, insecticide application, engaging communities on good practices, and the deployment of Wolbachia wMel strain. By the end of 2019, only about a third of the field-caught Aedes aegypti population carried Wolbachia and coincided with a 38% drop in dengue cases and a 10% reduction in chikungunya—good, but not as effective as hoped. To see the long-term stability of the wMel strain in Rio de Janeiro, we independently collected over 50,000 mosquitoes from neighborhoods home to around half a million people and analyzed nearly 40% of the Aedes aegypti for Wolbachia. Biotic and abiotic variables such as temperature, other mosquito species, vegetation coverage, and the use of insecticides were estimated to model the wMel introgression. The substitution of the analogue of juvenile hormone (pyriproxyfen) by the bioinsecticide spinosad wiped out most mosquitoes—both those with and without Wolbachia. However, mosquitoes without Wolbachia bounced back quickly, even growing in high number. Meanwhile, the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes struggled to recover. This was likely because they have a disadvantage when egg-hatching compared to native mosquitoes, meaning wMel-infected females couldn’t “store” enough eggs to rebuild their population. On top of this, some mosquitoes lost their Wolbachia infection over time, making it even harder for the bacteria to spread. Together, these factors explain why Wolbachia mosquitoes didn’t recover as expected, limiting their impact on dengue transmission. Therefore, to make these mosquito-based programs work better in Brazil, planning their deployment must involve delving deeper into the issue of integrated vector management to make sure resources are used wisely.
