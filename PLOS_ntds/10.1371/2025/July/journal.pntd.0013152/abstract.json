    "Background": "Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgery is a key strategy for avoiding blindness and visual impairment from trachoma. We compared alternative WHO-endorsed TT surgery techniques, hypothesizing that in a “real world” study posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR) would be associated with less postoperative TT (PTT) than bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR).",
    "Methods": "In an ongoing TT control program in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, TT surgeons used their preferred procedure (PLTR or BLTR) for upper eyelids with TT. Logistic regression—crude or adjusting for inter-eye correlation and relevant baseline factors (age, number of trichiatic lashes, epilation, entropion severity, and upper palpebral conjunctival scarring severity)—was used to compare the one-year cumulative incidence of PTT (any upper eyelid lash touching the globe, evidence of epilation and/or repeat TT surgery).",
    "Findings": "Most baseline TT severity markers were worse in the PLTR (855 eyes) than the BLTR (678 eyes) group and PLTR surgeons were less experienced than BLTR surgeons. Nevertheless, one-year cumulative PTT incidences were 8.2% (PLTR) and 21.4% (BLTR; adjusted odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.39). Prospectively ascertained postoperative adverse TT surgery outcomes were similar between groups by six months and 12 months postoperatively.",
    "Interpretation": "When surgeons applied their preferred surgical technique, PTT occurred less than half as often with PLTR than BLTR. These real-world data confirm a prior trial’s primary result, suggesting that using PLTR instead of BLTR reduces PTT incidence to a clinically important degree without increasing adverse outcomes. Another recent trial suggests continued BLTR is appropriate for surgeons already trained in that technique.",
