Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world-wide, affecting the poor. Chronic inflammation from trachoma can lead to scarring of the covering of the white part of the eye and inner surface of the eyelids. Scarring then may lead to in-turning of the eyelashes which scratch the eye surface (“trichiasis”). This scratching is the primary pathway leading to blindness. Trachoma elimination programs include eyelid surgery to out-turn the upper eyelashes back into the right position. Unfortunately, sometimes the eyelash scratching returns after surgery. We compared the two leading ways of doing this corrective surgery. In the first year after surgery, only 8.2% of 855 eyes having the surgery with cutting only on the inner layers of the upper eyelids (“posterior lamellar tarsal rotation”) had recurrence of eyelash scratching while 21.4% of 678 eyes having surgery cutting all the way through the upper eyelid (“bilamellar tarsal rotation”) had recurrence. Other problems after surgery were similarly uncommon in the two groups at 12 months after surgery. Combined with evidence from previous research which found similar results, our study suggests that patients have better outcomes from the surgery on the inner layers of the eyelid unless the surgeon already is familiar with the technique cutting all the way through the lid.
