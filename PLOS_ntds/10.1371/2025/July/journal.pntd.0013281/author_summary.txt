Dengue is a major public health concern causing millions of infections each year. Among those, people living with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe dengue compared to the general population. There is no effective specific treatment for dengue. Metformin, a glucose lowering drug that has been demonstrated to prevent dengue virus replication (the act of viruses making copies of themselves to increase their number) as well as potentially modulating the patientâ€™s response to dengue virus infection, has been considered as a promising therapy for dengue. In this study, metformin was administered to 60 Vietnamese voluntary patients with dengue and obesity. The number of adverse effects and the clinical progress of dengue disease in the metformin-treated patients were recorded and compared to other 60 Vietnamese patients, who received standard care alone. The study results showed that patients receiving metformin appeared to develop more side effects compared to the standard care controls, leading to 25 patients needed to stop using this drug, mostly due to severe diarrhoea and/or persistent vomiting. In addition, patients receiving metformin did not show improvement in clinical outcomes compared to the standard care group. This study did not support further testing to evaluate the beneficial effects of metformin in larger population with dengue and obesity.
