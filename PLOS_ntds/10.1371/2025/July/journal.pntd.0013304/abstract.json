    "Abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne emerging infectious disease with a reported mortality rate of up to 30% in hospitalized patients. The causative agent, SFTS virus (SFTSV) is maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving animal hosts and ticks. Therefore, effective control of SFTS in nature environments necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the tick-host circulation patterns that sustain viral persistence. We developed and calibrated mathematical models using seroprevalence survey data collected across China to assess the relative contributions of diverse domestic and wildlife host species to transmission, their determinants, and the effectiveness of various interventions. Our analysis identified poultry, previously unrecognized, as the most important species across the majority of survey sites, followed by goat/sheep, cattle, and rodents. These rankings remained robust even when parameter values were perturbed or certain host species were omitted from the survey. Across all sites, increasing tick mortality rate  and reducing transovarial transmission efficiency  consistently ranked among the top five interventions that led to the most significant reduction in the overall . Understanding the relative host contributions is crucial for developing interventions. Our simulation results indicated that halving the contact rate of the most important species with ticks could yield a 25-fold greater reduction in transmission intensity compared to halving that of the second most important species."
