Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease characterized by rapid spread, a broad host range among vertebrates, high case fatality rate in humans, and potential for global dissemination due to the wide distribution of its main vector Haemaphysalis longicornis. Despite being identified nearly two decades ago, the specific contributions of different host species to its natural persistence remain poorly understood. In this study, we compiled published seroprevalence data across various host species from mulitple locations in China and calibrated mathematical models for each location. Our analyses identified poultry, previously unrecognized, as the most important species at the majority of locations, followed by goat/sheep, cattle, and rodents. Through simulations, we found that increasing tick mortality, reducing transovarial transmission efficiency, and lowering the contact rate between ticks and the most important host species are the most effective interventions for reducing local transmission intensity. Notably, halving the contact rate of the most important species with ticks could yield a 25-fold greater reduction in transmission intensity compared to halving that of the second most important species.
