Malaria remains a major global health concern, with Plasmodium vivax being the most prevalent species in the Americas. Although historically regarded as less severe than P. falciparum, P. vivax is increasingly associated with severe and complicated malaria, including hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia. Despite its high frequency, the mechanisms underlying P. vivax-associated thrombocytopenia are not fully understood. In this study, we found a previously unreported negative correlation between platelet count and autoimmune anti-phosphatidylserine (anti-PS) IgG antibodies, suggesting a role for autoimmunity in disease pathogenesis. This was further supported by a dysregulated cytokine profile, characterized by elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 in patients with thrombocytopenia compared to those without. Notably, higher levels of TGF-β1 were observed in patients without hematological complications, indicating a potential protective and immunomodulatory role. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of P. vivax malaria and may inform future strategies for disease management and prognosis.
