Mosquito vector control programs rely heavily on data and information generated from research and phenotypic insecticide resistance monitoring, which require the use of live mosquitoes, both from laboratory colonies and field caught populations. Here we tested a modified version of a force oviposition technique originally designed for establishing wild Anopheles spp. colonies, on two key mosquito vectors, Culex quinqufasciatus and Aedes aegypti. We find that, despite their distinct oviposition preferences and behaviors, both species of mosquitoes generated adequate numbers of F1 eggs needed to start either laboratory or wild colonies. A key advantage to this method is its ease of use, only requiring minimal numbers of female mosquitoes and inexpensive, easily accessible materials commonly found in most laboratories and mosquito control districts. Further application of the forced oviposition method has important implications for enhancing our capacity to conduct a range of vector research with various key mosquito species. This could include key vector research projects such as, determining single female sex ratios, producing genetic isolines by controlling specific genetic backgrounds, and conducting heritability studies focused on selective mating.
