Dengue has been identified as a significant public health concern in Côte d’Ivoire, with Aedes aegypti identified as the primary vector. The most effective method of controlling arboviral disease is to control the vector mosquitoes. These control measures have focused only on urban areas, particularly the city of Abidjan, and have not taken rural areas into account. The intensification of agricultural activities could lead to a proliferation of breeding sites for Ae. aegypti, which would increase the risk of dengue transmission in rural areas. The success of Ae. aegypti control at national level could be compromised if rural areas are excluded from the control effort. We studied the entomological risk of dengue in three key agricultural areas in Côte d’Ivoire. We found that Ae. aegypti larvae mainly colonised the water storage and discarded containers. The Stegomyia indices suggested a high risk of dengue transmission in these areas. The additional pupal indices suggested that the risk of dengue was higher in Songon-Agban. A pool of Ae. aegypti collected as larvae from this same site was positive for DENV-3. The findings of this study suggest that the current regulatory measures in place for water tanks and discarded containers in urban areas are inadequate for achieving national-level control of Ae. aegypti, as the same breeding sites persistently remain infested by this vector in agricultural areas. It is imperative that dengue control measures take into consideration the presence of Ae. aegypti in agricultural areas to ensure optimal outcomes.
