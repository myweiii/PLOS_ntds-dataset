Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a significant zoonotic haemorrhagic disease in Africa impacting human and livestock health. Heterogeneities in environmental, ecological and agricultural factors that influence disease transmission pose a substantial challenge to designing effective vaccination control measures in livestock. Our study uses a mathematical model that has been fitted to disease data to evaluate the effectiveness of different vaccine control strategies in mitigating RVF livestock infections in the Comoros archipelagoâ€”a network of four islands in the south-western Indian Ocean repeatedly affected by RVF. We find that a trade-off exists between maximising overall strategy effectiveness throughout the archipelago and ensuring equitable outcomes between islands. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complexities of RVF control and inform the development of more effective vaccination programmes against livestock diseases.
