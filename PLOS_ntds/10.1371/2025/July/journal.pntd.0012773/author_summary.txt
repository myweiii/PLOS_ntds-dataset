Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a vector-borne disease targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2030. The Global Program to Eliminate LF recommends tools to measure the impact of interventions on infection prevalence and when elimination has been achieved. A reliable and easy to use diagnostic tool is key for the success of the global program. Currently only one rapid antigen test is used for programs in Wuchereria bancrofti endemic countries. This study was part of a multi-country field evaluation of a new W. bancrofti antigen lateral flow assay rapid diagnostic test, the SD Biosensor STANDARDQ Filarial Antigen Test (QFAT). The primary objective was to determine comparability of QFAT to the Abbott Bioline Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) in its ability to classify LF prevalence at a population level and compare performance of QFAT to FTS. In addition, information was collected on the ease of use of QFAT in field settings. The evaluation was done in two districts (Bombali and Karene) in Serra Leone, which were undergoing repeat pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS). The results of the study confirm QFAT as a suitable alternative to the currently recommended FTS. In field conditions, using QFAT seems effective given that no invalid test was recorded compared to six invalid FTS tests.
