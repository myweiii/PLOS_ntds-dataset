Leishmaniasis poses a significant health threat in East African refugee camps, particularly among populations with high mobility, poor living conditions, and limited healthcare access. This cross-sectional study, conducted from May to August 2023, aimed to assess the prevalence of Leishmania infection in four refugee camps in the Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella regions. Using direct agglutination tests (DAT) and RT-PCR on blood samples from 1,223 participants, the study revealed a Leishmania infection prevalence of 4.0% by DAT and 10.3% by RT-PCR. Notably, RT-PCR positivity was significantly higher in Tsore camp (14.6%) compared to Sherkole camp (3.2%), where residents were 81% less likely to be tested positive. Fever, chills, and headache were common symptoms reported by the participants in varying proportions. Sociodemographic factors, such as being from the Benishangul Gumuz region or South Sudan, increased the odds of DAT positivity. These findings underscore the need for active case detection, intervention including treatment tailored interventions, including active case detection and vector control to manage visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in these vulnerable populations effectively.
