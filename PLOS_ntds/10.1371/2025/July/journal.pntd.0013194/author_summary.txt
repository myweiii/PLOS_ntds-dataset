We describe an innovative qualitative monitoring and evaluation assessment tool called the Gap Assessment Tool (the GAT) which was developed as a complement to routinely reported quantitative data, to periodically assess global progress towards goals set out in the World Health Organization’s Neglected Tropical Diseases’ Road Map to 2030. GAT methods include online public consultations, endemic country-based experiences and expert focus group discussions. Based on applying a standardised set of criteria, GAT outcomes include: a visualisation of progress in a ‘heat map’, a review of the current status of each disease, and both disease-specific and overarching recommendations for programmatic and research action. Selected results are presented to illustrate the value of these GAT outcomes, not only for country programmes, but also for global stakeholders, so that optimal efforts can be made to achieve road map goals, and ultimately, to reduce the burden of neglected tropical diseases in at-risk populations.
