One intriguing phenomenon in T. gondii infection and immunity is that the immune response induced by T. gondii is diverse in various hosts. Our previous research shows that in mouse macrophages, T. gondii microneme protein 3 (MIC3) activates TNF-α transcription via the TLR11/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. T. gondii infection can also induce TNF-α production in humans. However, human cells lack TLR11, leading us to predict that the mechanisms by which T. gondii regulates TNF-α expression in human macrophages differ from those in mouse macrophages. In this study, we found that T. gondii infection increased the abundance of m6A demethylase FTO. Joint analysis of RNA-seq and m6A-seq data indicates significant differences in the m6A levels of differentially expressed genes related to the TNF signaling pathway after T. gondii infection. Results of m6A-IP-qPCR assay further confirmed that T. gondii infection decreased the m6A modification levels in the 3’UTR and 5’UTR regions of TNF-α mRNA. Knocking-down FTO hindered the infection-induced decrease in m6A modification levels of TNF-α transcripts, accompanied by a dampened immune response and uncontrolled T. gondii proliferation. Additionally, T. gondii infection significantly weakened the binding of YTHDF2 to TNF-α mRNA, thereby promoting TNF-α expression by inhibiting TNF-α mRNA degradation. In sum, these findings explain why human macrophages lacking TLR11 can still express TNF-α after T. gondii infection and uncover a novel post-transcriptional regulation mechanism for TNF-α.
