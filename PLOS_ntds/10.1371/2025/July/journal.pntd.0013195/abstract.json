    "Background": "Species of the genus Echis, particularly those of the ‘ocellatus’ group, are responsible for the majority of snakebite envenomations and deaths in the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. In a clinical study conducted in Cameroon, we treated a series of patients bitten by formally identified E. romani. The clinical outcomes are described and discussed.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Specimens brought in by the victim were identified by a herpetologist. Clinical description and therapeutic management followed a standardized protocol applied by trained physicians.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "This study confirms the frequency and severity of hemorrhagic complications in E. romani envenomation. Lethality remains high despite antivenom treatment. Cytotoxic syndromes, present in 95% of victims, rarely progress to extensive necrosis."
