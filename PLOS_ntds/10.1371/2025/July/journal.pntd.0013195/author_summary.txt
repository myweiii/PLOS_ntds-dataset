The Echis genus is responsible for the majority of envenomations and deaths in the savanna and grassland regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The authors examined and treated 92 patients bitten in northern Cameroon by E. romani –a species of the ‘ocellatus’ group– formally identified from the specimen brought by the victim. Five of them showed no symptoms of envenomation (5% dry bites). Of the 87 envenomated patients, 84 (97%) had a cytotoxic syndrome characterized by edema of varying severity. Hemostasis disorders were observed in 78 patients, 38 (49%) of whom experienced bleeding during hospitalization. Among the latter, 5 patients (13%) showed recurrence of bleeding after cessation of bleeding. Seven patients who were not bleeding on arrival experienced late bleeding despite antivenom administration. Four patients, all with bleeding, including one pregnant woman, died. Two others had permanent sequelae of moderate severity. This study confirms that E. romani is a major threat to the rural population of northern Cameroon due to hemorrhagic complications and, secondarily, the risk of motor disability from tissue necrosis.
