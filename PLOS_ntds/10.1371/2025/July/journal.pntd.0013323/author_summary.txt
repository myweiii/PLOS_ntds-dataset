Trichinellosis, a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Trichinella spiralis, poses a significant threat to global food safety and public health. Current vaccine strategies face a critical limitation in their inability to effectively induce mucosal immunity, particularly during the early intestinal invasion phase of the parasite. To address this challenge, we developed a recombinant adenovirus vaccine (rAd5TsCLP) targeting the T. spiralis cystatin-like protein (TsCLP). Though a heterologous strategy (intranasal priming with adenoviral vaccine followed by intramuscular with recombinant protein vaccine) effectively induced high levels of specific serum antibodies(IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM) and neutralizing antibodies, with peak of IFN-Î³, IL-13, and IL-4 in serum, spleen and cervical lymph node. Furthermore, elevated levels of secretory IgA (sIgA), histamine, and goblet cell proliferation were observed. After challenge, immunized mice showed significant protective efficacy, with adult worm and muscle larvae burdens reduced by 61.17% and 58.22%. These findings highlight the potential of adenoviral vectors to enhance local mucosal immunity and induce mixed Th1/Th2 responses, offering a promising prime-boost strategy for the development of Trichinella vaccines.
