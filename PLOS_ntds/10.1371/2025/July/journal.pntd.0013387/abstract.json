    "Background": "Individuals affected by skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (skin-NTDs) are at increased risk of psychological distress, public stigma and perceived stress. However, the nexus between these burdens remains underexplored globally. This study investigates the burden of psychological distress and perceived stress, their relationships with public stigma and the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on these relationships among individuals affected by skin-NTDs in Ghana.",
    "Methods": "A cross-sectional study design was utilized. Data were gathered from 292 conveniently sampled individuals with skin-NTDs in the Nkwanta North and South Districts of the Oti region in Ghana. A structured questionnaire that assessed perceived stress, psychological distress and public stigma was administered. The prevalence of psychological distress and perceived stress was estimated using descriptive statistics, while Structural Equational Modelling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesised relation among the study variables and moderating effects of sociodemographic variables.",
    "Results": "Approximately 42.8% of the participants experienced psychological distress, and 61.1% reported elevated levels of perceived stress. SEM revealed that public stigma was significantly associated with psychological distress (β = 0.26, p < 0.001, SE = .05) and perceived stress (β = 0.52, p < 0.001, SE = .04). Perceived stress significantly mediated the relationship between public stigma and psychological distress (β = 0.26, p < 0.001) The relationship between public stigma and perceived stress was moderated by educational level (p = 0.03) and help-seeking behavior for mental health (p < 0.05).",
    "Conclusion": "The study highlights the complex relationship between public stigma, perceived stress and psychological distress among individuals affected by skin-NTDs, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to mitigate their impacts.."
