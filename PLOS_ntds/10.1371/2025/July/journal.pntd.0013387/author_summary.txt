Individuals affected by skin-NTDs experience negative behaviours that significantly threaten their quality of life. Among them are (1) psychological distress, referred to as a combination of anxiety and depressive symptoms, (2) public stigma, and (3) perceived stress. The burden imposed by these negative experiences are enormous, necessitating the need for empirical studies to characterize the nature of their relationships and the sociodemographic factors that modulate these relationships. This interesting line of research has been barely conducted in the skin-NTDs literature, globally, leaving a conspicuous gap in our understanding. To this end, we recruited 292 participants affected by skin-NTDs in local communities in Ghana who responded to measures of psychological distress, public stigma, and perceived stress. The results of data analyses showed that more than 50% of the participants reported significant perceived stress and psychological distress. Second, an increase in exposure to a burden (e.g., public stigma) leads to a concomitant increase in experience of other burden (e.g., psychological distress). Furthermore, it was observed that the effect of public stigma on the experience of psychological distress was mediated by perceived stress. Lastly, participants with high education and those who have sought help for mental health in the past were less likely to experience significant perceived stress following exposure to public stigma. The outcome of the study has the potential to inform efforts to improve the psychosocial wellbeing and quality of individuals affected by skin-NTDs as well as contribute to the overall goal of eradicating skin-NTDs in Ghana and other jurisdictions.
