Trichinellosis is a disease that arises from the infection with a food-borne parasite known as Trichinella spiralis. The parasite presents a global distribution. Infection is acquired by consuming infected undercooked meat, mostly pork. Throughout the initial infection phase, worms invade the intestine resulting into abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Almost a week after infection, larvae start migration to the muscles, leading to muscle pain and weakness. Symptoms may aggressively complicate to heart failure, respiratory failure or central nervous system involvement. Those severe complications may unfortunately be fatal. Although there are multiple treatment options, they still have objectionable drawbacks. The commercially available drugs are not effective in eradicating the parasite muscular stage, in addition to being unsafe for pregnant women and children below three years. Nitazoxanide is a safe therapeutic option but has a lower comparable efficiency. Accordingly, this study focused on attaining an improved treatment outcome via the preparation of nano-sized formulation. The formula was attained by preparing the safe anti-microbial zinc oxide nanoparticles then loading them with nitazoxanide. The nano-formulation exhibited an outstanding propitious effectiveness against experimental trichinellosis.
