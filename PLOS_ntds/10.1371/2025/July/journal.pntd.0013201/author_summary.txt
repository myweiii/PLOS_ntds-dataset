Scorpion stings present a significant public health challenge in many regions, particularly in northwest Iran, where scorpions diversity is high. This study investigates the epidemiological trends and health outcomes associated with scorpion envenomation in East Azerbaijan Province over a two-years (2022–2023). We analyzed data from 3,154 reported cases, focusing on demographics, treatment modalities, and recovery rates. Our findings reveal that the majority of victims are males; specifically, those aged 31 to 40, with peak sting incidents occurring during the summer months, predominantly indoors. Remarkably, 99.96% of cases resulted in full recovery, highlighting the effective treatment protocols. However, one death was documented. The data emphasize the need for targeted public health interventions, including educational programs targeting vulnerable groups such as farmers and children. Enhancing community awareness, as well as ensuring access to timely medical care, can significantly mitigate the impact of scorpionism in affected populations. Future research should explore the specific scorpion species present in the region and develop tailored prevention strategies to further reduce the burden of this neglected tropical disease.
