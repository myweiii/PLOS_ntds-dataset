Intestinal parasitic infections are a major public health concern in developing countries, particularly among young children who are vulnerable to diarrhoeal diseases. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasitosis in children with diarrhoea the Huambo’s municipality. This is the first study that has been exploring and reporting epidemiological data on intestinal parasitosis in children with diarrhoea in the Huambo’s municipality. Our findings reveal that more than one-third of the children were infected with intestinal parasites, with Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba spp. being the most common. We also identified key risk factors such as poor sanitation, unsafe water, low maternal education, and animal contact, which contribute to the high burden of infection. These results highlight the urgent need for preventive strategies, including improved hygiene education, water sanitation, and routine parasitic screening in diarrhoeal cases. Our study underscores the importance of addressing environmental and social determinants of health to reduce the impact of parasitic infections in vulnerable populations.
