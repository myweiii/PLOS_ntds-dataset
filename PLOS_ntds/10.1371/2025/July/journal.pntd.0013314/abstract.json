    "Abstract": "Intestinal parasitic infections are classified as neglected tropical diseases and represent a serious public health issue, particularly in developing countries, where they often manifest as diarrhoeal syndromes. A prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted with the aim of describing the prevalence of intestinal parasites in children aged 9 months to 14 years who were hospitalised with a diagnosis of diarrhoeal disease in the paediatric department of Huambo General Hospital. Of the 173 stool samples analysed, 47 (27.2%) were positive, with a predominance of helminths (22.5%), among which Necator americanus (46.81%) and Strongyloides stercoralis (46.81%) were the most prevalent. The only protozoan identified was Giardia lamblia (12.77%) and Taenia spp. (4.26%). Although found in low percentages, this study demonstrated the presence of three groups of parasites infecting children, with helminths being the most predominant, followed by protozoa and cestodes. Additionally, the variables studied (age, sex, origin, education level, parentsâ€™ occupation, source of drinking water, hygiene practices, and open defecation) did not constitute risk factors for the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections."
