We thank the staff at the Environmental Health Directorate, of the Department of Health, Western Australia, past and present, for the collection, identification, and processing of mosquito samples for virus isolation over the course of the Western Australian arbovirus surveillance program. We are also indebted to the many people who contributed to the research projects and surveys conducted throughout Western Australia since the 1960s and collected the virus isolates and mosquito homogenates that have been archived since that time. We acknowledge the assistance of the Surveillance Unit of PathWest, Western Australia, for assistance with genome sequencing and for access to their facilities. We also thank Cheryl Johansen and staff of the former UWA Arbovirus Surveillance Laboratory, now merged with PathWest Surveillance, for isolating and identifying viruses.
