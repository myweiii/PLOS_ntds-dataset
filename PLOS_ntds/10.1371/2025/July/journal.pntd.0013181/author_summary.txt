We analysed MVEV sequenced from archived virus isolates and mosquito homogenates collected since 1972 by the Western Australia Arbovirus Surveillance Program and by various research projects, with other published whole and partial genome sequences, to understand MVEV genetic diversity, evolution, and geographic distribution over a 69-year period 1951â€“2020. We amplified MVEV from virus isolates and developed an MVEV tiling amplicon PCR assay to analyse mosquito homogenates, and sequenced whole genomes of 70 viruses to create the largest and most geographically and temporally diverse MVEV dataset published to date. We describe a new sub-lineage G1C that circulated unrecognised in the 1990s, highlighting the value of more regular and strategic virus sampling and genome sequencing to capture the true diversity and evolutionary history of MVEV.
