A questionnaire survey was conducted in seven communities in Bangkok, Thailand to obtain baseline information on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to mosquito-borne diseases, i.e., dengue, chikungunya and Zika, including mosquito vectors and how to control them. The questionnaire also asked about the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for sterile mosquitoes used in controlling mosquito populations. Our results showed that, from a total of 400 sampling households, about 85% of participants were familiar with dengue and its mosquito vectors, as well as their prevention and control. Furthermore, participants with lower ages and higher incomes had more knowledge on mosquito vectors (p < 0.05). Even though the majority of participants did not have any knowledge on sterile mosquito release, they showed a positive perception about it. However, more than half of them were not willing to pay for sterile mosquitoes, since they would like to receive them as public support from the government. If they were to pay, the cost that they could afford was 1–2 THB (~US$ 0.03- 0.06) per sterile mosquito. These findings should be useful for public health authorities when planning to apply the sterile mosquito release as an alternative mosquito control approach in Bangkok, Thailand.
