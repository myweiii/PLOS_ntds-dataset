Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem in Ethiopia and is spread by female sandflies. The causative agent is Leishmania aethiopica, and the reservoir hosts are rock and tree hyraxes. After being bitten by a sand fly, distinct skin lesions typically develop within 6 weeks of infection. The ulcers can persist for varying durations and heal slowly and causing ugly scarring. This disease is mainly found in the highland areas of the country. However, there have been recent changes in the transmission patterns of CL in Ethiopia, with the disease now being identified in lowland areas and involving different hosts and vectors. In recent reports, there have been findings of hybrid parasites resulting from L. donovani/L. aethiopica and L. donovani/L. tropica species. Additionally, cases of CL caused by L. donovani have been documented. A high number of cases, predominantly among male militia members, were reported following the recent outbreak of CL in the Somali region of Ethiopia. Our study has identified the infecting Leishmania species as L. tropica, causing atypical skin lesions. This study sheds light on the emergence of L. tropica as a new Leishmania species, responsible for causing skin lesions in the lowlands of Ethiopia.
