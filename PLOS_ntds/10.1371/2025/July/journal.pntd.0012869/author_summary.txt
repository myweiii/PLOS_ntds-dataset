Dog-mediated human rabies, a fatal and preventable disease, remains a significant public health challenge in some parts of Latin America, including Arequipa, Peru. Despite efforts to control the disease through mass dog vaccination campaigns (MDVCs), achieving and maintaining adequate vaccination coverage has proven difficult, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this issue, we applied the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a widely used tool in implementation science, to identify barriers to MDVC implementation and propose actionable solutions. Through focus groups with community members and a workshop with public health personnel, we identified key challenges, including fragmented communication, decreased public perception of rabies risk, financial and logistical constraints, and misinformation about vaccine quality. Our findings reveal that the pandemic not only disrupted vaccination campaigns but also shifted public and institutional priorities away from rabies prevention. By engaging with stakeholders, we co-designed strategies to overcome these barriers, such as improving interinstitutional collaboration, enhancing public awareness, and extending campaign hours to better accommodate the communityâ€™s needs. This study underscores the importance of a One Health approach to understand the complexities of controlling a canine rabies outbreak, including integrating perspectives from diverse stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions for rabies control. Our recommendations aim to strengthen rabies elimination efforts in Arequipa and can inform similar strategies in other endemic regions.
