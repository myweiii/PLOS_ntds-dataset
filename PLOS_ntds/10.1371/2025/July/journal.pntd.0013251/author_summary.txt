Yellow fever is a life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes, with frequent outbreaks in Uganda despite a highly effective vaccine. This study addresses disease perceptions and treatment practices in communities affected by yellow fever outbreaks. Through qualitative analysis of interviews and group discussions with vulnerable groups (pregnant women and older adults) and medical experts we explored these perceptions aiming to improve future public health campaigns. Our findings showed that for most participants, yellow fever was a novel and deadly disease. Participants understood who is most susceptible to yellow fever, but their knowledge on the underlying cause, transmission, and prevention often overlapped with other diseases. Survivors often relied on herbal medicine due to limited access to healthcare and diagnostics. Furthermore, we found that there was an unequal access to health information, particularly in remote areas where people were often unaware of the cause of the outbreak, as awareness campaigns focused mainly on the symptoms and prevention. This study contributes to broader efforts in global health by emphasizing the importance of engaging communities in disease control programs, through health education and public participation, in addition to enhancing yellow fever diagnosis in the clinical setting.
