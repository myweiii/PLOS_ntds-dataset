The study focuses on finding antiviral drug candidates targeting the DNA Polymerase (DPol) and Profilin-like Protein A42R (A42R) of the Monkeypox virus (MPXV) using an in-silico approach. Various compound libraries were screened for potential inhibitors and the top-performing ligands were selected based on their predicted binding affinities. This study identified several ligands, including Dorsilurin K, Mangostin, dimethylbenzoate derivative and others that demonstrated strongly predicted binding to DPol and A42R, suggesting their potential as effective inhibitors of MPXV. The molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these ligand-protein complexes and further ADMET analysis indicated favorable pharmacokinetic properties. These findings provide a promising foundation for developing new antiviral treatments against MPXV, however further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to validate these results.
