Schistosoma has a unique parasite life cycle that lives in the veins of the mammalian host and feeds on its blood, which suggests that schistosoma might be a natural source of novel anticoagulants that can balance the coagulation and anticoagulation systems. Here, by sequence blasting and structural fold searching of Kunitz-domain containing proteins from schistosoma, a specific Kunitz-domain Shp4 that appears in nine secreted proteins from four schistosoma species was identified successfully. We found that Shp4 had potent XIa inhibitory activity and well antithrombotic effects. Besides this, by structural modelling of nine schistosoma-derived secreted proteins, we firstly found that the C-terminal non-Kunitz-domain fragments might play important roles in modulating the Kunitz-domain protease-inhibitory activities by steric hindrance effect and transmembrane helix structure. In conclusion, our work not only characterized the first XIa inhibitor from schistosoma with high anticoagulation activity and well antithrombotic effects, and but also highlights a potential strategy to discovery new functional Kunitz-domain peptides from medical related species with blooding-sucking life habits.
