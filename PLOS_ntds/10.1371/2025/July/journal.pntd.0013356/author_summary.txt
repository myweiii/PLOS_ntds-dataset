Dengue fever is a growing global threat, partially due to unplanned urbanization and climatic change. Africa, which is increasingly paying the price, lacks comprehensive data on the disease. Dengue fever has increasingly threatening Burkina Faso in recent years with sporadic outbreaks. We therefore conducted this study in the Central Region of Burkina Faso to better understand its dynamics. According to previous data, dengue cases are expected to continue rising between 2022 and 2023. This was confirmed in 2023, as Burkina Faso declared the largest dengue outbreak ever recorded in Africa. Dengue fever transmission is modulated by climatic factors. Thus, recent weather conditions associated with rainfall, humidity, ambiant temperature and wind speed were found to influence the occurrence of new cases. The influence of climate on the emergence of dengue new cases is also remote. These results highlight the complex dynamics of dengue-climate interactions. In addition to the climate, the growing population of the Region will favour the occurrence of dengue new cases. These data have enabled us to gain a better understanding of the dengue situation in Burkina Faso.
