Appreciation is extended to the Government of South Sudan, particularly the Ministry of Health, and Amref Health Africa, South Sudan office. We are indebted to the Amref health Africa Country Manager, MR Morrish Humphrey Ojok, for his administrative support during the visit and field activities.
This work would not have been possible without the support of the Directors of Mvolo and Mundri West Health Departments. We also thank Ismael for his exceptional support in compiling the list of sites to be visited along the Yei River, liaising with local authorities, and managing the security arrangements during the second field visit. Finally, we are grateful to Mr Patrick Buyinza for assisting with the statistical analysis of our data.
