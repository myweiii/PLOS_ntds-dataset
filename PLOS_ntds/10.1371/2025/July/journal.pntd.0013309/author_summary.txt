Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a parasitic disease transmitted through blackfly bites. The primary control strategy has been the mass distribution of ivermectin, but this approach has not consistently achieved the desired outcomes in many endemic communities. Recently, an alternative method known as “slash and clear” (S&C) has shown potential in reducing transmission. This technique involves removing riverside vegetation where blackflies typically breed, thereby reducing their population. To test the effectiveness of S&C in South Sudan, researchers mapped blackflies breeding sites along the Naam River in Mvolo County and the Yei River in Mundri West County. They measured how often people were bitten before and after the S&C intervention. The results showed that on both rivers, the effects of a single round of S&C were not sustained during the subsequent months especially in the rainy season when blackfly abundance tends to increase. This indicates that S&C might need to be repeated several times each year to achieve a more substantial and lasting reduction in blackfly biting rates.
