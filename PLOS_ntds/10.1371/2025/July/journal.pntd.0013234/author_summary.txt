We evaluated the effectiveness of YOLOv7 and its variants—deep learning-based computer vision models designed for object detection—in identifying four types of parasite eggs in stool smears. These models, even the simpler variants, performed exceptionally well in the same, in-distribution (ID) settings, indicating a potential for use by in-field edge diagnostic devices, provided that both the development and real-world deployment scenarios are exactly the same. Nevertheless, in practice, we frequently encounter a multitude of different scenarios that previous parasite egg detection models have not adequately addressed. Our experiments and findings highlight the critical need for thorough testing of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios to evaluate the effects of distribution shifts, including changes in capturing devices and the encounter of previously unseen egg classes. This OOD testing is essential to ensure the resilience of models in confronting the unpredictable conditions they may face in real-world scenarios. Such testing is crucial for realizing a trustworthy AI-powered in-field diagnostic device that can help eliminate Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infections as public health problems by 2030.
