Neurocysticercosis (NCC), a parasitic brain infection caused by pork tapeworm larvae, remains a critical health challenge in Ecuador. This study maps where NCC is most concentrated and investigates the social, economic, and environmental factors driving its spread. Using hospital and outpatient records from 2017–2023, we analyzed 735 NCC cases across Ecuador’s municipalities. Over this period, annual NCC rates dropped by more than half (from 1.01 to 0.44 cases per 100,000 people), but clusters of high infection rates persisted in southern Ecuador.
These hot spots—characterized as rural, drier, and cooler areas—share two key features: higher income inequality and more backyard pig farming. Paradoxically, these areas also reported higher sewerage coverage and greater density of healthcare providers compared to low-risk areas (referred to as cold spots). This suggests that despite the provision of sanitary infrastructure and healthcare access, structural inequalities continue to undermine efforts to control NCC.
The findings highlight a vicious cycle linking poverty and disease: communities relying on traditional pig-rearing face a heightened risk of NCC, exacerbated by uneven income distribution. To break this cycle, policymakers must address income disparities while simultaneously improving living conditions, healthcare access, and sanitary infrastructure. Integrating these interventions with measures to promote best practices for animal husbandry by smallholder farmers could help Ecuador reduce the burden of this preventable disease. This research underscores that combating NCC is fundamentally a matter of social justice—requiring systemic action to redistribute income and dismantle the structural inequalities that perpetuate poverty and disease.
