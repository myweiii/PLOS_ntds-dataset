Effective surveillance activities are essential for achieving elimination targets for lymphatic filariasis (LF). Cost-effective surveillance strategies are needed to locate infections for targeted treatment of individuals or high-risk communities. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of targeted sampling using reactive case detection compared to random sampling for locating antigen (Ag)-positive and microfilaria (Mf)-positive individuals in Samoa and explore how differences in efficiency gains depend on the Ag prevalence in the village. In 2023, six villages with varying Ag prevalence in 2019 were surveyed using both random and targeted sampling strategies. For the randomly selected group, we selected 15 houses in each village and invited all household residents aged five years and over to participate. The targeted group consisted of residents in these same villages who lived within 200 metres of an Ag-positive participant from the 2019 survey. Finger prick blood samples were collected and tested for Ag and Mf. Overall, significantly more cases were identified per person tested using reactive case detection. This efficiency gain was greatest in the medium prevalence villages. These results show that targeted surveys of households neighbouring the residence of an Ag-positive person may be more efficient than random sampling, particularly in medium Ag prevalence villages. The findings could help improve the design of future LF surveys in Samoa and other Pacific Island countries.
