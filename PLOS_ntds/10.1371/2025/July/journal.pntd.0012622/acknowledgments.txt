We are extremely grateful to our colleagues at the Samoa Red Cross for their continued and invaluable support as field teams during SaMELFS surveys, as well as staff from the Samoa Ministry of Health. We would also like to acknowledge the significant in-country support provided by Lepaitai Hansell and Dyxon Hansell at the WHO office in Apia and extend our sincere thanks for their assistance during the survey preparation and fieldwork. We gratefully acknowledge Shannon Hedtke for reading the Mf slides from the 2018 and 2019 SaMELFS surveys, and Jane Sinclair, Ramona Muttucumaru, Maddison Howlett and Jessica Scott for their assistance with fieldwork for the 2023 survey.
