    "Abstract": "Genomic analysis of parasites can deepen our understanding of their transmission, population structure, and important biological characteristics. Onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus, involves adult worms residing in subcutaneous nodules that produce larval-stage microfilariae (mf), which are routinely detected in the skin for diagnosis. Whole-genome studies of mf are limited; most analyses have focused on the mitochondrial genome. We conducted a genome-wide analysis with 94% median nuclear genome coverage, analyzing 171, 37, and 98 mf from 16, 3, and 5 individuals from Ghana, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively. These data were used to investigate population differentiation, estimate the number of reproductive adult worms, and analyze genetic variation across chromosomes. Population genetic analyses across hosts and countries showed that nuclear genome diversity can reveal fine-scale genetic structure, even between geographically close countries, providing more resolution than mitochondrial haplotype data. By reconstructing maternal and paternal sibships, we estimated the number of reproductively active adult filariae. Comparisons between adult worm estimates from genetic data and nodule observations showed that genetics-based estimates were higher or equal to observed worm counts in 8 out of 9 hosts for female worms and 7 out of 9 hosts for male worms. Our analysis also revealed lower-than-expected X chromosome diversity, consistent with neo-X chromosome fusions in filarial species. This study represents an important step in using nuclear genome data from mf to support onchocerciasis elimination efforts and in developing genetic tools that could inform mass drug administration programs."
