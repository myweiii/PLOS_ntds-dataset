Onchocerca volvulus, a human filarial parasite, causes river blindness, a neglected tropical disease that primarily affects sub-Saharan Africa. Despite extensive efforts to eliminate the disease through mass administration of ivermectin—which interrupts parasite transmission by blackfly vectors by killing and reducing the production of larval parasites (microfilariae) but does not eliminate adult worms—some regions continue to experience persistent transmission or resurgence. Genetic data can provide valuable epidemiological insights that are otherwise challenging to obtain, such as estimates of adult worm burden and fecundity in individual hosts. By analyzing microfilariae samples collected from clinical trials, we demonstrate that it is possible to genetically estimate the number of reproductively active adult worms from these samples. Our whole nuclear genome analysis of microfilariae also highlights the benefits of high-resolution analysis of genetic diversity and differentiation, surpassing the limitations of previous studies. These findings represent a crucial first step in developing genetic tools for analyzing longitudinal microfilariae samples to assess treatment effects and identify new infections, ultimately aiding in the monitoring and improvement of mass drug administration programs.
