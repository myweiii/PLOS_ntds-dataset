Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. Anti-schistosomal vaccines for human or animal use is a critical part of a multifaceted control approach but is not available yet. Efforts are still needed to identify appropriate protective antigens to elicit effective immune responses. Cysteine proteases play crucial roles in nutrient absorption of trematodes and some of them have shown great value as a vaccine target. Cathepsin L-like proteases are important cysteine proteases discovered in S. mansoni and S. japonicum. While their enzyme activities have been reported, the role of SjCLs during infection has not been fully explored. In this study, we produced the mature form of SjCL1â€“5. Immunization with recombinant SjCL1 (rSjCL1) provided partial protection to mice against S. japonicum infection, whereas the other four rSjCLs did not confer any protective effect. SjCL1 was expressed in the intestinal intima of hepatic schistosomulum, male and female adults, as well as on the tegument of male adults. The mature form of SjCL1 can be detected in the products excreted or secreted by the larvae and adult worms in vitro. Overall, the findings indicate that SjCL1 holds potential as an immunoprotective target.
