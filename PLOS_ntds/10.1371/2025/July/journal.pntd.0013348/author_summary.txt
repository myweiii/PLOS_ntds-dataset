Roadkills represent potential unrealized samples for detecting and monitoring diseases in wildlife. However, roadkills are often in poor condition, which can affect test results. In this study, a PCR test (LN34 assay) was able to detect rabies virus in eight out of almost 300 poor quality roadkill samples sampled across ten states in the United States. Real-time RT-PCR was successful at detecting rabies virus RNA in poor quality roadkill samples, and results informed rabies surveillance in wildlife in areas of high interest for wildlife rabies management. These findings support the use of real-time RT-PCR for samples that would be unsuitable for testing by widely used test such as the direct fluorescent antibody test (DFA or FAT) and direct rapid immunohistochemistry test (DRIT).
