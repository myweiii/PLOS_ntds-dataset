Thousands of dengue cases are reported in non-endemic countries each year due to returning travelers having been infected in tropical and subtropical regions. However, the true number of dengue illnesses among travelers is unknown because not all cases seek medical care and an unknown proportion of those who do are not diagnosed or reported to health authorities. Consequently, travelers and their medical providers do not have accurate information on the risk of acquiring dengue during trips to inform preventative behaviors. To address this gap, we estimated the incidence of dengue among travelers from 43 non-endemic countries between 2010–19. We found there were an average of 64,623 symptomatic dengue cases across 43 origin countries annually between 2010–19. The USA had the highest number of estimated cases (16,551) followed by China (7,298). Across considered countries, a median of 24.9% of cases were reported to health authorities. Our findings can be used by travelers and their healthcare providers during pre-travel visits to inform about the risks of dengue.
