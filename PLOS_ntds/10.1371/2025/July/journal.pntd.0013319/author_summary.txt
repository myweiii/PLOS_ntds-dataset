Traditional medicine plays important role in healthcare across many countries, including Ethiopia, though it is often ignored by the formal health system. In Ethiopia, traditional remedies are commonly used for a range of illnesses, including rabies exposure, despite no scientific evidence supporting traditional treatments for rabies, a disease that is almost always fatal once symptoms begin. Ethiopia uses the “One Health” strategy to prevent and control rabies through collaboration across sectors. However, traditional healers have not been included in this approach as they have greater contribution for delaying the access of post exposure prophylaxis. This review aimed to determine how many people exposed to rabies seek help from traditional healers to facilitate evidence informed decision making. Authors conducted review of both published and unpublished studies in Ethiopia their analysis showed that 57% of individuals exposed to rabies visited traditional healers, either before or instead of seeking modern medical care. This implies that traditional healers play a major role in how communities respond to rabies. Therefore, we recommend that the Ministry of Health involve traditional healers in rabies prevention and control as part of the One Health strategy to improve awareness and access to timely post exposure prophylaxis service.
