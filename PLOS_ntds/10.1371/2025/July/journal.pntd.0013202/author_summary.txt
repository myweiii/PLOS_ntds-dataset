Free-roaming dogs present a risk to community health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where dog-mediated rabies remains a critical issue. Rabies control strategies basically integrate mass vaccination with sterilization programs to prevent and control both disease transmission and population growth. However, resource constraints often limit the effectiveness of these interventions. Mathematical modeling serves as an alternative tool for assessing the potential impact of such strategies and identifying cost-effective approaches without the financial burden of real-world implementation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to analyze dog population dynamics in Thailand, with a focus on sterilization and vaccination programs. Our findings suggest that prioritizing the sterilization of female dogs can substantially reduce the overall dog population while demonstrating greater cost-effectiveness compared to non-specific sterilization programs. This modeling approach provides critical evidence to support informed decision-making in dog population management and rabies control efforts.
