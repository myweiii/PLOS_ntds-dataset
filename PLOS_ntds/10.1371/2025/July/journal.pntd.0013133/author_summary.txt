Toxoplasma gondii is a globally distributed intracellular parasite with marked genetic diversity, especially in South America. China has long been considered a region with a limited diversity of T. gondii, being dominated by the Chinese 1 lineage (ToxoDB #9). This study reports the first identification and characterization of the Africa 1 strain (ToxoDB #6) in China isolated from a captive black mangabey native to tropical Africa. The emergence of Africa 1 augments the genetic diversity of T. gondii in East Asia and likely stems from the importation of African wildlife. The appearance of the strain emphasizes the role of human activities in the transcontinental transmission and geographical distribution of zoonotic pathogens. Overall, the isolated strain of non-native genotypes like Africa 1 tend to exhibit high virulence, which may complicate local toxoplasmosis control. To mitigate zoonotic risks, more infection investigations and stricter animal entry quarantines are needed to monitor emerging T. gondii genotypes and address new challenges in controlling the pathogen.
