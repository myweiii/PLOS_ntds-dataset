In Yemen, a country challenged by an ongoing humanitarian crisis, armed conflict, and economic hardship, childhood diarrhea remains a serious public health issue. This study investigated diarrhea prevalence, trends, and underlying factors among Yemeni children under five. It analyzed data from four national surveys conducted in 1991, 2006, 2013, and 2022. The findings revealed that over one-third of children were affected by diarrhea, with the situation worsening over time. Key risk factors identified were the childâ€™s age, residence in North Yemen, lack of access to water on premises, unimproved toilet facilities, smaller household size, and low wealth quintile. Disparities in diarrhea prevalence increased over the last decade and were more pronounced between households than across neighborhoods. The latter highlights the pivotal role of household-level socioeconomic factors and living conditions in determining diarrhea risk. These findings underscore the urgent need to improve water and sanitation infrastructure and implement tailored programs to reduce the burden of diarrhea across Yemen.
