Lassa fever virus infects an estimated 0.9 to 4.3 million people and kills thousands annually in West Africa. Incidence rates appear to be highly spatially heterogeneous within the endemic region; however, the true nature is uncertain due to significant surveillance gaps. We modeled Lassa Fever disease incidence at a sub-national scale throughout West Africa to inform the design of vaccine efficacy trials. We find considerable spatial heterogeneity in incidence rates, with the highest rates concentrated in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and a few areas of Nigeria. Even though we estimate that <1% of infections are reported, our estimates also indicate that using symptomatic LF as a primary endpoint will require tens of thousands of trial participants to demonstrate vaccine efficacy. Our work highlights data gaps and uncertainties related to the ecology and epidemiology of LASV that limit our ability to estimate and predict disease incidence.
