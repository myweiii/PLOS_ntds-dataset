The World Health Organization calls for the development of rapid, easy-to-use, and performant point-of-care diagnostics to follow up large-scale deworming programs against strongyloidiasis. However, there are no further recommendations regarding the required performance and cost of such new diagnostics. We performed a simulation study and a cost analysis to assess the minimum requirements in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, cost per test, and sample throughput for future assays while comparing the survey costs with those of a reference method. In addition, we determined the most cost-efficient survey designs to support control programs for strongyloidiasis applying currently available assays. Our results indicate that research and development efforts should focus on developing point-of-care assays with high specificity. Of the currently available diagnostics, a prototype of a rapid diagnostic test resulted in the lowest total survey cost, while restricting the risk of incorrect policy decisions to the minimum.
