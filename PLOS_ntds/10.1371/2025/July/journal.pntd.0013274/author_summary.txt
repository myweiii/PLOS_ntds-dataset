Zika and dengue viruses are closely related and often spread in the same regions of the world. Due to their similarities, the immune system produces antibodies that react to both viruses. However, other antibodies are specific and only recognize one virus. A cohort of patients who had recently contracted the Zika virus was monitored. It is noteworthy that a subset of these individuals had previously encountered infection with the dengue virus. Zika virus-infected patients demonstrated the production of both Zika virus-specific and orthoflaviviruses-specific antibodies. Patients with previous dengue virus infections primarily used immune “memory” from past exposure, leading to greater production of antibodies that react to related orthoflaviviruses. Their antibodies neutralized not only Zika virus but also dengue virus. This suggests that the immune response to Zika virus can be shaped, and sometimes masked, by previous infection with similar viruses such as dengue virus. These results highlight how pre-existing immunity can strongly shape the body’s response to new infections. This has important consequences for improving vaccines and treatments, and for developing more accurate diagnostic tools.
