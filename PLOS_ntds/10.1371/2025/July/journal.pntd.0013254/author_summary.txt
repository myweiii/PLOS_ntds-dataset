Chikungunya is an infectious disease that can frequently cause chronic and debilitating muscle skeletal symptoms. While adults often experience severe symptoms and long-term effects, less information is available on children. This study investigates chikungunya in children and adolescents, focusing on its occurrence in an endemic area, frequency of asymptomatic cases, seroconversion and chronic manifestations. By examining these aspects, our research provides critical insights into the disease in a young population, which is essential to improve public health strategies and planning effective interventions and mitigate its impact.
