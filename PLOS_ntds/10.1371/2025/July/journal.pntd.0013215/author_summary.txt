The effectiveness of interventions that integrate MDAs, WASH and behavior change has been highlighted by the global community to address the NTD problem. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of integrated strategies, but the findings were different. This study aims to determine the effects of integrated interventions on schistosomiasis prevalence in rural Tanzania. In our study, the effectiveness of integrated NTD control models, which included MDA, community-led total sanitation, and health education, was more pronounced than when relying on school-based MDA alone. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in water contact behavior and an increase in use of improved toilets at home in the integrated model group compared to other groups.
