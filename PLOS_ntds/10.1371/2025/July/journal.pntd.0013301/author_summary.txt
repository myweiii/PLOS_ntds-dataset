Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonosis transmitted between dogs and ungulates; in humans, CE is a public health problem where livestock breeding is practiced, including Chile, which adhered to the Pan American Health Organization Regional Program for the Elimination of Cystic Echinococcosis 2020–2029. Abdominal ultrasound (US) screening of school-aged children (SAC) in high-risk areas is envisaged by the Action Plan for Control, Monitoring and Prevention of CE of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Chile. US screening in SAC is carried out in the Control Program of CE in Río Negro provice, Argentina; furthermore, targeting SAC in control programs for other neglected tropical diseases is common, due to the possibility for an early treatment and the easy accessibility of SAC. We implemented an US screening and estimated CE prevalence in SAC in three municipalities identified by the MoH of Chile as at high risk. Our results showed that US screening in SAC is feasible in Chile; however, prevalence of CE in this age group might be too low to allow school-based monitoring and evaluation of a control program. On the contrary, US screening in SAC could allow early case-finding and support the implementation of control measures around new diagnoses.
