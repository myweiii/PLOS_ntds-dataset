The sterile insect technique (SIT) involves subjecting laboratory-bred male mosquitoes to radiation, typically gamma rays, X-rays, or electrons, that render them sterile. These sterile male mosquitoes are then released into the field to mate with wild female mosquitoes. From that mating, no viable eggs are produced. The SIT is a mosquito population control strategy that prevents the spread of the dengue virus through Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. Considerable progress has been made regarding the SIT, and its effectiveness has been tested in numerous regions for managing local mosquito populations. In the present study, the field performance of sterile male mosquitoes was evaluated through a mark–release–recapture study, which was followed by an SIT trial. In an SIT pilot trial, pre-release control measures, including insecticide application and mosquito breeding site removal, were applied within the framework of integrated vector management. Community engagement activities were designed to ensure community acceptance and support for the SIT. The trial led to substantial reductions in the egg hatching, numbers of eggs and female mosquitoes despite challenges related to sterile male production and population isolation. This study revealed the key factors contributing to the success of an SIT trial to be the field performance of sterile male mosquitoes, complementary vector control methods, population isolation, and support from local residents.
