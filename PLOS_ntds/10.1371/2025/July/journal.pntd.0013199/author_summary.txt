This study used MaxEnt modeling to develop potential distribution models for the four main vectors of Chagas disease in the domestic cycle of Hidalgo, Mexico: T. dimidiata, T. mexicana, T. gerstaeckeri, and T. barberi. We analyzed over 500 occurrence records alongside environmental variables. The models were validated statistically using AUC metrics (AUCs ≥ 0.8) and experimentally through field collections at selected sites. Validation showed high concordance between model predictions and field data. Climate types were the primary contributors to most models, with precipitation and altitude also influencing some species. This integrated approach enhanced our understanding of vector habitats within environmental gradients in Hidalgo, providing valuable insights for Chagas disease surveillance and control efforts.
