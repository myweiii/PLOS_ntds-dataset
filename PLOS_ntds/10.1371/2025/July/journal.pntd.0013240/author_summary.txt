When cities lack proper planning, land use becomes disorganized, which creates ideal conditions for mosquitoes to thrive and spread diseases â€” especially affecting poorer communities. This study looked at how social and economic factors are connected to Zika virus infections in pregnant women and cases of microcephaly in babies in Recife, Brazil, between 2015 and 2021. The results showed that areas with higher poverty had more cases of Zika in pregnant women and more babies born with microcephaly. This highlights the strong link between social inequality and health problems. Both during and after the Zika outbreak, these issues continued to affect the most vulnerable neighborhoods in the city. These findings show how important it is to invest in public policies that improve living conditions and protect people socially and environmentally. Such actions are key to reducing the risk of Zika and other similar diseases, especially in the communities that need the most support.
