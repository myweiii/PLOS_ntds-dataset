    "Background": "Fascioliasis, caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, is a zoonotic disease that significantly impacts public health in agricultural communities, particularly in Vietnam. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding fascioliasis among residents in a rural community in Vietnam.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A cross-sectional study was conducted in Dong Thanh commune, north-central Vietnam. A random sample of 621 households was selected, and 1,398 individuals participated in this study. All participants were interviewed to assess their KAP regarding fascioliasis. Household heads were also interviewed about household practices, including life cycle knowledge, health-seeking behavior, water and sanitation practices, livestock and crop management, and dietary habits. Descriptive statistics were used to assess KAP, and generalized linear models were applied to examine the associations between socio-demographic variables and KAP. Awareness of fascioliasis was low, with 85% (1,193/1,398) of respondents reporting no prior knowledge. Detailed understanding of transmission, symptoms, and prevention was limited. Only 9% (124/1,398) of participants could accurately identify the symptoms, while 12% (168/1,398) were knowledgeable about preventive measures. A high percentage of households treated drinking water (99%, 613/619), and consumption of raw vegetables was widespread, with 93% (1,083/1,168) of individuals and 95% of households reporting this practice. Males were less likely to engage in non-risky practices than females (odds ratio: 0.696; 95% confidence interval: 0.591-0.819). Most households (85%, 522/617) sourced plants from their parcels, and 67% (395/588) used animal manure as fertilizer.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The study reveals significant gaps in KAP related to fascioliasis in Dong Thanh commune. There is a pressing need for targeted educational programs to enhance community awareness and promote safer practices to mitigate the risk of fascioliasis transmission. Future interventions should emphasize gender-specific education and broader community involvement to address these gaps effectively."
