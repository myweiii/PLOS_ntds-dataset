Fascioliasis, caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, is a zoonotic foodborne disease emerging in Vietnam. This study investigates the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to fascioliasis among residents of a commune in north-central Vietnam, where the disease is highly prevalent in livestock. A cross-sectional survey of 1,398 individuals and 621 households assessed life cycle knowledge, health-seeking behaviors, dietary habits, water and sanitation practices, and management of both livestock and crops. The results show that 85% of respondents were unaware of fascioliasis, with inadequate knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and prevention. Water treatment is commonly practiced, but consumption of raw vegetables persists. Socio-demographic factors, especially gender, males more likely to engage in risky practices. The findings highlight critical gaps in KAP, emphasizing the need for targeted education to improve awareness and promote safer practices, incorporating gender-specific strategies and community engagement.
