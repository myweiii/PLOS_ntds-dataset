Interferons (IFNs) are secreted antiviral cytokines, which commonly exert their activity by inducing an antiviral state, conferred by antiviral factors encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Collectively, ISGs can inhibit the replication of all known viruses, although some have developed resistance mechanisms. In this study, we compared the sensitivity to ISGs of different strains of Zika virus (ZIKV), a neurotropic arbovirus that exists as two distinct lineages, African and Asian. The Asian lineage of ZIKV has been responsible for major epidemics associated with severe neurological and congenital disorders, while the African lineage of ZIKV has not been reported to be responsible for epidemics or severe disease so far. In this study, we demonstrate that African ZIKV strains are more resistant than their Asian counterparts to the antiviral activity of IFN, and that ISGs that inhibit replication of Asian viruses have little or no effect on strains of African origin. While our results explain why African ZIKV strains propagate better than Asian ones, as demonstrated in various cellular and animal models, they do not provide an explanation for the higher pathogenicity and epidemic propensity of the Asian lineage.
