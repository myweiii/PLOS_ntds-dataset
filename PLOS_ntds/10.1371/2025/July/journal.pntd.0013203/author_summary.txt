To date, solid evidence on the effectiveness of vector control methods against Aedes mosquitoes is scarce, with most research coming from Latin America and Asia, although arboviruses are known to circulate in sub-Saharan Africa as well. Our scoping review aims to describe the interventions against Aedes mosquitoes implemented to date in sub-Saharan Africa and their field-tested effectiveness, highlighting the strengths and limitations of available research to provide insights for improving future vector control strategies. We found that the literature in this field is limited and heterogeneous, thus leaving a critical knowledge gap on effectiveness of Aedes vector control interventions in sub-Saharan African countries. Although data are scarce and study design are variable, chemical interventions, applied alone or as part of integrated vector control strategies, have demonstrated some benefits. However, these effects have been short-term and subject to failure if not tailored to how the Aedes mosquito behaves in a specific environment. Community-based interventions aimed at reducing mosquito breeding sources have been investigated in sub-Saharan Africa, but lack sufficient community perception analysis and process evaluation to assess their full impact.
