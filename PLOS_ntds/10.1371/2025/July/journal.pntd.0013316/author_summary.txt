Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by infected sandflies. VL transmission is influenced by weather patterns, land use, and climate change, but how specific weather events impact disease risk in local areas over short timescales is not well understood. Using spatiotemporal modeling, we captured both the nonlinear and delayed impacts of weather anomalies—such as unusually high temperatures and rainfall—on VL incidence over a range of climatic and environmental conditions. We found that weather anomalies can increase or decrease VL risk depending on timing and location. For example, abnormally high temperatures were associated with higher VL risk 2 months later, while above-average humidity and precipitation contributed to an immediate rise in VL risk, followed by a decrease at longer lags. These associations were more pronounced in rural and deforested regions, where weather anomalies amplified transmission risk. These patterns underscore the necessity for climate-adaptive, spatially targeted public health strategies.
