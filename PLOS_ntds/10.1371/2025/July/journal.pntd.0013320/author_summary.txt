Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease, is a significant health concern for both humans and dogs worldwide, often transmitted through the bite of an infected vector called sand fly. While the disease is typically managed through case detection, treatment, and vector control, maternal transmission to offspring remains a critical factor in maintaining infection rates. In the United States, hunting dogs are particularly susceptible to canine leishmaniosis (CanL), with previous studies showing high rates of transplacental transmission from infected mothers to their puppies. The present study investigated the possible benefit of a Leishmania A2 protein vaccine, LeishTec, in disturbing maternal transmission of the parasite to offspring. Results showed that puppies born to vaccinated mothers had significantly lower mortality rates, reduced likelihood of developing clinical disease, more robust immunity against parasites and decreased rates of testing positive for CanL compared to puppies born to unvaccinated mothers. These findings suggest that vaccinating infected mothers before pregnancy can effectively inhibit vertical transmission of L. infantum in dogs. This research highlights the potential for vertical transmission prevention as new strategy for controlling CanL and reducing the burden of leishmaniasis in endemic areas. Larger and more effectively powered studies, focused on disrupting or preventing vertical transmission, are necessary to gain a clearer understanding of this phenomenon and assess its potential for integration into public health strategies.
