Freshwater snails of the genus Bulinus play a crucial role in supporting the larval development of schistosomes and other trematode parasites responsible for significant diseases in humans and animals in Africa; yet knowledge of their genetics and genomics remains limited. Considerable contradictions exist regarding species identification and classification. Focusing on bulinine specimens from Kenya, we employed flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing, and morphometrics for a simultaneous investigation, making the data comparable and informative. This study uncovers unexpected genome size variation, suggests the presence of unrecognized genome expansion and/or whole genome duplication (polyploidization), provides new mitogenome data, clarifies phylogenetic relationships, illuminates genome evolution, highlights the limitations of morphological analysis, and raises questions about the cytogenetics and classification of the genus Bulinus.
