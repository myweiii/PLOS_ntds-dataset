    "Background": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) continue to significantly impact marginalized communities, contributing to high morbidity, stigma, and social exclusion. Traditional health education strategies often fail to engage affected populations effectively. This study evaluates the impact of a community public art as an innovative tool for improving knowledge, shifting attitudes, enhancing preventive practices, and reducing stigma related to NTDs in Okwelle Community, Imo State, Nigeria.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A mixed-methods implementation research design was employed, involving 724 participants (362 at pretest and 362 at posttest). Public art installations depicting common NTDs in the study location including, Onchocerciasis, Buruli ulcer, and Lymphatic filariasis, were strategically placed in community spaces. Pretest and posttest surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted to elucidate information about the influence of the public art on knowledge improvement and perception shifting. Quantitative data were analyzed using chi-square tests. Findings revealed a significant increase in NTDs awareness post-intervention (p < 0.05). Identification of disease symptoms improved, misconceptions regarding supernatural causation decreased, and preventive behaviors such as healthcare-seeking and participation in community health programs increased. Stigma reduction was evident, with greater acceptance of affected individuals and increased willingness to interact with them. Notably, 98.3% of participants supported maintaining public art as an educational tool.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Public art can be a powerful and culturally relevant medium for enhancing NTDs awareness, promoting behavior change, and reducing stigma in endemic communities. This study highlights its potential for integration into broader public health strategies to improve disease awareness and community participation. Future research should explore the scalability and long-term sustainability of public art interventions in diverse settings."
