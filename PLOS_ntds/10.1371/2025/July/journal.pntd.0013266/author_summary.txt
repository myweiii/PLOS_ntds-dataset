Neglected Tropical Diseases affect some of the worldâ€™s most vulnerable communities, causing illness, disability, and social stigma. Many people are unaware of these diseases or hold misconceptions that prevent early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explored how public art can be used as a tool to educate communities, improve knowledge, and reduce stigma associated with NTDs. We worked with community members in Okwelle, Nigeria, to create public murals that visually represented common NTDs including, Onchocerciasis, Buruli ulcer, and Lymphatic filariasis. Before the artwork was introduced, many residents had limited knowledge of these diseases, and some believed they were caused by witchcraft or punishment from a higher power. After the murals were displayed, awareness increased significantly, attitudes toward affected individuals improved, and more people took steps to prevent and treat NTDs.Our study shows that public art can be an effective and culturally relevant way to share health information, challenge stigma, and encourage healthier behaviors in underserved communities. This approach could be adapted for other public health challenges, making education more engaging and accessible to those who need it most.
