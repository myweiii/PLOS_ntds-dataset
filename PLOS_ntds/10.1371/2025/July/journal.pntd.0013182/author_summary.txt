Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease prevalent in western China. In this study, we used a risk model to predict how the spread of CE might change in the future, considering factors like climate change, land use changes, and socio-economic development. We focused on understanding how these changes might affect high-risk areas and what role public awareness plays in reducing the spread of disease. Our results suggest that regions such as Yunnan, Gansu, and Sichuan may experience higher risks in future. Importantly, we found an association between improved public awareness of CE prevention and an estimated reduction of the population at risk by 3.35%, corresponding to a decrease of 7.92 million people in western China by 2030. This study provides valuable insights into how global changes may influence the future spread of CE and emphasizes the importance of public health interventions. Our findings offer a useful framework for assessing the risk of other zoonotic diseases that may be influenced by similar factors.
