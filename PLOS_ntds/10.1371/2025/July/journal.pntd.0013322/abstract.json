    "Abstract": "Melioidosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is known to be associated with the rainy season. Although several attempts have been made to explain this phenomenon, data on the association between the presence of B. pseudomallei in environmental reservoirs and weather variables remain limited. This study focused on water samples collected from a paddy field in north-central Vietnam to investigate this association. A total of 800 samples were collected over eight different time points in 2018. Using a two-step enrichment method, 349 samples (43.6%) were positive by a B. pseudomallei-specific real-time PCR assay targeting the TTSS1 gene and by B. pseudomallei isolation on Ashdown agar. The positive culture rate of B. pseudomallei ranged from 5% in the winter to 82% in the summer. Quantitative culture method directly detected B. pseudomallei colonies only from samples collected in the summer, with an overall mean count of 93.1 CFU/ml (n = 13; range from 5 to 750). The positive culture rate of B. pseudomallei showed a strong positive correlation with the average ambient temperature when binned from three days up to a month before the sampling dates, with the strongest correlation observed at the 19-day bin data (rs = 0.905; p = 0.002). Two clusters of melioidosis cases were identified in the summer, one after tropical depressions and another after rice harvesting activities. Diverse B. pseudomallei genotypes were found within this small-scale paddy field, with a novel sequence type (ST) 1994 persisting throughout the year. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that increased ambient temperature significantly contributed to the higher occurrence and bacterial load of B. pseudomallei in surface water, leading to more melioidosis cases if combined with severe rainfalls or occupational agricultural exposure. These findings should be considered in the context of global warming and climate change."
