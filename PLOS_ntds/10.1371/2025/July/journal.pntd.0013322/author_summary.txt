Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental bacterium that can cause melioidosis, a potentially fatal infectious disease affecting both humans and animals, particularly in many tropical and subtropical regions. While melioidosis cases typically peak during the rainy season, the association between the presence of this bacterium in environmental reservoirs, climatic factors, and disease incidence remains poorly understood. This study provides the first evidence of a significant correlation between ambient temperature and the positive culture rate of B. pseudomallei in paddy field water. The findings suggest that the increase in melioidosis cases during the rainy season can be attributed to a higher occurrence and bacterial load of B. pseudomallei in surface water during the summer, especially after heavy rainfalls and occupational agricultural exposure. Our findings are important to consider in the context of global warming and climate change, which may shift the global distribution of B. pseudomallei and the epidemiology of melioidosis, possibly expanding into areas in subtropical regions where melioidosis is currently suspected to be less common.
