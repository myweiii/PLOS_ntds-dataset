Mosquito-borne viruses are continual threats to human and animal health globally. With climate change, the geographic distribution of mosquitoes is projected to expand, leading to increased burden of their accompanying viruses. The flavivirus genus consists of well-known threats including yellow fever virus, Zika virus, dengue viruses, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus as well as closely related, but understudied species, such as Usutu virus. Although most Usutu virus infections in humans are asymptomatic, symptoms of neuroinvasive disease in individuals have been recorded. Further, this virus is highly lethal in avian species and has caused massive die-offs of Eurasian blackbirds. Here, we investigated Usutu virus infection in various cell lines and mouse strains to gain insight into how this virus establishes infection in a susceptible host. Cell lines derived from humans, mice, chicken, and mosquitoes were all susceptible to Usutu virus. Immunocompetent mice were resistant to infection, but mice with disrupted innate immune signaling succumbed to lethal infection. Notably, intact innate immune signaling was essential in hematopoietic cells, but dispensable in liver and neuronal cells. Additionally, B, T, and natural killer cells were not necessary to restrict Usutu virus infection.
