Tsetse flies are sole biological vectors of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT) in sub-Sahara Africa. Tsetse fly repellent technologies that reduce contact between tsetse flies and their vertebrate hosts can disrupt transmission cycle of HAT and AAT. Waterbuck Repellent Compounds (WRC) and Novel Repellent Blend (NRB) are recently developed tsetse fly repellent formulations. Information on relative efficacy of these formulations against major tsetse fly in Kenya is limited. Such information can inform choices of repellent technology for optimal control of the flies. We assessed relative field responses of Glossina pallidipes and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, representative of savannah (morsitans) and riverine (palpalis) groups of tsetse flies, respectively, to these repellent formulations. We established that WRC and NRB were effective against G. pallidipes, with NRB exhibiting 3.5 and 4.7-folds better repellence of female and male G. pallidipes than WRC. None of the repellents was effective against of G. f. fuscipes. Whether these profiles represent general responses of morsitans and palpalis group of tsetse flies remains to be determined. The G. f. fuscipes merits further research to formulate an effective repellent against this fly. The NRB can potentially better-protect vertebrate than WRC from G. pallidipes.
