Brucellosis is an infection caused by different species of the Brucella bacteria. It is transmitted from animals to humans by direct contact or by consumption of contaminated animal products. Brucellosis requires prolonged treatment with multiple antibiotics to be fully eradicated, otherwise it can relapse. How often brucellosis relapses is a topic of contention, with a wide variety of estimates. This is likely due to the lack of a standard definition of relapse, as well as the smaller sample size of some of the studies. We aimed to get an accurate estimate of the rate of brucellosis recurrence, utilizing a larger sample size of 1,049 confirmed brucellosis cases in our hospital, which is a referral center in an endemic area. We also implemented strict criteria, ensuring that other causes of therapy failure, such as nonadherence or repeated exposure, are not mislabeled as relapse. As a result, we found that the relapse rate of brucellosis was 0.95%, considerably lower than the rate in most reported studies. This demonstrates that the rate of brucellosis relapse when standard treatment regimens are adhered to are less than previously estimated.
