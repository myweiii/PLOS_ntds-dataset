Countries have made progress towards eliminating trachoma, a bacterial blinding disease. To assess trachoma prevalence, countries conduct surveys involving examination for clinical signs of trachoma, which in turn inform the decision to implement mass drug administration of antibiotics. However, clinical examination can result in errors, particularly as the disease becomes rare. Countries have explored alternative methods of identifying trachoma, which include testing swabs of the inner eyelid or dried blood spots (DBS). These methods can be more accurate than clinical examination, but also more costly. We examined the costs of surveys with swabs and DBS in Tanzania and Mozambique compared to surveys with clinical examination alone. We found that adding swabs and DBS to a survey increased costs by 408% in Tanzania and 55% in Mozambique. We also assessed cost-effectiveness, or the extent to which additional costs corresponded to greater trachoma indicator identification, and found that swabs were most cost-effective in Tanzania, while DBS were most cost-effective in Mozambique. Using both swabs and DBS together in a survey added the most costs, with similar gain in trachoma identification compared to using one or the other. Our results will help countries plan for future surveys.
