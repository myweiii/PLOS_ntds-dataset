Since 2013, dengue has spread rapidly throughout KP Province, northern Pakistan, resulting in major outbreaks with over 20,000 reported cases and nearly 100 fatalities. Ae. aegypti is the primary dengue vector, with Ae. albopictus emerging as a new concern. This study addresses the significant gaps in entomological and molecular surveillance by identifying key dengue risk factors across multiple districts in KP. We conducted surveys of water-holding containers in households to detect Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae, assessed mosquito infection rates with DENV, and calculated Stegomyia indices to measure infestation levels. Our findings show that Ae. aegypti was the dominant vector, making up about 67% of all samples, while Ae. albopictus displayed considerable adaptability to both domestic and peri-domestic environments. Metropolitan districts such as Peshawar, Mardan, and Nowshera exhibited alarmingly high levels of Aedes infestation, with Breteau Indices of 89.3, 71.4, and 57, respectively. Molecular analysis revealed that 19% of mosquito pools were infected with DENV-2 and DENV-3, underscoring the ongoing transmission of multiple dengue virus serotypes. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted vector control strategies and continuous entomological surveillance to address the growing public health threat posed by dengue in the region. By providing critical baseline data, this study supports the development of cost-effective, region-specific interventions to reduce dengue transmission and prevent future outbreaks.
