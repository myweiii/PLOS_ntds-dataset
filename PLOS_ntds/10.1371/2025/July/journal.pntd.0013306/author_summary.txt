Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by rodent-transmittedÂ Hantaviruses. Although prevention efforts in China have reduced HFRS incidence, the disease remains a significant threat in regions such as Shandong Province, especially with the challenges posed by climate change. In this study, we used a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model combined with distributed lag nonlinear model to assess the nonlinear and lagged effects of hydrometeorological conditions on HFRS incidence, and explore the modifying effects of regional characteristics in these associations. The results of this study revealed a U-shaped cumulative association, with both wet and dry conditions associated with increased HFRS within a 6-month lag period. County-level characteristics, such as economic, environmental, and climatic factors significantly modified these associations. The relative risks under extreme wet conditions were higher in area with low per capita Gross Domestic Product, Normalized difference vegetation index, Total power of agricultural machinery and annual temperature, as well as areas with high elevations. The modification effects under extreme dry conditions were similar but less pronounced. These findings provide valuable guidance for developing climate change adaptation strategies and targeted public health interventions to reduce the risk of HFRS outbreaks, particularly in vulnerable regions.
