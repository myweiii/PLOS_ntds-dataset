The World Health Organization considers Chagas disease one of the most important neglected diseases in the Americas. However, numerous Chagas disease patients are currently found worldwide, even in regions where the biological cycle of T. cruzi does not occur due to the absence of triatomines, which are essential for the parasite’s natural transmission (e.g., Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada, and the USA). The main pathology in the chronic phase of Chagas disease occurs at the cardiac level. In some cases, this is explained by the presence of intracellular amastigote nests in heart cells, while in others, cardiac manifestations appear despite the absence of the parasite in this organ. This has led several research groups to investigate the mechanisms responsible for cardiac damage in patients, which remain unclear. However, several hypotheses have been proposed: The first suggests that inflammatory reactions induced by the parasite itself or by any of its components, which cause damage to tissues, lead to tissue alterations. The second is based on molecular mimicry, resulting in autoantigen recognition by autoantibodies and an autoimmune attack. The third proposes the existence of factors capable of altering the conductivity of the heart’s conduction bundles, ultimately affecting cardiac contractility. Therefore, given the need to shed light on these mechanisms and based on the described protein load carried by these EVs and the physiological changes they are capable of inducing in uninfected cells, we have assessed the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by trypomastigotes—and the immune complexes they form upon recognition by host IgGs—in the development of cardiac alterations that could be associated with those described in Chagas disease patients. We believe that this work highlights the impact of EVs and immune complexes on the progression of Chagas disease symptoms.
