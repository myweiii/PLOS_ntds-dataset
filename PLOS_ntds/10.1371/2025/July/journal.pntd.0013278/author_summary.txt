Plague, a severe infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, remains a significant public health concern in Madagascar, where seasonal outbreaks continue to occur. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for timely treatment and outbreak control. Current diagnostic methods, including bacteriology and rapid diagnostic tests, often face limitations in speed, sensitivity and/ or specificity especially in remote settings. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new molecular diagnostic tool: a triplex real-time PCR assay that simultaneously detects three genes from Y. pestis (pla, caf1, and yopM). This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy while reducing turnaround time. The assay was validated using clinical samples collected in Madagascar and showed high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%), outperforming conventional techniques. It is important to notice that this technique resolved previously inconclusive results produced by standard molecular methods. Our findings demonstrate that this triplex qPCR is a robust, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tool that can improve plague detection, especially in outbreak settings. Moreover, its implementation could significantly strengthen public health responses and laboratory capacities in endemic regions like Madagascar.
