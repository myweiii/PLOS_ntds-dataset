The co-endemicity of malaria and leishmaniasis affects thousands of individuals annually, potentially complicating the diagnosis and resolution of both diseases. However, few studies have explored how the presence of a secondary infection might modulate the host immune response, either exacerbating or suppressing it. In this study, we utilize experimental models to investigate the impact of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection on the progression of Leishmania major infection, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in both humans and mice. Our findings demonstrate that, while the clinical course of malaria remains unaffected by co-infection, the progression of cutaneous leishmaniasis is significantly altered. Co-infection leads to reduced tissue damage and a lower Leishmania parasite load in the dermis. This phenomenon can be attributed to a decrease in the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and activated T cells to the site of infection, leading to reduced inflammation and lower availability of host cells, particularly inflammatory monocytes, that support Leishmania replication.
