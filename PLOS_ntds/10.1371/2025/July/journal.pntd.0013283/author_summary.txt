This study explored the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 37 SFTS human-to-human transmission clusters that occurred in China from 1996 to 2023. We found that the clusters occurred from March to November and were mainly concentrated in rural areas in central, eastern and northeastern China, and the affected population was mainly middle-aged and elderly farmers. The number of cases involved in a single cluster ranged from 2 to 13, with an average of 5 cases. Because the early symptoms were atypical, most of the index cases were diagnosed after multiple medical visits. The case fatality of the index cases (97.30%) was extremely high. Secondary cases were mostly infected by contact with the blood and bloody secretions of patients, and mostly occurred among family members, medical workers, villagers, and morticians who were involved in nursing care (72.97%), funeral and mortuary (64.86%), and medical treatment (24.32%). If early diagnosis, treatment and management can be achieved, while raising public awareness of SFTS and taking personal precautions when caring for cases and contacting the remains of SFTS cases, the occurrence of human-to-human transmission clusters can be avoided.
