Mapping schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is essential to identify at-risk populations and implement targeted interventions effectively. Despite global progress, existing SCH mapping approaches still struggle to account for SCH’s clustered distribution within implementation units. Since 2012, Kenya’s National School-Based Deworming Programme has focused on treating school-age children (SAC) based on a sub-national baseline survey and spatial modeling from that year. Under the Breaking Transmission Strategy (BTS), Kenya’s Ministry of Health adopted a WHO-guided Ward-level precision mapping protocol to support the elimination of neglected diseases like SCH and STH. This approach enabled a more accurate identification of at-risk populations, revealing variations in prevalence and ultimately reducing treatment needs for SCH and STH through more efficient community-based mass drug administration in western Kenya.
