Chagas disease is caused by a parasitic infection most frequently occurring in Mexico, Central and South America. Approximately 300,000 individuals who migrated from these regions are living with Chagas disease in the US and may benefit from antiparasitic treatment. Yet many US providers are unfamiliar with treatment eligibility and management. Treatment with the two currently available medications (benznidazole and nifurtimox) is frequently associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which can be challenging to manage. This study retrospectively described management of patients living with Chagas disease who were treated by a multidisciplinary team at Boston Medical Center. Most initiated treatment with benznidazole, but some were treated with nifurtimox due to benznidazole intolerance or shortage. Eighty-five percent of individuals who took benznidazole and 100% who took nifurtimox experienced ADRs. The most common benznidazole-associated ADR category was allergic, whereas for nifurtimox it was gastrointestinal. Despite significant ADRs, 75% completed the recommended 60 days of therapy, and 91% completed at least one month of therapy. This analysis underscores the significant side effect burden of currently available therapies for Chagas disease and that intensive treatment monitoring and support facilitates treatment completion. Tolerable and safe therapies are needed to expand access and improve treatment success.
