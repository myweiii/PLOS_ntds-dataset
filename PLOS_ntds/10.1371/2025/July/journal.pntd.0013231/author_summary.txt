Intestinal parasitic infections are especially common in warm climates, particularly where sanitation facilities are poor. Immunocompromised individuals, such as people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, are more susceptible to parasitic infections. Strongyloides stercoralis is a common parasite in Iquitos, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon, although its current infection rate among HIV patients is unknown. In this study, our objective was to detect the prevalence of the parasite in the stool of 339 patients from two different hospitals using three microbiological techniques, as none of them is completely reliable by itself. The prevalence of antibodies in the blood of 537 patients was also assessed, since it is useful for knowing the burden of disease in the community as a contact marker. In addition to the diagnostic procedure, we conducted an interview on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to identify risk factors for infection that can be corrected. This information will help improve prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management in this population.
