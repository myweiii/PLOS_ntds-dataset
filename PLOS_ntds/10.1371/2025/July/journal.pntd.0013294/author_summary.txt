The disabling leg swelling condition, podoconiosis, is unusual in having never been linked to a biological agent such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus. For five decades, the occurrence of podoconiosis has been connected with highland areas in the tropics where red clay soils predominate, and long-term barefoot exposure to these soils has been postulated as necessary to developing the condition. However, no clear factor or trigger within the soil has yet been clearly documented as ‘causing’ podoconiosis. It is vital for the prevention and treatment of podoconiosis to understand its aetiology better. We collected all research articles in which information on bedrock, soil or soil-generating (pedogenic) factors was collected with reference to podoconiosis. We identified 27 studies spanning 51 years, and extracted and synthesised information from all these. The findings suggest important routes of future research, in particular exploring the enrichment of certain elements and minerals within soils and the study of soil organic matter.
