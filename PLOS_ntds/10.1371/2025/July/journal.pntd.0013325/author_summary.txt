Arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are an increasing global health concern. While traditionally confined to tropical regions, these diseases are now emerging in new areas, including parts of Europe, due to rising international travel and environmental changes that support the spread and establishment of Aedes mosquitoes. This shift highlights the urgent need for tools to assess and manage outbreak risks in previously unaffected regions. In this study, we present a data-informed modeling framework to assess the risk of local transmission of Aedes-borne diseases in non-endemic areas where the mosquito vector has recently become established. We adapted a classical stochastic model of disease transmission to reflect local conditions, incorporating mosquito abundance and the arrival of viremic travelers to simulate different outbreak scenarios. By integrating real-world entomological and epidemiological data, we produced monthly risk maps for the Basque Country at the municipal level and evaluated risk under various scenarios. Our approach is flexible and can be updated with new data or adapted to different settings and diseases. It offers a valuable tool to support public health planning, improve preparedness, and guide timely interventions against emerging vector-borne threats.
