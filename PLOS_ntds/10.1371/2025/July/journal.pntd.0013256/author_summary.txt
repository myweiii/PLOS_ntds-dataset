Aedes aegypti is a major nuisance mosquito in many warm places across the world. This species is particularly significant for vector control programs because it has high capacity to transmit viruses that can cause human disease including dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus. Traditional chemical control treatments are not always effective for Ae. aegypti, because larvae breed in dispersed sites, their adults rest in cryptic locations, and insecticide resistance has evolved in some populations. Thus, additional control tools are needed for this species. Here we show that the sterile insect technique (SIT), a long-standing tool in agricultural pest management, can be effectively used to suppress a nuisance population of Ae. aegypti on Captiva Island in Florida, USA. Specifically, we released just over 24 million sterile, lab-reared males between June 2020 to September 2022 and show that the number of wild females was substantially reduced in our intervention site compared to both the same site before intervention and non-intervention sites. Our work demonstrates that SIT should be considered for use as part of the toolbox for the integrative management of mosquito pests.
