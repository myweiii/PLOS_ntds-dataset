Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania that occurred when the infected sandfly phlebotomine injected the parasite during blood meals. Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin lesions. In regions where the parasite is present, many people do not develop the disease. Understanding why some people develop the disease and others donâ€™t, can help in designing vaccine or new therapy such as immunotherapy. Furthermore, understanding how the system of defense (immunological defense) of individuals to the parasite Leishmania works can also help us to know why some individuals are susceptible to developing the disease, while others are protected to the parasite. In this work, we examined the genetics of the system of immune defense of individuals who develop the disease and those who do not develop the disease. We studied two genetic variations of the gene IFNG-AS1 and showed that one genetic variant is associated with disease development and one with protection.
