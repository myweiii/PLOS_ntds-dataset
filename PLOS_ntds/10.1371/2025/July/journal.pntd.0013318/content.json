    "Background": "Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by the flagellated protozoan Leishmania spp. The extracellular promastigote form is transmitted through the bites of phlebotomine sandflies and transforms into the intracellular amastigote form within the mammalian host following blood meals. Leishmaniasis presents a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic cases and self-healing or non-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to severe mucosal involvement or life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis (VL). CL is the most common form of human leishmaniasis, characterized by inflammatory ulcerative cutaneous lesions with elevated borders, confined to the skin.\nLeishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease despite it is endemic in 99 countries across Africa, Asia, Southern Europe, the Middle East and South America according to WHO in 2022 [1]. In 2023, 272098 cases of new CL and 11922 new VL cases were reported to WHO [2]. This disease, associated with poverty, malnutrition, population displacement and poor housing conditions, has a significant global burden and affects predominantly vulnerable populations living in remote regions with limited access to healthcare. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic zoonosis, and its transmission patterns are changing with increasing urbanization due to deforestation and human invasion. To date, there is no vaccine and treatment efficacy is low.\nThe involvement of the immune system in leishmaniasis has been extensively demonstrated in the resistant C57BL/6 and the susceptible BALB/c mouse strains infected with L. major. BALB/c mice exhibit a robust T-helper 2 (Th2)-type response to L. major, leading to disease progression, in contrast to resistant C57BL/6 mice, which develop a strong T-helper 1 (Th-1)-type response, predominantly dependent on the interleukin-12 (IL-12)/interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) axis [3]. IFN-γ plays a critical role in controlling Leishmania growth during infection. IFNG knock-out C57BL/6 mice are unable to control L. major infection. Blocking IFN-γ signaling results in increased lesion size and parasite burden [4].\nIn Brazil, L. braziliensis (Lb), L. guyanensis (Lg), L. lainsoni, L. amazonensis, L. shawi, L. naiffi and L. lindenbergi are the major species causing tegumentary leishmaniasis. In the state of Amazonas, Lg is the primary etiological agent of CL, accounting for approximately 95% of CL cases. In regions where L. braziliensis is endemic, individuals with a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH+) response to Leishmania antigen but without a history of disease occurrence have been observed, indicating the presence of subclinical or asymptomatic infection [5].\nIn regions endemic for leishmaniasis, not all individuals develop disease following bites from Leishmania-infected phlebotomine sandflies, suggesting that host genetic factors significantly influence clinical outcomes. Notably, the host-pathogen interaction has several layers of complexity, including the genetic background of the host, the virulence and genotype of the parasite, the Leishmania-phlebotomine vector and an environment favorable for the development of lesions. There is evidence of a major recessive gene controlling susceptibility to Lb-CL among migrants to an endemic area of leishmaniasis in Bolivia [6]. Family-based genetic epidemiological studies have demonstrated the role of genetic components in controlling susceptibility to L. peruviana-CL, particularly at an early age of onset in Peru [7]. Familial aggregation of CL and ML, caused by L. braziliensis, in endemic regions supports the hypothesis of heritability and genetic susceptibility of clinical forms of leishmaniasis [8]. Genetic variants within the IFNG are suggested to influence cytokine levels of IFN-γ [9–11]. Our findings indicate that the IFNG variant rs2069705 may serve as a genetic modifier of the clinical outcome of L. guyanensis-infection and individuals with a haplotype of several single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within IFNG, associated with low IFN-γ plasma levels, have a 60% increased risk of developing Lg-CL [11].\nThe long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) interferon gamma antisense-1 (IFNG-AS1), also known as TMEVPG1 and NEST, is adjacent to IFNG on chromosome 12q14. In a murine model of multiple sclerosis, IFNG-AS1 was identified as a susceptibility locus for Theiler’s virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) [12]. Subsequently, the homologous region on human chromosome 12q14–15 was associated with multiple sclerosis in humans [13]. IFNG-AS1 is induced in response to Th1 differentiation through mechanisms dependent on Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 4 (STAT4) and T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) [14–16], and IFNG-AS1 cooperates with T-bet to promote IFNG transcription. T-bet binds to the IFNG-AS1 promoter/proximal enhancer, as well as to upstream distal enhancers in both developing and differentiated effector Th1 cells, playing a critical role in epigenetic remodeling of these regions [17]. IFNG-AS1 is essential for Th1 lineage-specific expression of IFNG and is co-expressed with IFNG. IFNG-AS1 contributes to IFNG expression, and the human IFNG-AS1 is selectively expressed in Th1 cells, particularly in effector Th1 cells, and is regulated by the Th1 transcription factors STAT4 and T-bet [17]. IFNG-AS1 expression is downregulated after in vitro stimulation of murine CD4+ or CD8 + splenocytes, while IFNG expression is upregulated [17]. T-bet guides the epigenetic remodeling of IFNG-AS1 proximal and distal enhancers, leading to recruitment of the stimulus-inducible transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and ETS proto-oncogene (Ets-1) to the locus [18]. The enhancer-specific activity of IFNG-AS1 and its transcriptional regulation depend on NF-κB.\nGene expression profiling of colonic tissue surgical samples from patients with ulcerative colitis revealed high expression of IFNG-AS1 [19], and bioinformatics analysis suggests that the IFNG-AS1 is associated with the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility locus SNV rs7134599 [20]. Moreover, its genomic location is adjacent to the inflammatory cytokine, IFNG. The IFNG-AS1 SNV rs4913269 is associated with susceptibility to L. braziliensis-CL [21]. Considering the importance of IFNG-AS1 in regulating the expression of IFNG, this study investigated whether the variants of IFNG-AS1 rs4913269 C/G and rs7134599 A/G may be associated with L. guyanensis-CL in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethical statement\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Fundação de Medicina Tropical Heitor Vieira Dourado under approval file number CAAE 09995212.0.0000.0005. This research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or from parents/guardians for participants under 18 years of age, for the collection of biological samples and subsequent analysis.\n\n\nStudy population\nThe present study was conducted in the peri-urban region of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, where progressive deforestation for settlements, agriculture and farming has been observed over the years, resulting in the emergence of endemic areas for L. guyanensis due to human encroachment. This study population has been previously described in multiple studies [22–26]. The research was conducted at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD), Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Treatment-naïve patients with active confirmed CL caused by L. guyanensis for the first time and presenting with six or fewer lesions were included in the study, with most having a single lesion. All patients presented recent lesions, ranging from three to five weeks. Patients with active CL were recruited between November 2012 and April 2017 at FMT-HVD, a regional reference center for tropical diseases. Healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from the same endemic area as the patients and underwent a thorough clinical examination by physicians to exclude any prior history of leishmaniasis. They shared similar socioeconomic and epidemiological backgrounds as the patients with active CL and had been living in the endemic area for more than five years. Most participants in this study were agricultural or farm workers. A significant majority of the study participants had a history of Plasmodium vivax malaria, as these regions also are endemic for malaria. All participants tested negative for HIV infection and had no history of cardiovascular, renal, or diabetic disease. Pregnant women were excluded. HCs were not stratified as asymptomatic or non-infected groups, as no delayed hypersensitivity test (Montenegro skin test) was performed for Leishmania antigens. This population is an admixed group of Native American ancestry, commonly referred to as “caboclo”, comprising 50–60% Native American, 40–50% European and approximately 10% African ancestry [27].\n\n\nSample size estimation\nThe effective sample size for genetic association analysis for case-control study, assuming multiple gene inputs for a trait, was calculated based on several assumptions, including a minor allele frequency of 5%, disease prevalence of 5%, complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the marker and the trait, a case–control ratio of 1:1, a type 1 error rate of 5% and an odds ratio of 1.5 and 2.0 for heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively, with statistical power of 80%, using the Genetic Power calculator of Harvard University. The genetic allelic model indicated a required sample size of 789 cases and 789 controls. This study consisted of 1714 unrelated individuals (855 patients with Lg-CL and 859 HCs). This case–control study compared unrelated patients with Lg-CL to healthy unrelated individuals and adhered to the guidelines for Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA).",
    "Biological materials": "Identification of the Leishmania spp\nAll patients with CL provided biopsy specimens from cutaneous ulcer lesions for the identification of Leishmania spp. Parasite presence was confirmed by microscopic-examination of Giemsa-stained lesion scarifications. DNA extracted from the biopsy specimens was subjected to Leishmania vianna-specific PCR to distinguish L. guyanensis from L. braziliensis, following previously established protocols [28,29]. Species identification was confirmed via direct nucleotide sequencing using an ABI 3130XL DNA genetic analyzer. A 233-bp fragment of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene and a 227-bp fragment of the mini exon genes were sequenced as described previously [26]. Notably, all Lg-CL patients included in this study were also enrolled in our previous studies [22–26].\n\n\nDNA purification and genotyping of IFNGAS1 variants\nAll participants provided 5 mL of peripheral blood via venipuncture, collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated Vacutainer tubes containing (Becton Dickinson, São Paulo, Brazil). Genomic DNA was extracted using the proteinase K digestion and salting-out method [30].\n\n\nGenotyping of IFNGAS1 variants\nThe rs4913269 and rs7134599 variants of the IFNGAS-1 were genotyped using direct nucleotide sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), respectively. The following primers pairs were used: rs4913269F: 5’-TTT TAC CCC TCG CTC CCC T-3’ and rs4913269R: 5’-CCA ACC CAA ATG CCC ATC CA-3’ for (rs4913269) and rs7134599F: 5’-CCC TTT CCA TTT CTA CTC TAG GC-3’ and rs7134599R: 5’-ATG AGC TGG CTT CTA AGG AAT GG-3’ for (rs7134599) to amplify the regions encompassing the variants separately.\nPCR was conducted in a 25μL reaction mixture containing 2.0 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 pmol/L each forward and reverse primer, 40 μmol/L of each dNTP, 50 ng of genomic DNA and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a buffer containing 500mmol/L KCl and 100mol/L Tris-HCL (pH 8.3). The PCR cycling conditions for rs4913269 were as follows: an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95ºC, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95ºC for 15 s, annealing at 62ºC for 15 s and extension at 72ºC for 30 s, with a final extension step at 72ºC for 7 min. The PCR products sizes were 285 bp for rs4913269 and 191 bp for rs7134599.\n\n\nGenotyping of rs7134599 by PCR-RFLP.\nA 10-uL aliquot of the PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes Nla III or HpyCH4IV (New England Biolabs). Nla III cleaves the 19-bp fragment into 123 and 68-bp fragments in the presence of the A allele and the G allele remains uncut. HpyCH4IV cleaves the fragment into 119 and 72 bp fragments in the presence of the G allele, while the A allele remains uncleaved. The PCR-RFLP products were size-separated by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nGenotyping of rs7134599 by direct nucleotide sequencing\nThe PCR products were purified using a 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution to remove residual primers and free nucleotides. Nucleotide sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) with the same forward or reverse primers used in the PCR reaction. The sequencing was carried out on an ABI 3130XL DNA sequencer using POP-7 polymer. Sequences were initially analyzed using the Sequencing Analysis software (Applied Biosystems, v5.3.1) and only high-quality sequences data were used for SNV analysis.\n\n\nMeasurement plasma cytokines\nPlasma samples were collected from 400 patients with Lg-CL and 400 HCs for cytokine analysis [31]. Concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-12p70 in 5uL of plasma were measured using the Human Cytokine Grp I Panel 27- Plex kit (Bio-Rad, USA) through a multiplex bead-based assay. The assay was conducted following the manufacturer’s instruction on the Bio-plex 200 Protein Array System (Luminex Corporation, USA).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nGenotypic and allelic frequencies were determined by direct counting. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by comparing observed and expected genotypes distribution using the χ2 test. Statistical comparisons of genotype distributions between individuals with Lg-CL and HCs were performed using R software (version 4.3.1) with the SNPassoc package (version 2.1-0), employing logistic regression. The effects of genotypic variation on circulating plasma cytokine levels were assessed using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for quantitative traits in R software with the SNPassoc package. Cytokine data were visualized using the ggplot2 package. Post-hoc analysis following ANOVA was conducted using the rstatix package (version 0.7.2) in R software (r-project.org) for multiple comparisons. Post-hoc P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the False discovery rate (FDR) correction. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis and LD visualization were performed using Haploview software (version 4.2).",
    "Results": "The study population consisted of 1,714 unrelated individuals, including 855 patients with Lg-CL and 859 HCs. A total of 639 were male patients with Lg-CL (mean age ± standard error of the mean 34.29 ± 0.53 years) and 216 were female patients with Lg-CL (37.19 ± 1.05 years). In the HCs group, 591 were male (42 ± 0.72 years) and 268 were female (40 ± 1.04 years). Male HCs were significantly older than male patients with Lg-CL (p < 0.0001).\nThe IFNG-AS1 gene, located on chromosome 12q14, is adjacent to IFNG. IFNG-AS-1 is approximately 165 kb upstream of the IFNG coding region on the opposite strand to IFNG, spanning nucleotide 67,989,447–68,234,686 covering IFNG, IL26 and part of IL22, as shown in Fig 1. The variant rs4913269 is in the third intron at nucleotide 68,014,065 and rs7134599 is positioned at nucleotide 68,106,295 and 48,474 bp upstream of IFNG.\nLocation of the variants rs4913269 and rs7134599 of IFNGAS-1 on chromosome 12.\n\n\nIFNGAS-1 variants are associated with Lg-CL\nGenotypic and allelic frequencies for rs4913269 and rs7134599 are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed for either variant in patients with Lg-CL or HCs. The rs4913269 G/G genotype was less frequent in patients with Lg-CL (9%) compared with HCs (15%). Individuals with the rs4913269 G/G genotypes exhibited a 46% reduced risk of developing Lg-CL compared to individuals with rs4913269 C/C genotypes (odds ratio adjusted for age and sex [ORadj]= 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39–0.75; Pvadj = 0.0001). The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that the recessive genetic model provided the best fit model in logistic regression analyses.\nThe distribution of IFNG-AS1 rs7134599 genotypes differed significantly between patients with Lg-CL and HC (P = 2.9 x10-6) as shown in Table 2. There was an excess of genotypes A/A and A/G among the patients with Lg-CL. Individuals with the A/A genotype exhibited a 130% increased risk of progressing to Lg-CL compared to individuals with the C/C genotype (ORadj = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6–3.4; P = 0.0001), whereas heterozygous A/G individuals had a 50% increased risked (ORadj = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.9; P = 0.0002). The AIC analysis identified the dominant genetic model as the best-fit model, suggesting that the A allele is associated with increased risk of Lg-CL (OR=1.55 [1.32 – 1.82]; P < 0.0001).\nWe have previously demonstrated that the T allele of the rs2069705 C/T variant of the INFG, located in the promoter region at -1616 bp, is significantly associated with susceptibility to Lg-CL in the same study population [11]. This variant is located at nucleotide position 68,161,231 on the chromosome 12, approximately 55 Kb downstream of the IFNG-AS1 rs7134599 variant. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis among the three variants was conducted using the Haploview 4.2 program. The r2 and D’ values for LD were very low, as shown in Fig 2, indicating that these variants segregate independently.\nThe LD plot was performed using Haploview 4.2 and displays R2 and D’ measures.\nHaplotype analysis identified eight haplotypes as presented in Table 3. The CAT haplotype (P-value = 9.0 X 10-6) is associated with susceptibility to Lg-CL, while the GGC haplotype (P-value = 2.0 X 10-4) is associated with protection.\n\n\nPlasma cytokines levels by genotypes of IFNG-AS1 rs4913269 and rs7134599\nFor cytokine analysis, 354 patients with Lg-CL (264 males and 90 females) and 376 healthy controls (269 males and 107 females) were included in the study and shared the same socio-epidemiological and ecological characteristics. The average age of the male patients and healthy controls were 39.8 ± 1.57 and 45.2 ± 1.58 years old, respectively. Th average age of the female patients and healthy controls were 34.8 ± 0.80 and 43.7 ± 1.8 years old, respectively. All patients presented recent lesions, ranging from three to five weeks, and were treatment naïve.\nExpression of IFNG-AS1 has been shown to positively correlate with IL-6 levels, and negatively with IL-10 levels [32]. Additionally, elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 has been associated with activation of IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α in ulcerative colitis specimens [17]. The rs7134599 variant has also been implicated with asthma [33]. IL-4 plays a pivotal role in asthma pathogenesis. Plasma levels of TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-12p70 stratified by rs4913269 and rs7134599 genotypes among patients with Lg-CL and HCs are shown in S1 Fig. Notably, we previously demonstrated that plasma levels of TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-12p70 were significantly elevated in patients with Lg-CL compared to HCs [31]. Fig 3 presents cytokines levels by genotypes of rs4913269 across all subjects (patients with Lg-CL and HCs). ANOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in IL-12p70 levels among the (P adjusted for age and sex = 0.04). Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that significantly lower levels of IL-10 (P = 0.05) and IL-12p70(P = 0.009) were correlated with the rs4913269 G/G genotype compared to the C/C genotype across all subjects.\nStatistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA test with P-value adjusted for sex and age (Padj) for distribution among genotypes and post-hoc test for pairwise comparison between genotypes (*P = p-corrected for false discovery rate (FDR)).\nAdditionally, the ANOVA test identified significant differences in plasma levels of TNF-α (Padj = 0.03), IL-4 (Padj = 0.03), IL-10 (Padj = 0.01) and IL-1β (Padj = 0.02) among the rs7134599 genotypes across all subjects (patients with Lg-Cl and HCs), as shown in Fig 4. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the A/A genotype was associated with higher TNFα (P = 0.06 borderline), IL-4 (P = 0.04), IL-10 (P = 0.04) and IL-1β (P = 0.02) compared to the G/G genotype across all subjects, as shown in Fig 4. All P-values were corrected by false discovery rates (FDR).\nStatistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA test with P-value adjusted for sex and age (Padj) for distribution among genotypes and post-hoc test for pairwise comparison between genotypes (*P = p-corrected for false discovery rate (FDR)).",
    "Discussion": "Individuals from the same endemic areas are more likely to share similar socio-epidemiological and ecological characteristics. However, only a subset of these individuals develops Lg-CL, highlighting the role of host genetic factors in disease susceptibility. To advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunopathogenesis of Lg-CL, we conducted a case-control genetic analysis of IFNG-AS1 variants.\nPrevious studies have indicated that IFNG-AS1 positively regulates IFNG expression in immune cells such as CD8+ and CD4 + T cells [14–16]. IFN-γ is a key immunoregulatory cytokine produced by T cells and innate lymphoid cells, playing a pivotal role in host-defense against invading pathogens. LncRNA, including IFNG-AS1, are sequences exceeding 200 nucleotides in length, transcribed from genes lacking open reading frames for protein translation. They are involved in transcriptional regulation by modulating RNA polymerase II activity, promoter activation [34], chromatin remodeling, telomere activity, subcellular structural organization [35], and post-transcriptional mRNA processing, including splicing, editing, transport, translation, and degradation [36].\nIn this study, we identified distinct roles for two IFNG-AS1 variants in modulating susceptibility to Lg-CL. Notably, individuals homozygous for the G allele at rs4913269 in the LncRNA IFNG-AS1 appear to be protected from developing Lg-CL, in contrast to findings in Lb-CL where the same G allele was associated with disease susceptibility [21]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heterozygous (A/G) patients with Lb-CL, stimulated with soluble Leishmania promastigote antigens, showed a significantly higher percentage of IFN-γ and TNFα–producing T cells compared with G/G homozygotes, suggesting that G/G homozygotes are at higher risk of developing Lb-CL [21]. However, no significant differences of IFN-γ and TNFα–producing T cells was observed between the AA genotypes and GG homozygotes [21].\nWe observed that homozygous individuals for the rs4913269 G allele exhibited lower plasma levels of IL-10 and IL-12p70. IL-12 is essential for the expression of IFNG and IFN-γ plays a central role in host-defense against intracellular pathogen. In IL10-knockout mice with spontaneous colitis, elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 was noted [17]. The protective effect of rs4913269 is noteworthy, particularly considering the prior findings in Lb-CL where the same allele was linked to susceptibility [21]. The rs4913269 G allele may promote a controlled Th1 response, suppressing IL-10 and limiting IL-12p40 as part of a feedback effect of early parasite clearance. Indeed, these immunological profiles may suggest that bearers of the rs4913269 G/G genotype achieve parasite control without excessive inflammation.\nIL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can inactivate macrophages, inhibit the elimination and multiplication of intracellular pathogens, and impair Th-1 immune responses, including the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α and avoid tissue damage. IL-12-p70, known to promote Th1 differentiation, is produced primarily by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to infection. In rs4913269 G/G carriers, a reduced IL-10 level may preserve macrophage activation and enhance parasite elimination. Meanwhile, lower IL-12p70 may indicate that the immune system achieves sufficient IFN-γ levels early in infection, limiting the need for continued IL-12 driven stimulation to avoid exacerbating proinflammatory reaction, while keeping in check the parasites. This is consistent with the broader understanding that genes involved in immune responses must be precisely coordinated and tightly regulated to ensure rapid expression of multiple genes to control microbial pathogens while mitigating host tissue damage [37]. The IFNG-AS1 gene is selectively expressed in Th1 effector cells, and we hypothesized that reduced IL-12 and IL-10 levels may facilitate an adequate IFN-γ response, ensuring sufficient macrophage activation to control intracellular pathogens, thereby preventing tissue damage following parasites clearance or control during early infection.\nInterestingly, our findings align observations from biopsy lesion specimens of Lb-CL patients that exhibited high expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, primarily associated with the activation and migration of monocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, and Th1 CD4 + T cells [38], as well as elevated cytolytic activity mediated by CD8 + T cells [39]. Additionally, increased frequencies of NK cells have been observed in the peripheral blood cells of Lb-CL patients, with these cells expressing higher IFN-γ, TNF-α, granzyme B, and perforin than CD8+ T cells. Granzyme B expression positively correlates with lesion-size, suggesting NK cells contribute to CL immunopathology [40]. In Lb-CL, a positive correlation exists between lesion size and the number of CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-γ and TNF-α [41]. In Plasmodium falciparum, children whose cells produced higher IFN-γ following stimulation with Plasmodium falciparum antigen in vitro were more likely to experience the clinical manifestations of malaria infection [42]. IFNG-AS1 expression enhances IFN-γ expression in CD8 + T cells, in response to Salmonella infection [16]. Elevated IFNG-AS1 expression has been shown to augment Th1 responses in Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (HT) patients and may contribute to HT pathogenesis [43]. Conversely, the increased IFNG-AS1 expression has been associated with decreased Th1 cells and increased Treg cells population in experimental autoimmune Myasthenia gravis models [44].\nThe rs7134599 in IFNGAS-1 has been suggested as a susceptibility locus for the IBD [20]. In a Tunisian population, the rs713599 A allele was associated with protection against asthma, a condition influenced by IL-4 expression [33]. In our study, we found that the A allele is associated with susceptibility to Lg-CL and correlates with higher circulating plasma levels of IL-10, IL-4, IL-1β and TNF-α. IL-10 and IL-4 are well-established inducers of Th2 response which has been linked to disease progression in Balb/c mice, contrasting with the protective Th1 response observed in C57Bl/6 mice [3]. Indeed, Lg-CL patients with predominant Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) tend to develop lesions earlier than those with a Th1- dominant cytokine profile [45]. In Lb-CL patients, higher IFN-γ and IL-10 expressions have been observed in late-stage lesions compared with early-stage lesions [46]. Excess IL-1β has been associated with increased disease severity in patients with CL caused by L. peruviana [47]. IL-1β can suppress proinflammatory Th1 response by downregulating IL-12 receptor expression and interfering with IL-6-induced STAT1 phosphorylation [48].\nIt is important to consider that the observed association may also reflect differences in parasite burden and disease kinetics. It is plausible that rs4913269 G/G individuals mount a rapid and effective immune response, resulting in reduced parasite loads and shorter lesion duration. Conversely, rs713599 A carriers may experience delayed parasite clearance, leading to prolonged or more severe clinical manifestations. Future studies assessing parasite load and lesion healing time in relation to genotype will be valuable to validate these hypotheses.\nMoreover, comorbid conditions such as malaria, malnutrition or HIV can profoundly influence immune homeostasis and cytokine profiles, influencing disease progression and treatment response. These conditions may interact synergistically with host genetic factors, including IFNG-AS1 variants, to increase susceptibility. For instance, HIV can induce immunosuppression and impair a Th1 response, while malaria might skew cytokine production through chronic immune action. The introduction of these variables in future multivariate models will enhance the accuracy of disease risk prediction, uncover gene-environment interactions and offer better clinical assessments in endemic populations. Of note, individuals with HIV were excluded in this study.\nFrom a translational perspective, genotyping of IFNG-AS1 variants could enable risk stratification, identifying individuals more likely to develop disease upon exposure. For example, individuals with the rs7134599 A/A genotype may benefit from therapies aimed at modulating IL-10 or IL-4 in combination with conventional treatments.\nIn this study, we selected two SNVs (rs4913269 and rs7134599) based on their reported associations: rs4913269 with Lb-CL in Brazil [19], and rs7134599 with IBD [17,18]. The rs4913269 variant has been identified as a strong expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for IFNG-AS1 and a cis-acting eQTL for IFNG [19], while rs7134599 has been characterized as a strong eQTL in IBD [17,18]. The IFNG-AS1 gene region, located on chromosome 12q14, encompasses the genes IFNG, IL26 and IL22 as shown in Fig 1. Previously, we examined 9 SNVs spanning the IFNG gene region and demonstrated a similar LD structure between the patients with Lg-CL and HCs [11]. To mitigate the risk of spurious associations, we incorporated the two IFNG-AS1 SNVs along with eight IFNG SNVs to evaluate the LD structure consistency. The LD structure remains consistent between the patients with Lg-CL and HCs, suggesting a shared genetic background between the two groups, in line with STREGA guidelines (S2 Fig). Collectively, these findings indicate that allele frequency differences between the patients with Lg-CL and HCs are unlikely to be attributed to population stratification.\nOur study population consists of approximately 50% to 60% of Native American, 40% to 50% European and around 10% African ancestry [27]. The minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs4913269 varies from 20% to 50% across different ethnic groups (https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snptag.html). Notably, the frequency in Bahia (29%) aligns with that observed in the Admixed American population, whereas in Manaus (37%), it approximates the frequency observed in the Japanese population. Regarding rs7134599, the MAF ranges from 10% to 37%, depending on population ethnicity, with our study population exhibiting a MAF of 22%, like that observed in admixed American populations. In light of differences in MAF across ethnic groups, spurious associations may arise in case-control studies. In our study, this risk is minimized as the study population originates from the same endemic areas and the LD structure in this chromosomal region is similar between the patients and HCs group.\nNevertheless, the associations of rs4913269 G and rs7134599 A allele with CL are insufficient to fully explain protection against and susceptibility to Lg-CL, respectively. CL is a complex and multifactorial disease, influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The immune response to infection is determined by the individual adaptive T-helper cell responses and disease progression also depends on the host-pathogen interaction which includes the host’s genetic background, parasite virulence, the Leishmania-vector phlebotomine characteristics and environmental factors.\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate that rs4913269 and rs7134599 are independently associated with decreased and increased risk of Lg-CL, respectively. These insights contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease and highlight its immunopathogenic mechanism of the disease, paving the way for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies."
