Access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and good hygiene (WASH) is essential for preventing communicable diseases, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh. Despite progress, many communities in Bangladesh still lack these basic services, leading to frequent outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and other infections. In this study, we investigated the link between hygiene-related factors and the occurrence of communicable diseases in two urban municipalities—Savar and Satkhira—using data from 607 residents. Our findings revealed that nearly one in four participants reported a communicable disease, with diarrhoea being the most common. Women and those using tube wells for drinking water were at significantly higher risk. Poor hand hygiene practices showed the strongest association with disease. These results highlight the urgent need for targeted WASH interventions, such as hygiene education, improved access to clean water, and better sanitation infrastructure. Promoting handwashing and safe water practices can substantially reduce disease risk. Our findings provide evidence to guide public health policy and community programs aimed at reducing WASH-related disease burdens in similar urban settings.
