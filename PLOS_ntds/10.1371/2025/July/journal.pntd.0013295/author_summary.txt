The WHO has set ambitious strategic objectives to halve the deaths and disabilities caused by SBE by 2030. However, significant challenges exist in sub-Saharan Africa, including a lack of rigorous research evidence and a misalignment of research with local priorities. Comprehensive research is essential to identifying country-level priorities to guide the design and implementation of locally relevant plans for combating this NTD. Achieving this goal demands innovative research methods, including expanding the traditional health research toolkit by adapting existing methodologies and incorporating new approaches to gather improved information on snakebites in Ghana and the sub-region. To this end, this study employed innovative research methods, including the statistical design of experiments and machine learning models, to identify healthcare workers’ priorities regarding the WHO’s strategic objectives for controlling and preventing SBE. Our findings indicate that healthcare workers in a particular region of Ghana prioritized ‘Ensuring safe and effective treatment’, followed by ‘Strengthening health systems’, ‘Empowering and engaging communities’, and ‘Increasing partnerships, coordination, and resources’. Implementing a local action plan, as our research suggests, has the potential to significantly impact the health landscape, offering hope for communities at risk of snakebite and snakebite victims. Prioritizing these strategies in Ghana is crucial for supporting the WHO’s goal of reducing the global SBE burden by 50% by 2030. However, the success of these strategies hinges on the active involvement of the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service in their implementation at the local level and within the health system.
