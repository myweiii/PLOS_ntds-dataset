The Mayaro fever is an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes disabling joint pain and swelling. Seventy years after the first cases were detected, the Mayaro virus (MAYV) is considered a global health issue due to the elevated risk for urban dissemination. Besides the efforts for controlling vector populations, vaccines, and antivirals must be developed to prevent and treat the Mayaro fever. This is only possible when studies are conducted to understand the disease, usually with the aid of laboratory animals. In this sense, research must be performed to identify appropriate animal models for human illness. In this work, we infected immunocompetent and immunodeficient laboratory mice with a clinical isolate of MAYV. We observed that the immunodeficient animals manifested more signs of the disease and would be appropriate for studying MAYV. Interestingly, systemic signs of infection were more evident in male mice, while females suffered more from joint pain and muscle weakness. We have also detected the virus in the brain and gonads, showing that MAYV can affect the nervous system and be sexually transmitted. Our study proposes a novel animal model that could be used to investigate MAYV biology, transmission, and possible preventive and therapeutical agents.
