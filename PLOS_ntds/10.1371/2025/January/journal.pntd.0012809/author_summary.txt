Our work on Na-GST-1 mRNA vaccines addresses a critical need in the fight against hookworm infections, which affect more than 100 million people worldwide. Na-GST-1, a protein essential for the survival of hookworms, has been explored as a target for vaccine development. By using mRNA technology, we designed vaccine candidates that express and deliver Na-GST-1 to different locations in cells and tissues of immunized mice, including forms that are secreted, anchored to the plasma membrane, or retained within cells (the native form). Our findings reveal that the location of antigens within cells significantly impacts the immune response. Secreted and membrane-anchored forms of Na-GST-1 generated strong antibody responses, which are important for neutralizing Na-GST-1 in the hookworm. Meanwhile, the intracellular and membrane anchored forms elicited a robust cytotoxic cell response, which would be more important for targeting intracellular pathogens. This research not only advances our understanding of how protein localization affects immune responses but also highlights the versatility and potential of mRNA vaccines to target various pathogens by manipulating how and where vaccine antigens are presented to the immune system.
