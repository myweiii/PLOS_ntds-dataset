Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting more than 200 million people. Currently, ongoing schistosomiasis control programs are based on mass drug administration with declining prevalence in many regions. Under near-elimination settings, highly sensitive, specific and feasible tools for monitoring transmission are essential. Among the existing standard methods, antibody detection against soluble egg antigen (SEA) is the most sensitive tool for detecting low-intensity infection. However, the specificity is generally low due to the longevity of antibody responses after treatment and SEAâ€™s inherent cross-reactive potential. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional crude antigens in antibody detection assays, we used a combination of single recombinant antigens, ShSerpin and RP26. Here, we show that antibodies to this antigen mix indicate S. haematobium infection with high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, cross-reactivities to other helminthic infections are markedly reduced compared to ShSEA, and antigen-specific IgG levels correlate positively with circulating anodic antigen (CAA) concentration that reflects active infection intensity. Our results suggest that the mixture of ShSerpin and RP26 is superior to ShSEA for IgG based detection of active S. haematobium infection. The excellent performance of this antigen mixture shows promise for applications in schistosomiasis monitoring under near-elimination settings.
