Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is a chronic lung disease that occurs commonly in pre-existing lung cavities. It mostly occurs in post- or active-tuberculosis patients and shares similar clinical features with tuberculosis. Many tuberculosis cases are treated without microbiological evidence; such cases might be CPA cases that are misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. CPA-related mortality and morbidity can be reduced by detection of Aspergillus-specific IgG antibody. The test for detection of antibodies is still not available in resource-limited health setups. The disease is underdiagnosed because of the unavailability of this test. This study evaluated the prevalence of Aspergillus IgG antibody and CPA in clinically significant patients of tea garden community of Assam for the first time and found it to be 32.03% and 17.18%, respectively. Aspergillus fumigatus seropositivity was found to be 48.9% in post-tuberculosis patients in our study. Haemoptysis and fatigue/tiredness were significant symptoms associated with CPA in our study.
