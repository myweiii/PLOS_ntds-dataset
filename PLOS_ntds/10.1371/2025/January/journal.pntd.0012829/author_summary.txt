Scrub typhus (ST) is an acute febrile illness ranging in severity from mild to severe. Delayed diagnosis, lack of treatment, or improper management can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite its association with high mortality rates and negative fetal outcomes, large-scale epidemiological studies on ST during pregnancy remain scarce. Less than 100 cases with pregnancy outcome reported from 1992 to 2014, and the reports after 2014 involved a small number of cases as well, in which the largest one analyzed 33 cases.
Our study includes the largest number of cases in this population to date. We investigated 260 pregnant women with ST in China across a 10‚Äêyear time period. First, we observed that this population have a high risk of poor fetal outcome, especially those with lower gestational age at the time of infection and those with pneumonia at the same time. Second, the antibiotics regimens for this population have been changed in the second 5 years, but there was no significant improvement in fetal outcome. Further studies are needed to investigate the correlation between antibiotics regimens for this population and fetal outcome. Third, we found there is a lack of diagnostic tool for ST in resource-limited settings, policies and strategies should be strengthened to support the widespread use of accurate and affordable point-of-care testing for ST in the future.
