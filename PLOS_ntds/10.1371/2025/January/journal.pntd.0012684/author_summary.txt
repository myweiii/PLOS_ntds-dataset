Bp causes melioidosis and the incidence of melioidosis is significantly associated with high endemicity of this pathogenic bacterium in tropical Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. There are usually seasonal outbreaks of the disease due to human encounters with the pathogen in severe weather events since it is largely influenced by environmental variables. Using MaxEnt species distribution modeling to predict its occurrence, the environmental variables identified in this study were both bioclimatic and soil predictors (temperature, annual precipitation, and Acrisol-rich soil environment) that strongly influence the geographical distribution of Bp. Combining those significantly influential variables, our predictive modeling generated a potential distribution map showing the concentration of areas and location names with high suitability for Bp presence. This predictive map showed extensive occurrence in the mainland of SEA and should be prioritized for public health interventions and protect those individuals with additional health risk factors in acquiring melioidosis. In an ongoing climate change condition, there is a need to predict further future Bp geographical distribution under different climate change scenarios within the areas of high endemicity and beyond. This is intended to establish early public health warning systems before the disease becomes a global public health problem.
