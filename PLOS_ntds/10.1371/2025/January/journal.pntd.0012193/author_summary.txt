The impact of preexisting DENV anti-NS1 antibodies on the outcome of prenatal ZIKV infection in viral cocirculation areas is a critical and unsolved issue. Here, we show that DENV and ZIKV IgG-NS1, but not NS1-IgM, are placentally transferred to infants. The efficiency and lasting of transferred NS1 antibodies depend on the magnitude of circulating NS1-IgG in mothers. A low or absent DENV NS1-IgG was the most critical characteristic of mothers and children with CZS-related microcephaly, supporting a protective role of preexisting DENV NS1 humoral immunity. These findings will be helpful for future vaccine designs, risk population identification, and updated medical guidelines.
