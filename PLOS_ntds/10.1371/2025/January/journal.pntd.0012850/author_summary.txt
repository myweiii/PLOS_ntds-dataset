Rabies is a zoonotic infectious disease considered to be of great public health importance due to its high lethality and numerous epidemiological transmission cycles. Indigenous communities may present several risk factors for rabies exposure. These include poor living conditions in natural areas, limited access to health services and a lack of awareness about prevention practices. The present study has shown, for the first time, the presence of rabies-neutralizing antibodies in Indigenous human and dog populations without prior vaccination and living in an Indigenous land in the countryside of SÃ£o Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. The Epidemiological Surveillance Center has reported rabies-positive bats in 2017 in the study area, near a highly endemic state region that registered 7/40 (17.5%) positive bats. Such overlapping scenarios have likely favored the presence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies in individuals and their dogs living in natural Indigenous areas without prior rabies vaccination. Results herein should be carefully considered as a warning for human-dog rabies exposure and infection risk, particularly due to potential bat contact, in Indigenous communities and healthcare professionals in Brazil and worldwide.
