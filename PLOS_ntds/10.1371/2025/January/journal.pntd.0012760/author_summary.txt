Current models predict that an expansion of intervention efforts to include community-wide treatment strategies could, in certain geographies, result in the elimination of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) as a public health problem. Large-scale operational research efforts to reduce the burden of STH such as the DeWorm3 cluster randomized trial have been organized to evaluate these predictions, but such evaluations require a high throughput testing strategy capable of providing sensitive, specific, and accurate results. To meet this need, we have developed and rigorously evaluated a multiplexed diagnostic platform using a novel validation plan with pre-defined performance characteristics. Our successful validation of this platform has provided the community with a tool capable of meeting the diagnostic requirements of large-scale operational research efforts. Furthermore, this strategy provides a blueprint for the development of similar platforms for use as part of other neglected tropical disease programs evaluating other intervention strategies.
