Schistosomiasis is a major public health concern in many tropical and subtropical regions, affecting millions worldwide. When human come in contact with the larvae of the parasitic trematode called Schistosoma through contaminated fresh water, the larvae penetrate human skin and mature in the blood vessels, leading to various clinical manifestations. The disease can lead to serious health complications, including liver and spleen enlargement, kidney damage, bladder cancer, and even death if left untreated. The primary strategy towards control of schistosomiasis was mass drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel, targeting school-aged children and at-risk communities. However, despite these efforts, schistosomiasis persisted, primarily due to challenges such as inadequate drug supplies, infrastructural deficits, and socio-cultural barriers. The emphasis then shifted from mere disease control to mitigating it as a public health issue, therefore the authors introduced a health education intervention in order to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community members on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. The findings of this study has implications on mitigating schistosomiasis, and contributing to the global body of knowledge on practical approaches to controlling schistosomiasis and guide the development of evidence-based strategies that can reduce the burden of the disease worldwide.
