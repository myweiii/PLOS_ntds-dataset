Early treatment with antibiotics can shorten the course of scrub typhus, reduce mortality, and accelerate recovery, making the rapid diagnosis of O. tsutsugamushi infection critically important. In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12a-based rapid diagnostic method targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA to detect O. tsutsugamushi infection across all known genotypes. Using this method, we successfully detected as few as 100 copies of in vitro-transcribed O. tsutsugamushi 16S rRNA within 1 hour under isothermal conditions. In blood samples from patients confirmed to be infected with O. tsutsugamushi by nested PCR, the developed method demonstrated a clinical sensitivity of 98% and high specificity.
