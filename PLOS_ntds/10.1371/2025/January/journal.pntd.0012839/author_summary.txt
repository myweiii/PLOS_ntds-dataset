Mosquito control is a key component of strategies to reduce the increasing occurrence of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue. New effective technologies are needed to complement existing methods. In the Wolbachia-based incompatible insect technique, male mosquitoes with Wolbachia are released repeatedly to mate with wild female mosquitoes; the resulting eggs don’t hatch, hence reducing the mosquito population over time. We assessed the effectiveness of this technique using mosquitoes reared and packed in California and shipped and released in 19 community clusters in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Analysis of the impact of the releases in decreasing dengue occurrence was not possible, given the low transmission rate during the project period. Preliminary analysis showed sub-optimal mosquito population reduction; we then focused the releases in 4 clusters, reaching up to 49% (CI 29–63%) population reduction. Our extensive laboratory investigations suggest that the packing and shipping process had significant effects on mosquito fitness and daily survival rates, which may have limited the impact of the releases and prevented reaching a higher population reduction. Our data confirms that this technique is effective in reducing mosquito populations in Ponce, PR, but efficacy can increase when releases are part of an integrated control strategy.
