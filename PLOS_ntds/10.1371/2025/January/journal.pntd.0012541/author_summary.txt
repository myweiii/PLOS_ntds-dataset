African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) in cattle is commonly controlled through the use of medications called trypanocides. However, these interventions often fail to control AAT due to reasons such as drug resistance, poor-quality medicines, or incorrect administration. This study, conducted in Tanzania between June 2021 and October 2022, aimed to understand why trypanocides fail. Researchers focused particularly on cattle herds that used a preventive drug called isometamidium chloride (ISM).
During the study, a veterinarian monitored how farmers administered trypanocides like ISM, diminazine aceturate (DA), or homidium, ensuring proper dosage and storage. Blood samples from cattle were tested to check if treatments were effective. The study found that one-third of trypanocide treatments were not given correctly, and many cattle treated with trypanocides were not actually infected. It was determined that 7% of treatments and 44% of preventive doses failed. The type of ISM brand used played a significant role in failure rates, with some brands performing worse than others. Additionally, tests revealed that some ISM samples lacked the active ingredients necessary for effectiveness. The study highlights that counterfeit drugs, improper use, and drug resistance all contribute to the problem, and a more comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle these issues.
