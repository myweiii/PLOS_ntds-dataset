    "Abstract": "African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) in cattle is primarily managed through trypanocide administration and insecticide application. Trypanocides can be used for both treatment and prophylaxis, but failure is often reported; this may occur due to resistance, substandard drugs, or inappropriate administration. This study in Tanzania aims to quantify reasons for trypanocide failure. An observational year-long longitudinal study was conducted in high-risk AAT areas in Serengeti District between June 2021-October 2022. Purposive sampling targeted herds with high utilization of the prophylactic trypanocide isometamidium chloride (ISM). When a farmer administered a trypanocide (ISM, diminazine aceturate, homidium), the project veterinarian assessed administration and treatment outcomes were determined based on PCR results from blood samples. A multivariable mixed model was utilized to evaluate risk factors for prophylaxis failure. Quality analysis was performed on trypanocide samples using High Performance Liquid Chromatography."
