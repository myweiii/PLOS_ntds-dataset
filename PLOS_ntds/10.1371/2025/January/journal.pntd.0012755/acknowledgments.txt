This work would not have been possible without the help and advice from the Health and Social Affairs Department (DASS-NC) of New Caledonia, in particular Dr. Arnaud Cannet who provided the leptospirosis surveillance data and with whom the scientific discussions have been insightful. Acknowledgments are due to the Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of New Caledonia for providing demographic data, as well as the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development for providing soil type data. Also, we thank Prof. Philippe Grosjean, for his kind advice regarding the meteorological data interpolation. We would also like to thank Dr. Aristotelis Giannakos who helped improve the manuscript with his constructive comments and suggestions. Lastly, acknowledgments are due to scientific colleagues for contributing to our scientific discussions, including Dr. Gr√©goire Davignon and Noreen Wejieme.
