Leptospirosis is a neglected worldwide zoonosis caused by the Leptospira bacteria, responsible for nearly 60,000 deaths annually. It is transmitted to humans through contact with infected mammals and contaminated environments, where mammals, particularly rodents, spread the bacteria through their urine. Climate change, which increases heavy rainfall and severe cyclones, further exposes tropical and subtropical regions to bacterial contamination. Additionally, in the South Pacific, the specificities of the local environment and the lifestyle of the inhabitants contribute to increase exposure to the bacteria. In this paper, we conducted a precise spatio-temporal analysis of the risk of Leptospira contamination, incorporating environmental and socio-demographic factors in a subtropical region (New Caledonia) over a 12-year period. This study will facilitate the implementation of timely, targeted prevention and mitigation actions, benefiting public health services. Ultimately, the analysis revealed that accumulated rainfall and humidity with a 1-month lag, as well as the soil types specific to New Caledonia, are the primary factors contributing to the risk of Leptospira contamination.
