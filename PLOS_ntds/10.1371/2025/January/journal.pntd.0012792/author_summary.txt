Mosquitoes are well-known vectors of diseases that impact both human and animal health. Among them, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, distributed globally, is particularly notable for transmitting viruses such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya. Developing robust surveillance methods and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the viruses these mosquitoes harbor is essential for preventing disease outbreaks. In this study, we employed Oxford Nanopore Technologiesâ€™ sequencing platform to detect viruses in mosquitoes collected from various regions of Argentina. Our findings revealed the presence of several viruses, including mosquito-specific viruses, across different parts of the country. This approach not only helps identify viruses that pose a direct threat to humans and animals but also those that exclusively affect mosquitoes, which may indirectly influence disease transmission dynamics. Our research provides a valuable surveillance tool that can be used not only to help prevent outbreaks but also to gather critical information during ongoing outbreaks.
