Special thanks go to the Ministry of Health personnel who welcomed this study and the District Health Officers of Buvuma and Napak Districts who gave us permission to conduct research in their districts. Similarly, we would like to thank the district’s TBLP focal persons, VHTs, health workers and participants in both districts.
Finally, we express our gratitude to our IT specialists—Mr. Brian Odoch and Mr. Stuart Moffat—as well as our committed research assistants—Fiona Kago Sekkidde, Josephine Kyaligonza, Gabrielle Okello and Aleper Ambrose—who played crucial roles in facilitating the demanding data collection process.
