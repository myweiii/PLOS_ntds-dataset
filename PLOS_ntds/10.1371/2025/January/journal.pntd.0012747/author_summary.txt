In many rural parts of Uganda, people living with swelling in their limbs, known as lymphatic filariasis, face significant challenges in receiving the treatment they need. This condition is often caused by infected mosquitoes biting humans and transferring parasitic worms from the Filariodidea family, primarily Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, into the bloodstream, ending up in the lymphatic system. Despite efforts to eliminate this disease, many people still suffer without proper care.
Our study examined the difficulties these individuals and their healthcare providers encounter in the Buvuma and Napak districts. We talked to health workers and people with lymphatic filariasis to understand their experiences. We found that various factors, such as stigma, social isolation, a lack of healthcare resources, and poor infrastructure, make it difficult for people to obtain the help they need.
These findings are important because they highlight the need for better support and resources for managing lymphatic filariasis. By understanding the barriers to treatment, we can develop better policies and interventions to help those affected. Our research aims at improving health outcomes and quality of life for people with lymphoedema in Uganda and similar areas. The work fits in the broader context of global health by addressing the ongoing challenges of neglected diseases in resource-poor settings.
