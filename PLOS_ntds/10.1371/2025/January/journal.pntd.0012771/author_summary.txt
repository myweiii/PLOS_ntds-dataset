Human schistosomiasis is caused by the parasitic trematode genus, Schistosoma. The disease is transmitted when people come into contact with contaminated freshwater sources that contain snail intermediate host species carrying the parasite. The intestinal form of human schistosomiasis is commonly caused by Schistosoma mansoni which uses Biomphalaria snails as its intermediate host. To better understand the factors that affect the prevalence of S. mansoni infection within snail populations, the authors examined biotic and abiotic factors from sites across the Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan shorelines of Lake Victoria. The study found that there was a significant relationship between high S. mansoni prevalence and several physiochemical factors such as water acidity and cation (Ca2+, Mg2+) levels. The study also observed that B. choanomphala populations with S. mansoni infection present had a higher number of private haplotypes and a higher mean haplotype diversity score when compared to populations without S. mansoni infection present. However, there was no significant relationship between the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and the genetic diversity of a population. Overall, this study improves our understanding of which factors influence S. mansoni infection among Biomphalaria populations.
