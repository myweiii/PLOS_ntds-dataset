This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Moroto District, Northeastern Uganda, an area previously underexplored regarding this neglected tropical disease. A cross-sectional approach identified community cases, followed by treatment outcomes monitored at Amudat Hospital. Findings revealed an overall VL prevalence of 5.21%, with county-level variations. Key risk factors included inadequate knowledge about sand fly habitats, significantly impacting infection rates. Patients typically presented with symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and fatigue, requiring an average hospitalization of 17 days. The study concludes that while the VL prevalence is within the elimination threshold, public health initiatives must address knowledge gaps about sand fly habitats to reduce infection risk effectively. This research contributes valuable insights into VL epidemiology in East Africa, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in vulnerable communities.
