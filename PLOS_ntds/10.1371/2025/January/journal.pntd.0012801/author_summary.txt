Salmonella Typhimurium is a serovar of the bacterial species Salmonella enterica. S. Typhimurium usually infects humans through contaminated food or drink to cause self-limited diarrhoea. However, S. Typhimurium can also cause invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease, a dangerous bloodstream infection. In sub-Saharan Africa, most of the iNTS-associated S. Typhimurium isolates belonged to sequence type ST313. It was not known what type of S. Typhimurium caused iNTS in Colombia. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been widely used to monitor Salmonella infections in European and Northern American countries. However, WGS data from Latin American countries such as Colombia has been very limited. Here, we analysed 270 Colombian S. Typhimurium isolates from bloodstream infection patients with iNTS disease. Using WGS and bioinformatic analyses, we answered many questions about the Colombian S. Typhimurium isolates. The majority of the iNTS-associated isolates in Colombia belonged to ST19, rather than the ST313 sequence type responsible for bloodstream infections in sub-Saharan Africa. We compared the three ST313 isolates from Colombia and Malawi. The Colombian ST313 cluster was closely related to Malawian ST313 L3, and both appeared to have adaptations to an extraintestinal lifestyle. We suggest that the limited number of ST313 bloodstream infections in Colombia reflects the highly immunocompetent population, in contrast to the substantial numbers of immunocompromised people in sub-Saharan Africa. We identified ST19 multi-drug resistance clusters linked to globally-distributed S. Typhimurium isolates. One MDR cluster (Cluster 2) is likely to have spread from Europe or North America. We propose that a second MDR cluster (Sub-cluster 7.3) recently emerged in Colombia, and acquired plasmid-associated resistance genes prior to transmission to Ecuador.
