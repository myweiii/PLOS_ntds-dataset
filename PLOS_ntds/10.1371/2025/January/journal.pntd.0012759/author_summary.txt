Trachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), remains a leading cause of infectious blindness globally. Understanding how Ct is transmitted within households is crucial for designing effective interventions. In this study, we investigated the presence and viability of Ct on the eyes, faces, and hands of individuals in geographically adjacent households in Shashemene Woreda, Oromia, Ethiopia, over two visits during a year-long cohort study.
We enrolled 298 participants from 68 neighbouring households, including 133 children aged 2–9 years. Trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF) was observed in 20.3% of these children, and trachomatous inflammation—intense (TI) was found in 6.0%. Ct was detected in ocular, facial, and hand swabs, with a strong association between ocular Ct infection and the presence of viable Ct on the face and hands. Notably, 75.0% of ocular Ct infections in children were viable, as were 42.9% and 36.4% of infections on the face and hands, respectively. Viable Ct on the face and hands was predominantly identified in individuals who also had viable ocular infections.
Caregivers of children with Ct on their faces or hands occasionally carried Ct themselves, underscoring potential intra-household transmission. We also observed cases where Ct on the hands preceded ocular infection, supporting the hypothesis that hands and faces play a critical role in disease spread.
By utilizing reverse transcription PCR to detect viable Ct, this study provides an insights into transmission dynamics in this Ethiopian community. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions focusing on facial and hand hygiene to disrupt Ct transmission and support ongoing trachoma elimination efforts.
