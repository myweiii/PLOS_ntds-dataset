    "Background": "We aimed to determine the household distribution and viability of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) from the eyes, face, and hands during the initial two visits of a year-long fortnightly cohort study in geographically defined adjacent households.",
    "Methods/Findings": "We enrolled 298 individuals from 68 neighbouring households in Shashemene Woreda, Oromia, Ethiopia. All individuals above 2 years of age residing in these households were examined for signs of trachoma. Swab samples were taken from the conjunctiva, faces, and hands and analysed for the presence and viability of Ct. Ct viability was determined using reverse transcription (RT) PCR.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Using RT-qPCR assay to detect Ct omp2 mRNA to define viability offers a new, informative perspective of trachoma transmission in this community in Ethiopia. The presence of viable Ct on the faces and hands of individuals living in households with people with current ocular Ct infection supports the hypothesis that hands and faces are important routes for transmission of trachoma. This highlights the importance of targeted interventions to address these sites of Ct carriage to help interrupt transmission."
