We conducted an eight-year insecticide resistance surveillance study on vgsc mutations to monitor resistance trends and understand the role of vgsc mutations in Aedes aegypti in Taiwan. Mutations S989P, V1016G, T1520I (first documented in Taiwan), F1534C, and D1763Y were detected, and their frequencies increased over time. We observed that Ae. aegypti with resistance-associated vgsc genotypes comprised the majority of the field population in later years of surveillance, and the unmutated haplotype disappeared; all surveyed field Ae. aegypti harbored at least one vgsc mutation. Three haplotypes were first detected in Taiwan: PGTFY, PGTCD, and SVICD. This study presents the first report of PGTFY in Ae. aegypti, and determining its role in resistance and physiological effects will require further investigation. The observations in this study highlight the emergence and expansion of vgsc mutations and suggest the difficulty of vector control in Taiwan and worldwide. In addition, we found that mutations in Taiwan showed geographical differences.
