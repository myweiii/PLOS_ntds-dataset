Hcp1 is a component of the virulence-associated Type VI Secretion System 1 (T6SS1) that plays a significant role in the MNGC formation of B. pseudomallei in hosts. In addition to its importance in bacterial pathogenesis, Hcp1 is recognized by the host immune system, resulting in strong antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses in melioidosis patients and protective immunity in animal models. Our analysis of hcp1 sequences from 1,283 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates revealed genetic diversity and identified 8 hcp1 alleles and 3 types of Hcp1. We demonstrated that Hcp1variant A, associated with several amino acid changes, could still function in cell-to-cell spread similar to Hcp1wt, but it exhibited decreased specific antibody levels in plasma of melioidosis patients compared to the levels stimulated by Hcp1wt. Understanding the impact of possible antigenic variation with respect to immune responses and bacterial pathogenesis will be necessary to determine if expression of different Hcp1 proteins may have implications for the development of effective treatments and vaccines.
