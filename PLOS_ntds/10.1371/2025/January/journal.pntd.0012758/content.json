    "Introduction": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in the environment in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide [1]. It is categorized as a Tier 1 agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) due to its potential for misuse as a biological weapon [2]. B. pseudomallei can infect humans and a broad range of animals and cause a potentially fatal disease called melioidosis. The bacterium can be contracted by inoculation, inhalation or ingesting contaminated soils and water [3]. Thailand is a hyperendemic area for melioidosis with the highest number of cases being reported in the Northeast region of the country. However, reported cases of melioidosis are underestimated due to misdiagnosis and lack of awareness in several areas [4]. Melioidosis is a life-threatening infectious disease with a high mortality rate of up to 34% and a recurrence rate within one year of up to 2% in Northeast Thailand [5]. The clinical symptoms of melioidosis range from mild, localized infections to severe sepsis. The most common presentations are pneumonia and septic shock with multiple abscesses in internal organs. Currently, no vaccines are available for immunization against melioidosis [6].\nB. pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular bacterium that has high genetic diversity. Several studies have shown that B. pseudomallei isolates from Southeast Asia are genetically distinct from B. pseudomallei isolates from other regions [7–14] and that this is likely due to differences in environmental factors as well as human, plant and animal migration patterns [1,3,15,16]. The genetic diversity of B. pseudomallei strains within the same area can also be high, suggesting that the bacterium has evolved to adapt to local environmental conditions [15–23]. The genetic diversity of B. pseudomallei has been reported in several virulence factors, including lipopolysaccharide, flagella, BimA, type III secretion system (T3SS) and type VI secretion system (T6SS) [6,11,24]. Of these, variations of LPS and BimA have been shown to be associated with bacterial pathogenicity and immune activation [25–28]. Four types of LPS, including type A, type B, type B2 and rough type, are distributed among B. pseudomallei populations which exhibit distinct immunogenicity [25,26]. A B. mallei-like bimA sequence variation in some B. pseudomallei isolates that are commonly found in Australian strains has been reported to be associated with neurological manifestations in melioidosis patients in Australia [27,28].\nUnderstanding genetic diversity and the roles of virulence factors in the pathogenesis of melioidosis is important for developing effective treatments and vaccines against infection by B. pseudomallei. One critical virulence factor expressed by B. pseudomallei is the cluster 1 Type VI secretion system (T6SS1) that has been shown to influence the intracellular behavior of this pathogen and be required for multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation [29]. Hemolysin co-regulated protein 1 (Hcp1), encoded by bpss1498 (BPS_RS26895), is a component of T6SS1 and forms the secretion tube of this system that is necessary for the transport of effectors from the bacterial cytoplasm into host cells [29,30]. Hcp1 is an antigen being explored in both serodiagnostic and vaccine development efforts [31–39]. Transcriptome analysis revealed that hcp1 was not expressed when grown in rich media formulations in the laboratory but is expressed following uptake by host cells [29,31,40]. Importantly, Hcp1-specific antibody responses are detected in patients with acute melioidosis [29–31]. In addition, immunization of mice with vaccine formulations that include Hcp1 results in the production of high-level Hcp1-specific antibody and T-cell responses [38,39,41].\nRecently, Hcp1 variation has been reported in a population study of clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates collected in Ubon Ratchathani, Northeast Thailand. Interestingly, 26% of B. pseudomallei isolated from a household water supply harbored variant hcp1, whereas this variant hcp1 was present in only 7% of clinical B. pseudomallei isolates [15]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrated that wild-type hcp1 was one of 38 disease-associated genes in B. pseudomallei by both a kmer-based and a pan-genome-based approach [15]. Furthermore, this variant hcp1 was also discovered in a B. pseudomallei strain isolated from a soil sample in Ubon Ratchathani that was associated with attenuated virulence in mice [42].\nTo better understand the presence and distribution of hcp1 variants in Northeast Thailand, this study aimed to examine a large number of clinical B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from this region. The prevalence of hcp1 variants was assessed in 1,283 primary clinical B. pseudomallei isolates from 9 hospitals in Northeast Thailand, and in addition to wild-type Hcp1 (Hcp1wt), two variants designated variant A (Hcp1variant A) and variant B (Hcp1variant B) were identified. The reactivity of recombinant Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A and Hcp1variant B proteins with plasma from melioidosis patients and healthy donors was assessed. Since Hcp1 is known to play a role in cell-to-cell spread in cell culture [29], the efficiency of multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation was determined using B. pseudomallei strains expressing the three different Hcp1 types. For control purposes, B. pseudomallei K96243 containing hcp1wt, hcp1variant A or hcp1variant B were constructed for use in these assays.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics and biosafety\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (MUTM 2015-002-01, MUTM 2018-039-02 and MUTM-EXMPT 2020–005). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects enrolled in our previous studies [5,35]. Work with live B. pseudomallei was performed at a biosafety level (BSL-3) following the protocol that was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (TM-2020-005).\nAnimal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The University of Nevada, Reno Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or University of Georgia IACUC approved the experiments.\n\n\nDNA extraction and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of B. pseudomallei isolates\nB. pseudomallei isolates were collected from primary clinical specimens obtained from 1,283 melioidosis patients who participated in the DORIM study between July 2015 and December 2018 [5]. The genomic DNA was extracted from B. pseudomallei using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) [43]. Whole genome sequencing was carried out using a 150-base-read library on the Illumina HiSeq2000 system with a 100-cycle paired-end run. The sequences were assembled and annotated sequences using Velvet v.1.2.10 [44] and obtained from our previous study, which deposited in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accession number PRJEB25606 and PRJEB35787 [43]. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in S1 Table.\n\n\nAnalysis of hcp1 variants and other T6SS1-related genes\nVariations of hcp1, tssB, tssC and tssE sequences of clinical B. pseudomallei isolates were identified from assembly data using the blastn function with default parameters (word size: 11, Match: 2, Mismatch: 3, Existence: 5, Extension: 2) in CLC genomic workbench version 20 (Qiagen). B. pseudomallei K96243 was used as a wild-type. Nucleic acid sequences of each allele were translated into amino acid sequences using standard genetic code. Representative nucleic acid or amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W for multiple alignments [45] in the MEGA 11 [46]. The evolutionary analysis was performed using the Maximum Likelihood method with 1,000 replicates of bootstrap analysis. Tamura-Nei model and Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) models were used for substitution analysis of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, respectively [47,48]. The hcp1 variants identified by WGS analysis were verified. We performed Sanger sequencing to confirm the DNA sequences of three variant alleles, including allele 6, allele 7, and allele 8 using c_d_bpss1498-wt_F and c_d_bpss1498-wt_R primer pair (S2 Table). PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (Applied Biosystem) before DNA sequencing.\n\n\nProduction of recombinant Hcp1 (rHcp1) proteins\nhcp1 genes were amplified from genomic DNA of B. pseudomallei K96243 for hcp1wt, DR1235 for hcp1allele 8 (Hcp1variant A) and DR0089 for hcp1 allele 6 (Hcp1variant B) with primers listed in S2 Table. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). hcp1 genes were subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of expression vector pET28a to produce recombinant Hcp1 proteins (rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B) with an N-terminal 6×His-tag. The insert hcp1 sequences in pGEM-T Easy and pET28a vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant Hcp1 expression constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE (Invitrogen). Expression of the recombinant His-tagged Hcp1 proteins was induced using isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Scientific). Coomassie blue staining of purified rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B via SDS-PAGE showed single bands of protein with molecular weights between 19–21 kDa (S1A Fig). Western blot analysis of these proteins using an anti-His antibody (Sigma; H1029) showed the same banding patterns, indicating that the purified recombinant Hcp1 proteins were of high quality (S1B Fig), suitable for further characterization. For the ELISpot assay, endotoxin was removed from the purified proteins using Pierce high-capacity endotoxin removal resin (Thermo Scientific). Endotoxin levels were determined using a Pierce LAL chromogenic endotoxin Quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific).\n\n\nHcp1 antibody production\nTo obtain polyclonal antibodies directed against Hcp1variant A, purified His-tagged rHcp1variant A (5 μg/dose) formulated in tissue culture-grade PBS (pH 7.2; Gibco) with Alhydrogel 2% (250 μg/dose; Brenntag) and CpG (10 μg/dose; ODN 2006; Invivogen) was administered to female C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 mice per group; Charles River Laboratories) subcutaneously on days 0, 21, and 35. Terminal bleeds were conducted 1 week after the final dose. Polyclonal mouse serum generated against recombinant Burkholderia mallei Hcp1 (rHcp1) as part of previous studies was available for use [32,38]. Serum was stored at -80°C until required for use.\nThe rHcp1-specific monoclonal antibody #3 (mAb-H1-3) was generated by fusing splenocytes obtained from a BALB/c mouse immunized with rHcp1 [32], with Sp2/mIL6 cells (ATCC CRL 2016). The fused cells were plated in methylcellulose medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine using a ClonaCell HY kit per the manufacturer’s specifications (Stemcell Technologies). Hybridomas secreting antibodies specific to Hcp1 were identified by ELISA.\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nELISA was used to determine IgG antibody levels against rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B in the plasma of melioidosis patients and healthy donors from Northeast Thailand, who were randomly selected from the previous study [5], as previously described [32]. EDTA plasma samples were collected from melioidosis patients on the day bacterial culture results were reported positive for B. pseudomallei [5]. ELISA was performed in duplicate using 50 μl of 2.5 μg/ml rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B protein. Primary antibodies (human plasma, mAb H1-3, anti-rHcp1 [32,38] or anti-rHcp1variant A) and secondary antibodies (anti-human IgG conjugated with a horseradish peroxide (HPR; Dako; P0214) for human antibody detection and anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated with HRP (Dako; P0260) for mouse antibody detection) were diluted 2,000-fold before used. Mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma; H1029) was diluted 3,000-fold before use. A positive result was determined using an OD 450 nm cut-off value of 1.165, as previously evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for the diagnosis of melioidosis in the Thai population [32].\n\n\nWestern blot analysis\nPurified rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer at a concentration of 300 μg/ml and heated to 95°C for 10 min. Five microliters of each sample were loaded into 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to the PVDF membrane by electrotransfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and then reacted with 1:2,000 dilution of rHcp1-specific mAb H1-3, anti-rHcp1 [32,38] or anti-rHcp1variant A polyclonal in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then probed with a 1:5,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako; P0260) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoblots were then developed with a 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate.\n\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation\nPBMCs were collected from melioidosis patients and healthy donors in Northeast Thailand, randomly selected from the previous study [35]. In brief, PBMCs were isolated from 15 ml of heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation in Lymphoprep (Axis Shield) using a Sepmate tube (STEMCELL technologies) [35]. Heparinized blood was diluted with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) before PBMC isolation. The purified PBMCs were resuspended in FBS supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for storage in liquid nitrogen until use.\n\n\nIFN-γ ELISpot assays\nCellular immune responses to rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B were measured using IFN- γ ELISpot assays as previously described [35]. Frozen PBMC were rapidly thawed and gently diluted into a pre-warmed RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and Benzonase. The cells were then washed twice with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. PBMCs were resuspended in CTL-TEST medium supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 h before viability was determined. 2 ×105 PBMCs were stimulated with 25 μg/ml of rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B in 96-well plates pre-coated with anti-human IFN-γ antibody at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was used as a positive control. IFN-γ secretion was detected using a Human IFN-γ single-color enzymatic ELISpot kit (Cellular Technology Ltd.). The ELISpot plates were processed and developed per the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were imaged using an ImmunoSpot S6 Micro analyzer and IFN-γ-secreting T cells were quantitated using the ImmunoSpot v5.1 professional DC smart count software (Cellular Technology Ltd.). Experiments were performed in duplicate.\n\n\nEpitope prediction\nThe MHC-I and -II binding predictions of Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A and Hcp1variant B were conducted using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) analysis resource with NetMHCpan 4.1 EL and NetMHCIIpan 4.1 EL methods [49]. The MHC alleles were selected based on common HLA types in the Thai population, including HLA-A*11:01, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, -DRB1*12:02, -DQA1*01:01 and -DQB1*05:02 [50]. The epitope lengths for MHC-I and -II were set at 9–10 and 15 amino acids, respectively.\n\n\nCell culture and multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation assays\nMNGC formation induced by B. pseudomallei was performed using A549 cells essentially as previously described [51]. Briefly, A549 cells at 1.5 × 104 in 96-well plates were infected with B. pseudomallei at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 50 and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. Extracellular bacteria were removed by aspiration and any remaining extracellular bacteria were killed with 250 μg/ml kanamycin. Infected cells were incubated for a further 8 h then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and stained with Giemsa as previously described [52]. A MNGC was defined as a single cell with three or more nuclei. The percentage of MNGC formation efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of nuclei within multinucleated cells by the total number of nuclei × 100. The average number of nuclei in a MNGC was determined to represent the MNGC size. Experiments were performed in triplicate and four independent experiments were conducted. The bar graphs show the mean of percentage of MNGC formation efficiency or average number of nuclei from four independent experiments with error bars representing the standard deviation (SD).\n\n\nhcp1 gene expression\nOne hundred microliters of overnight culture of B. pseudomallei in LB broth was inoculated into fresh 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and then incubated at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 5 h. hcp1 gene expression was stimulated by 200 μM glutathione (Sigma) for 2 h. One milliliter of bacterial culture was collected for RNA extraction using RNeasy mini kit with RNAprotect Bacteria reagent (Qiagen). DNA contamination was treated by RNase-Free DNase as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen) and verified by no PCR product of dnaK gene.\nhcp1 gene expression was determined using iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit (Bio-rad). Expression of dnaK gene was used for normalization (ΔCt) [40]. The normalized hcp1 gene expression levels were compared between conditions with and without glutathione stimulation (ΔΔCt). Relative gene expression was calculated by 2-ΔΔCt. The primers for hcp1 and dnaK genes expression are shown in S2 Table.\n\n\nGenetic manipulation of B. pseudomallei\nTo generate a hcp1 deletion mutant, bpss1498 from B. pseudomallei strain K96243 was deleted by allelic replacement using established methods [53]. In brief, 219 bp upstream and 462 bp downstream fragments of hcp1 gene were amplified and ligated together to generate a knockout fragment that was then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector before being subcloned into pEXKm5 at NotI and EcoRI restriction cut sites. The resulting construct was transferred to B. pseudomallei K96243 by conjugation with E. coli RHO3. The mutation by allelic replacement was selected for by sucrose induction at room temperature. The hcp1 mutant, referred to B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1, was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.\nhcp1allele 6 from B. pseudomallei DR1235 for Hcp1variant A and hcp1allele 7 from B. pseudomallei DR0089 for Hcp1variant B were introduced into B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1 by allelic replacement as described above. The insertion fragment was designed by insertion of hcp1 variants between upstream and downstream of the deletion fragment. The insertion fragments were synthesized by Gene Universal Inc (DE, USA) and cloned into pEXKm5. The insertion vectors were transferred to B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1 by conjugation with E. coli RHO3. The allelic replacement was induced by a culture of the bacteria on a sucrose medium. Two hcp1 mutants with variant genes referred to B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6 and B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 7 were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The primers for the genetic manipulation of B. pseudomallei are shown in S2 Table.\n\n\nProtein crystallization\nThe initial crystallization and screening of rHcp1variant B was performed using an Oryx8 automated crystallization (Douglas Instrument). The protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml in PBS pH 7.2 and crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method across 288 conditions, employing Crystal Screen Cryo (Hampton Research; HR2-133), JCSG-plus (Molecular Dimensions; MD1-37), and Morpheus (Molecular Dimensions; MD1-46) at 18°C. The crystals of the rHcp1variant B were grown in condition consisting of 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 3.75% v/v 2-propanol, and 25% glycerol. The crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage and diffraction experiments. The resulting crystals were of high quality and diffracted to 1.58 Å resolution.\n\n\nDiffraction data collection and crystal structure analysis\nDiffraction data sets were collected at the TPS05a beamline at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan) with a Rayonix MX300HS CCD detector at the temperature of 100 K and a wavelength of 0.999840 Å. The diffraction data were processed using autoPROC [54]. Data collection and processing statistics are shown in S3 Table.\nAll computations were carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite, unless otherwise stated [55,56]. The initial molecular replacement solution was obtained using Phaser and the Hcp1wt monomer (PDB ID 3wx6)[30] as a template. The structure was refined with REFMAC [57] alternating with manual model correction in COOT [58]. Hcp1variant B structure has been deposited with the PDB (PDB ID 8Z7K). The details of the structure analysis are described in S1 Text.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used to analyze humoral and cellular responses to the various rHcp1 proteins assessed in this study. The Student’s t-test was used to test the differences in MNGC formation efficiency among B. pseudomallei containing different Hcp1 types, as well as differences in hcp1 gene expression. ANOVA was performed to evaluate differences in intracellular survival among bacterial strains. P ≤ 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13.0.",
    "Results": "Variation of B. pseudomallei Hcp1 in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)\nWe initially searched for variations of B. pseudomallei Hcp1 amino acid sequence that were available in the public database using protein-protein BLAST (blastp) using WP_004525344, identical to Hcp1 of B. pseudomallei K96243, as query sequence. Nine reference amino acid sequences from RefSeq (NCBI Reference Sequence Database) were found to have 100% coverage with the Hcp1wt and were annotated from B. pseudomallei (Fig 1A). From the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), B. pseudomallei Hcp1 amino acid sequences were annotated for 3,154 records on March 4th, 2024. The evolution of Hcp1 was separated into three clades (Fig 1B).\n(A) Amino acid alignment and (B) phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of 9 Hcp1 types of B. pseudomallei recorded in the RefSeq: NCBI Reference Sequence Database on March 4th, 2024, generated using the Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model with 1,000 bootstraps. Bootstrap values are shown in red text. The branch lengths are presented under each branch.\nClade 1 consisted of 5 Hcp1 types, encompassing a total of 2,936 records. The prominent type, WP_004525344, accounted for 2,929 records, found from both clinical and environmental isolates worldwide (2,194 from clinical sources, 629 from environmental sources, 7 from laboratory stock, and 99 from unknown sources). The remaining Hcp1 types in clade 1 included WP_131116732 (2 records from clinical isolates in Sri Lanka), WP_038768460 (1 record from an environmental isolate in Australia), WP_208807185 (2 records from clinical isolates from India), and WP_119637682 (2 records from clinical isolates in USA).\nClade 2 comprised 3 Hcp1 types: WP_041194730 (3 records from 2 environmental isolates in Australia), WP_038792666 (5 records from 3 clinical isolates from Australia, Thailand and the USA, as well as 2 environmental isolates from Australia), and WP_038782671 (1 record from an environmental isolate in Australia).\nInterestingly, 6.6% (209/3,154) of the Hcp1 sequences were found in clade 3, represented by WP_004555009 (59 records from clinical sources and 150 records from environmental sources). These were mainly distributed in Thailand and sporadically found in Lao PDR, Vietnam, India and Australia, indicating distinct evolutionary divergence from the other clades.\n\n\nGenetic variation of hcp1 in clinical B. pseudomallei isolates\nWe next examined the Hcp1 diversity in clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei collected from patients admitted at nine different hospitals in Northeast Thailand (S1 Table). In this study, we aimed to examine the variation of B. pseudomallei Hcp1 by retrieving the full length of hcp1 gene from the assembly data. Our goal was to identify all known Hcp1 types annotated in a public database and potentially discover new Hcp1 variants. The analysis identified 8 distinct hcp1 alleles across 1,283 primary clinical isolates (S2 Fig). Among these isolates, the majority (1,208/1,283 isolates, 94.2%) contained a hcp1 that was identical to that of B. pseudomallei K96243 (designated as hcp1wt or hcp1allele 1). In 50 B. pseudomallei isolates (50/1,283 isolates, 3.9%), there were four hcp1 alleles (hcp1allele 2, hcp1allele 3, hcp1allele 4 and hcp1allele 5) with more than 99.6–99.8% identity to hcp1wt, including synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The remaining isolates harbored three additional alleles hcp1allele 6 (hcp1variant B; N = 1), hcp1allele 7 (N = 14) and hcp1allele 8 (N = 10) with identities of 97.5%, 87.1% and 87.3%, respectively, with non-synonymous SNPs compared to hcp1wt. The hcp1allele 6–8 were validated by DNA sequencing. Notably, hcp1allele 7 and hcp1allele 8 (hcp1variant A) were on a branch separated from other alleles.\n\n\nAmino acid sequence variation of Hcp1 in clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei\nThe 8 hcp1 alleles from clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei were translated to only three Hcp1 amino acid sequence types (S3 Fig) out of nine types in the INSDC database (Fig 1). The majority of clinical isolates (1,258/1,283 isolates, 98.1%) harbored Hcp1 sequences identical to the reference strain K96243 (WP_004525344) and are representative of wt (allele 1) and alleles 2–5 shown in S2 Fig We identified two other variants of Hcp1 in the 25 remaining B. pseudomallei isolates. The first Hcp1 variant, designated Hcp1variant A (WP_004555009), was observed in 24 B. pseudomallei isolates (1.9%). The Hcp1variant A was translated from 2 nucleic acid sequences (hcp1allele 7 and hcp1allele 8 in S2 Fig). Compared to Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A had 81.1% amino acid identity (137/169) with two amino acid deletions at positions 96 and 98 in multiple alignments (S3 Fig). Likewise, in hcp1allele 7 and hcp1allele 8, the evolutionary analysis demonstrated that Hcp1variant A (WP_004555009) was discrete from other Hcp1 proteins (S3 Fig). The second variant, Hcp1variant B (WP_038792666) was found in only one clinical isolate (DR0089). Compared to Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant B showed 95.9% identity (163/170) and harbored an amino acid insertion at position 97 of the alignment (S3 Fig).\nAdditionally, we found that B. pseudomallei isolates harboring a Hcp1variant A or Hcp1variant B were dispersed throughout Northeast Thailand. Twenty-five B. pseudomallei isolates with variants of Hcp1 were cultured from patients admitted to 7 of 9 hospitals in this study. Twenty-four isolates were cultured from Thai patients who resided in 7 provinces in Northeast Thailand and another one isolate was cultured from a Cambodian patient (S1 Table).\n\n\nGenomic comparison of B. pseudomallei isolates with variants of Hcp1\nWhole genome sequencing analysis showed that B. pseudomallei isolates with variant Hcp1 had diverse genetic backgrounds. A total of 223 known sequence types (STs) by multiple locus typing (MLST) analysis were assigned to 1,283 B. pseudomallei isolates in this study (S1 Table) [43]. Twenty-five B. pseudomallei isolates with a variant of Hcp1 were assigned to 17 known STs by MLST analysis and were distributed into 13 of 101 lineages by PopPUNK analysis (S1 Table) [43]. Of these, 9 isolates were distributed in major lineages (lineage 1 to 3) [43].\nWe further analyzed the whole genome sequences for variation in the T6SS1 gene cluster bpss1493 (BPS_RS26870)–bpss1511 (BPS_RS26960) of B. pseudomallei strains that had a variant of Hcp1. Variation in TssC, a T6SS contractile sheath protein encoded by bpss1497 (BPS_RS26890), was associated with Hcp1 variation. Six amino acid sequence types of TssC were identified in 1,283 B. pseudomallei isolates in this study (S4 Fig and S4 Table). We observed two conserved amino acid substitutions, V457A and V486I, in 3 types of TssC (TssCvariant C, TssCvariant D and TssCvariant E) from the 24 B. pseudomallei isolates that produced Hcp1variant A (S1 Table). These two amino acid substitutions in TssC were not observed in other clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei in this study. B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant B contained TssCwt, similar to B. pseudomallei K96243 (S1 Table).\nB. pseudomallei isolates containing hcp1variant A were also associated with amino acid substitutions in TssB (a T6SS contractile sheath small subunit) and TssE (a T6SS baseplate subunit) (S1 and S4 Tables and S5 and S6 Figs). Of these 24 isolates, 23 isolates had a conserved amino acid change, T74A, in TssB (TssBvariant D; S5 Fig). However, the T74A change in TssB that was found in 3 types of TssB, including TssBvariant D, TssBvariant E and TssBvariant F was not specific to B. pseudomallei strains harboring the Hcp1variant A. This change was also detected in 165 B. pseudomallei isolates with Hcp1wt or Hcp1variant B. Similar to TssB, 22 B. pseudomallei isolates containing hcp1variant A had conserved amino acid changes, E27A and H32R, in TssE (TssEvariant F, TssEvariant G and TssEvariant I; S1 Table and S6 Fig) but both non-synonymous SNPs were also detected in 35 B. pseudomallei isolates with Hcp1wt.\n\n\nAntigenicity of Hcp1\nA recent study investigated the impact of a variant hcp1 gene found in environmental B. pseudomallei isolates and its role in virulence in an animal model and found that isolates carrying the variant hcp1 gene (containing hcp1variant A; ST93 and ST60) exhibited a reduced level of virulence compared to strains with hcp1wt (ST58 and ST176) [42]. It is possible that the different amino acid compositions of Hcp1 proteins may significantly influence their biological properties.\nWe predicted the MHC-I and -II binding epitopes of Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A and Hcp1variant B using IEDB analysis resource. The prediction showed 963, 951, and 969 MHC-I binding epitopes for Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A, and Hcp1variant B, respectively. Additionally, 310, 306, and 312 epitopes were predicted to bind with MHC-II for Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A, and Hcp1variant B, respectively. We next assessed the cross-reactivity among antibodies against the Hcp1 proteins identified in this study. We performed ELISA and Western blot analyses using three purified rHcp1 proteins, rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B. We utilized various antibodies targeting different Hcp1 types, including mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (mAb-6×His), mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Hcp1wt (mAb H1-3), mouse serum raised against B. mallei rHcp1 by immunization (anti-rHcp1) [32,38] and mouse serum raised against rHcp1variant A by immunization (anti-rHcp1variant A). The reactivity of mAb-6×His demonstrated that the binding affinity of three rHcp1 proteins was comparable when coated on the ELISA plate (Fig 2A and S5 Table). Anti-rHcp1 was used for comparison since Hcp1 from B. mallei and B. pseudomallei K96243 are >99% identical and have only one amino acid difference [59] at position 148 of alignment in S3 Fig.\n(A) Reactivity of mouse anti-polyhistidine (mAb-6×His), mouse monoclonal antibody against rHcp1wt (mAb H1-3), mouse sera obtained from B. mallei rHcp1 immunization (anti-rHcp1) and mouse sera obtained from rHcp1variant A immunization (anti-rHcp1variant A) against rHcp1wt (blue bar), rHcp1variant A (red bar) and rHcp1variant B (green bar). The experiment was performed in duplicate. The bar graph represents mean of OD values and error bar shows SD. (B) Reactivity of human sera from healthy donors, melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt, melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A and melioidosis patient infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant B against rHcp1wt (blue dot), rHcp1variant A (red square) and rHcp1variant B (green triangle). The data points represent the mean of duplicate OD values. The black line represents the median of each group. The orange dotted line represents the cut-off value. * P ≤ 0.05, *** P ≤ 0.001.

The data points present the mean of duplicate wells. The error bars represented 95% CI. (D) Heat map of IFN-γ secretion from PBMC of 10 healthy donors and 23 melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt after stimulated with PHA, rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B. The data points present the mean of duplicate wells.\nWe determined the cross-reactivity of the Hcp1 proteins with mAb H1-3 that recognizes the native form of Hcp1wt by ELISA. As shown in Fig 2A, mAb H1-3 reacted with rHcp1wt but not rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B, suggesting that mAb H1-3 recognized the epitope affected by amino acid substitutions in both variants, which alter the native form of Hcp1wt. We next examined the reactivity of rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B with anti-rHcp1 polyclonal serum. Anti-rHcp1 recognizes all three types of rHcp1 with strong reactivity toward rHcp1wt and rHcp1variant B but showed approximately half the reactivity toward rHcp1variant A by ELISA (Fig 2A and S5 Table) and showed only a faint band in Western blot analysis (S7A Fig). Additionally, the decreasing reactivity of anti-rHcp1 with rHcp1variant A was consistently observed in various dilutions of anti-rHcp1 (S8A Fig and S6 Table). Conversely, mice immunized with rHcp1variant A produced antibodies that cross-reacted toward all three Hcp1 proteins at similar levels by both ELISA and Western blot analysis (Figs 2A and S7B). Furthermore, we observed comparable levels of anti-rHcp1variant A activity toward all three types of rHcp1 even when the anti-serum was diluted to 1:10,000 (S8B Fig and S7 Table).\n\n\nAntibody responses against Hcp1 variants in melioidosis patients\nTo assess the impact of Hcp1 variation on the humoral immune responses associated with melioidosis patients, we performed ELISAs to determine the reactivity of IgG antibodies against rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B. Plasma samples were collected from healthy donors and three groups of melioidosis patients who were infected with B. pseudomallei strains containing hcp1wt, hcp1variant A or hcp1variant B (Fig 2B and Tables 1 and S8). Plasma samples were obtained from melioidosis patients within 24 h after diagnosis based on the culture method. The median time from admission to blood collection of melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt was 4 days (IQR 3–5), which was not significantly different from the patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A, with a median time of 3 days (IQR 2.5–4; P = 0.1890, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, blood from the patient infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant B was collected after 9 days of admission. An OD value of 1.165, previously evaluated by ROC for diagnosis of melioidosis in the Thai population [32], was used as the threshold for positive specific antibody responses.\nAntibodies from healthy donors had very low reactivity towards rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B, with OD 450 values ranging from 0.004–0.352 (Fig 2B and S8 Table). In contrast, melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt showed the highest median levels of IgG antibodies specifically targeting rHcp1wt, but their antibody levels against rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B were lower (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively; Fig 2B). When an OD 450 value of 1.165 was used as a cut-off to determine a positive result, 16 of 22 (72.7%) melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt were detected (Table 1). Among these patients, 9 (56.3%) and 13 (81.3%) of the patients had antibodies that cross-reacted with rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B at lower levels (S8 Table). However, 3 of 16 (18.8%) melioidosis cases had negative reactivities with either rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B (S8 Table). Only 6 of 22 patients (27.3%) in the melioidosis patient group were infected with B. pseudomallei strains that produced Hcp1wt and had negative Hcp1-specific IgG levels for all three rHcp1 proteins (S8 Table).\nThe reactivity of IgG antibodies from melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A showed no significant difference when tested against rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A, and rHcp1variant B (rHcp1wt versus and rHcp1variant A, P = 0.061; rHcp1variant A versus rHcp1variant B, P = 0.077; and rHcp1wt versus rHcp1variant B, P = 0.119) (Fig 2B). Reactivity of IgG antibodies against rHcp1variant A was detected in 10 of 24 (41.7%) melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A (S8 Table). Among them, 80.0% (8 of 10) and 70.0% (7 of 10) showed cross-reactivity with rHcp1wt and rHcp1variant B at higher levels than rHcp1variant A. Only two melioidosis cases produced specific IgG antibodies that reacted with rHcp1variant A alone. Among 24 melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A, 14 (58.3%) were negative for rHcp1variant A-specific antibodies. Of these, 4 of 14 melioidosis patients (28.6%) produced antibodies against rHcp1wt and rHcp1variant B but did not react to rHcp1variant A. Therefore, 10 of 24 patients (41.7%) in this group had antibody levels against all three recombinant Hcp1 proteins that were below the cut-off value.\nThe melioidosis patient infected with B. pseudomallei DR0089 that containing hcp1variant B did not have detectable reactivity against purified rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B at the time of enrollment or within 24 h after a positive culture result report.\n\n\nCellular immune responses against variants of Hcp1\nTo examine cellular immune responses specific for Hcp1wt, Hcp1variant A and Hcp1variant B, IFN-γ ELISpot assays were conducted. PBMCs isolated from 23 melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei strains that contained hcp1wt were stimulated with rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A or rHcp1variant B. PBMCs from 10 healthy donors were used as controls. As expected, PBMCs from both melioidosis patients and healthy donors were responsive to stimulation with PHA, a positive control antigen (S9 Table). Although the purified rHcp1wt, rHcp1variant A and rHcp1variant B contained residual endotoxin levels at 8.84, 12.21 and 47.20 EU/ml, respectively, this did not appear to affect the immune response. The healthy donors from Northeast Thailand, an endemic area of melioidosis, may have been previously exposed to B. pseudomallei during daily life, potentially developing low-level T cell responses to rHcp1 proteins, as previously reported [35]. IFN-γ secretion by PBMCs from healthy donors showed no correlation with endotoxin levels (S9 Table), suggesting that endotoxin contamination did not influence the observed IFN- γ secretion, consistent with previous findings [60, 61]. Moreover, PBMCs from melioidosis patients exhibited IFN-γ-secreting T cell responses when stimulated with all three rHcp1 proteins, with rHcp1variant B inducing significantly IFN-γ secretion than rHcp1wt and rHcp1variant A (P = 0.0054 and 0.0002; Fig 2C and 2D). The rHcp1variant A stimulated IFN-γ secretion from PBMCs at a level similar to that of rHcp1wt (P = 0.330).\n\n\nMultinucleated giant cell formation (MNGC) by clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei\nMNGC formation is a unique phenotype associated with B. pseudomallei infections, and it is believed that these structures play a role in enabling the bacteria to evade host immune responses [62]. Previous studies have shown that Hcp1 is essential for MNGC formation by B. pseudomallei in murine macrophages [29]. To investigate a potential role for Hcp1 variation in MNGC formation, A549 cells were infected with B. pseudomallei at MOI 50 for 10 h and then visualized with Giemsa staining. The clinical B. pseudomallei isolates producing variant Hcp1 (DR1235 for Hcp1variant A and DR0089 for Hcp1variant B) were compared with the reference strain K96243 (produces Hcp1wt) for their abilities to stimulate MNGC formation (Fig 3). While the three isolates survived at similar levels in A549 cells (S9A Fig and S10 Table), their ability to stimulate MNGC formation varied (Fig 3A) in both percentage of MNGC formation and average number of nuclei in MNGC (P < 0.001 for all comparisons; Fig 3B and 3C and S11 Table). As expected, B. pseudomallei K96243 could spread from cell to cell and stimulate the formation of enlarged MNGCs following infection. In contrast, B. pseudomallei DR1235 induced a lower number of MNGCs with a lower number of nuclei. For B. pseudomallei DR0089, an expansion of the cytoplasm of the infected cells was observed, but MNGC formation was infrequently detected at 10 h of infection.\n(A) Multinucleated giant cell formation in A549 cells infected with strains K96243 (Hcp1wt), DR1235 (Hcp1variant A) and DR0089 (Hcp1variant B) at MOI 50 for 10 h. The bar scale represents 20 μM length. MNGC formation efficiency was calculated by determining the percentage of a MNGC formation (B) and the average number of nuclei in each MNGC (C). The bar graphs show the mean of three independent experiments. The error bars represent the standard deviation (SD).\n\n\nGenomic diversity of B. pseudomallei influences MNGC formation\nIt is possible that the MNGC formation associated with clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei may be influenced by other genes related to intracellular survival and/or transcriptional regulation of T6SS1 genes rather than this being a direct effect of Hcp1 variation. We, therefore, examined the levels of hcp1 expression by isolates harboring the three different Hcp1 variants. Since glutathione stimulates hcp1 gene expression in vitro, simulating the intracellular phase of infection [63], we determined hcp1 expression by B. pseudomallei K93243, DR1235 and DR0089 under glutathione induction. The glutathione-induced expression of hcp1 in B. pseudomallei isolates DR1235 (Hcp1variant A) and DR0089 (Hcp1variant B) was significantly lower than in B. pseudomallei K96243 (P = 0.023 and 0.010, respectively; S9B Fig and S12 Table). The low hcp1 expression (S9B Fig) and MNGC formation efficiency (Fig 3B and 3C and S11 Table) suggest that the level of hcp1 gene expression may influence the efficiency of MNGC formation in A549 cells.\nNext, we selected additional clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei expressing Hcp1wt and Hcp1variant A to compare their abilities to stimulate MNGC formation in A549 cells. Fourteen isolates from each group, representing different multi-locus sequence types (STs), were included for MNGC formation analysis (S13 Table). We observed individual variations in MNGC formation efficiency among clinical B. pseudomallei isolates. However, the group expressing Hcp1variant A (with 13 STs) showed lower levels of MNGC formation compared to the group expressing Hcp1wt (with 11 STs) (P = 0.027; S9C Fig and S13 Table). However, a group of clinical B. pseudomallei isolates containing hcp1variant A showed varying abilities to form MNGC, suggesting that factors beyond the hcp1 allele, potentially by the different genetic backgrounds of B. pseudomallei isolates, may affect gene expression and the ability to stimulate MNGC formation.\n\n\nMultinucleated giant cell formation (MNGC) efficiency of B. pseudomallei K96243 with hcp1 variants\nExpression of different hcp1 alleles by clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei may affect MNGC formation efficiency. To address the possibility that different genetic backgrounds might influence MNGC formation efficiency, we performed mutagenesis experiments to generate derivative strains of B. pseudomallei K96243 that express Hcp1variant A or Hcp1variant B. To facilitate these studies, we first constructed a hcp1 deletion mutant in B. pseudomallei K96243 (K96243Δhcp1) and then used this mutant to generate K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 8 (expresses variant A) and K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6 (expresses variant B). These two strains were then tested for their ability to survive in A549 cells (S10A Fig and S14 Table), levels of hcp1 gene expression (S10B Fig and S15 Table) and MNGC formation ability (Fig 4) in comparison to K96243 and K96243Δhcp1. All four strains tested, including the wild type K96243, K96243Δhcp1, K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 8 and K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6, were able to replicate in A549 cells at similar levels (P > 0.05 for all time points; S10A Fig). In addition, hcp1 expression levels under glutathione stimulation by K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 8 and K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6 were comparable to wild type K96243 (P > 0.05 for all comparisons; S10B Fig).\n(A) MNGC of genetically manipulated B. pseudomallei isolates (strain K96243, K96243Δhcp1, K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6 and K96243Δhcp1:: hcp1allele 7) after infection at MOI 50 for 10 h. The bar scale represents 20 μM length. MNGC formation efficiency is presented by the percentage of MNGC formation (B) and average nuclei in MNGC (C). The bar graphs show the mean of three independent experiments. The error bars represent the standard deviation (SD).\nFour different B. pseudomallei strains (K96243, K96243Δhcp1, K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 8 and K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6) with the same genetic background except for the hcp1 gene, were evaluated for MNGC formation efficacy after infecting A459 cells for 10 h (Fig 4 and S16 Table). Consistent with previous reports [29,30], we observed that the loss of hcp1 results in an inability to stimulate MNGC formation, although the bacteria could still survive and multiply within the cells. Expression of the Hcp1variant A in B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 8, restored MNGC formation to levels comparable to the wild-type K96243 (P = 0.131 for % MNGC formation and P = 0.337 for average nuclei in MNGC). In contrast, expression of Hcp1variant B in B. pseudomallei K96243Δhcp1::hcp1allele 6 resulted in a slightly increased MNGC formation efficiency compared to K96243Δhcp1 (P < 0.0001 for both % MNGC formation and average nuclei in MNGC). However, this strain expressing Hcp1variant B exhibited significantly decreased levels of cell-to-cell spread compared to the wild-type K96243 (P < 0.0001 for both % MNGC formation and average nuclei in MNGC).\n\n\nStructural analysis of Hcp1variant B\nBased on the observation that strains expressing Hcp1variant B did not induce MNGC formation, we hypothesized that this amino acid substitution might affect protein structure and the formation of the tube-like structure of the T6SS1. Therefore, we conducted protein crystallization experiments to examine the structure of Hcp1variant B.\nOptimized crystallization conditions allowed us to obtain better quality crystals of Hcp1variant B (PDB ID 8z7k, resolution of 1.58 Å) than those used to determine the Hcp1wt structure (PDB ID 3wx6, 2.7 Å) [30]. The new data made it possible: to realize that the crystals are partially disordered and to understand their overall organization, to build and refine a sensible periodic representation of the structure, to re-solve and analyze the structure of 3wx6 and to prove that it is isomorphous to ours, and suffers from the same crystal pathology which was wrongly diagnosed as twinning.\nSince the 3wx6 structure had been solved, the structure of the T6SS tubes was determined for Vibrio cholerae by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), PDB ID 5ojq [64]. The structure revealed a head-to-tail stacking of Hcp1 hexamers in the tubes, meaning that the dodecamers observed in both 3xw6 and our structure are crystallographic artifacts. Interestingly, the head-to-tail tubes of Hcp1 had already been observed in a crystal structure of Hcp1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1y12) [65] long ago and superposed reasonably well on the tubes reported in the above cryo-EM study, with the main difference being a several-degree twist present in the EM which would not be possible in a crystal structure. The comparison with the above structures allowed us to analyze the possible effect of the mutations on the T6SS tube formation, as illustrated in Fig 5A–5D. Namely, mutations H90Y, R91S, T94A, T96K and T96_T97insE are located either closer to or inside the loop P92-T102 (WT numbering), which is essential for inter-hexamer contacts (Fig 5C), and mutation Q14T is located at the outer surface of the hexamer (Fig 5D) and can be important for the interaction with the sheath proteins. The mutated residues T14, Y90 and S91 are well-defined in our structure (Fig 5C and 5D). Interestingly, Q14 and R91 are conserved in V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa (Fig 5E). Additionally, the structure analysis comparing our X-ray structure of Hcp1 with a cryo-EM structure of T6SS sheath/tube complex in V. cholerae suggested that the amino acid substitution of T167K located near the C-terminus of protein did not affect the structure.\nThe superposition of the T6SS tubes, comprising Hcp1 and sheath proteins, of B. pseudomallei and V. cholerae (5ojq) showed an overall structural similarity and identified intermolecular interfaces that may be impacted by mutations associated with Hcp1variant B. X-ray structure of Hcp1variant B (orange, yellow and green) was superposed onto Hcp1wt (3wx6; light blue and grey). AlphaFold2 prediction of B. pseudomallei sheath protein (magenta) was superposed onto sheath (cyan) proteins in the cryo-EM model of T6SS tubes from V. cholerae (5ojq). (A) Two superposed subunits of B. pseudomallei Hcp1variant B (orange and green) highlight a head-to-tail stacking of the Hcp1 hexamers in the T6SS tubes and a twist of the adjacent hexamers. (B) The superposed hexamer of B. pseudomallei Hcp1variant B (orange and yellow) is formed by symmetry related subunits from the crystal structure and superposition highlights its strong structural conservation. (C) and (D) are zoom-ins of (A) and (B), respectively. (C) Four mutations and an insertion between the residues 90 and 97 are likely to have a strong effect on the conformation of the loops involved in the interactions between hexamers, while (D) the mutation Q14T affects the interaction of the Hcp1 hexamer with the sheath. Mutated residues in (C) and (D) are shown in sticks and the adjacent V. cholerae Hcp1 subunits in (B) are shown in light blue. (E) The amino acid sequence alignment of B. pseudomallei Hcp1wt (3wx6) and B. pseudomallei Hcp1variant B (8z7k) from, V. cholerae Hcp1 (5ojq) and P. aeruginosa Hcp1 (1y12). Highlighted regions indicate unmodelled amino acids in Hcp1variant B crystal structure with mutations shown in red and conserved amino acids shown in pink.\nIn conclusion, the structural study confirmed the preservation of the hexameric structure in Hcp1variant B. This, however, required resolving the 3wx6 structure and verifying that it shared similar crystal pathology with our structure. The possible effect of the mutations on T6SS tube formations in Hcp1variant B was analyzed by comparing our X-ray structure of Hcp1 with a cryo-EM structure of T6SS sheath/tube complex in V. cholerae. The amino acid substitutions in Hcp1variant B may have a negative effect on T6SS tube formation and, as a result, reduce its effectiveness in MNGC formation.",
    "Discussion": "Several studies have shown that the Hcp1 protein is a promising serodiagnostic marker, therapeutic target, and vaccine candidate for melioidosis [31,33,34,38,39,41]. However, Hcp1 variation has been reported, which may contribute to the virulence of B. pseudomallei and be associated with pathogenesis of the disease [15,42]. This study identified hcp1 variants from an extensive collection of 1,283 primary clinical B. pseudomallei isolates and demonstrated they elicit variable antibody responses in melioidosis patients and can differentially affect MNGC formation in A549 cells. We detected 3 of 9 possible Hcp1 types (WP_004525344, WP_004555009 and WP_038792666) among 1,283 clinical isolates from Northeast Thailand. The other 6 Hcp1 types are rare within the B. pseudomallei population and may have evolved in other geographically restricted areas. For example, Hcp1 variants in clade 1 were found in environmental isolate from Australia (WP_038768460), clinical isolates from South Asia (WP_131116732 and WP_208807185), and clinical isolates from USA (WP_119637682). Meanwhile, Hcp1 variants in clade 2 (WP_041194730 and WP_038782671) were found in environmental isolates from Australia. This rarity and geographic distribution may explain why these types were not observed in the 1,283 patient samples analyzed in this study. The most common Hcp1 type is identical to that of Hcp1 from B. pseudomallei K96243 (WP_004525344) and accounted for 98.1% of isolates, which was the predominant Hcp1 type that was annotated in the INDSC.\nThe major variant designated Hcp1variant A (WP_004555009), which was found in 1.9% (24 of 1,283) from 7 of 9 hospitals, has been reported in previous studies [15,42]. This variant was found in clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates from Ubon Ratchathani, Northeast Thailand [15, 42]. Additionally, Hcp1variant A was sporadically found in B. pseudomallei isolates from Laos, Vietnam, India and Australia, annotated in INSDC. A prior population study conducted on B. pseudomallei isolates from Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, revealed a higher prevalence of the Hcp1variant A in B. pseudomallei clinical isolates from Ubon Ratchathani [15], 7.1% (23 of 325), compared to other areas in Northeast Thailand reported in this study. The higher prevalence of Hcp1variant A in water supply isolates in that area [15], 26.6% (114 of 428), might increase the risk of human exposure, leading to a high frequency of clinical Hcp1variant A isolates in Ubon Ratchathani. However, surveillance of B. pseudomallei in the environment and associated genome analysis has not been conducted in other areas of Northeast Thailand, which is required to gain a better understanding of the distribution of B. pseudomallei and Hcp1 variation in this region.\nThe uncommon variant designated Hcp1variant B (WP_038792666) has not been reported in Thailand prior to this study. However, this variant was annotated in INSDC in two environmental isolates from Australia and two clinical isolates from Australia and the USA. The USA patient has a travel history to Australia. These findings suggest that Hcp1variant B may have a broader geographical distribution beyond Thailand, with its presence detected in different regions globally but with limited occurrences.\nGenetic variation of B. pseudomallei is driven by the selective pressure from environment and infected host [15]. A toxin complex (tcdBAC) was associated with clinical isolates whereas a putative adhesin (BPSL1661) has been identified as a co-selection signal for survival under nutrient deprivation [15,16]. Additionally, biofilm formation and the production of 8-O-4′-diferulic acid (a superoxide scavenger metabolite) are essential for persistence within Acanthamoeba sp., a phagocytic organism in environments [66]. Antigenic variation is a strategy that some pathogens use to evade the host immune responses [67]. In the case of B. pseudomallei, genetic diversity in virulence factors such as LPS synthesis and BimA has been associated with bacterial pathogenesis in human [25–28]. The diversity observed in B. pseudomallei Hcp1 demonstrated in this study may be another mechanism for the bacterium to escape host immune responses, but this will need to be addressed experimentally. At present, it is unclear if the different amino acid compositions in the Hcp1 proteins reported here and associated effects on MNGC formation play a role in the pathogenesis of melioidosis.\nCompared with Hcp1wt, mutations present in Hcp1variant A were associated with a reduction in the levels of antibody responses to the Hcp1 protein. ELISA results showed that several amino acid substitutions in Hcp1variant A appeared to affect reactivity with Hcp1wt-specific mAb H1-3. Additionally, anti-rHcp1 reactivity decreased when reacting with rHcp1variant A. Similar to the serum from mice immunized with rHcp1, specific antibodies toward rHcp1wt in plasma of melioidosis patients infected with Hcp1wt isolates had low levels of reactivity with rHcp1variant A. This suggests that amino acid substitutions in Hcp1variant A decreased reactivity with Hcp1wt-specific antibodies. Therefore, the subunit vaccine developed using Hcp1wt may have reduced efficacy in preventing infection by B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A.\nInterestingly, Hcp1variant A induced antibody responses in mice that recognized all three rHcp1 proteins and did not generate antibody responses that exclusively recognized rHcp1variant A. Melioidosis patients infected with Hcp1variant A-expressing strains developed antibodies against rHcp1 proteins and most patients had higher antibody levels toward rHcp1wt than rHcp1variant A. This correlated with positive ELISA results that showed that melioidosis patients infected with Hcp1variant A isolates were positive less often than those infected with Hcp1wt isolates. It is possible that the amino acid changes may diminish the immunogenicity of Hcp1variant A. However, the lower antibody responses to rHcp1 proteins in melioidosis patients infected with B. pseudomallei with Hcp1variant A may also be due to the host-related factors that may affect immune responses such as underlying diseases and other health conditions.\nDespite the amino acid changes associated with the Hcp1variant A, strains containing this variant were still capable of inducing MNGC formation. B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A and harboring unique TssC types with V457A and V486I, also effectively stimulated MNGC formation in A549 cells. Notably, several B. pseudomallei isolates containing hcp1variant A have been isolated from both environmental and clinical samples, supporting its presence in diverse conditions [15,42].\nAll 24 B. pseudomallei isolates containing hcp1variant A were carried TssC, a T6SS contractile sheath protein, with amino acid substitutions, V457A and V486I, that found in TssCvariant C, TssCvariant D and TssCvariant E. Hcp1 and TssC are components of T6SS that have a close interaction. The combination of mutations in these genes might affect the T6SS function. Therefore, an additional experiment is required to verify the effect of a combination of variations of hcp1 and tssC on MNGC formation.\nRecently, Roe and colleagues reported that B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variantA from soil isolation are attenuated in mice model of infection comparing with those bacteria contain hcp1wt [42]. Additionally, we found that Hcp1 variants had the low antigenicity and B. pseudomallei containing Hcp1 variants showed low MNGC formation efficiency comparing with Hcp1wt. We therefore performed the association analysis between Hcp1 types and 28-day outcomes. Data on 28-day outcomes were available for 1,271 out of 1,283 patients (S17 Table). Among melioidosis patients, 25.5% infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt and 32.0% infected with B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A or hcp1variant B died within 28 days after enrollment. The two-by-two table analysis demonstrated that the Hcp1 types were not associated with 28-day outcomes (P = 0.489; Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that the virulence of B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant A was not significantly different from B. pseudomallei containing hcp1wt. However, melioidosis patients present with more complex and uncontrolled variable factors compared to the animal model used by Roe et al [42]. Additionally, virulence gene expression is influenced by the genetic background of each bacterial strain, meaning that hcp1 variation alone may not be a sole factor affecting patient outcome. The further experiment of animal model infected with B. pseudomallei strains with the same genetic background but containing different hcp1 types would provide a clearer demonstration of the impact of hcp1 variation on B. pseudomallei virulence.\nThe genetic diversity of uncommon Hcp1variant B resulted in increased activation of cellular immune responses and decreased MNGC formation. These traits may impose a disadvantage for bacterial infection by B. pseudomallei containing hcp1variant B in an immunocompromised host, as seen in the case of B. pseudomallei DR0089 infection, which occurred in a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura as an underlying condition. Additionally, the limited number of B. pseudomallei isolates in recorded B. pseudomallei isolates (only 4) with Hcp1variant B suggests a possible negative selection pressure on its persistence and spread of strains harboring this variant. The combination of increased immune recognition and impaired MNGC formation may contribute to the reduced prevalence of this variant in clinical samples.\nOur crystallographic studies showed that rHcp1variant B can form a hexameric ring structure similar to the wild-type protein. The location of mutated residues is in agreement with the possible disruption of inter-hexamer contacts (meaning impaired tube formation) as well as negative effect on the interactions with the sheath proteins. Additional studies would be needed to examine the interactions between each type of Hcp1 protein and other T6SS1 structural proteins, such as TssB, TssC and TssE, to further elucidate the potential role that the Hcp1 variants play in affecting T6SS1 function.\nCompared with the prevalence of Hcp1variant A in this study (1.9%), there is a relatively high prevalence (7.1% and 26.6%) from clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates in Ubon Ratchathani, a hyper-endemic area of melioidosis. While it is possible that the effectiveness of diagnostic tests that rely on detecting Hcp1wt may decrease, as they may fail to detect the Hcp1variant A, this is unlikely to have much of an impact given the low percentage of variant isolates seen in clinical samples. Likewise, since there are alternative diagnostic methods available for detection of B. pseudomallei the existence of Hcp1 variants would not be predicted to impact the diagnosis of melioidosis. Further investigations into the genetic variations and their functional implications will be required to better understand the significance of the different hcp1 alleles in endemic areas.\n\nFunding\nThis research project was supported by Mahidol University to ST.
