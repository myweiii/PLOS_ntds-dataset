The Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs, ESPEN) was established in 2019 to help monitor and control NTDs such as Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in African countries. We carried out a geostatistical analysis of STH data for 35 countries from the ESPEN database. Separate geostatistical models were developed for each country to tailor the selection of spatial covariates and estimation of covariance parameters to the unique spatial patterns across countries. Moreover, it was observed that the geostatistical models exhibited inadequate calibration in some countries, and thus carrying out spatial predictions at unsampled locations was not possible. These findings urge caution in developing an Africa-wide model based solely on ESPEN data, given the observed heterogeneity in the model parameter estimates and the challenges encountered in model calibration across different species and countries. Despite challenges posed by data sparsity, the insights gained remain crucial for directing focused interventions and shaping future STH assessment strategies within national control programs.
