Cholera, a bacterial disease impacting millions of people each year, is resurging worldwide. Case-area targeted interventions (CATIs) are an increasingly common cholera outbreak response strategy where teams deliver a mixture of health and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions to cholera case households and neighboring households within a specific radius. In particular, adding chlorine to water so that the concentration of free chlorine residual (FCR) is ≥0.2 mg/L can inactivate the bacteria that causes cholera. While studies have investigated the impacts of short-term WASH interventions including water treatment tablets and hygiene promotion, research is limited on integrated interventions during CATIs. We studied improvements in FCR concentrations following CATIs and factors associated with the odds of FCR concentrations <0.2 mg/L, collecting data during each CATI and following up with households 10–14 days later. We found significant improvements in household-level FCR concentrations following CATIs in Adamawa state. Factors associated with reduced odds of FCR levels <0.2 mg/L in Borno and Adamawa included self-reported receipt of water treatment tablets and handwashing station availability. Our findings support the continued use of CATIs in humanitarian settings and provide implementing partners with valuable insights for future CATI response.
