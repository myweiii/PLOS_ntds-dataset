We could not have done this study without the hard work of the staff and volunteers at Action contre la Faim and Solidarités International who implemented the studied CATIs. In particular, we would like to acknowledge Bram Riems (ACF) and Timothée Zoungrana (SI). We would also like to thank Kate Alberti (World Health Organization), Frank Curriero, Tim Shields, David Codington, Cyndy Vasquez, and Qiulin Wang (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health).
