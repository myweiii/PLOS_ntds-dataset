Dengue, a major public health threat, is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes that can cause a range of symptoms from mild to life-threatening. Our study analyzed 19 years of data from two pediatric studies of dengue in children 6 months to 17 years of age in Managua, Nicaragua. We aimed to understand how dengue severity varies with different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) and whether the child had experienced a previous DENV infection or not. We also used two classification schemes of dengue severity, published by the World Health Organization in 1997 and 2009. Overall, we found that DENV2 and DENV3 caused the most severe disease in children. DENV3 and DENV1 led to severe outcomes in both primary (first) infection and secondary infections with another DENV serotype, while DENV2 and DENV4 manifested severity in secondary infections. These findings highlight the importance of a balanced dengue vaccine that can protect against all four virus serotypes, as current vaccines show varying effectiveness by serotype. Our research emphasizes the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to manage dengue, particularly in regions where the virus is widespread.
