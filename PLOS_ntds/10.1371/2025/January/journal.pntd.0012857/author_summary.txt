In the context of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approaches including a sterile insect technique (SIT), to monitor the efficacy of the program, it is desirable to discriminate between wild and sterile males captured in monitoring traps. Currently, this is primarily achieved by marking sterile males with fluorescent dye powder before release, and identifying them using a fluorescence camera and/or microscope. However, the accuracy of this method is limited due to defective marking and wild flies contaminated with a few dye particles in the monitoring traps. The molecular tool developed to discriminate doubtful flies remains expensive for endemic countries. We investigate the ability of the Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to discriminate between reared Glossina palpalis gambiensis males and their field counterparts. NIRS discriminated wild males from reared males with high accuracy and can successfully identify tsetse flies even when UV camera identification is inconclusive. This tool has the potential to be a complementary method for future tsetse eradication programs with a SIT component.
