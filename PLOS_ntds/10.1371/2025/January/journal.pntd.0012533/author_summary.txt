The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends reducing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence to below 20% and moderate-to-heavy infections to less than 2% in treated areas to achieve elimination targets. Endemic countries, including Nigeria, have implemented mass albendazole administration to children aged 5â€“14 years to meet these goals. After a decade of such interventions in Nigeria, reassessing the infection status is essential for determining whether to adjust or discontinue the program. This study analyzed stool samples from 2,093 children across three implementation units (IUs) in Ondo State. The results indicated significant reductions in STH prevalence to below 20% in two of the three IUs, with no heavy infections reported in any IU. While these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PC interventions, the study also identified poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) resources, highlighting the need for improvements in these areas to sustain progress and prevent infection resurgence.
