This study addresses the persistent issue of diagnostic delay in leprosy cases in Pakistan, where grade 2 disability remains prevalent at the point of diagnosis, despite declining incidence rates. Through qualitative analysis, seven semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, termed "leprosy experts," were conducted to explore the underlying factors contributing to these delays.
The findings identified three primary domains responsible for the diagnostic delay: (1) low awareness and misconceptions about leprosy in the general population, (2) inadequate knowledge and clinical experience of leprosy among healthcare professionals, and (3) deficiencies in the leprosy control program, including infrastructure, resources, and funding. These factors were found to be influenced by the broader context of low-endemicity.’ Additionally, correlations between diagnostic delays and variables such as socioeconomic status, gender, geography, and systemic health challenges were highlighted.
The study concludes that diagnostic delays in leprosy affect all levels of the healthcare system in Pakistan. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach is necessary, involving raising public awareness, enhancing healthcare professionals’ education, and improving organizational structures. The cultural differences within Pakistan also warrant further research to better understand the health beliefs and access barriers in diverse communities.
