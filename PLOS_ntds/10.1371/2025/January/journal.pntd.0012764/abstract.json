    "Background": "Recent epidemiological data shows significant rates of grade 2 disability at point-of-diagnosis among new leprosy cases in Pakistan. This indicates a feature of extensive diagnostic delay; the disability burden appears unmoving and disproportionate to the falling leprosy incidence rates. Therefore, this study was required to understand reasons for delay in diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.",
    "Methods": "A qualitative design of 7 semi-structured interviews was employed to reveal perceptions and understandings of various leprosy stakeholders in Pakistan, termed “leprosy experts”. Subsequent inductive analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes concerned with delay in the diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.",
    "Results": "Leprosy experts identified three main areas, or domains, to which delay can be attributed: 1. Awareness and beliefs about leprosy, within the general population, 2. Knowledge and clinical experience of leprosy, among healthcare professionals, 3. Leprosy control program infrastructure, allocation of resources and institutional funding. These domains were each viewed as consequent to the larger theme of ‘low-endemicity’. Strong correlations between diagnostic delay and socioeconomic status, gender, geography and health system challenges, were also mentioned, and which intersected the three major themes.",
    "Conclusion": "Reasons for diagnostic delay are evident in all tiers of the healthcare hierarchy in Pakistan. Thus, an approach at multiple levels is justified, to improve the general awareness of leprosy, education of healthcare professionals, and organizational structuring. Additionally, cultural features relevant to different communities in Pakistan which might be different from other care access frameworks demonstrated a need for further study into the health beliefs of Pakistani patients in a wide range of communities."
