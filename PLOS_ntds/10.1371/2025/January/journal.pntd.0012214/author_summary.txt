The emergence of new pathogens from wildlife is today a well-recognized health threat. Studying these infectious agents has proven to be challenging due to the difficulty in accessing samples from wild animals. In the present study, we took advantage of a recent survey on the viral carriage of wild animals from Gabon, Central Africa, to screen animal samples for the presence of the zoonotic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. This ubiquitous and highly prevalent parasite can theoretically infect all warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans. This parasite is the etiological agent of toxoplasmosis, a disease causing a substantial public health burden worldwide through different clinical manifestations and varying degrees of severity. A novel genotype was identified in a wild antelope from the Gabonese forest, and was found to be highly divergent from previously described T. gondii populations worldwide, including those from the domestic environment in Gabon. This discovery suggests the existence of a wild T. gondii population in Africa. It has been shown that wild strains of T. gondii are of significant epidemiological relevance, as they have been associated with more severe forms of toxoplasmosis in different regions of the world. The implications of wild T. gondii strains in the incidence of severe toxoplasmosis in Africa remain unclear and merit further investigation.
