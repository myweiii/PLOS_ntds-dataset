    "Introduction": "Ticks are considered important arthropod vectors of various pathogens and have been associated with serious medical and veterinary health problems [1]. Many tick-borne bacterial agents are significant causes of unknown morbidity and mortality in human and domestic animals of great public health importance, e.g., spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGRs), Anaplasma spp. and Coxiella spp. [2,3]. The majority of tick-borne infections are zoonotic, and their incidence and distribution are steadily increasing worldwide [4,5]. The distribution of various tick species and tick-borne agents in China has been studied for a long time. To date, at least 124 tick species from 9 genera have been reported across 1134 counties in China [6]. It was reported that more than 3,500 human cases had been confirmed infections with tick-borne pathogens (Borrelia spp., Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and SFGRs) covering the west, north, and northeast of China, including 32 cases of unexplained fever caused by Rickettsioses [6,7].\nRickettsia spp. and Anaplasma spp. belonging to the order Rickettsiales, of most concern in China, are common tick-borne bacterial pathogens. The SFGRs are obligate intracellular, gram-negative bacteria, generally associated with ticks, which can cause the emergence of spotted fever worldwide [8\u201311]. More than 20 species of SFGRs are causative agents of human diseases characterized by various clinical features, including fever, headache, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy, which can be fatal in severe cases [12\u201315]. In mainland China, the emergence of SFGRs and corresponding rickettsial human cases have been predominantly reported in northeastern and central regions, where climatic conditions and human activities such as farming and livestock rearing favor the proliferation of tick populations, whereas in other areas, rickettsiosis is sporadic [16\u201320]. Several cases of rickettsial disease associated with acute fever and lymphadenopathy have been reported in Henan and Xinjiang regions of China [19,20]. In addition to humans, SFGRs infections have been detected in a variety of animal reservoir, including artiodactyla animals (sheep/goat/horse) [21,22], rodents [2], and wild birds [23]. Meanwhile, it is important to note that significant differences exist among tick species and their carried rickettsiae [24,25]. Anaplasma species have been also frequently detected in ticks and animals from multiple provinces in China [26]. Domestic animals, including sheep, cattle and goats, are often infected causing weight loss, reduced milk production, or even death, leading to great economic losses in animal husbandry annually [27]. Human infectious agents with these pathogens, such as A. phagocytophilum, A. capra and A. bovis, have been found in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Anhui provinces of China, but not as often as rickettsial cases [2,28\u201331].\nDiverse manifestations of diseases can make their clinical diagnoses rather difficult. With the aid of molecular techniques, recent studies have expanded our knowledge on the diversity of vetor-tick bacteria and many novel species are being discovered globally with increasing frequency [31,32]. Some tick-borne bacteria species that were previously not considered pathogenic to humans are nowadays proven pathogens [33]. Diagnosis of infections with rickettsiae is commonly achieved by employing molecular biology-based analyses, specifically polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing of DNA extracted from the patient [31,33]. Many different genes have been used for Rickettsia and Anaplasma phylogenetic systematics, including 16S rRNA, gltA, 17kDa, ompA, sca4, groEL, msp2 and complete genomic sequences by conventional, nested, and real-time PCR techniques [34]. However, relatively few investigations of tick-borne agents have been reported in the underdeveloped regions of northwestern China [35]. Thus, effective surveillance helps to determine tick populations, pathogen presence and seasonal activity, which is critical to implementing control measures. To be specific, investigations on the presence of tick-borne bacteria circulating in our environment within ticks\u2014are of great medical and public health significance.\nLocated in northwestern China, Ningxia covers an area of 66,400 km2. The large topographic drop and the varied landform make for local complex ecological landscapes and diverse vegetation types. Combined with extensive livestock production activities, which is the major source of income for rural households, these conditions create a favorable environmental for tick growth and development [36,37]. Meanwhile, the frequent contact between villagers and domestic animals makes it possible for tick-borne pathogens and related diseases to be easily transmitted from animals or ticks to humans. The abundance of tick species varies substantially across diverse biogeographic zones defined by climatic and ecological characteristics. This study focuses on Ningxia, a region with distinct ecological and socio-economic characteristics that may promote tick development and tick-borne pathogen transmission. However, data about the prevalence and diversity on tick-borne bacteria in this area are limited, and relevant case studies are equally lacking. There have been no reports of SFGRs and Anaplasma species or even other pathogens directly detected from ticks. In this study, we collected ticks from five locations in Ningxia and analyzed the presence, prevalence, and genetic characteristics of the SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. in ticks using PCR and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Nucleotide sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships are helpful to pathogen identification. Here we report the first finding of ticks, harbouring the pathogen SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. in Ningxia. The results of this study will be valuable in creating effective control measures to prevent zoonotic pathogens from spreading in this underexplored region.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe collection of ticks from the body surface of host animals in this study was verbally consented by the animal owners and approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China. The animal ethics approval number is IACUC-DWZX-027-20.\n\n\nSample collection and DNA extraction\nTicks were collected from livestock by using forceps, and vegetation surrounding the farms or living areas of animals by dragging white flags between March and May of the tick active period in 2022\u20132023 in all cities of Ningxia (38\u00b027\u201958.9\u201dN, 106\u00b016\u201941.4\u201dE), including Guyuan, Shizuishan, Wuzhong,\u200c Yinchuan, \u200cand \u200cZhongwei city. Only adult ticks were identified and classified based on morphological criteria by an entomologist (Y.S.). Ticks were frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction individually. We employed ArcGIS v10.8.2 to create detailed maps illustrating the geographical distribution of tick species across Ningxia region. The basemap shapefiles were downloaded from the Chinese Resource and Environmental Science Data Platform (http://www.resdc.cn/, DOI:10.12078/2023010102). These visualizations provide a clear spatial context for the prevalence of different tick species [38]. DNA extraction, amplification, and PCR product detection were carried out in separate rooms in order to prevent cross-contamination. Ticks were washed in distilled water for 10 min dried on sterile filter paper and homogenized individually with a single tick in Eppendorf tubes. Following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, the TaKaRa RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) was used for DNA extraction from homogenized ticks. Obtained total DNA was stored at \u201380\u00b0C.\n\n\nPCR assays and sequencing\nTicks were examined for the presence of SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. by qualitative PCR (semi-nested and nested PCR) which amplify fragments of the 16S rRNA (rrs), outer membrane protein A gene (ompA), citrate synthase (gltA), and heat shock protein (groEL) genes [39,40]. Additionally, 17kDa gene was recovered for the putative novel Rickettsia species by nested PCR. PCR conditions comprised initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at temperatures, specified in S1 Table, for 30 sec and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. PCR primer sequences and conditions are listed in S1 Table. The DNA of R. raoultii and A. ovis were used for as positive control, whereas ddH2O was set as the negative control. PCR reactions were performed using a Veriti 96-Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, USA) and the PCR amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing in both directions after showing high intensity bands in 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. All the obtained nucleotide sequences were proofread, edited and assembled by CLC Main Workbench 5.0 (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA, USA)\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\nSamples that tested positive for all three genes of SFGRs or Anaplasma spp. were considered positive. Individual rrs, gltA, ompA or groEL sequence of the PCR products was compared to the sequences in the GenBank using the nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [41]. Individual gene sequence and concatenated sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. The assembled gene sequences were concatenated in the order of rrs, ompA (for Rickettsia)/groEL (for Anaplasma), and gltA. Additionally, reference sequences of different genes from various strains were obtained from GenBank, from which the amplified regions were extracted and concatenated in order (S2 Table). These sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.505 [42] and adjusted using trimAl software [43]. All phylogenetic trees were constructed with maximum likelihood (ML) in IQ-TREE v2.2.0.3 with 1000 bootstrap replicates [44]. To further validate the evolutionary positions of gene sequences in newly discovered Rickettsia species, separate phylogenetic trees were constructed for the rrs, ompA, and gltA genes of Rickettsia species. These concatenated trees were annotated and visualized using the Tree Visualization by One Table online software [45].\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe data obtained in this study were analyzed to estimate the proportion or percentage of SFGRs in different tick species with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) including continuity correction based on one tick for a sample. Pearson\u2019s chi-square (\u03c72) test or Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to examine the differences in positive rates among tick species. Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, California, USA); a P-value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. We used R, an open-source statistical programming platform, and the circlize package v0.4.16 to create chord diagrams to visualize the associations between tick species and the prevalence of Rickettsia species [46].",
    "Results": "Morphological identification of ticks\nA total of 425 adult ticks were collected in four cities from Ningxia.After morphological identification, the ticks were classified into 4 genera and 9 species. These included Argas vulgaris (14, 3.29%), Dermacentor nuttalli (121 28.47%), Dermacentor silvarum (65, 15.29%), Haemaphysalis concinna (10, 2.35%), Haemaphysalis japonica (36, 8.47%), Haemaphysalis longicornis (42/425, 9.88%), Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (36, 8.47%), Hyalomma asiaticum (24, 5.65%), and Hyalomma scupense (77, 18.12%). The distribution of tick species varies in different regions of Ningxia. (Fig 1). Ticks were collected in each city except Yinchuan (S3 Table). Dermacentor ticks (186/425, 43.8%) were the majority of ticks sampled and notably widespread, spanning the eastern, central, and southern regions of Ningxia (S1 Fig).\nDifferent colour and size of circles represent the species and number of ticks collected from Ningxia, China. The map was constructed using ArcGIS v10.8.2 software. The basemap shapefiles were downloaded from the Chinese Resource and Environmental Science Data Platform (http://www.resdc.cn/, DOI:10.12078/2023010102).\n\nDetection and characterization of Rickettsia spp.We tested 425 adult ticks by nested or semi-nested PCR for the presence of SFGRs. In total, Rickettsial DNA were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 210 (49.4%) of the 425 ticks. The gene sequences were subjected to BLAST analysis for a preliminary verification of their identity. BLAST results are shown in S4 Table. Phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of the rrs, gltA and ompA gene fragments with the ML method are shown in Fig 2. From the phylogenetic analysis based on three genes, most rickettsial sequences from this study clustered with R. raoultii and R. aeschlimannii isolates, some sequences of them were clustered together with R. sibirica, R. slovaca, R. heilongjiangensis, and Ca. R. hongyuanensis in branches, respectively. In addition, a few rickettsial sequences were most closely related to different SFGRs, even in separate clusters on these phylogenetic trees. For example, sample (TIGMIC125) clustered with R. sibirica (KU586293.1), R. africae (LC565700.1) and R. raoultii (MK304548.1) in the rrs, gltA and ompA phylogenetic trees, respectively (Fig 2).\nThe trees were constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of (a) rrs (760 bp), (b) gltA (381 bp) and (c) ompA (532 bp) using the maximum-likelihood method with the best substitution model found. All bootstrap support values from 1,000 replicates are shown at the interior branch nodes. The sequences obtained in this study are marked by orange circles.\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of rickettsiae based on the concatenation of the rrs, ompA, and gltA genes\nFor further characterization of the detected bacterial strains, the sequences of ticks positive for all three genes (rrs, ompA and gltA) were concatenated and aligned for rickettsial phylogenetic analysis. The concatenated sequences also included validated Rickettsia species available in GenBank (S2 Table). In total, 210 tick DNA samples tested positive for Rickettsia were available for analysis. The validated Rickettsia sequences based on concatenated tree which overlooked these clade credibility values was delineated into the eight species of SFGRs, including six known species: R. raoultii, R. aeschlimannii, R. sibirica, R. slovaca, R. heilongjiangensis, and Ca. Rickettsia hongyuanensis (Fig 3).\nThe partial nucleotide sequences of genes rrs (760 bp), ompA (532 bp), and gltA (381 bp) were concatenated and constructed via the maximum-likelihood method by using the best substitution model found. A bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates was applied to assess the reliability of the reconstructed phylogenies. Study sample Rickettsia sp. Av11 and Rickettsia sp. DH11 branched distinctly from other rickettsiae and were considered novel SFGR genotypes. The various coloured lines represent distinct pathogens. Circles indicate host sources; solid circles denote samples from this study, while the rest represent reference sequences.\nAmong the ticks infected by Rickettsia species, the sequences of R. raoultii obtained in this study showed greater than 97.6% nucleotide (nt) identity with those of previously reported R. raoultii str. Khabarovsk isolated from D. silvarum in Russia and the R. raoultii isolate Datong-Dn-1 from D. nuttalli in China (Fig 3). R. aeschlimannii sequences had 99.7%\u2013100% nt identity with multiple reference sequences (R. aeschlimannii isolates Baiyin-Ha-14, Baiyin-Hm-150, and RH15). The R. sibirica and R. slovaca strains detected in this study clustered together, comprising twelve and four positive samples, respectively. Sample sequences of R. sibirica shared more than 98.5% nt identity with R. sibirica str. RH05 isolated from Hya. truncatum in Senegal. Four sequences of R. slovaca identified in this study showed greater than 99.2% nt identity with R. slovaca strains 13-B and D-CWPP. R. heilongjiangensis was detected in only one sample (Hae. qinghaiensis), showing 99.3% nt identity with sequences from R. heilongjiangensis isolate XY-1 from Hae. longicornis in China.\nBased on concatenated phylogenetic analysis, 22 samples from ticks with two novel SFGR genotypes with identical rrs, gltA and ompA gene sequences, which we designated Rickettsia sp. Av11 (TIGMIC196\u2013206) and Rickettsia sp. DH11 (TIGMIC185\u2013195). The sequences of 11 samples of Rickettsia sp. Av11 constituted an independent cluster on the concatenated tree, as a lone taxon between R. vini and Ca. R. jingxinensis, although showing exceeding 98.8% nt identity with the closest sequence from R. vini str. Boshoek1. Rickettsia sp. DH11. and Ca. R. jingxinensis comprise a separate cluster that appears most closely related to R. vini, R. japonica and R. heilongjiangensis (Fig 3). The rrs, ompA, and gltA sequences of SFGRs amplified from the tick samples were submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession numbers PP110549\u2013PP110758 (rrs), PP117689\u2013PP117898 (ompA), and PP150126\u2013PP150335 (gltA) (S5 Table).\n\n\nComparative analysis of phylogenies in novel rickettsiae\nIn this study, we preliminary observed two possible new Rickettsia genotypes based on a phylogenetic tree constructed from concatenated sequences. To further describe the genetic characteristics of these new genotypes, single-gene segment phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the rrs, gltA, and ompA sequences of the new Rickettsia genotypes, and the results were comprehensively analyzed in conjunction with the concatenated sequence phylogenetic tree. Systematic analysis based on the rrs gene revealed a small genetic distance between branch sequences (S2 Fig), possibly due to the highly conservative nature of the rrs gene, which limits its effectiveness in species differentiation [47]. Therefore, we primarily referred to the phylogenetic trees based on the ompA and gltA genes and compared the two phylogenetic trees [48]. The sequences of Rickettsia sp. Av11 (TIGMIC196\u2013206) in this study on the ompA phylogenetic tree were closest to R. vini (KX159440), showing 99.2%\u201399.4% identity, but formed an independent cluster on the gltA phylogenetic tree. A total of 11 sequences from Rickettsia sp. DH11 (TIGMIC185-195) were grouped together with Ca. R. jingxinensis (OQ702294) on the ompA phylogenetic tree, sharing 100% identity, whereas formed a separate branch on the gltA phylogenetic tree (Fig 4).\nPhylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of two protein-encoding genes (on the left: ompA, on the left: gltA). The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap proportions with 1000 replicates. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.\nWe amplified the 17kDa gene again with these samples from the possible new Rickettsia genotypes were compared with those available in GenBank. For the SFG Rickettsia sp. Av11, although the rrs gene was 100% identical to R. japonica str. LA16/2015 (CP047359.1), its 17kDa, ompA and gltA genes show 99.7%, 99.0%, 99.2% nucleotide similarity to R. heilongjiangensis isolate 2022-Tick251 (PP116500.1) from Hae. flava, R. vini str. Boshoek1 (MT062907.1) from Ixodes arboricola and Uncultured Rickettsia sp. isolate S6 (LC060714.1) from D. reticulatus, respectively. In the phylogenetic trees, its rrs and ompA genes were apparently divergent from other SFG Rickettsia species (Figs 3 and S2). Notably, its gltA gene is in a basal location in the phylogenetic tree but far from SFG Rickettsia species (Fig 3). According to the gene sequence-based criteria for taxonomic classification of new Rickettsia isolates, a Candidatus status could be assigned to Av11, so we named this species Candidatus Rickettsia vulgarisiii. For the Rickettsia sp. DH11, its rrs,ompA, gltA and 17kDa genes all show above 99.5% nucleotide similarity to Ca. R. jingxinensis (MH500194.1, MN463682.1, OR801782.1 and MW114879). Given that phylogenetic analysis of both rrs and ompA gene sequences revealed that the Rickettsia sp. DH11 strains were clustered with Ca. R. jingxinensis, so this SFG species was identified as Ca. R. jingxinensis.\nDetection of Anaplasma spp.To screen for Anaplasma infection in ticks, we also amplified the rrs, groEL, and gltA gene segments using nested PCR and detected 98 samples for all three positive genes. BLAST results are shown in S6 Table and phylogenetic trees based on single gene are shown in S3 Fig. As mentioned above, phylogenetic tree for Anaplasma species was also constructed by concatenated sequences from the three genes [49]. Among all positive sequences, 97 sample (TIGMIC001\u2013097) showed 97.1%\u2013100% identity to the Anaplasma ovis isolate TC249-5 detected in D. nuttalli from China, while the only remaining sample (TIGMIC098) fell between the two branches of A. ovis and A. capra (Fig 5), with 86.2% and 89.3% identity, respectively. Specific gene segments for A. ovis and A. capra were amplified again for this one sample, and only aligned with A. ovis (MH790273), showing 99.6% identity. This positive sample was identified as A. ovis. The nucleotide sequences of Anaplasma rrs, groEL, and gltA genes amplified from tick samples were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers PP106263\u2013PP106360 (rrs), PP117399\u2013PP117496 (groEL), and PP117094\u2013PP117191 (gltA) (S5 Table).\nThe tree was based on concatenated rrs (660 bp), gltA (793 bp), and groEL (1100 bp) nucleotide sequences. The tree was constructed by the maximum-likelihood method and we performed bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates to assess the reliability of the constructed phylogenies. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap proportions with 1000 replicates. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The sequences obtained in this study are marked by blue circles.\n\n\n\nPrevalence of SFGRs and Anaplasma in Ticks\nWe screened 425 adult ticks from Ningxia region and Rickettsia and Anaplasma DNA were detected in 210 ticks and 98 ticks. The distribution of bacterial species and quantity is shown in S4 Fig. The most species and the highest positive number of SFGRs were in Guyuan city (65/210), while the highest positive rate was in Zhongwei city (68.8%, 53/77); the highest positive number and positive rate of Anaplasma species were in Guyuan city (50/98) and Wuzhong city (40.3%, 27/67), respectively (S4 Fig and S7 Table). We detected seven described species of Rickettsia and one novel candidate Rickettsia species (Figs 2\u20134). Sequencing of the Anaplasma amplicon determined the presence of one Anaplsma species in D. nuttalli, D. silvarum, Hae. longicornis and Hae. qinghaiensis (Fig 5). Eight species of Rickettsia were identified, while R. raoultii exhibited the highest infection rate (24.0%, 102/425), and R. heilongjiangensis had the lowest infection rate (0.2%, 1/425), detected solely in only one sample from Hae. qinghaiensis (Table 1). The prevalence of R. raoultii, the most abundant species, in Dermacentor ticks (52.7%, 98/186) was significantly higher than that in Haemaphysalis (3.2%, 4/124), Hyalomma (0/101), and Argas (0/14) ticks (\u03c72 = 149.6, df = 3, P < 0.001). R. aeschlimannii was exclusively detected in Hyalomma ticks (64.4%, 65/101), R. sibirica and R. slovaca were solely identified in Dermacentor ticks, Ca. R. hongyuanensis identified in Haemaphysalis ticks, whereas Ca. R. jingxinensis was detected in Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis ticks. The infection rates of the newly discovered SFGR was relatively high in Argas ticks (78.6%, 11/14). Furthermore, 98 samples tested positive for Anaplasma species, showing an overall positivity rate of 23.1% (95% CI: 19.1\u201327.1), all of which identified as A. ovis (Table 2). Anaplasma infection was detected only in Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis ticks (51.1%, 95/186, 2.4%, 3/124), with no evidence in other tick species. The infection rate of A. ovis in Dermacentor ticks was significantly higher than that in Haemaphysalis ticks and other tick genera (\u03c72 = 146.5, df = 3, P < 0.001). We identified the greatest richness of bacteria strains in D. nuttalli.\nCo-infection of Rickettsia-Anaplasma within individual ticks was observed in 14.6% (62/425) of the ticks tested. Co-infections of R. raoultii + A. ovis were 11.5% (49/425), R. sibirica +A. ovis were 2.4% (10/425), and R. slovaca + A. ovis were 0.7% (3/425). All co-infected samples were Dermacentor ticks, with co-infection rate of 38.0% (46/121) in D. nuttalli and 24.6% (16/65) in D. silvarum (Table 3).\n\n\nVector host preference of rickettsiae\nThe above analysis results revealed differences in the parasitic adaptability of various Rickettsia species to tick hosts. To further describe this phenomenon, a species correlation analysis was conducted on all the samples and Rickettsia species included in this study. As illustrated in the chord diagram (Fig 6), these Rickettsia species exhibited specificity to tick genera or species. R. raoultii demonstrated relatively high adaptability to various tick species, being detected in three Haemaphysalis species and two Dermacentor species, with a positive rate reaching 60.3% in D. nuttalli, followed by D. silvarum (38.5%). R. aeschlimannii was found in both Hya. asiaticum and Hya. scupense, with positive rates of 50.0% and 68.8% (Table 1), respectively, and was not detected in tick genera other than Hyalomma ticks. R. sibirica and R. slovaca were exclusively found in Dermacentor ticks, Ca. R. vulgarisii was exclusively detected in Ar. vulgaris, whereas Ca. R. hongyuanensis was solely found in three species of Haemaphysalis ticks. While Ca. R. jingxinensis displayed a lower positive rate than R. raoulti, it was also detected in different tick species. These findings suggest that the distinct host preferences and adaptation ranges exhibited by different Rickettsia species.\nThe upper semicircle is the tick species, the lower semicircle is the Rickettsia species, and the color of the inner lines represent the tick species. The width of each chord corresponds to the count of Rickettsia-positive individuals in respective tick species.",
    "Discussion": "Rickettsia species exhibit broad pathogenicity, with some posing a lethal threat to humans [50], and ticks are critical vectors in the transmission cycle of these pathogens, affecting both human and animal health. Understanding the tick-host-pathogen interactions is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impact of tick-borne diseases. Our results document the first detection in ticks of SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. collected from Ningxia, China. As a result, one Anaplasma species and eight SFGR species were identified in nine tick species. Sequence data provided evidence for the presence of A. ovis, R. raoultii, R. aeschlimannii, R. sibirica, R. slovaca, R. heilongjiangensis, Ca. R. hongyuanensis, Ca. R. jingxinensis, and one novel Rickettsia species, which we named \u201cCa. R. vulgarisii\u201d.\nSFGRs compose the important group in the genus Rickettsia. They are common tick-borne pathogens and have long been considered as the causative agents of various zoonotic diseases. In this study, a combination of single gene and concatenated genes (rrs, ompA, and gltA) were used to infer the evolutionary topology of Rickettsia using DNA samples obtained from ticks [51]. Eight Rickettsia species, especially a novel SFGR species named Ca. R. vulgarisii, were identified in ticks. Since its characterization in 2008 [52], R. raoultii, as a causative agent of human tick-borne lymphadenitis, has been reported in ticks from the Romania [24], India [53] and China [54]. The second SFGR identified in this study was R. aeschlimannii, which has been found in Hya. marginatum collected from southern Europe [55], and Africa [56]. R. sibirica, R. slovaca and R. heilongjiangensis are recognized as human pathogens that can cause mild rash associated with fever and eschars [57]. Ca. R. hongyuanensis and Ca. R. jingxinensis, belonging to SFG Rickettsia, were first identified in Hae. longicornis in southwest [58] and northeast China [59]. These findings indicate a human infection risk of important SFGR tick-borne diseases in the region.\nFurthermore, we had detected an incompletely described Rickettsia in Argas ticks. This Rickettsia species had been detected with a highly positive rate in Zhongwei city, and had provisionally been named Rickettsia sp. Av11. The analysis of rrs, ompA and gltA genes and concatenated sequences confirmed the presence of this SFGR in Ningxia. As stated by de Sousa et al. [60], when they reported the detection of this bacterium, other gene sequences were required to establish its identity correctly according to the genetic guidelines published by Fournier et al. [61,62]. Genetic analyses indicate that its rrs, ompA, gltA and 17kDa genes have the highest identities to different validated species and these stains in different trees were apparently divergent from other SFG Rickettsia species. Considering these criteria, we propose to give to this strain a Candidatus status and name it \u201cCa. R. vulgarisii\u201d, with reference to the name Ar. vulgaris ticks in which this Rickettsia species had been detected. Argas ticks can easily transmit and acquire bacteria to and from different hosts during its life cycle on account of the fact that they feed multiple times during a given developmental stage [63]. Wild birds, as the common hosts of Argas ticks, may be the non-negligible reason for introducing ticks and related pathogens into new environments due to their special migratory behaviors [64]. The role of Ar. vulgaris in the transmission of SFGRs should be further considered, and investigations on the human pathogenicity of these Rickettsia species are still needed. This discovery suggested that the potential threat of novel species to humans and animals still can not be excluded although its transmissibility and potential pathogenicity should be further studied.\nA. ovis has been recognized as a tick-borne obligatory intraerythrocytic pathogen mainly infecting the ovine and caprine erythrocytes [65,66]. This pathogen can cause ovine anaplasmosis characterised by subclinical signs such as weakness, anorexia, weight loss and anaemia [67]. A. ovis was reported in all continents and has a widespread distribution in China [68], France [69] and Italy [70]. In this study, we observed remarkably high positivity rates of A. ovis in D. nuttalli (58.9%) and D. silvarum (45.7%). Hae. longicornis and Hae. qinghaiensis also tested positive for this A. ovis strain. Although the possibility cannot be ruled out that the A. ovis DNA may come from the blood meal of ticks, we suspect that Dermacentor ticks might play an important role in the transmission of A. ovis in domestic animals. The existence of A. ovis in Ningxia may indicate the risk of human infection and highlight the importance of surveillance in local populations though the pathogenicity of these strains to humans is still to be determined.\nEvaluation of SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. prevalence at tick level was possible through phylogenetic analysis inference. The infection rates of SFGR and Anaplasma spp. in ticks from the Ningxia region were 49.4% and 23.1% in the present study and their positive rate among different tick species existed significance difference. The ticks were collected during the peak activity period of ticks, and Dermacentor ticks were the dominant tick genus, suggesting their important role in the distribution and transmission of rickettsiae in this region. The positive sequences of SFGRs and A. ovis in this study were mostly derived from ticks feeding on animal hosts (sheep and goat) rather than free ticks. These pathogens were found in regions with high biodiversity where migratory birds may inhabit. Combined with extensive livestock husbandry in Ningxia, they might spread to other hosts through these domestic animals. Previous studies have shown that mammals including sheeps and goats, particularly rodents and other small mammals, are often key reservoirs for tick-borne pathogens [2,21\u201323]. Meanwhile, studies have shown that a higher diversity of mammalian hosts can influence the transmission dynamics of these pathogens, reducing the transmission rates of pathogens like A. phagocytophilum [71]. This is due to the presence of non-susceptible species that can disrupt the cycle of transmission among more susceptible hosts. The ecological and economic factors in the Ningxia region have led to a rich array of animal resources. Therefore, according to the One health concept, it is not only human infections that are of concern, but infections in wild animals and livestock are also major health issues that deserve attention [72].\nOur results also showed that co-infection of A. ovis and SFGR (R. raoultii, R. sibirica and R. slovaca) existed in Dermacentor ticks, and suggested potential interactions between these pathogens within tick vectors. The results obtained in the current study coincide with those previously described in Thailand, which reported co-infection with Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma spp. in Dermacentor ticks [73]. It is reported that persistent infection of A. ovis can be accompanied by cyclical fluctuations in rickettsial levels, which may obviously alter the vector infection rate and thus alter transmission [74]. Previous research also indicated that co-infection often leads to a broader spectrum of clinical symptoms, prolongs disease duration, and exacerbates disease severity [75]. For instance, co-infection with both Borrelia burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, as opposed to single infections of either one, leads to more deep impairment of endothelial barrier function [76]. The higher co-infection rate in Dermacentor ticks, particularly D. nuttalli, suggests potential synergistic or competitive dynamics between these two genera of pathogens. The interactions between co-infections of pathogens within ticks and the impact of tick-borne transmission on human health still require further study [77].\nDue to its intracellular lifestyle, rickettsiae are highly dependent on their primary tick vectors and tend to be selective for the tick species they infect. In this study, most bacteria were detected in Dermacentor ticks. Meanwhile, some bacteria were also detected in Haemaphysalis ticks, Hyalomma and Argas ticks. Further analysis of host preferences among different Rickettsia species highlighted differences in adaptability to various tick species. In this study, R. raoultii displayed relatively high adaptability across five tick species, with infections in Dermacentor ticks accounting for as much as 96.1% (98/102) of the tick population. In contrast, other Rickettsia species exhibited more specific host preferences. R. aeschlimannii showed a preference for two species of Hyalomma ticks. Among the newly discovered Rickettsia, Ca. R. vulgarisii was detected only in Ar. vulgaris, further emphasizing the genus-specific adaptation of Rickettsia species. Additionally, the detection of Anaplasma species in ticks also indicated that they have varying adaptability to different tick species. Beyond the Rickettsia and Anaplasma species studied herein, ticks generally engage in complex ecological interactions with their microbiota [78], where the presence of specific pathogens contributes to the stability of tick microbial communities and influences their population dynamics and metabolic functions [79,80]. The adaptability of Rickettsia species to specific hosts holds significant value in maintaining the structure and function of pathogen-vector microbial communities [81], suggesting that research on the mechanisms of co-evolution between ticks and the microbiota will enhance efforts to control the risk of Rickettsia disease transmission.\nThese findings presented here are of epidemiological importance. We have characterized a novel SFGR named \u201cCa. R. vulgarisii\u201d, which may enhance our understanding of our knowledge on the diversity of SFGRs. Although the human pathogenicity for this novel bacterium from a limited sources of Argas ticks is still determined, more attention should be paid to the risk of human infection and the possible circulation of these pathogens in local population. Thus, further studies are needed to explore its implications for human and/or animal diseases in Ningxia by extending ecological surveys with an increased number of tick species and tick specimens. The host range, distribution, and pathogenicity of \u201cCa. R. vulgarisii\u201d also merit further investigations.",
    "Conclusions": "In conclusion, the present study provided a molecular detection on Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma spp. for the first time in ticks from Ningxia, northwestern China. One Anaplasma species (A. ovis) and egiht SFGR (R. raoultii, R. aeschlimannii, R. sibirica, R. slovaca, R. heilongjiangensis, Ca. R. hongyuanensis, Ca. R. jingxinensis and Ca. R. vulgarisii) including a novel species were detected and characterized. Our findings reveal a presence of diverse SFGRs including unidentified agents within tick species in Ningxia. Further investigations should be focused on expanding the sampling range, required to examine the effects of ecological and seasonal factors on ticks and pathogens, and ascertain the pathogenicity of newly emerged SFGRs in humans. Moreover, variations in host adaptability among different Rickettsia species highlight the complexity of the transmission and dissemination of tick-borne diseases. Therefore, there is a compelling need for intensified monitoring of tick and tick-borne pathogens in subsequent research attempt."
