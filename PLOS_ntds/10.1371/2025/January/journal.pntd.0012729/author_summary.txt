SFGRs are bacteria mainly vectored by different tick species. There is increasing attention paid to them as causative agents of human disease. To date, these bacteria have been prevailing in China, but no studies have been conducted to detect potential tick vectors of rickettsiae in the Ningxia region. This study collected a total of 425 ticks from four cities with diverse geographic environments in Ningxia and determined the presence of SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. in naturally infected ticks. All the ticks were classfied as Argas, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis s and Hyalomma genera. The overall prevalence of SFGRs and Anaplasma spp. detected in nine tick species were 49.4% and 23.1%, respectively. We present data that indicate high genetic diversity of SFGRs in Ningxia and co-infections with SFGR and A. ovis in ticks. Importantly, we describe a divergent Rickettsia spp. and propose the name Candidatus Rickettsia vulgarisii. These findings imply a potential threat of SFGRs infection among humans and highlight the importance of SFGRs and their targeted surveillance for human health in Ningxia.
