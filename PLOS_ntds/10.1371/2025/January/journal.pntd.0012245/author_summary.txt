Being aware of mosquito biting behaviour is essential to determine the threat of mosquito-borne diseases. Studying the feeding patterns of Culex mosquitoes is crucial as these mosquitoes are vectors of currently emerging or re-emerging arboviruses such as West Nile and Usutu. Feeding behaviour of Culex mosquitoes has been examined in many individual small-scale studies. These studies only focus on the feeding patterns in a specific area. To gain a more global understanding of these feeding patterns we analyzed all available Culex blood-feeding data from the last 15 years. In summary, data on 29990 blood-meals from 70 different Culex species was collected. For each species the percentage of blood-meals on different host groups was determined. We analyzed the relationship between feeding patterns and mosquito phylogeny, which showed that phylogeny alone could not explain feeding patterns. These results indicate that external factors such as land use and climate could play an important role in determining feeding patterns. A more in-depth analysis of the feeding patterns for three important vector species, Cx. quinquefasciatus, ‘Cx. pipiens pooled’, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was done in different biogeographical realms. All three species showed different feeding patterns in the included realms. Thus, the same species can have different feeding patterns in different regions, indicating the importance of local surveillance.
