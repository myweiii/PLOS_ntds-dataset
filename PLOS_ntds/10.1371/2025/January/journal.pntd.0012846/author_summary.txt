The early identification of severe dengue (SD) patients who are at high risk of mortality is crucial for frontline physicians to deliver timely and intensive clinical interventions. This study is particularly significant as it focuses on SD patients and explores the factors associated with mortality, aiming to reduce preventable deaths within this specific patient group. We have pinpointed several independent risk factors that are predictive of mortality outcomes, including advanced age, altered consciousness, elevated leukocyte counts, and gastrointestinal bleeding upon admission. Addressing these risk factors at the initial presentation is critical for mitigating the severity of SD and decreasing mortality rates. Additionally, the development of acute kidney injury, severe hepatitis, and pneumonia during hospitalization has been identified as significant prognostic indicators. Prompt recognition of signs of organ hypoperfusion and the implementation of intensive supportive management to prevent further deterioration are essential strategies to reduce mortality among SD patients. These insights are particularly vital for regions with limited medical resources, enabling healthcare providers to efficiently identify and prioritize SD patients at increased risk of mortality.
