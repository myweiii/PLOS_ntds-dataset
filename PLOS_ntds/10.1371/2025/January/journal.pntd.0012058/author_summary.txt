Malaria transmission is complex, involving interactions of parasite, vector biology and ecology, human immune response, and human host behavior. We used social network analysis to understand how the daily lives including occupation-related mobility leads to the maintenance of malaria endemicity and transmission. Rural communities (within the districts of Mazan) and peri-urban communities around the city of Iquitos have different socio-demographic characteristics that determine malaria transmission rates. Networks of fixed rural communities and occupation-related distant camp sites play a key role as reservoirs and sources of parasite movement. Factors including male sex, outdoor occupational activity outdoors, and having rural camp sites as travel destination increase the risk of Plasmodium infection. Factors associated with occupation-related mobility are correlated with incidence and prevalence of malarial disease and parasite infection rates, respectively. This work provides a detailed understanding of the importance of work-related travel to target in malaria elimination programs, key to maintaining malaria transmission both in the Amazon region and more generally.
