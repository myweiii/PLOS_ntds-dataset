The Lihir Islands of Papua New Guinea host a mining operation on Aniolam, the main island, which implements specific vector control strategies in the mine-impacted zone (MIZ); whereas the remaining areas rely solely on distribution of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLIN). Our study compared transmission dynamics in the different geographic areas and demonstrated lower malaria incidence, prevalence, Anopheles density and biting intensities in the MIZ. Living outside the MIZ on Aniolam and on Malie Island was associated with a higher risk of infection, with transmission metrics rarely seen outside high burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Besides the geographic area, other risk factors for infection included younger age, cohabiting with infected individuals, and living in traditional housing; while the use of LLINs was not associated with a reduction of infection risk.
Our results highlight the need for tailored strategies based on local transmission patterns and could be beneficial for ongoing initiatives aimed at malaria control and elimination. In Lihir, there is an opportunity to invest and improve the collaboration between the mine company and public health authorities. Such a public-private partnership could enhance control efforts, including expansion of diagnostics and treatments, the vector control program and community education beyond the MIZ.
