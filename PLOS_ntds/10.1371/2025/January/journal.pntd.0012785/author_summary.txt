Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite which causes Chagas disease. Mother-to-child transmission is the main route of transmission in vector-free areas. Congenital Chagas disease refers specifically to cases arising from this route of transmission. Diagnostic for Congenital Chagas disease comprises performing more than one test on children from birth until nine months of age, to ten months of age. This work evaluates two qPCR techniques for diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease with high sensitivity and bring treatment during the period in which tripanocydal drugs has high efficacy.
