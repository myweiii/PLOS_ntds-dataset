Trichinella spiralis is a nematode of genus Trichinella that infects a variety of mammals worldwide, and intestinal larva invasion is a crucial step of T. spiralis infection. T. spiralis intestinal infective larvae (IIL) and their excretory/secretory proteins (ESP) interact with the host gut epithelium, which promoted the larval invasion, but the IIL invasive mechanism is not clear. Apoptosis is involved in multitudinous pathological process in parasite infection. In this study, the effect of T. spiralis IIL ESP on Caco-2 monolayer barrier function was assessed by using trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), FITC-dextran, qPCR, Western blot and IFT. The results showed that IIL ESP decreased the TEER, increased FITC-dextran flux in Caco-2 monolayer, decreased the expression of tight junctions (TJs; ZO-1, E-cad, Occludin and Claudin-1). These results suggested that IIL ESP damaged the integrity of intestinal epithelium barrier. The IIL ESP-induced Caco-2 cellular apoptosis was observed by DAPI, Hoechst 33358, TUNEL and Annexin V/PI staining. Besides, a flow cytometry exhibited an increasing apoptosis rate of Caco-2 cells treated with IIL ESP. qPCR and Western blot results showed that IIL ESP activated caspases (Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and Caspase 8), up-regulated the pro-apoptotic factors (Bax and Cytochrome c), down-regulated the anti-apoptosis molecule Bcl-2. Pretreatment with apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK abrogated and recovered the barrier function of Caco-2 monolayer destroyed by IIL ESP. The inhibitor pretreatment also impeded the in vitro larva invasion of Caco-2 monolayer. These findings demonstrated that IIL ESP mediated larva invasion via inducing gut epithelial apoptosis and damaging gut barrier integrity.
