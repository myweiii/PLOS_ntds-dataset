Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) has mortality rates ranging from 5% to > 20%, particularly in those with prolonged shock, severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation (MV), and acute kidney injury (AKI). Although colloidal solutions are commonly used in severe DSS management, excessive use can lead to respiratory failure and AKI, raising concerns regarding optimal fluid strategies. This study analyzed 1,278 children with DSS and found that 13.3% required MV, with a significantly higher mortality rate in the MV group (22.4%) than in the non-MV group (0.1%). Both the total intravenous fluid volume and colloid-to-crystalloid ratio were strong predictors of MV, with optimal cut-offs of 181 mL/kg for fluid volume and a ratio of 1.6. In practice, a cut-off of colloid-to-crystalloid ratio â‰¥ 1.6 may indicate the need to transition to alternative fluids such as albumin or fresh frozen plasma. Moreover, a marked reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed in the MV group, indicating a link between fluid management and renal function. These findings underscore the importance of fluid management in DSS, providing key predictors of MV and AKI to guide treatment and improve the clinical outcomes.
