Understanding why Cryptosporidium species and isolates differ in infectivity to their hosts is a complex puzzle. Recent comparative genomic analyses suggest that copy number variation of genes may be a contributing factor. In this research, we focused on two subtelomeric genes encoding the proteases INS-19 and INS-20 in C. parvum, the most important zoonotic Cryptosporidium species. We genetically tagged and engineered these genes to study their expression and function. Our results showed that INS-19 and INS-20 are expressed at different stages of the parasite life cycle. Interestingly, while knocking out each gene did not affect parasite growth in vitro, deleting or mutating INS-20 significantly reduced the severity of infection in mice. Mice infected with the C. parvum mutants had less intestinal damage and lower parasite loads. This study highlights the distinct roles of these two proteases and suggests that INS-20, in particular, plays a critical role in the parasiteâ€™s ability to infect and cause disease. These findings may facilitate the development of new drugs for cryptosporidiosis.
