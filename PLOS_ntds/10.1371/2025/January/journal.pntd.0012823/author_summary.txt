Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the primary etiological agent of acute human encephalitis in Asia, and currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy for JE. JEV is transmitted to mammalian via the bite of an infected mosquito, making the acquisition of the virus from an infected mammalian host by the vector a critical step in the transmission cycle. JEV produces a distinctive nonstructural protein, NS1′, which is produced through a −1 ribosomal frameshift. Previous studies have demonstrated that the NS1′ protein plays a crucial role in the virulence of both West Nile virus (WNV) and JEV. Our research demonstrates that the NS1′ protein facilitates JEV infection in mosquitoes by suppressing their innate immunity response. This discovery elucidates a previously unrecognized mechanism of JEV infection, offering potential avenues for the development of innovative prevention strategies against JEV.
