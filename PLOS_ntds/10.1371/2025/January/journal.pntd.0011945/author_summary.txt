Mental health services are often not available at the community levels in NTD-endemic countries; this is a vital felt need. While basic psychological support from peers could be an important solution, NLR India took efforts and developed a new guide that has shown effectiveness. We aimed to describe the process of development of the guide.
A qualitative approach was taken in weighing the values of various guides and arriving at a consensus, during meetings sponsored by NLR India, for developing the new guide through adaptations. The Psychological First Aid guide of WHO was selected as a suitable basic model. Aspects of the Rights-Based Counselling intervention procedures were also used for adaptation.
A review team verified the final document—Basic Psychological Support for Neglected Tropical Diseases (BPS-N)—to ensure it was simple, adequate, and appropriate; affected persons contributed to its practicality.
The guide promotes awareness, empathy, ethics, willingness and abilities among the peer supporters, community and health staff. Its use would reduce stigma, improve confidence, compassion, communication, participation and mental wellbeing of those with NTDs. Regular training, and actions advised by this new guide may change the lives of the affected millions.
