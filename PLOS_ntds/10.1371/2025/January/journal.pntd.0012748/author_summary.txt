Despite national efforts to suppress malaria outbreaks, there has been a recent increase in the number of vivax malaria cases in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Insecticides are the most cost-effective and efficient approach for vector control. However, mosquito populations consistently exposed to these insecticides experience significant selection pressures to develop resistance. While insecticide resistance plays a crucial role in effective vector control, current research on insecticide resistance in the ROK has primarily concentrated on Anopheles sinensis that is considered to be a poor malaria vector. This study examined the presence of insecticide resistance-related mutations in all Anopheles mosquito species in the ROK, aiming to enhance the future development of effective malaria vector control strategies. Screening for the G119S mutation in the acetylcholinesterase-1 gene, associated with organophosphate insecticides, and the identification of knockdown resistance mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene demonstrated the presence of previously unrecognized resistance mutations in Anopheles species in the ROK. We also observed variations in seasonal insecticide resistance among each of the species. These findings indicate that the rotation and/or combination of insecticides are necessary for effective vector control, thereby providing a valuable strategy for future malaria control efforts.
