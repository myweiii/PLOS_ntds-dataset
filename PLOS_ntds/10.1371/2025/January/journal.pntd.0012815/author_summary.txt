As a common situation, when pathogens enter the body, antigenic proteins (such as virus proteins synthesized by infected cells) will be processed into short peptides, where those immunogenic peptides will bind to MHC molecules to form complexes, triggering immune processes. These short peptides are called epitopes, and on a larger antigenic protein, only a small number of epitopes actually function. Through the linkage of epitopes, multi-epitope subunit vaccines can be formed, which exhibit excellent properties and, at the same time, reduce the potential harm to the human body compared to natural protein vaccines. With the advancement of immunoinformatics technology, we can now predict unknown epitopes from proteins. Various studies have shown that this prediction has high accuracy and can be fully utilized in vaccine design. Based on this, when emerging pathogens such as SFTSV appear, we can significantly reduce the time required for vaccine design and validation.
