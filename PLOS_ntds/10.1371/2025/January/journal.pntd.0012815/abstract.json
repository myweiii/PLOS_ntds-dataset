    "Abstract": "Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a novel identified pathogen, despite two decades of research on SFTSV, the potential widespread threats pose a significant challenge for researchers in developing new treatment and prevention methods. In this present, we have developed a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine for SFTSV and valid it with in silico methods. We screened 9 immunodominant epitopes for cytotoxic T cells (CTL), 7 for helper T cells (HTL), and 8 for Linear B-cell (LBL) based on promising candidate protein Gn, Gc, Np, and NSs. All predicted epitopes demonstrated strong antigenicity without any potential harm to humans. Additionally, the high conservancy is required to cover different strains. All epitopes as well as adjuvants were constructed into a final vaccine, which was further assesd by calculating of physicochemical properties. Then, we docked the vaccine protein with immune receptors and analyzed the complexes with dynamic simulations to evaluate its affinity to receptors. Finally, the vaccine sequence was constructed into a mRNA sequence. The constructed vaccine is a potential candidate for combating SFTSV by stimulating protective humoral and cellular immune responses."
