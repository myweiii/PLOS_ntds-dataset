C-type lectin (CTL) plays a vital role in parasite adhesion, invading host’s cells and immune escape. Previous studies showed that recombinant Trichinella spiralis C-type lectin (rTsCTL) facilitated larval invasion of intestinal epithelium. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective immunity evoked by vaccination with rTsCTL in a mouse model. The results revealed that subcutaneous vaccination of mice with rTsCTL elicited a systemic humoral response (high levels of serum IgG, IgG1/IgG2a and IgA) and significant gut mucosal sIgA responses. The levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ/IL-4) secreted from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches were distinctly increased at 6 weeks following vaccination (P < 0.05). The rTsCTL-vaccinated mice exhibited a 51.69 and 48.19% reduction of intestinal adult and muscle larva burdens, respectively. Moreover, the numbers of goblet cells and expression level of Muc2, Muc5ac and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) in gut tissues of vaccinated mice were obviously decreased after challenge, while expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) was evidently increased. Additionally, expression levels of tight junctions (occludin, claudin-1 and E-cad) were prominently elevated and intestinal permeability was interestingly declined in vaccinated mice. The results showed that vaccination of mice with rTsCTL elicited an obvious protective immunity against T. spiralis challenge, impeded larval invasion of the gut, reduced intestinal adult burden, female fecundity and muscle larval burdens; it also alleviated gut inflammations, consequently improved intestinal epithelial integrity and enhanced intestinal mucosal barrier function. Therefore, TsCTL might be a novel candidate target molecule for anti-Trichinella vaccines.
