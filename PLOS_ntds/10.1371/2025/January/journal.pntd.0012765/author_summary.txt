Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne disease caused by Leishmania that affects more than one million people worldwide each year. CL is a disfiguring disease capable of causing chronic skin ulcers that leave scars with significant social and economic impact. Although chemotherapy, such as antimonial compounds, is the pillar choice for treatment, large doses and extended treatment regimens hamper their efficacy. Application of growth factors and immunomodulatory agents for treatment of CL represents a highly favorable approach for reducing the healing time and scar. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of subcutaneous administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in combination with Glucantime or nano-liposomal Amphotericin B (SinaAmpholeish) in the treatment of CL in BALB/c mice. During the five-week treatment, lesion sizes were measured weekly. At the end of the study, parasite load was determined in the skin biopsies using the qPCR method. Combination therapy of EGF at 4.5 Î¼g/kg with either drug alone enhanced wound healing; however, treatment with EGF and SinaAmpholeish was most potent in reducing the lesion size and parasitic load. Numerous studies indicated the usefulness of EGF for wound healing in different clinical settings. Our results suggest EGF as a promising supplement to antileishmanial drugs for the treatment of CL. Further studies are needed to explore the beneficial effect of combining EGF with antileishmanial drugs in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
