Machupo virus (MACV) is a New World arenavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) in humans. BHF involves both viscerotropic and neurotropic disease. The prototypical Carvallo strain frequently used for MACV pathogenesis and vaccine development studies has been proven to be fully or partially attenuated in immunocompetent mice and guinea pigs. To overcome this challenge, we report the development of a reverse genetics system for the MACV Chicava strain that is representative of the dominantly-circulating lineage in the Mamore province. Our reverse genetics system rescues the recombinant MACV Chicava strain from BHK-21 cells transfected with Pol-I-driven plasmids transcribing viral genomic RNAs and expression plasmids of the L protein and nucleoprotein genes. The recombinant MACV Chicava strain exhibits the virulence phenotype and antigenicity similar to the parental wild-type virus. The lethal guinea pig model developed in this study showed both viscerotropic and neurotropic disease and, hence, has broad utility for molecular virology research and the development of candidate vaccines and therapeutic antibodies for human BHF.
