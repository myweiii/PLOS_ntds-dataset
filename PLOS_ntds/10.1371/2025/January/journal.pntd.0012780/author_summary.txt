Human hookworm infections constitute a significant global health burden, and a vaccine is urgently needed to overcome limitations in current management strategies. No current proteomic study on the secretome of hookworm infective larvae exists and this stage represents a distinct and crucial window where the parasite first encounters the immune system during infection. Identifying excretory/secretory proteins associated with this stage of the lifecycle uncovers novel targets for vaccines and diagnostics. This study comprehensively characterizes and compares excretory/secretory proteins from Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Necator americanus adult hookworms and infective larvae using mass spectrometry. We found that A. ceylanicum and N. americanus infective larvae predominantly express excretory/secretory proteins that are unique to that developmental stage (i.e. not detected in the adult stage secretome) and are likely tailored to the skin and lung environments through which the larvae traverse. This proteome offers a new set of vaccine and diagnostic targets unique to infective hookworm larvae. We also identify several conserved and diversified proteins across both the adult and infective larvae stage of either hookworm. Conserved proteins could represent proteins essential to common functions and may be ideal candidates for a pan-hookworm vaccine.
