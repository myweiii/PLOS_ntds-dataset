Neglected tropical diseases like cutaneous leishmaniasis are often overlooked. It can take on a variety of clinical forms and presentations. Comparably, the various causal agents and clinical forms of the treatment also vary. Both localized and systemic treatments are effective in treating localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. In most dermatological clinics, liquid nitrogen cryotherapy was the primary method employed. However, most dermatology clinics also utilize carbon dioxide-based cryotherapy sparingly, although the gynecology department uses it often for cervical cancer screening. On the other hand, the product is accessible, simple to use, painless, reasonably effective, and leaves fewer scars. Carbon dioxide cryotherapy had a pretty high pooled impact across trials, offering another accessible, easy-to-apply, and reasonably effective therapeutic option for localized cutaneous leishmaniasis.
