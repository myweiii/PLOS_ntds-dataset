A major concern for Chagas disease control programs is transmission reactivation by native vectors that are not commonly found living within the domestic environment. In Colombia, transmission by primary vector species was certified as interrupted in Miraflores municipality in 2019, however other secondary native species have been found entering human dwellings in rural areas, emphasizing the need for entomological surveillance. In this study we collected and analyzed human and animal blood samples, and secondary vector species from six rural villages to detect Trypanosoma cruzi infections. The results show evidence of active infection among three native vector species, domestic canines, and peridomestic opossums. Our results are important, as vector species ecology continues to adapt warranting increased entomological surveillance to assess human transmission risk in an area perceived as free of Chagas disease transmission.
