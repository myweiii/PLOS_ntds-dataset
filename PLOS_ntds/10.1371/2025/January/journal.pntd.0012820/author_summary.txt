Fascioliasis is a snail-borne zoonotic disease caused by the trematodes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. The highest prevalences and intensities ever found in humans have been reported in the Northern Altiplano of Bolivia, in South America. In this endemic area, the disease is caused only by Fasciola hepatica and transmitted by Galba truncatula, the sole lymnaeid species present in the area. Our aim was to analyse the physiographical heterogeneity of this fascioliasis hyperendemic area, and assess its repercussions in the implementation of a One Health action. We applied multivariate linear regressions to analyse the influence of physiographical features on the long-term variation of climate and of the transmission risk. Our results revealed markedly heterogeneous climate characteristics throughout the endemic area. This irregular pattern is influenced by altitude, closeness to inner hills and Lake Titicaca, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation. These findings highlight the importance of considering physiographical features, an aspect usually not considered in studies dealing with influences of climate and climate change on human and animal fascioliasis. Moreover, it shows that an endemic area may climatically evolve differently in its various inner zones and emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring to assess whether control measures should be modified accordingly.
