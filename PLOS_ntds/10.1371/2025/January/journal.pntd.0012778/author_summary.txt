Snakebite envenoming is a life-threatening emergency occurring predominantly in low-and middle-income countries in the Global South. Studies involving healthcare workers in snakebite-endemic countries have indicated that recognizing and appropriately treating snakebite envenoming can pose a challenge to healthcare staff. Reducing the deaths and disabilities caused by snakebite envenoming, however, will require a strengthened, competent and skilled healthcare workforce. In this study, a panel of international snakebite experts designed a questionnaire based on skills essential to the clinical care of patients with snakebite envenoming and which can be employed in any region around the world to assess the snakebite-specific training needs of healthcare workers. The questionnaire was subsequently used in a sample of healthcare workers in Eswatini, a country in which snakebite envenoming is a public health concern. The measured training needs differed according to the skill in question, participantsâ€™ profession and the extent and context of previously received snakebite training. Healthcare workers who had attended specialized snakebite training in the past had a markedly reduced training need for clinical skills. This study provides a useful tool which can help tailor snakebite-specific clinical training initiatives to the needs of local and regional healthcare workers.
