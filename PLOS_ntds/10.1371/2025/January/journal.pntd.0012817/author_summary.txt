Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) represent a significant burden to public health and local economies due to their ability to cause unpredictable and widespread epidemics. To maximize early detection and rapid diagnosis of their occurrence, surveillance efforts should target areas where circulation is most likely. However, identifying such hotspots of potential emergence is a major challenge. The ecological conditions leading to VHF outbreaks are shaped by complex interactions between the virus, its vertebrate hosts, arthropod vectors, abiotic and human environments that are often poorly understood. Here, we systematically reviewed spatially relevant risk factors associated with the emergence and maintenance of VHFs in the tropical moist forest of Africa. These include mosquito-borne zoonoses (Rift Valley fever, dengue, yellow fever), tick-borne zoonosis (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever), zoonoses transmitted by direct contact (Ebola Virus Disease, Marburg Virus Disease, and Lassa Fever). Analysis of all the documents considered reveals that the invasion of humans on nature is the main risk factor incriminated in spillover events of VHFs. This work provides baseline information for the identification of regions and habitats that have suitable environmental and human conditions for emergence and maintenance, useful for forecasting and targeted surveillance programs.
