Bangladesh is increasingly vulnerable to waterborne illnesses, exacerbated by climate change. This study uses spatial analysis, regression, and machine learning models to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A, and amoebiasis across districts from 2017 to 2020. Districts with the highest prevalence of cholera include Brahmanbaria, Chapai-Nawabganj, and others. The study identifies mean and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, and precipitation as the main climatic factors influencing disease transmission. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, early warning systems, and improved surveillance in high-risk areas to prevent waterborne infections. These insights align with the One Health approach to managing health risks in Bangladesh and similar regions.
