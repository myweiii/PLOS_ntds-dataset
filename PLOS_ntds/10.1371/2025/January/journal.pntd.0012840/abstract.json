    "Background": "Riverine communities face various health problems, which involve geographical and cultural barriers to accessing care, in addition to a lack of financial investments in services aimed at these communities, resulting in a process of invisibility for the population living in these regions. In this scenario, the significant burden of snakebite envenoming (SBE) highlights the need for participatory research to address ways to minimize this situation. Thus, this study aimed to describe the priority health problems identified by this population and the ranking of SBEs in that context, mapping solutions according to the local reality.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This study was conducted in Limeira, a riverine community located in Tabatinga, in the extreme Western Brazilian Amazonia, on the borders with Peru and Colombia. The research lasted approximately one year, from 2021 to 2022.It is a participatory study that followed three steps: baseline assessment of the community, community assembly, and final data analysis.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Improvements in health care delivery to populations living in Amazonian communities are possible with the judicious use of tested integrated interventions, particularly when the community identifies various concurrent health problems. SBE control programs in remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon should be planned with a multidisciplinary and intercultural approach, preferably integrated with broader interventions that address the populationâ€™s needs for a range of health issues."
