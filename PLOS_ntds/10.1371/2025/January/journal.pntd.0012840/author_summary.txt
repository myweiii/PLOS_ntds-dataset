Riverine communities in the Brazilian Amazon have been facing various health problems due to factors such as the region’s geographic characteristics, lack of investment in public policies, and difficulty accessing healthcare services, among others, which result in the invisibility of this population in the country’s public policies. This participatory study, conducted in Limeira, a riverine community in the interior of the Amazonas state, Brazil, reveals the various challenges faced by the community members, including tropical and infectious diseases, occupational diseases, work-related accidents, women’s health issues, among others. Additionally, the study collectively mapped out strategies and solutions to address these problems, which threaten the quality of life and overall well-being of this population.
