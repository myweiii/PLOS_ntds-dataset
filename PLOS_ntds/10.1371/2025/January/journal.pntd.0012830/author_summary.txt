Recent research has raised alarms about antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella found in pigs from farms in Antioquia, Colombia. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify 34 resistance genes in 28 Salmonella isolates, revealing that 89% of these isolates carried more than two resistance genes, affecting various antibiotics. This situation poses significant risks, as multidrug-resistant Salmonella in pigs could directly or indirectly impact human health and lead to potential economic losses in pig production.
Our findings highlight the urgent need to implement better management practices on farms and responsible antibiotic use in pig production. Properly addressing these issues is essential to ensure food safety and protect public health. Continuous surveillance and effective control measures are crucial to combat this growing problem. By prioritizing these actions, we can help mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance and safeguard both livestock and consumers.
