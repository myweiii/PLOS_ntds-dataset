    "Background": "Occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella strains has been reported worldwide, because of inappropriate use of antimicrobial products in either humans or animals. The presence of multidrug resistant Salmonella in pig production systems had been reported in Antioquia, Colombia.",
    "Aim": "To identify antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) in different Salmonella spp. strains isolated from pig productions in Antioquia, Colombia. Methods: Samples were received at the Diagnostic Unit of the Faculty of Agrarian Sciences at the University of Antioquia, from January 1, 2019, to January 2021. A total of 28 isolates of Salmonella spp. were included, which presented phenotypic resistance to more than one antibiotic used in pig farms. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in the Unit of Genomic of Agrosavia using an automated pipeline from the GHRU- Sanger Institute, employing the Illumina MiSeq platform.",
    "Results": "WGS revealed 34 ARGs among these isolates. In 25 isolates (89%) more than two ARGs were found. Genes encoding resistance were found for 10 different groups of antibiotics (beta-lactam, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, rifampicins, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and trimethoprim). The most frequently observed MDR profile in Typhimurium isolates was AMP-CEX-CEP-CEF-EFT-CEQ-FLU-ENR-TE-FFC-SXT.",
    "Conclusion": "The presence of multi-drug resistant Salmonella strains in pigs destined for human consumption in Antioquia, Colombia was determined. This research emphasizes the utmost importance of epidemiological tools to understand the presence and spreading of antimicrobial resistance genes in pig farms. Additionally, it highlights the critical need for developing educational programs and public policies to help reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance in production systems."
