Fatty acid and retinol-binding protein 1 (FAR-1) is lipid-binding protein that may be associated with modulation of host immune responses and provide insights into nematode pathogenicity to their hosts. However, the role of FAR-1 protein on parasitic nematodes remains unclear. Nippostrongylus brasiliensis was employed to identify the characteristics of Nb-far-1 gene, its expression patterns, ligand binding properties and the functions associated with it. The secretory Nb-FAR-1 protein was found to be highly expressed in N. brasiliensis ESPs and demonstrated affinity for fatty acids and retinol. Interference with Nb-far-1 gene expression resulted in a reduction in the formation of lipid droplets in L3s, a decrease in a rate of adult egg-shedding, egg hatchability, and larval development. Therefore, we proposed that N. brasiliensis Nb-FAR-1 protein may serve as a causative agent in nematode growth, development, and reproduction by regulating the level of lipids.
