Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium parasite genus transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Five different species are involved in human infection, and two of them have been largely studied, P. falciparum and P. vivax. However, within an eradication agenda in mind, the other three less explored species should not be neglected. In this study, we focused on the investigation of one of this species, P. malariae, for which little is known, mainly due to the lack of a continuous in vitro system and the frequency of co-infections with other species. Here, we studied the clinical manifestations of the infections, optimised a flow cytometry-based method aiming to decipher molecular interactions between the parasite and the red blood cells, the main parasite host-cell. Our results indicate that P. malariae might use different invasion pathways than other Plasmodium species, including the possibility of invading red blood cells of distinct maturities.
