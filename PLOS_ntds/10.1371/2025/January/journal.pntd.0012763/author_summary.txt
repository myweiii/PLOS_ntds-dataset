Our study delves into the intricate interplay between macrophages and Leishmania spp. infections, shedding light on how these parasites manipulate host cell metabolism. Despite variations in the mechanisms employed by different Leishmania species to evade immune responses, our findings reveal a striking similarity in their impact on host metabolic pathways. Infected macrophages consistently exhibit heightened energy metabolism, characterized by increased glycolysis and oxygen consumption rates, alongside alterations in mitochondrial function. Importantly, we demonstrate that targeting key metabolic pathways with drugs significantly affects parasite survival, offering promising avenues for therapeutic interventions against leishmaniasis. By elucidating these complex metabolic processes in a clear and accessible manner, our research not only deepens our understanding of host-parasite interactions but also holds significant implications for the development of novel treatment approaches. We aim to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and its broader implications for both scientists and non-scientists alike, advancing the fight against neglected tropical diseases.
