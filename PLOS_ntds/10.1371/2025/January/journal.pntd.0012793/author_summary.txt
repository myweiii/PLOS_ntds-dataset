Previous studies have mainly focused on the risk factors of death in SFTS patients. The mortality rate of SFTS in China has decreased from 10.58% to 5.07% over the past decade, therefore we pay more attention to the prognosis of SFTS patients who survive during convalescence. The recovery of PLT level during convalescence is one of the important indicators for measuring patient improvement, thus our study analyzed the predictors influencing PLT recovery during convalescence. In this study, we found that baseline PT, days from onset to admission, and PLT at baseline were independent risk factors affecting PLT recovery, which emphasized the importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment in SFTS patients. Our study provides evidence that early diagnosis and timely treatment contribute to improving the prognosis of SFTS patients, which can assist clinicians in the early screening of patients associated with a greater risk of adverse sequela and mortality in the future.
