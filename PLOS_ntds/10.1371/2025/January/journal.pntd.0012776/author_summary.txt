Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections found worldwide and can lead to significant long-lasting morbidity due to chronic joint pain. Although CHIKV vaccines are in development (with one recently receiving accelerated approval based on a surrogate end-point), the transmission patterns of CHIKV are unpredictable, presenting as explosive epidemics separated by variable interepidemic periods, making clinical trials difficult. In southern Thailand, we monitored acute febrile illnesses via an enhanced passive surveillance system from 2012 to 2019 and by combining molecular and serological methods, acute CHIKV was identified in 27.1% of 1466 individuals. These findings suggest persistent circulation of chikungunya in the region and that there may be unknown reservoirs or low-level transmission occurring outside of detected outbreaks.
