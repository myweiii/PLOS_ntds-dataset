The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is one of the largest global programs for neglected tropical disease elimination and since its formation, the number of lymphatic filariasis (LF) infections has been reduced by 74% globally. However, several countries including Samoa have reported persistent foci of LF transmission. For LF elimination to succeed, detecting and treating infected individuals is critical. Whilst point-of-care tests to detect filarial antigen (Ag) are recommended for use in LF elimination programs, there are concerns about their reduced sensitivity in some settings. Recent evidence suggests that anti-filarial antibody (Ab) markers could be more sensitive measures of transmission. In this study, we found that only 3.7% (n=117) of participants were Ag-positive, whilst 57.8% (n=1889) of participants tested positive to at least one Ab, suggesting a significant proportion of LF-seropositive participants would be missed if Ag testing alone was used. Of the three Ab seromarkers, Bm14 Ab had the highest area under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (0.88) to classify participants as Ag-positive. Furthermore, in this study we found that the average number needed to test (NNTestav) to identify one positive participant for all seromarkers was lower for all Abs compared to Ag, decreased as age increased, and was lower in suspected hotspots. Serosurveillance with Abs could provide a valuable additional monitoring tool for countries aiming for elimination. Our NNTestav results can help inform guidelines to target limited resources towards conducting surveillance among older individuals in suspected hotspots, thereby increasing the efficiency of surveys to identify residual foci of LF transmission.
