We would like to thank all the staff at the Samoa Ministry of Health who supported the many different aspects of the study. We sincerely thank Tautala Maula, the general secretary of the Samoa Red Cross, and her team for their enthusiastic and untiring support with fieldwork, village visits, and laboratory work; this survey would not have been possible without their hard work and dedication. We greatly appreciate all the support and advice provided by Rasul Baghirov and Lepaitai Hansell at the WHO country office in Samoa. We thank Patricia Graves for her assistance with data analysis and interpretation.
