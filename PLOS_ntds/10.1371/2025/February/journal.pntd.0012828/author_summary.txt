Biomphalaria straminea, an important intermediate host for the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, has invaded China since 1973. Here, our study explores the complex interplay of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping gut bacterial communities within B. straminea. We identify dominant gut microbiota and reveal the pronounced influence of stochastic processes from 118 samples, particularly during snail invasion and environmental adaptation. This research contributes new insights into the dynamics of gut microbial communities in freshwater gastropods, emphasizing the ecological impacts on host adaptation. With implications for controlling intermediate hosts and mitigating schistosomiasis transmission, our findings hold the potential for addressing this neglected tropical disease.
