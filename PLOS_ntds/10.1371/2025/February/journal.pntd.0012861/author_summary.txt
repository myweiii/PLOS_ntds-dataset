Chagas disease (CD) is a significant health issue in Paraguay, especially in the remote and resource-limited Chaco region. This disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is mainly spread by insects, and from mother to child, among others. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment; however, conventional serological techniques require highly specific and extensive training as well as specialized equipment, which are often unavailable in resource-limited settings. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer a practical solution as they are easy to use and provide quick results. In our study, we tested the diagnostic CD algorithm proposed by the Paraguayan National Clinical Guidelines for resource-limited areas, which combines the use of RDTs and traditional laboratory tests, in an indigenous community in the Chaco. We found that this approach was highly effective, with nearly perfect agreement with the reference algorithm. Our findings showed that 12.6% of the community members were infected with T. cruzi. We also identified infection-associated factors like age, ethnicity, and awareness of CD vectors. Our work confirms that the diagnostic algorithm recommended by Paraguayan health authorities is reliable and suitable for resource-constrained settings and further emphasizes the urgent need for targeted diagnosis and treatment programs in Chaco communities, which bear a heavy burden of CD.
