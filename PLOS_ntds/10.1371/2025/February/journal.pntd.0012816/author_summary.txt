In our study, we investigated the caterpillar Premolis semirufa, known as Pararama, which poses a health risk in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly for rubber tappers. Contact with its bristles can lead to Pararamosis, an inflammatory condition that may cause long-term joint issues similar to osteoarthritis. Currently, there are no specific treatments for Pararamosis, making it essential to understand how the caterpillarâ€™s venom affects human health. We focused on how extracts from its bristles influence human cartilage cells, which are crucial for joint function. We discovered that these extracts increase inflammatory markers in cartilage cells without significantly affecting their survival. This indicates that the bristles trigger an inflammatory response that could lead to joint damage over time. By examining these effects, we aim to provide insights into the mechanisms behind Pararamosis.
