Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, which can infect humans and animals. The disease is globally distributed, but most infections occur in livestock-dependent communities of low-resource settings. In this study, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to estimate production losses attributable to livestock brucellosis in northern and central regions of Tanzania. We obtained data on brucellosis prevalence and livestock production characteristics from several sources, including household surveys. We then analysed these data using a modelling approach that can estimate the difference in the value of livestock production (e.g., animals sold or slaughtered, milk produced) between the current situation of brucellosis presence and a hypothetical scenario of brucellosis absence. This difference in the value of livestock production was defined as production loss attributable to brucellosis. We found that brucellosis causes considerable production losses in the study area. In households that keep livestock as their primary means of subsistence, annual losses amounted to 4.4% of the income derived from livestock. However, there was significant heterogeneity in estimated losses across production systems and geographical areas. These results can help inform further research and guide the development of brucellosis control policies.
