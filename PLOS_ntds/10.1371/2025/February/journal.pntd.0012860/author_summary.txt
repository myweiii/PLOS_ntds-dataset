The adaptability of Aedes mosquitoes to diverse climatic and environmental conditions complicates their control, necessitating a deeper understanding of the factors driving their distribution to predict disease risk. This study examined the distribution of Aedes mosquitoes in Lagos State, Nigeria, using 98 occurrence points from eight Local Government Areas (LGAs), evenly divided between urban and rural regions. Ecological niche modeling with 23 variables revealed that precipitation and temperature during the coldest quarter were key drivers of distribution. Most LGAs were highly suitable for Aedes mosquitoes, with urban areas, high population density, and anthropogenic factors, such as tire accumulation and the presence of improperly disposed containers, contributing to increased larval habitat availability compared to rural areas. Both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were widespread but exhibited species partitioning. Additionally, some LGAs in Ogun State bordering Lagos were also highly suitable. These findings underscore the critical role of climatic and human factors in Aedes mosquito distribution, providing valuable insights for targeted disease prevention strategies in Lagos State.
