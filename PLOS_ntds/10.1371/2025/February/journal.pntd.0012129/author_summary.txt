The monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been found to increasingly infect humans across Southeast Asia via the bite of its anopheline mosquito vectors. Human infections with a similar monkey parasite, Plasmodium cynomolgi, have also been reported. The diagnostic tools commonly used to detect these malaria species are often unable to detect very low-level infections. We aimed to improve surveillance detection tools and blood sample collection methods to detect these zoonotic malaria species and understand the extent of transmission and the burden of disease. This study validated and compared the use of molecular laboratory assays targeting these species. We found that with the use of reverse transcription, large improvements in the limit of detection were possible, by up to 10,000-fold for initial malaria screening, and up to 2759-fold for specific P. knowlesi detection. Findings from this study support the use of ultrasensitive detection tools to improve surveillance approaches to emerging zoonotic malaria species.
