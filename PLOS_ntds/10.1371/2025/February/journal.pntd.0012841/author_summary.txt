Soil-transmitted helminthiases, such as trichuriasis, predominantly affect children in tropical regions with inadequate sanitation. These infections, caused by whipworms, damage the intestinal tissue, disrupt the balance of microbiota, cause bacterial translocation, and trigger immune responses with significant health consequences. Our study focuses on understanding the progression of the infection – from the ingestion of infective eggs and the initiation of mucosal damages (acute phase) to the establishment of chronic infection - particularly highlighting how the parasite facilitates bacterial invasion through damaged tissue. Using advanced techniques that integrate immunology experiments, 3D imaging, and animation, we explore the early stages of infection and demonstrate how the parasite’s movements and attachment mechanisms enable bacteria to cross the intestinal barrier. Additionally, we emphasize the potential of 3D models in enhancing the understanding of host-parasite interactions in large-volume biological sample. These models allow students and educators to visualize complex biological processes in a more engaging way and provide inclusive learning opportunities for visually impaired individuals, fostering greater accessibility in science education. By shedding light on the intricate interactions among neglected parasites, bacteria, and the host immune system, our research advances knowledge in parasitology and suggests new avenues for developing strategies to combat these often-neglected diseases.
