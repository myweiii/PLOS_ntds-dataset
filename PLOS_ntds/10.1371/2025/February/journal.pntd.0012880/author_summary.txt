Dengue is a viral disease spread by Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions with over 40% of the worldâ€™s population considered at-risk of infection. Traditional methods of assessing prior dengue infection can be costly and invasive (e.g., blood draw) which are impractical for population-based surveillance or large field-based studies. Whole blood collected via a finger-prick is an alternative option for measuring past infection by identifying antibodies using serological methods. This study compared two methods of blood sample collection for the purpose of identifying previously infected individuals: a serum sample collected by venipuncture vs. a dried blood spot sample collected by finger-prick. Study nurses collected both types of samples from each research participant and they were analyzed in a laboratory for the presence of antibodies from a prior dengue infection. Results of the laboratory analyses between the two different types of samples were very similar. This suggests that the simple dried blood spot (DBS) approach can be used with reasonable validity in similar study populations to evaluate prior dengue infection.
