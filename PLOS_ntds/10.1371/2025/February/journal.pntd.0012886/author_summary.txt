Dengue fever is a significant public health threat in many parts of the world, including Latin America. Understanding the seroprevalence of dengue virus antibodies in specific populations helps gauge exposure levels and inform public health decisions. In this study, we conducted a population-based probabilistic survey to estimate the seroprevalence of dengue virus antibodies among adults in Buenos Aires, Argentina, just before a major outbreak in early 2024. We found a moderate level of exposure to the dengue virus, with marked differences across various social and demographic groups within the city. Notably, younger individuals, females, and residents of slums were more likely to have been exposed to the virus. Despite the moderate seroprevalence, our findings indicate that the levels are still below those typically considered necessary for mass vaccination campaigns. These results emphasize the need for regular seroprevalence surveys to monitor the burden of disease and adjust public health strategies accordingly. Our study contributes to a better understanding of dengue epidemiology in urban settings and highlights the importance of localized data in managing and controlling dengue outbreaks.
