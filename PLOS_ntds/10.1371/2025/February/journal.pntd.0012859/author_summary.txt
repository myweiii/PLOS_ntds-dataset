Whole-genome sequencing is pivotal in unraveling the complexities of viral evolution, genomic epidemiology, and the transmission dynamics of emerging infectious agents. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers a portable and cost-effective platform that has become invaluable for virological studies. Orthohantavirus hantanense (HTNV), the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), represents a significant global public health concern. In the Republic of Korea (ROK), HTNV outbreaks are especially prevalent in the Gyeonggi and Gangwon Provinces, where the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) serves as the primary reservoir host. To obtain high-fidelity genomic data, an advanced amplicon-based nanopore sequencing method was developed, utilizing the latest R10 chemistry and KU-ONT-HTNV-consensus modules. This approach led to the generation of 15 complete HTNV genomes from rodents. These advancements have substantially improved the spatiotemporal genomic surveillance of HTNV, facilitating high-resolution phylogeographic and epidemiological analyses, and deepening our understanding of viral phylodynamics. This report provides valuable insights into nanopore-based diagnostics, genomic surveillance, and the evolutionary history of orthohantaviruses, all of which are essential for formulating effective control strategies against HFRS in endemic regions of the ROK.
