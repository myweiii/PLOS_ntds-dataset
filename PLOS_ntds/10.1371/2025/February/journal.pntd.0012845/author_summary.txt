The puff adder is a medically important snake species found across much of Africa, yet the signs and symptoms of patients presenting with a puff adder bite have not been extensively described. We described the signs and symptoms of patients who were admitted with a puff adder bite in two primary healthcare facilities in Kenya and identified further published cases from the literature with sufficient details of the clinical presentation. Between December 2020 and September 2021, of the 15 patients admitted with a diagnosis of a puff adder bite at the Chemolingot and Mwingi sub-county hospitals, pain, swelling and haemorrhage were most common, while coagulopathy, blistering and shock were less common. From the 23 studies which described signs and symptoms from 37 patients, swelling and pain were most common, while hypotension, fever, and anaemia were less common. It was easier to objectively identify the biting snake after bites by a captive snake than after a bite in the community, and complications like amputations and hypotension followed the same pattern. Our study describes the common and less common clinical features of puff adder envenoming, but further clinical research incorporating serial laboratory assays of patients with definitively identified puff adder bites is crucial to better understand the pathophysiology of envenoming by this medically important snake species.
