Soil-transmitted helminthiasis, a widespread neglected tropical disease, affects over 1.5 billion people globally. This disease is caused by Trichuris trichiura, hookworms, and Ascaris lumbricoides. Moderate to heavy infections can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dysentery, and if untreated, can result in serious complications like anemia, chronic malnutrition, and developmental delays. Our research compared the diagnostic performance of the traditional microscope based Kato-Katz technique versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detecting soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). We tested these diagnostic methods in a framework of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of a new treatment, emodepside, against T. trichiura and hookworm infections. qPCR proved to be more sensitive than Kato-Katz in detecting STH infections, especially for A. lumbricoides. Although qPCR showed lower cure rates for both treatments compared to Kato-Katz, it confirmed that emodepside was highly efficacious against all STHs. In summary, our study confirmed that qPCR is a sensitive diagnostic tool for STH infections, ensuring a more effective disease management.
