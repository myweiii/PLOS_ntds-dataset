    "Background": "Flavivirus infections pose a significant global health burden, highlighting the need for safe and effective vaccination strategies. Co-administration of different vaccines, including licensed flavivirus vaccines, is commonly practiced providing protection against multiple pathogens while also saving time and reducing visits to healthcare units. However, how co-administration of different flavivirus vaccines de facto affects immunogenicity, particularly with respect to T cell responses, is only partially understood.",
    "Methods and findings": "Antigen-specific T cell responses were assessed in study participants enrolled in a previously conducted open-label, non-randomized clinical trial. In the trial, vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), or yellow fever virus (YFV) were administered either individually or concomitantly in different combinations in healthy study participants. Peripheral blood samples were collected before vaccination and at multiple time points afterward. To analyze antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, PBMCs were stimulated with overlapping peptide pools from TBEV, JEV, YFV, and Zika virus (ZIKV) envelope (E), capsid (C), and non-structural protein 5 (NS5) viral antigens. A flow cytometry-based activation-induced marker (AIM) assay was used to quantify antigen-specific T cell responses. The results revealed remarkably similar frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, regardless of whether vaccines were administered individually or concomitantly. In addition, administering the vaccines in the same or different upper arms did not markedly affect T cell responses. Finally, limited cross-reactivity was observed between the TBEV, JEV, and YFV vaccines, and related ZIKV-specific antigens.",
    "Conclusions": "TBEV or JEV vaccines can be co-administered with the live attenuated YFV vaccine without any markedly altered antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the respective flaviviruses. Additionally, the vaccines can be delivered in the same or different upper arms without any significant altered influence on the T cell response. From a broader perspective, these results provide valuable insights into the outcome of immune responses following simultaneous administration of different vaccines for different but related pathogens."
