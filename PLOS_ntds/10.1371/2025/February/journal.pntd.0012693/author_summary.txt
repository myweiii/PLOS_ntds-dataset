Why was this study done?

The World Health Organization recently declared a global initiative to control arboviral diseases. Many of these are caused by pathogenic flaviviruses, most transmitted byÂ mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors such as ticks.
Vaccination is a key intervention for diseases caused by flaviviruses.
Co-administration of different vaccines, including currently licensed flavivirus vaccines, is commonly practiced.
Co-administration of vaccines saves time and reduces the number of visits to healthcare facilities and vaccine clinics.
Cellular immune responses have not been thoroughly evaluated upon co-administration of currently licensed flavivirus vaccines, including yellow fever virus (YFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccines.


What did the researchers find?

The magnitude and specificity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to virus-specific antigens remained largely unaltered by the concomitant delivery of the studied flavivirus vaccines.
Concomitant delivery of vaccines in the same or different upper arms of the study participants had minimal impact on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.


What do these findings mean?

The studied vaccines maintained distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity across their respective viral antigens without generating any marked cross-reactivity to each other or ZIKV-antigens, with exception for some signs of CD8+ T cell cross reactivity.
Along with recently published data from the present study cohort, co-administration of three commonly used current licensed flavivirus vaccines is feasible without increasing the risk of adverse events or significantly affecting the development of either neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) or T cell responses against the respective viral antigens.
