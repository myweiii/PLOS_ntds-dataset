Cryptococcal meningitis, an infection of the brain, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is a major contributor to death among people with advanced HIV disease, with CD4+ T cells less than 100 cells/mm3. In cryptococcal meningitis it is unknown how CSF white blood cells compare to CSF immune responses, fungal burden, and patients’ survival. We determined the relationship between levels of CSF immune responses, CSF fungal burden, and CSF white blood cells at the time of diagnosis with 18-week survival. Subjects who died within 18-weeks of diagnosis had lower levels of interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL-2 and IL-17A) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and chemokine (CXCL10) and higher fungal burden compared with survivors. Numbers of CSF white blood cells showed a positive association with CSF immune response and patient survival. However, these observations were negatively associated with CSF fungal burden. These findings are unique and provide new insights into the immunopathology of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and fatal outcomes. The results suggest immune-based approaches to improve patients’ survival.
