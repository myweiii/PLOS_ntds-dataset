    "Abstract": "In China, health education served as the primary method for controlling schistosomiasis and had significantly contributed to the management of schistosomiasis epidemics. In contrast, university students who lived/studied in schistosomiasis-endemic areas were often in the risk zone for schistosomiasis infection as part of their social practice and leisure activities. Thus, the risk of schistosomiasis transmission remained widespread and chronic. This study will conduct a survey and analyzed schistosomiasis awareness among university students in colleges and universities in endemic areas. The aim was to optimize intervention strategies once transmission had been interrupted. Students from two colleges and universities in the city of Gongqingcheng on Lake Poyang were selected and asked to complete a questionnaire via the online platform Questionnaire Star- The survey assessed exposure to snail-infested water, knowledge about schistosomiasis, and preferences for health education methods among students who had traveled to snail breeding areas. The survey took place from April 2 to April 4, 2024. The survey results showed that of the 4,847 respondents (49% male, 51% female), 53.8% reported exposure to snail-infested environments near their schools, and 38.4% had direct contact with snail-infested water. Of these, with those who dug for wild vegetables exposed significantly more nonendemic than endemic students to snail water (13.93% vs. 8.42%, χ2 = 16.681, P = 0.000). Awareness of schistosomiasis was low (31.08%), with limited knowledge about transmission (30.58%) and symptoms (42.91%). Of these, students from endemic areas were significantly more aware of transmission and symptoms than those from nonendemic areas (36.52% vs. 27.22%, χ2 = 7.623, P = 0.006 & 50.17% vs. 38.80%, χ2 = 9.872, P = 0.002). Preferred education methods included mobile multimedia (72.75%), brochures (68.68%), and physical promotional items (66.58%). In general, the overall awareness of schistosomiasis among university students remained low. There was a need to enhance health education in schools to improve disease prevention awareness within this population."
