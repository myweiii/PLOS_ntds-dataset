Schistosomiasis remains a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Although Chinaâ€™s schistosomiasis epidemic is at a very low level, the risk of infection still exists, and health education for schistosomiasis control in the new situation still has blind spots, especially for the entire health education for the mobile population has not yet been carried out. Among them, university students who live/study in schistosomiasis-endemic areas are often at risk of schistosomiasis infection due to social practices and leisure activities. In order to identify possible blind spots in schistosomiasis health education and promotion in the process of schistosomiasis elimination, we will conduct a survey and analyse the awareness of schistosomiasis among university students enrolled in colleges and universities in the infected areas. Our survey revealed a serious lack of knowledge about schistosomiasis control among university students. At the same time, it was found that, given the high level of internet access among university students, online health education can be used to raise awareness of schistosomiasis prevention among the university student population. This will provide a scientific basis for optimal intervention strategies for schistosomiasis health education and promotion following the interruption of transmission.
