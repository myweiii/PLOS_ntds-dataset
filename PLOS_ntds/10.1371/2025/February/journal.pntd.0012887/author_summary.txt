Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) is the causative agent of neglected tropical disease yaws. This bacterium infects humans in endemic regions in Africa, southern Asia and the Pacific region, and NHPs in Sub-Saharan Africa. The infection manifests as papillomas and/or ulcers, and can progress into deformation of bone and cartilage if untreated. Yaws is targeted by the currently ongoing second yaws eradication campaign, known as the Morges strategy, led by World Health Organization (WHO). In this work, we studied the transmission of the yaws bacterium in wild populations of NHPs, as they could serve as a possible source of reinfection of humans in the future, post-yaws eradication in humans. We have determined eleven whole TPE genomes from NHPs from different national parks in Tanzania. Together with previously determined genomes, we have analyzed 22 sequences, and we found a high degree of genetic similarity in samples isolated from different NHP species. This similarity is consistent with inter-species transmission of TPE among NHPs.
