Despite the control measures implemented in Brazilian Indigenous Lands, the prevalence of intestinal parasites continues to vary from moderate (> 20% and < 50%) to high (â‰¥ 50%) in its inhabitants. The number of indigenous people residing in Brazil has been increasing over the last few decades, including in the South region of the country, where a much smaller proportion of indigenous people reside compared to the North region. Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum are the most prevalent helminth parasites in humans and pigs, respectively. The occurrence of cross-infection and hybridization between human and pig Ascaris has been investigated in order to propose more effective control measures. In this study, we used parasitological and molecular methods to verify the presence of these parasites in fecal samples from schoolchildren and pigs, in addition to soil samples, from a Guarani indigenous village in the state of ParanÃ¡, southern Brazil. Genetic material from A. lumbricoides and A. suum, individually, was detected in humans and pigs respectively, and the soil, and hybrid and/or Ascaris spp. was found in both hosts and soil samples, indicating the occurrence of transmission of hybrids and/or both species in these populations. Control measures aimed at the correct disposal of human and animal feces must be implemented to minimize damage to health and prevent new infections.
