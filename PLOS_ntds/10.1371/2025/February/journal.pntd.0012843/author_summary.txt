As one of the most lethal viral neglected tropical diseases in human history, Ebola virus disease typically causes organ damage, high fever, internal bleeding, and diarrhea with a high transmission rate and a case fatality rate between 50 and 90%. Traditional mathematical models neglect to incorporate the spatial variation of Ebola pathogens to reveal its potential outbreak source and sink areas. In addition, previous studies mainly regard EVD as an infectious disease to predict its distribution change, but rarely consider specific transmission process of the virus, resulting in sudden and rapid predictions with relatively low accuracy. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to spatiotemporally investigate the ecological adaptability of Ebola virus and its response to different environmental factors by proposing an integrated model. We found that Ebola habitats show significant differences in regional distribution. Temperature seasonality and population density might significantly influence the ecological adaptability of Ebola. Our findings can provide scientific support for practical prevention and control of future Ebola outbreaks in potential risk area.
