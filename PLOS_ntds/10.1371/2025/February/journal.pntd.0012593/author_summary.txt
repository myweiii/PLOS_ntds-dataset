Buruli ulcer (BU) is a slow-growing skin infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. A new type of research study, called the Mycobacterium ulcerans Controlled Human Infection Model (MuCHIM), involves deliberately infecting consenting adult volunteers and treating them quickly. This approach could help us learn more about BU and test vaccines (or other preventative measures) and treatments. This study asked for the opinions of people connected to BU in Victoria, Australia. We invited adults living near BU-affected areas (but who had not had BU themselves), doctors who treat patients with BU, young adults who have had a small, treated BU, and advocates who have publicly shared their own personal BU experience. Participants reviewed a summary of the MuCHIM research plan and then joined focus groups on Zoom. We analysed and summarised their discussions. Participants saw the research as valuable but emphasised the need for clear, honest communication. They wanted potential volunteers to fully understand what the study involves, how it might affect their lives, and the possible risks, including the ‘worst-case’ scenario. Suggestions included using images and stories from real BU patients to help understand the study. Participants also shared their thoughts on who might volunteer for such research. This feedback will guide how we explain risks and expectations to future MuCHIM study participants.
