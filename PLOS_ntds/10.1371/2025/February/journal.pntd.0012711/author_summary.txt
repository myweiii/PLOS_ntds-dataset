Melioidosis is a potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is commonly found in soil and water in tropical regions. Both animals and humans can become infected through direct contact with contaminated sources, and the disease is endemic in countries like Laos, Thailand, and northern Australia. However, there is limited knowledge about its spread among animals, especially in Laos. This study focused on mapping the geographical distribution and seroprevalence (the presence of antibodies) of B. pseudomallei in livestock in Laos. Serum samples from buffalo, cattle, and swine were collected from slaughterhouses and tested for antibodies against B. pseudomallei. Our findings revealed that B. pseudomallei exposure was widespread among livestock, with cattle showing the highest seroprevalence, followed by buffalo and swine. The highest rates of exposure were found in the southern provinces, especially Savannakhet, which shares a border with northeastern Thailand. These results suggest that livestock could serve as indicators of human risk for melioidosis and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and monitoring of the disease in both animals and humans. The study provides valuable data to support future efforts in preventing, detecting, and managing melioidosis in Laos.
