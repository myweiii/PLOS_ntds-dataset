Schistosomiasis orchestrates profound regulation by/of the host immune responses. Given the core role of the gut microbiome in regulating the human immune responses at the systemic level, and the increasingly recognized potential of this host component in biomarking for the identification, monitoring, prevention and treatment of several diseases, we questioned whether the human gut microbiome shows patterns of alterations during schistosomiasis that could robustly inform novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches.
After systematically scrutinizing all available reports in the literature on the gut microbiome dynamics during schistosomiasis in humans so far, available evidences pointed at pathognomonic changes in human gut microbiomes following schistosomiasis infection, progression as pathology develops and treatment. Despite the fact that evidences from most of these studies are not yet definitive i.e. hardly controlled for poly-infections, for diet-driven alterations or for robustness of the observed signatures in large longitudinal studies, some of the gut microbial changes observed so far presented significantly and repeatedly in several individuals and at times in independent studies. This indicates here an exploitable potential for the gut microbiome that warrants more comprehensive and controlled studies to unequivocally identify diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic gut microbial biomarkers during human schistosomiasis.
