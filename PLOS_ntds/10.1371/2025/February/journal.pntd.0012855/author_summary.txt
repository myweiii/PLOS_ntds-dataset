Toxoplasma gondii is a widely distributed parasite that infects many people around the world. Its infection is linked to behavioral and metabolic disorders and can lead to serious health complications, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. In this study, we investigate how the parasite infects the intestine in the early days of infection and begins to spread within the gut in mice. We focus on the dormant form of the parasite, known as bradyzoites, and examine when they transform into the actively replicating tachyzoite stage within mouse intestines. Our in vivo data reveal that T. gondii primarily replicates in the intestinal stroma during early infection. To further understand this process, we used microphysiological systems to model intestinal infection in humans. This innovative approach allowed us to track the conversion between parasite stages and their subsequent dissemination. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between the host and the parasite, demonstrating the potential of microphysiological systems to uncover critical aspects of T. gondii infection. This research enhances our understanding of how this parasite spreads in humans and may inform future strategies for prevention and treatment.
