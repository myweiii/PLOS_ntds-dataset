The Azraq Syrian refugee camp in Jordan is home to a vulnerable population living under challenging conditions, making it difficult to manage the COVID-19 pandemic effectively. Our study examined the spread and impact of COVID-19 within this camp from August 2020 to August 2022. We collected and analyzed data on the residents’ demographics, health risks, testing, and vaccination status. We found that COVID-19 spread less rapidly in the camp than in the general Jordanian population, with the monthly infection rate decreasing over time. Women and older residents were particularly affected, with the elderly experiencing the most severe cases. While most patients were treated at home, some required hospitalization, especially those who were older or had underlying health conditions. Vaccination played a crucial role in managing the pandemic, with nearly one-third of the camp’s population receiving the vaccine. Our findings emphasize the need for ongoing health monitoring, tailored medical interventions, and increased vaccination efforts to protect vulnerable communities like those in refugee camps from current and future health crises.
