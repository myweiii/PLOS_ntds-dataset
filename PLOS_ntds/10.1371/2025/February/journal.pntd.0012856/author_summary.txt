The establishment of Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait Islands poses an ongoing challenge to dengue control in these islands. Additionally, these mosquitoes threaten to spread to mainland Australia. Baseline data on fructose prevalence in Ae. albopictus were thereby collected to ascertain the potential of attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) to control Ae. albopictus populations and to mitigate both the risk of local dengue transmission and the spread of Ae. albopictus to mainland Australia. Using sweep net sampling, 6,186 Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were collected on the Hammond and Yorke Islands. Of these, 24–46% of males and 24–32% of females harboured detectable fructose, averaging 62.9 µg fructose per sugar positive mosquito. The abundance, fructose prevalence and fructose content of Ae. albopictus differed by mosquito sex and collection times. The fructose prevalence observed were comparable to those in vector populations that were significantly reduced by ATSBs elsewhere.
