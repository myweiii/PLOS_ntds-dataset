Dengue and Zika are closely related viruses carried by mosquitos which affect over 100 million people worldwide each year. Recovery from infection by one type produces immunity against that type, but makes later infections with other types of those viruses more severe, due to complicated immune system interactions. Vaccination against dengue can produce the same effect. This study estimates the average cost and disease burden for each case, in ten countries where these viruses spread, in order to understand how dengue vaccination and these immune interactions change the effects of an outbreak of both dengue and Zika. These estimates find that the immune interactions increase the direct impact of a dengue infection by a factor of 2â€“16 times, and the impact of a Zika infection by more than 100. Dengue vaccination increases the impact of a Zika case, has only a small effect on the impact of a dengue case when most people have already been infected by that type of dengue virus, and greatly reduces the impact of a dengue case when most people have been exposed to a different type of dengue virus than the one currently spreading.
