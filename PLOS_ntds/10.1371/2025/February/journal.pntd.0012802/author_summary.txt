When GPELF started, between 5 to 6 effective rounds of MDA covering at least 65% of the endemic population was thought to be sufficient to halt LF disease transmission. The pre-Transmission Assessment Survey (pre-TAS), was the standardized method of LF prevalence testing adopted by the WHO. The Alere Filarial Test Strip (FTS) used in LF prevalence testing is known to detect low concentrations of CFA and therefore may likely detect persisting residual CFA following the death of the adult worms. Studies have indicated an increased risk of pre-TAS failure when the FTS Alere kit is used to assess treatment impact on antigenemia levels among adults in sentinel sites with <1% MF prevalence. This was a 1 to 5-year follow-up study which assessed the impact of time and Ivermectin/Albendazole intake on LF antigenemia seroreversion/seroconversion in individuals who had previously tested either positive or negative to the FTS. The results of this study indicated that a large percentage (91%) of the previously CFA positive participants had become CFA negative without intake of additional ivermectin/Albendazole. In addition, there was no CFA seroconversion in all the previously CFA negative participants. Time (years of follow-up) had significant impact and influence on FTS antigenemia seroreversion.
