The knowledge acquired regarding the high prevalence of several arboviruses present in the world, some of which spread rapidly to various regions of the planet, generating coexistence and coinfections, demonstrates the importance of a better understanding of the impact that each of them has on the health of infected individuals. In this scenario, differential diagnosis becomes an essential factor for the correct treatment of the signs and symptoms presented. Therefore, with this study we sought to expand knowledge about the epidemiology and clinical manifestations present in arboviruses, highlighting the Chikungunya Virus as one of the most prevalent and symptomatic arboviruses.
The results of this study aim to expand the epidemiological surveillance of Chikungunya fever by contributing to the better identification of clinical signs and symptoms, identifying its chronic phase and assisting in the differential diagnosis for other arboviruses with similar performance, such as infection by the Dengue and Zika viruses.
