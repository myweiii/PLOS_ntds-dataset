    "Introduction": "The aim of this systematic review of prevalence is to observe and discuss the clinical manifestations of Chikungunya Virus disease in its chronic phase.",
    "Methods": "To be eligible, the observational studies should accompany the individuals for at least six months. The research was conducted using electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE. The methodological quality was evaluated using the “Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence data” tool.",
    "Results": "The search has found 175 articles. The application of the inclusion criteria defined a total of 29 selected studies. From the included studies, only one did not present arthralgia as a prevalent symptom in the chronic phase. Other signs and symptoms observed were: fatigue; sleep disorders; myalgia; skin lesions; depression; digestive disorders.",
    "Conclusion": "Because it is an often incapacitating symptom, arthralgia can affect the individuals’ quality of life, with implications in their social and work life. Since the chronic phase is common in infected individuals, all levels of health care should be prepared to monitor, in the medium to long term, the patients affected by this condition."
