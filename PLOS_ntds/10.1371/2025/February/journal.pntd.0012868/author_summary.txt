Loiasis, endemic in Central Africa, presents with clinical complications including Calabar swellings (CS) which are transient angioedemas, Eyeworm (EW) which is the migration of adult worms under the eye conjunctiva, arthralgia, and pruritus. In a 13-month study of 991 individuals in loiasis-endemic areas, arthralgia had the highest incidence rate (555.2 cases per 1000 Person-Years), followed by pruritus, absences, EW, and CS. Notably, rates were elevated in those who experienced EW episodes. EW occurrence is more frequent in individuals with microfilaremia. Absences from work are more frequent in those with a significant history of EW or arthralgia. CS occurrences are more frequent in individuals with a significant history of pruritus, arthralgia, or EW.
