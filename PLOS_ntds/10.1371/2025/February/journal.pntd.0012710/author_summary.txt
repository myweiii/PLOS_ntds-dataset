Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by skin infections by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an organism related to causative pathogens of tuberculosis and leprosy. The disease is endemic to parts of Central and West Africa but is also found in Australia, Japan and some other countries. While mortality is low, morbidity caused by extensive and unsightly ulceration of the skin is high. There currently is no vaccine against Buruli ulcer and all previous attempts to develop one have been unsuccessful.
Here we developed a vaccine formulation termed ‘Burulivac’ that incorporates three M. ulcerans antigens, two of which are proteins and the third the mycolactone toxin, much responsible for the pathology of the BU disease. Our rationale was that in a vaccine setting and using a controlled dose of the toxin, we could calibrate the immune responses to selected antigens, so that they mimic those induced during natural infection. Using an experimental mouse footpad model of infection, we demonstrate that immunisation with Burulivac completely prevented ulceration in the mouse footpad over an extended 14-weeks period of observation, and that this correlated with elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10. We propose that Burulivac is a promising vaccine candidate that merits further testing and development.
