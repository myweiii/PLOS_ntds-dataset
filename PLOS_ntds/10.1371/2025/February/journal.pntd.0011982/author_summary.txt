Livestock production is a cornerstone of the Moroccan economy, but infectious diseases, particularly bovine tuberculosis (bTB), pose significant risks to animal health, and food safety. Predominantly caused by Mycobacterium bovis, bTB leads to substantial economic losses and an underestimated human health burden through zoonotic transmission. Previous research indicated possible M. bovis transmission links between Morocco and Southern Europe, though methodological limitations hindered conclusive findings. Here, we utilized whole genome sequencing to analyze the genetic diversity of the first 55 M. bovis genomes from Morocco, comparing them with a large dataset of 725 sequences from 36 countries, including cattle, wildlife, and human samples.
 Our findings revealed two new M. bovis spoligotypes in Morocco and classified Moroccan clonal complexes as European or Unknown, suggesting the Sahara Desert limits transmission between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, we identified close genetic relationships between M. bovis from Morocco and strains from Spain, France, Portugal, Germany, and humans in Italy, Germany, and the UK, implying that animal trade and human migration might be contributing to disease spread.
This study, benefiting from a comprehensive dataset, underscores the need for further research on animal and zoonotic TB transmission to inform effective control measures at the animal-human interface.
