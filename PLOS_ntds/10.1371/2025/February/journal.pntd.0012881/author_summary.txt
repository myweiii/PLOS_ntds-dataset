Water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions are often implemented with the goal of improving child growth and development, but we lack information on what determines which children can benefit most from these interventions. Frequent infection, gut inflammation, and systemic inflammation may limit the effectiveness of nutrition interventions by preventing children from using nutrients effectively. On the other hand, water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions may prevent infections and thereby reduce inflammation. We sought to evaluate the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions on child growth if these interventions were assigned based on biological markers of infection and inflammation. We found that children with Campylobacter infection and high myeloperoxidase (a measure of gut inflammation) experienced the greatest effect of the interventions on growth. These findings support the role of infection and inflammation in determining the effectiveness of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions in improving child growth.
