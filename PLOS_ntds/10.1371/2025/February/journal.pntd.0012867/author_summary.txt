Cholera is a major global health concern that causes high morbidity. It is a bacterial water-borne disease that can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route or the ingestion of contaminated water. Hence, both population mobility and environmental exposure can promote cholera persistence. The primary tools to prevent cholera include vaccination and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) improvements. The effectiveness of these interventions is well understood in epidemic settings, but their impact in endemic settings is unclear. Achieving cholera elimination requires disentangling the contributors to transmission, specifically population mobility and aquatic reservoirs, and assessing the impact of interventions performed in endemic settings.
This study focuses on Kalemie, a cholera endemic city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on shore of a lake that serves as a potential environmental reservoir. It quantifies the short-term impact of an intervention that used targeted vaccination and WASH. The study shows that the impact of vaccination was dampened by very high background immunity due to constant environmental exposure. This suggests that WASH improvements should be the primary intervention in such settings despite the time- and resource-intensive nature of implementation.
