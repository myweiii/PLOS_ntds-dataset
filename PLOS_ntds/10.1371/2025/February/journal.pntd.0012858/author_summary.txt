Burkina Faso is endemic for schistosomiasis in all health districts and has been conducting mass treatment with praziquantel at the district level in the last two decades, targeting school-aged children regularly and at-risk adults where prevalence was high. We conducted an impact assessment in 16 health districts in 2023–2024 to assess the current epidemiological situation and provide evidence to adjust treatment strategies at the sub-district level. Children aged 5–14 years were selected randomly from 320 schools. Urine samples were tested for urogenital schistosomiasis using urine filtration and for microhaematuria using Haemastix urinalysis reagent strips. Stool samples were tested for intestinal schistosomiasis using Kato-Katz. The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 2.4% in 16 health districts, with the overall prevalence of infection with heavy intensity at 0.9%. The prevalence of microhaematuria was 5.8%. The results showed good progress in eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem in the 16 health districts after two decades of mass treatment. There were, however, some hotspots of infection, as seven health areas in five health districts had an overall prevalence of >10%, and a total of 29 health areas had a prevalence of infection with heavy intensity above the 1% threshold for elimination as a public health problem. The results provide evidence for planning targeted sub-district-level treatment.
