P. vivax establishes infection in humans using its DBP which binds to the DARC receptor on host erythrocytes. A single point mutation in the DARC promoter region results in Duffy negative phenotype. This phenotype results in lower infection success of P. vivax and can explain the heterogeneity in the global geographic distribution of P. vivax. Here, we investigated the association between Duffy genotypes, CNV of PvDBP, and level of parasitemia using 435 P. vivax isolates from five different endemicities in Ethiopia. The results revealed that the majority of P. vivax infections do occur in Duffy positive individuals. This explains the high prevalence of P. vivax in Ethiopia. The high prevalence of multi-copy PvDBP along with the high rate of Duffy positivity explains the transmission success of P. vivax in the country, where the majority of the population are Duffy positive. The lower parasitemia levels among the Duffy-negatives, despite small samples, may signify an “undetected silent reservoir”.
