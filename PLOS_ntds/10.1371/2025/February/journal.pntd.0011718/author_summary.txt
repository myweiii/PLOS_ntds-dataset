Building on the findings of a previous small-scale operational study and formative phase, this study involved implementing an intervention to integrate the prevention, diagnosis, management and reporting of four common NTDs — trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and podoconiosis — into Ethiopia’s primary healthcare system. The intervention consisted of providing health workers with adapted job aids, supportive supervision and improved diagnostic and medical supplies to facilitate NTD diagnosis, management, and reporting. It was implemented for six months in one hospital, one health centre and five health posts in Damot Gale district, Ethiopia and the feasibility, acceptability and cost-effectiveness were evaluated. Results indicate feasibility, as the capacity of all enrolled health facilities for detecting, managing, and recording target NTDs improved over time. Furthermore, the use of intervention materials by health workers also increased over time. The intervention tools proved to be highly acceptable to health workers who viewed them as helpful, relevant, and easy to use. The findings further highlight that providing a package of interventions to support integration can be a cost-effective method and that the integration and scale of NTD interventions at the primary healthcare level in Ethiopia should be considered.
