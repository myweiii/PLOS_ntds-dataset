This is an interview-based investigation of patient awareness, experience, and individual challenges for adults and caregivers of children seeking diagnosis and effective care for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in rural districts of Bihar, India. Patients’ descriptions of their health experiences revealed obstacles at every stage, including limited information about the illness at the community level, financial burdens associated with loss of work, and cost of travel to seek diagnosis. Although our study was subject to recall bias, it elicited insights from the patients’ own experiences and revealed deterrents and burdens that may not have been visible otherwise. Our study also explored patient and caregiver interest in a potential oral treatment for VL. This patient-centric approach of identifying unmet needs and potential gaps in public health access could be useful in furthering the aims of the National Elimination Program for VL in India and in other areas with endemic VL, particularly those planning to introduce elimination programs.
