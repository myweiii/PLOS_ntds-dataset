In this study, we used AFADESI-MSI technology to investigate the variations in metabolite abundance in the liver during acute and chronic S. japonicum infection and the effects of PZQ treatment on the liver metabolism of schistosomiasis-infected mice. We aimed to identify and visualize alterations in liver-related metabolites at a spatially detailed metabolic level and map the distribution patterns of these metabolites within the egg granuloma region. The differentially abundant metabolites and metabolic pathways identified were compared and analyzed, It was found that the disturbance of uridine metabolism was a significant metabolic pathway in the course of infection and was related to lipid metabolism. In addition, focusing on the mechanism of lipid reprogramming and cell activation induced by the disturbance of uridine metabolism in hepatic stellate cells. This study not only increases our understanding of the metabolic disorders in the liver during the development of schistosomiasis-related liver disease but also highlights the importance of the disturbance of uridine metabolism in the development of liver fibrosis and pinpoints important candidate metabolites for future drug development.
