    "Abstract": "To sustain the gonotrophic cycle, the Aedes aegypti mosquito must acquire a blood meal from a human or other vertebrate host. However, in the process of blood feeding, the mosquito may facilitate the transmission of several bloodborne viral pathogens (e.g., dengue, Zika, and chikungunya). The blood meal is essential as it contains proteins that are digested into polypeptides and amino acid nutrients that are eventually used for egg production. These proteins are digested by several midgut proteolytic enzymes. As such, the female mosquitoâ€™s reliance on blood may serve as a potential target for vector and viral transmission control. However, this strategy may prove to be challenging since midgut proteolytic activity is a complex process dependent on several exo- and endo-proteases. Therefore, to understand the complexity of Ae. aegypti blood meal digestion, we used Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) to generate global proteolytic profiles of sugar- and blood-fed midgut tissue extracts, along with substrate profiles of recombinantly expressed midgut proteases. Our results reveal a shift from high exoproteolytic activity in sugar-fed mosquitoes to an expressive increase in endoproteolytic activity in blood-fed mosquitoes. This approach allowed for the identification of 146 cleaved peptide bonds (by the combined 6 h and 24 h blood-fed samples) in the MSP-MS substrate library, and of these 146, 99 (68%) were cleaved by the five recombinant proteases evaluated. These reveal the individual contribution of each recombinant midgut protease to the overall blood meal digestion process of the Ae. aegypti mosquito. Further, our molecular docking simulations support the substrate specificity of each recombinant protease. Therefore, the present study provides key information of midgut proteases and the blood meal digestion process in mosquitoes, which may be exploited for the development of potential inhibitor targets for vector and viral transmission control strategies."
