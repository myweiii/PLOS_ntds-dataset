The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a vector of viral pathogens that can be transmitted directly to humans. For instance, the transmission of dengue, Zika, or chikungunya viruses may happen during the Ae. aegypti acquisition of an infected blood meal. This blood meal is important for the anautogenous mosquito because without the digestion of blood proteins the mosquito will not obtain the necessary nutrients needed for egg production. After imbibing a blood meal, midgut digestive enzymes (proteases) are expressed and secreted into the lumen. To fully understand their roles in blood meal digestion, we used a special technique called Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS). This method allows us to generate global proteolytic activity profiles of Ae. aegypti midgut tissue extracts that were fed with sugar or blood. In addition, we generated substrate cleavage profiles of recombinantly expressed midgut proteases allowing us to understand the enzyme preferences for blood proteins. Therefore, utilizing this approach, we found the contribution of each individual recombinant protease tested relative to the global activity profile of blood-fed midgut tissue extracts. This may be a starting point for the validation of midgut protease inhibition and the development of a new vector control strategy.
