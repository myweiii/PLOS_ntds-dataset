Dengue poses a significant threat to global public health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of public health interventions has altered the transmission dynamics of dengue. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies examining the dengue epidemic throughout the entirety of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 2020 to 2022. Furthermore, limited research has been conducted in countries where dengue is not endemic, such as China. Utilizing surveillance data from Guangdong Province spanning from 2012 to 2022, we developed a dengue importation risk index and captured the epidemic trends of dengue in Guangdong Province. We observed the imported and local dengue cases in Guangdong notably declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were only six local dengue cases reported, with no large-scale local dengue outbreaks occurring. The study revealed that the dengue epidemic in SEA may influence the local epidemic in Guangdong, with wavelet analysis showing that imported dengue cases preceded local cases by one month. The BSTS model suggested that 6,557 dengue cases may have been reduced in Guangdong Province from 2020 to 2022, with a relative reduction of 99.91%. We found a significant decline in dengue cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be related to the co-benefits of COVID-19 intervention measures and the intensified interventions against dengue during that period. These further support the notion that dengue is not currently endemic in Guangdong.
