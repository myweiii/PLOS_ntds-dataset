Kenya continues to experience cholera outbreaks, particularly in areas with limited access to safe water, sanitary facilities, and health services. In response, Kenya has implemented the 2023 Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) method to identify the Priority Areas for Multisectoral Interventions (PAMIs). By analyzing six years of national data (2018–2023), we calculated a priority index score based on four key epidemiological indicators: cholera incidence, mortality, persistence of outbreaks, and laboratory testing capacity. The data were analyzed at the subcounty administrative level for each of the 304 subcounties.
A team of subnational and national stakeholders identified 78 sub-counties as PAMIs due to high-priority index scores. Additionally, 29 sub-counties were included as PAMIs due to evidence of local vulnerability factors. In total, the 107 PAMIs encompass 40% of Kenya’s population and account for over 97% of the reported cholera cases and deaths.
This targeted approach ensures that specific interventions, such as expansion of water and sanitation infrastructure and preventive vaccination campaigns, are directed to the areas that need them most. Kenya’s experience serves as a model for other countries by demonstrating the importance of inclusive, data-driven prioritization of intervention areas, especially where resources, such as vaccine supplies, are limited.
