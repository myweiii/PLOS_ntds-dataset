Sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous fungal infection, has recently been designated as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization, due to its rising global incidence with insufficient research and public health attention. S. globosa is one of the causative agents with a worldwide distribution, prevalent in Asia. However, knowledge about host immunity against this fungus remains limited. IL-18 is an inflammatory cytokine that can regulate T cell immunity within its cytokine milieu. Our study aims to characterize the T cell immune profile within skin lesions of sporotrichosis patients and to elucidate the role of IL-18 in modulating local immune responses against S. globosa infection, as well as its impact on disease progression. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized predominant Th2-mediated immune response in the pathogenesis of sporotrichosis caused by S. globosa. This Th2 immunity is facilitated by IL-18 secreted by DCs and LCs, together with Th1-derived IL-2, and leads to prolonged disease duration in patients. Our study significantly advances the understanding of regulatory effects of IL-18 on T cell-mediated immunity and the pathogenesis of sporotrichosis.
