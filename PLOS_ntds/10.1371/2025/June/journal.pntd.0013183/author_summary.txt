Leishmania major is a unicellular parasite that causes cutaneous ulcerative disease and circulates between rodent reservoir hosts and the blood-feeding insects, phlebotomine sand flies. In this study, we investigated transmission parameters important for understanding and modelling the epidemiology of leishmaniasis using two model animals, the natural host Meriones shawi and the standard laboratory mouse strain BALB/c. We found that Leishmania parasites are unevenly distributed in the infected ear pinnae of rodents, with the highest numbers observed in the centres and margins of the lesions. We subsequently analysed individual bite sites via fluorescence microscopy of microbiopsies, which mimic the volume and depth of penetration of sand fly bites. For M. shawi, the lesion margins proved to be the most effective sources of sand fly infections, with the ingestion of as few (2--10) amastigotes sufficient to establish infection. On the other hand, in BALB/c mice, sand flies become infected when they feed at both centers and margins of the lesions, and the threshold is at least 1000 parasites. Thus, this study not only provides valuable data for modelling the Leishmania transmission cycle but also demonstrates the importance of model organism selection in the study of hostâ€’parasite and vector interactions.
