Loa loa is a parasitic worm transmitted by Chrysops flies, endemic in the region of Central Africa, notably in Gabon. High levels of microfilaremia (> 8,000 mf/mL) can cause serious adverse effects when treated with ivermectin, a drug widely used in mass treatment campaigns. For this reason, albendazole is sometimes administered beforehand to reduce the parasite load in at-risk individuals. However, few data exist concerning its efficacy in people with low microfilaraemia, even though albendazole is the most accessible drug for rural populations, and the majority of patients with loiasis have low microfilaraemia levels below 4,000 mf/mL. In this study, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of albendazole (400 mg/day for 30 days) versus a single dose of ivermectin (200 µg/kg) in low-microfilaremic individuals in northern Gabon. Both treatments led to a significant reduction in microfilaremia, with a slightly higher efficacy observed for ivermectin. No serious adverse events were reported in either group. These results support the potential use of albendazole as an alternative treatment in loiasis endemic areas, particularly when this treatment is more accessible than ivermectin for the populations concerned.
