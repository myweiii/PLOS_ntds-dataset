Dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, represents a significant public health challenge in tropical countries like Brazil. Transmission patterns vary widely across the country, shaped by diverse geography, climate, and local conditions. This study analyzed 14-year dengue data (2010â€“2023) from 120 Health Macro-Regions (HMR) in Brazil, integrating epidemiological and climate data to understand regional variations and optimize the timing of vector control strategies. This study applied the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) output metrics, such as intensity and outbreak onset, along with environmental data (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and altitude in a multivariate cluster analysis to identify similar transmission seasons potentially driven by comparable climatic conditions. As a result, five regions emerged with similar outbreak patterns, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions. For example, some regions require vector control measures before February (~10 weeks of uncertainty), while others can delay until June (~13 weeks of uncertainty), highlighting the importance of locally adapted strategies. By integrating environmental data with traditional epidemiological approaches, this research offers valuable insights for enhancing disease control efforts. This methodology provides a framework for addressing other mosquito-borne diseases, including Zika and chikungunya.
