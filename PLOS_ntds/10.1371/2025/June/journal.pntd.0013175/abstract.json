    "Abstract": "A country with continental dimensions like Brazil, characterized by heterogeneity of climates, biomes, natural resources, population density, socioeconomic conditions, and regional challenges, also exhibits significant spatial variation in dengue outbreaks. This study aimed to characterize Brazilian territory based on epidemiological and climate data to determine the optimal time to guide preventive and control strategies. To achieve this, the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) was employed to analyze dengue historical patterns using 14-year disease data (2010–2023) aggregated by the 120 Brazilian Health Macro-Regions (HMR). Statistical outputs from MEM included the mean outbreak onset, duration, and variation of these measurements, pre- and post-epidemic thresholds, and the high-intensity level of cases. Environmental data used includes mean annual precipitation, temperature, and altitude, as well as the Köppen Climate Classification of each area. A multivariate cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm was applied to MEM outputs and climate data. Four clusters/regions were identified, with the mean temperature, mean precipitation, mean outbreak onset, high-intensity level of cases, and mean altitude explaining 80% of the centroid variation among the clusters. Region 1 (North-Northwest) encompasses areas with the highest temperatures, precipitation, and early outbreak onset, in February. Region 2a (Northeast) has the lowest precipitation and a later onset, in March. Region 3 (Southeast) presents higher altitude, and early outbreak onset in February; while Region 4 (South) has a lower temperature, with onset in March. To better adjust the results, the unique Roraima state HMR state was manually classified as Region 2b (Roraima) because of its outbreak onset in July and the highest precipitation volume. The results suggested preventive and control measures should be implemented first in Regions North-Northwest and Southeast, followed by Regions Northeast, South, and Roraima, highlighting the importance of regional vector control measures based on historical and climatic patterns. Integrating these findings with monitoring systems and fostering cross-sector collaboration can enhance surveillance and mitigate future outbreaks. The proposed methodology also holds potential for application in controlling other mosquito-transmitted viral diseases, expanding its public health impact."
