    "Introduction": "Cholera outbreaks are increasing in frequency and severity across the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This is despite efforts by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) to achieve cholera elimination in at least 20 countries by 2030 [1]. In 2024, a cumulative total of 804,721 cases and 5,805 deaths were reported across all five regions of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 33 countries [2]. Zambia, with its Republican President serving as the Global Champion for Cholera Control, had set out to lead the elimination efforts by 2025, ahead of the global targets, with the launch of the first Multisectoral Cholera Elimination Plan (MCEP) in 2018 [3] and a successful pre-emptive Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign in 2021 for over five million people living in hotspot areas [4].\nHowever, the country instead experienced its most significant outbreak to date with 23,381 cumulative cases, and 740 fatalities, of which 304 were facility deaths, representing a case fatality of 1.8% (Accessed on 31st July 2024 [5]. A multisectoral response was mounted, including the provision of safe water via water trucking to the hardest hit areas, household chlorine distribution, health education packages, and a reactive oral cholera vaccination campaign [6]. We reported elsewhere a survival analysis of a cohort of patients admitted to treatment centres in Lusaka and found that lack of prior vaccination and the presence of comorbidities were statistically significant contributors to inpatient mortality [7].\nThe GTFCC Roadmap to Cholera Elimination by 2030 focuses on investment in Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), early case investigation, and the systematic use of OCV as part of cholera elimination strategies as a bridge towards longer-term investments in WASH, health care system strengthening and robust community engagement [1]. The country was conducting a mid-term revision of the MCEP, rendering it necessary to undertake this work to understand what constitutes published knowledge on cholera in Zambia and to learn from lessons and evidence-based practices that could contribute to reduced cholera mortality and the overall number of cases in outbreaks by 2030.\nSeveral other countries earmarked for cholera elimination have documented progress and lessons learned. Haiti, for example, notes the need for Case-Area Targeted Interventions (CATI), given ongoing vulnerabilities and vaccine shortages [8]. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a narrative review detailed the successes and challenges in the implementation of three iterations of their National Cholera Control Plan (NCP) (2008–2012, 2013–2017 and 2018–2021) to influence the implementation of their NCP 2023–2027 [9]. They noted that there has been little to no change since the pre-NCP period. Lastly, Uganda noted the use of a scorecard to track cholera elimination efforts at district and ward levels [10]. They highlighted the risks of periods of elimination and then resurgence in some areas if ongoing elimination efforts, such as improved WASH and OCV campaigns, were not sustained [10]. Global efforts to improve vaccine availability and rapid diagnostic kits must be matched by domestic adaptation of GTFCC guidelines to ensure better response efforts during outbreaks and a speedier transition from control to elimination of cholera in endemic countries.\nTo better adapt cholera control and elimination strategies in Zambia, this scoping review was undertaken to summarise existing evidence on cholera epidemiology and elimination in Zambia, with particular attention to multisectoral and One-Health approaches, incorporating evidence from the human-environment interface. By examining the perceived regression in cholera elimination efforts, we sought to document the evidence generated from the different pillars to facilitate a comprehensive multisectoral response strategy. We addressed two main questions: (i) What is known about cholera in Zambia? (ii) What are the main suggested mechanisms and strategies to further cholera control efforts in the region?",
    "Methods": "A scoping literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Our goal was to map the existing literature, present evidence-based strategies in the different thematic areas of prevention/control, and present hypotheses on the best strategy to accelerate progress towards cholera control and eventual elimination in Zambia. We also sought to identify gaps in the research data that could be important for prioritising intervention areas, such as appropriate community-level interventions and evaluation of long-term WASH infrastructure sustainability in rural settings, as outlined in the GTFCC Cholera Research Roadmap [11]. A scoping review was favoured over a systematic review as the goal was to comprehensively map and summarise the existing literature on a broad topic and to identify emerging themes around evidence-based strategies that could accelerate the progress towards cholera control in Zambia.\nIn preparation for this scoping review, articles were identified in PubMed and Embase using the search terms ‘cholera’ and ‘Zambia’ for articles published between 1st January 2013 and 30th May 2024; filtered to English only. The same search terms were used for Google Scholar ‘cholera’ AND ‘Zambia’, limited to January 2013 to June 2024. Reference lists of selected papers and reviews were also screened for relevant papers, as were local publications and preprints within the period under review. Exclusions were made for all conference abstracts, meeting reports, editorial letters, daily situation reports, systematic review protocols or where Zambia or cholera was not mentioned in the abstract. All identified citations were uploaded into a Mendeley database, and data were extracted using a predesigned form. Key findings and study designs were then collated into thematic areas based on the GTFCC Global Road Map for Cholera Control [1]. The GTFCC describes three axes achievable across six different pillars for a comprehensive multisectoral control plan – effective leadership and coordination, surveillance and laboratory, case management, risk communication and community engagement, OCV and WASH [1]. Selected papers were analysed by the theme, and scrutinised for their aims, study design, population, location, identified risk factors and possible mitigative factors. The search was conducted, and all papers were screened between December 2023 and July 2024. Results were synthesised by theme and recommendations.",
    "Results": "Study identification and selection\nA total of 49 records were identified that investigated cholera and Zambia from January 2013 to June 2024 from PubMed, including one previous article exploring the epidemiology of cholera in Zambia from 2000 to 2010 [12]. An additional 23 unique records from a total of 76 were identified from Embase, and 13 more were found on Google Scholar, of which three were unique. Four additional titles were identified from alternative sources, such as preprints, in local journals or otherwise not listed on PubMed, and were included for analysis [13–16]. Full texts were available for all the studies and reported according to the PRISMA-Scoping Review (Scr) guidelines to ensure a systematic and transparent approach to study selection and data extraction, thereby enhancing the reliability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness of the review process [17]. After excluding 22 articles based on the set criteria, the total number of articles included was 53 (Fig 1). Fig 2 shows how the analysed publications were evaluated considering the different pillars they represent. The completed PRISMA-Scr checklist is included in the S1 Table.\nFig 1 shows the flow diagram illustrating the scoping review process according to PRISMA guidelines, highlighting selection and inclusion criteria, search strategy, screening, eligibility assessment, and final included studies.\nFig 2 illustrates the distribution of cholera-related publications in Zambia from 2013 to 2024 categorised by thematic focus. Themes include epidemiology, public health interventions, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), healthcare infrastructure, and community engagement. The data provides insights into the evolving research priorities and strategies aimed at combating cholera within the Zambian context over the past decade.\n\n\nCholera epidemiology and burden\nTable 1 shows studies exploring the epidemiology of cholera in Zambia. Consistently, the definition of an outbreak, based on the national Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) guidelines, was the confirmation by stool culture of V. cholerae in at least one cholera suspect patient with three episodes of acute watery diarrhoea in a 24-hour period in each district [18]. Once an outbreak has been declared, the subsequent cholera suspected patients are included in the line list based on the clinical case definition, with or without culture confirmation [18]. Only three studies depict multiyear surveillance data and are represented in Table 1 [6,12,19]. From 2000 to 2010, 39,285 cases in total over the ten years, with 80% of these cases occurring in Lusaka, the capital [12]. Overlapping slightly in years, Mwaba et al described the spatial distribution of cholera cases from 2008-2017 and again found that cases were primarily from Lusaka [19]. They identified 16 other cholera hotspots and noted that outside of Lusaka, cases were mostly identified in districts bordering Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi or the DRC – suggesting a linkage to the movement of people to and from neighbouring countries [19]. However, at the peak of the 2024 outbreak, 70 of the 116 districts in the country reported confirmed cholera cases with evidence of local transmission [20]. In describing the 2024 outbreak response in Lusaka – the most affected province, Kateule and colleagues depict the epidemiological trends over time since the first outbreak in 1977 and demonstrate an increasing magnitude of cases but a reduction in the case fatality rate from close to 10% in 1978 to about 3% in 2024 [6]. Before 2013, the largest outbreaks had encompassed 13500 cases in 1991 and 1999. There were no large-scale outbreaks recorded after the launch of the MCEP in 2018 until the 2024 outbreak, which was the largest [6]. A limit may be that cholera cases were only reported in the IDSR system when an outbreak is confirmed by culture. Consequently, as documented by Wiens and colleagues, in endemic areas where suspected cases are not routinely subjected to laboratory confirmation, the true incidence and overall disease burden may be significantly underestimated, particularly outside of outbreak season [21]. Additional studies attempted to explore risk factors of the outbreaks, the regions and age groups of affected individuals, but were limited in size and scope [7,13,15,22–24]. Fig 2 shows the bias towards descriptive analyses of each localised outbreak.\n\n\nRisk factors and determinants of transmission\nMale sex, close contact with a cholera case and the use of borehole water were found to be risk factors for cholera infection [14,23–28]. Drinking water sources were found to have inadequately low free-residual chlorine (FRC) in up to 71% of households surveyed [14,25,28]. Thirty-one per cent of those households with inadequate FRC had evidence of faecal contamination. Low latrine coverage, poor drainage systems, and sharing latrines [14,24] were also documented vulnerability factors that allowed for the perennial occurrence of cholera in some localities, particularly unplanned settlements such as the fishing villages in many of the areas bordering lakes and in high-density, peri-urban communities of Lusaka and the Copperbelt [19,22,26–28]. Whilst poor hygiene practices (mostly superimposed on people due to lack of facilities) were a notable risk factor, consumption of food products, particularly fresh fish, was not associated with an increased risk [16].\nThe availability and quality of drinking water in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka were assessed [28]. It was found that in areas underserved by the municipal utility companies, private borehole companies known as ‘Water Trusts’ would operate small shops known as ‘kiosks’ where community members could go and draw small quantities of water in buckets at a minimal cost to cover the fees only, and not for profit [28]. These trusts treated and provided water to the communities in these water-stressed unplanned settlements as an adjunct to the provincial utility company, and yet they were found to serve less than 60% of the communities in need of their services [12,24]. Despite this limitation, they were noted to present a safer alternative than privately owned consumer boreholes and shallow wells in terms of faecal contamination with Escherichia coli and nitrite content of the water [28]. Those unable to afford the kiosk water tended to use unsafe surface water sources such as shallow wells in their locality [24,25]. These presented the highest risk of contamination, particularly due to topographical features such as the high-water table in Lusaka Province, leading to a high risk of contamination of these shallow wells from nearby pit latrines [27,28].\nThe smallest surveillance unit of population reported was the ward level. It was found that the greatest risk for cholera was in the wards with the densest populations, unimproved sanitation and evidence of E. coli contamination of piped sources [14]. Elsewhere, as was seen in Kabwe, through an environmental sampling of groundwater using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) tracers, there was evidence of groundwater contamination with environmental vibrio [27]. The authors postulated that private boreholes are vulnerable to contamination, possibly due to incompetent casing, which may provide an artificial pathway for the Vibrio from contaminated ground sources and pose an even greater risk. Supporting this was the rapid decrease in cases seen during outbreaks, when there was an increased provision in WASH services, such as hyper-chlorination of the water utility lines, provision of safe water through emergency tanks in the hotspot areas [29] and with the use of reactive OCV campaigns [30].\n\n\nInter-district and inter-country spread of outbreaks\nRisk factors for continued outbreaks between the peak years included increased poverty and inadequacies of social services due to rural-urban migration [12,24,31]. Similarly, movement between neighbouring districts [15,29] and neighbouring countries [32–35] was identified as a factor associated with epidemic cholera in Zambia. Chirabombo and colleagues documented how naïve districts neighbouring traditional hotspots such as Lusaka can present with outbreaks of their own, with evidence of local transmission [15]. The question of environmental persistence versus reintroduction into the district from neighbouring countries such as the DRC and Tanzania, which equally have continuous outbreaks, has been documented [33–37]. This is reaffirmed by laboratory studies and descriptive analyses of genomic sequencing isolates that showed a wide genetic diversity [33–34] and close linkage with isolates from other parts of the Great Lakes region [35–37]. This underscores the need for both a decentralised approach at the district and ward levels, but also shows a need for enhanced cross-border surveillance and possible cross-border joint responses [25–38].\n\n\nClinical characteristics and host predisposition\nGlobally, there is a dearth of information on the clinical characteristics of patients affected by outbreaks beyond general case counts and case fatality rates [39]. Little is known about the proportion of pregnant women, elderly or paediatric patients affected by cholera, nor the number of patients presenting with co-morbid conditions or other complications of care. What was seen is that having received limited education and being older than 55 years constituted one risk factor for increased mortality [23]. There was a slightly higher proportion of patients documented to have died before arrival at the treatment facilities (i.e., at home or community deaths) versus in the facility in the 2024 outbreak in Lusaka (60% community deaths) [6], proportionately more than the community deaths reported in the 2018 outbreak (45%) [23]. Intravenous fluids were not available beyond Cholera Treatment Centres (CTC), and there was no documented use of Community Oral Rehydration Points before the 2023/2024 outbreak [6]. Adequate Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) was protective [23], yet it was clear that there were disparities in the availability of ORS, particularly in rural communities [40]. Rising antimicrobial resistance was found to have direct implications on patient management in cholera treatment settings [1]. Specifically, it can compromise the effectiveness of antibiotics used for managing severe cases, potentially leading to prolonged illness, increased risk of complications and greater strain on clinical resources [38]. Prior antibiotic use was not found to be protective, although noted that patients often took metronidazole, which is not one of the recommended agents [23]. In younger patients, cholera was noted to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the under-five age group, with increasing antimicrobial resistance over the years [32,41,42]. For example, earlier studies showed low-level resistance to tetracyclines but as high as 95% in subsequent outbreaks due to its use as drug of choice for first-line treatment of severe patients [38,42]. Case management was reported to have improved, with reductions in the case fatality rate (CFR) decreasing from 6.7% in 2000 to 1.7% in 2010 [12]. However, as of the 2018 outbreak, the case fatality rate hovered around 2.5% [25]. The case fatality rate of the 2023/2024 outbreak was 1.3%, with increased documentation of community deaths [3]. For inpatient fatalities, there were higher odds of dying for those with pre-existing comorbid conditions [7].\n\n\nVaccine availability and effectiveness\nVaccines are known to be a useful tool for community-level interventions for controlling waterborne diseases such as cholera, in places where access to water, sanitation and hygiene remains limited [43,44]. Recent studies have used the new Euvichol Plus, which is the Eubiologics bivalent vaccine of El Tor and Ogawa, presented in glass containers as opposed to plastic vials to improve cold chain in humanitarian crises [45]. They have shown a higher vaccine efficacy in the two-dose strategy than the single dose (at 74% and 81%, respectively [46,47]; and that reported OCV administrative coverage is often much higher than the actual coverage which was found to be 66% of people getting both doses, which may further lower efficacy rates [48]. Questions persist about the very high dropout rate of 18% between the two doses [48]. Similarly, it remains to be seen the effect of previous preventative campaigns, as a lead-up to future multi-year preventative vaccination campaigns, or if delaying the second dose post outbreak can be used to time subsequent campaigns before the rainy season, which is a high-risk period for cholera transmission [49].\nPugliese-Garcia and colleagues attempted to explore the factors influencing vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in the hotspot districts of Lusaka. They found that traditional remedies, religious beliefs and alcohol use persist as impediments [50], as does a background mistrust towards Western medicine [51]. There was an overarching sense of helplessness or ‘fate’ as the participants were aware they could not change their living conditions and did not realise their ability to use safer water practices to protect themselves [51].\nInvestigation of the immunogenicity of the vaccines in a controlled population in one of the high-risk fishing villages found no significant difference in vibriocidal antibodies at two weeks or six months and provided evidence for the delayed dosing schedule [52] but also waning immunity beyond 12 months [53]. The group found no influence of ABO blood groupings on vaccine response [54]. HIV-positivity was found to reduce immunogenicity in these individuals regardless of the CD4 count, whilst serum vitamin A levels had no effect positive or negative [55]. Elsewhere, there was a suggestion of vitamin A supplementation as a possible adjuvant to improve T-cell expression following vaccination, particularly in children [56], which may offer a gateway into host-specific factors for improved immunity and transmission dynamics. There was no work yet published on the role of the gut microbiome in cholera vaccine responsiveness or protection in the face of household exposure. However, a review article describing environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD), a subclinical disorder of intestinal function in settings of poverty that affects vaccine uptake, concluded that the immunogenicity and efficacy of oral vaccines in developing countries was less in developing countries than developed countries based on pathology findings [57] The evidence surrounding EDD in Zambian cohorts is limited but also points towards a potential role of Immunoglobulin A supplementation to improve uptake of vaccines through improved nutritional status [58]. Most recently, a comparison of vibriocidal antibodies in naturally infected vs vaccinated individuals was found to be comparable, with peak immunity seen around day 19 post-infection and waning after day 30–39 [42] . The group explored waning immunity beyond 90 days in revaccinated individuals compared to naïve and found that repeated use of a single dose strategy was unprotective and probably contributing to more explosive future outbreaks following such campaigns [59]. suggested the need for booster vaccinations, particularly in high-risk areas, as a possible public health protective strategy. Additionally, ongoing work is being done to explore Zambian Vibrio cholerae strains for human challenge studies, to explore future vaccine candidate efficacy [60].\nThe use of a single-dose campaign of Sanchol was found to be cost-effective, amounting to just under $ 1 million to vaccinate 500,000 people [30]. A further evaluation of the cost of cholera illness and the cost-effectiveness of the single-dose campaign in Lusaka was close to $1000 per disability-adjusted-life year (DALY) averted, especially in those above the age of 15 years [61]. The social implications for affected communities have not been deeply studied, nor the cost-benefit analysis of community-based interventions and health education initiatives in the hotspot districts. With the increasing size of the outbreaks, it remains to be seen the cost-effectiveness of reactive campaigns, and also the macro-economic effects of the overall cholera responses.\n\n\nClimate variability\nThe role of climate variability and extreme weather events cannot be ignored, with a strong association between the onset of rainfall and epidemic outbreaks [25]. Cholera outbreaks in Zambia, like many other African countries, are seasonal [25,36], differing from the Ganges Delta, where it occurs perennially [36]. The outbreaks start with the onset of the rainy season in 71% of cases and have been associated with 50% of all recorded drought years. Outbreaks are expected to increase in frequency by 300% in the near future with recurrent El Niño events [62]. El Nino events are associated with increased rainfall and flooding, which would lead to contamination of water sources, whilst the warmer temperatures will allow the growth and persistence of Vibrio cholerae in the environment. These conditions together create a conducive setting for the spread of cholera in vulnerable communities [62]. Following seasonal rains, the larger outbreaks are often heralded by flooding, which is a specific sequel of torrential rains possibly enhanced by climate change. Flooding has been associated with damage to WASH infrastructure, and the decay of flooding countermeasures, such as clogged-up drainage canals and sealing of ground passages for water, particularly when big cities such as Lusaka are afflicted [25,62], further compounding the problem. Reduced rainfall (i.e., drought periods) may also increase cholera outbreaks as seen in the U-shaped occurrence of diarrhoeagenic bacteria such as V. cholerae with rainfall and pathogen proliferation, meaning an increase in both ends of the spectrum – very dry and then very flooded – can contribute to increased cholera incidence [63]. Groundwater drilling during the drought years, if not carefully planned, will worsen the already water-stressed situation in certain parts of the country [62]. The anticipated periods of droughts in the near future are expected to exacerbate rural-urban migration into the peri-urban slums, further compounding the water-stressed situations and the likelihood of larger cholera outbreaks [62].\nMathematical modelling was used to predict the expected time to extinction of cholera in Lusaka, and based on previous estimates of a second wave in each outbreak found that heavy rains were associated with an increased environment-to-human transmission [31]. They warned that environmental vibrio could persist for eight months to six years in the environment, especially the shallow wells and areas with poor drainage, hence future outbreaks would be longer and more severe. They also recommended enforcement of the multisectoral cholera elimination plan, which sought the combination of WASH interventions with periodic oral cholera vaccinations [31]. A study exploring microbiological screening of plankton and meteorological monitoring of Uvira in DRC and Mpulungu in Zambia between 2000–2014 to better understand environmental factors that trigger cholera outbreaks in the region, concluded that whilst climate dynamics play a part in cholera transmission, most outbreaks in Africa region are due to genetically diverse strains that spread into non endemic areas and cause explosive outbreak [64] They suggested the need for localised prevention efforts to protect communities from introduction of new outbreaks, a nod to decentralisation of cholera control and prevention efforts. Chota and colleagues attempted to draw lessons from the cholera outbreak of 2017–2018 when responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21. They engaged health care professionals and community leaders in focus group discussions around the successes and pitfalls of multisectoral response strategies. They concluded that challenges in the partnership collaboration included inadequate resources, poor communication, poor coordination, lack of clear shared vision, reactive response, poor involvement of the community, hegemonic powers and mistrust of each other [65]: “Despite the attempts at co-ordination, ministries have a tendency of operating in isolation, this has resulted in lack of a clear shared vision. This also contributes to duplications of tasks in trying to prevent an outbreak of cholera” [65]. It has been proposed that the key to success in cholera elimination would be greater community participation in developmental activities and empowering the communities to take ownership of their health by addressing underlying economic challenges [66]. All the reviewed articles are listed in Table 2 with their key findings and possible mitigating factors that can contribute to cholera control and elimination in Zambia.",
    "Discussion": "Since the first documented outbreak in 1977, Zambia has recorded major outbreaks every three to five years with increasing intensity and fatality [6,12,19]. The outbreaks were predictable concerning the timing in the calendar year and with an increasing frequency related to climatic conditions and urbanisation [14,23,27]. Because most of the reporting is done based on case definitions during outbreaks, it is postulated that the true burden of cholera in Zambia, like other parts of the world, is underreported outside of explosive outbreaks [21,67]. The major risk factors for recurrent outbreaks in the country were poor access to water and sanitation services in urban unplanned settlements and the rural fishing villages [19,24,25]. These factors were found to be persistent even in the 2023/2024 outbreak, which is the largest to date [6], different from other cholera-prone areas, which are often coastal areas in South Asia [36] or places with humanitarian crises and conflicts, such as Northern Nigeria and Haiti [68,69].\nZambia was not considered endemic to cholera at the time of the development of the first Multisectoral Cholera Elimination Plan (MCEP) in 2018. However, the increased frequency and near-annual occurrence of outbreaks in certain localities now justifies its reclassification as a cholera-endemic country, eligible for sustained cholera control rather than elimination, in line with GTFCC guidance [1]. Given the documented risk of cholera re-introduction across wards and districts due to population movement, as demonstrated in Lusaka, where transmission events occurred across multiple peri-urban areas [32,33], interventions should prioritise a decentralised, community-centric approach to surveillance, case management and community engagement [65]. Case-Area Targeted Interventions (CATI), which support rapid, localised response to confirmed cases, have demonstrated operational effectiveness in comparable high-risk settings such as Uganda, the DRC, and Burundi, and are increasingly recognised as effective components of cholera elimination strategies [9,70,71]. The predictable geographic location and seasonality of the outbreaks could be used to envisage the location and size of repeat vaccination campaigns, with the possibility of pre-emptive campaigns timed before the rainy season to be included in the expanded program for immunisations, as has been demonstrated in Indian cohorts [72–74]. Excitement surrounds the recent WHO prequalification of Euvichol-S, a simplified version of the Euvichol-Plus that is easier to produce but equally efficacious [75]. It is anticipated that its inclusion in the global stockpile will increase vaccine availability, enabling countries like Zambia to implement multi-year vaccination campaigns as part of the cholera control and elimination efforts. These multi-year vaccine campaigns would serve as a bridge to increased WASH investments. Similarly, WASH infrastructure should be planned in a decentralised framework construct as the different localities, even within a single country, face unique vulnerabilities, which are expected to intensify with evolving climate patterns [10,19,24,62,63,76]. Ultimately, cholera elimination would depend on approaching prevention from a developmental lens and not outbreak response. This entails building resilient communities with available community resources, effective communication, local knowledge, training and education [76,77].\nEfforts to combat vaccine hesitancy must be sustained and embedded within long-term public health strategies, rather than implemented reactively during outbreaks [65]. Persistent myths and misconceptions, often stemming from historical injustices, socio-political marginalisation or fears of Western exploitation and medical malevolence, require culturally sensitive and community-led approaches to effectively address [50,51,77]. This is particularly relevant in contexts where mistrust in health systems continues to shape public perceptions of vaccination campaigns [50,51,65]. Building public trust demands continuous engagement through transparent communication, collaboration with local leaders, and integration of behavioural and social sciences into health programming [65,66]. Improving community literacy levels in African communities was also posited as an avenue to improve acceptance of public health interventions such as vaccines [77]. In parallel, we advocate for strengthened global collaboration in medical education and the bi-directional exchange of knowledge between low- and high-income countries. Such partnerships can enhance local research capacity, foster contextual innovation, and accelerate regional vaccine manufacturing. This aligns with recommendations from the President of the Republic of Zambia, in his role as the WHO Global and Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Regional Cholera Control Champion, who has called for the development of regional vaccine production hubs to improve timely access and health security across the Global South [78].\nEvidence for patient-specific case management modalities using host genomics is nascent. Research into the host microbiome is in early phases with mixed results but gives potential for newer treatment modalities such as probiotics and phage therapy against Vibrio cholerae [79,80]. Recent studies have highlighted the complex and sometimes contradictory role of the gut microbiome in cholera susceptibility and transmission [81–83]. Certain commensal bacteria have been associated with protective effects, potentially by competing with Vibrio cholerae for nutrients or attachment sites in the intestinal mucosa [81]. Conversely, disruptions of the gut microbiota—due to factors such as malnutrition, prior antibiotic use, or environmental exposures—may reduce colonization resistance, thereby increasing an individual’s vulnerability to infection [82]. Moreover, variability in microbiome composition across populations and geographic regions may partly explain differences in outbreak dynamics and individual disease severity [83]. These findings underscore the importance of considering host–microbe interactions in cholera prevention strategies. Notably, emerging evidence suggests that baseline gut microbiota composition may influence oral cholera vaccine efficacy, particularly in low-income settings, prompting further investigation into microbiome-based correlates of protection [58]. Additionally, bacteriophages and probiotics are being explored as adjunctive therapies to enhance cholera case management by modulating gut flora and directly targeting V. cholerae, though these approaches remain under active research and are not yet standard practice [82–84].\nIsolates from the 2023/2024 outbreak in Zambia have yet to be fully analysed for host and pathogen genomics. However, recent sequencing results from Malawi give insight into a possible new transmission event into the subcontinent, which bears a close resemblance to strains of Asian origin [85]. Zambia and Malawi share many porous borders, and trade and intermarriage are common between the people. The Malawian study postulated that the strain of Vibrio in their 2022/2023 outbreak, the worst in Malawian history, was a highly successful cone of pandemic potential worsened by humanitarian and climate crises and then propagated by suitable environmental factors [85]. This agrees with earlier findings suggesting that outbreaks in Kanyama and other hotspots like the fishing villages, were due to a combination of recent introduction of newer pathogenic strains and favourable environmental factors like deplorable WASH status [32,34,35]. This also underscores the importance of joint cross-border surveillance and response activities in the region [6,29,35–37].\nChallenges and gaps persist in cholera elimination efforts in Zambia. The need for a multisectoral, decentralised approach is evident, as no single intervention would remove all the various identified risk factors. The studies reviewed showcased different aspects of interventions during outbreak settings or vaccination efforts in a reactive response. What can be seen is that cholera outbreaks in Zambia and Africa as a whole are progressively larger [6,25,77] and call for enhanced multisectoral and cross-border collaboration [65,77]. Without environmental source control, such as improving flush-to-sewage plumbing systems and overall climate-resilient solutions, it can be anticipated that the number of outbreaks in the region will continue to increase [65,66,76,77]. Our findings broadly confirm the need to align health and WASH investments with the GTFCC’s Roadmap to Cholera Elimination by 2030 [1] but also highlight the need for additional research across the various pillars to ensure tailored solutions are adaptable to the local setting and able to inform best practice.\nWhile the study is primarily based on a scoping review methodology, limiting the application of statistical tests and resulting in largely descriptive recommendations, there are several notable strengths. The review synthesises a broad and complex body of evidence on cholera control in Zambia, offering a consolidated narrative that clearly outlines the key challenges and persistent gaps in the country’s elimination efforts. By mapping these barriers against existing interventions, the study provides practical insights that can inform more targeted and strategic planning for the next iteration of the National Cholera Control Plan.\nImportantly, the review identifies priority areas for future research, including best approaches for implementing community-centric surveillance and CATI. It also highlights critical gaps in patient-level data on survival outcomes and transmissibility, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and pregnant women. There is a clear need for studies exploring the influence of co-morbidities, host genetic factors (e.g., gut microbiome), and household-level dynamics on disease progression and spread. The potential of metagenomic technologies for enhancing point-of-care testing and linking surveillance to clinical outcomes is underscored as an emerging frontier. Similarly, the role of adjuvant therapies in vaccination and treatment regimens remains underexplored. Lastly, the review emphasises the growing importance of understanding how climate change, through both drought and flooding, affects WASH infrastructure and health outcomes. These insights contribute meaningfully to the global evidence base and offer direction for researchers and policymakers working toward the 2030 cholera elimination goal. In particular, the paucity of peer-reviewed literature on community engagement in cholera control in Zambia, as shown in our review (Fig 2), points to a critical gap in evidence. We highlight the need for more implementation research to identify effective, scalable models for community engagement in cholera surveillance, vaccination uptake, and WASH interventions. Strengthening this evidence base is essential for designing context-specific strategies that are both sustainable and responsive to the needs of high-risk communities.",
    "Conclusion": "This scoping review collated evidence supporting a decentralised approach to cholera control in Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa overall. Two key findings emerge from the analysis: first is the steady increase in cases and deaths over the years, despite adopting the first iteration of the Multisectoral Cholera Elimination Plan in 2019, and an anticipated increase in the coming years with rapid population growth and changing climate. The second key finding is that a wealth of evidence has already been generated in Zambia regarding best practices towards cholera control. There is a continued need to advocate strongly for multisectoral interventions with an alignment of health and WASH investment at the district and ward level, to align with this decentralised approach. The findings suggest multiple areas of further research considering the endemicity of cholera in Zambia. We propose that our insights and recommendations can inform policymakers in crafting guidelines for implementing ward-level interventions, and these will be integrated into the next iteration of the National Cholera Control Plan. We hope that the lessons from here can be applied in other sub-Saharan African countries facing similar challenges and seeking to internalise the Global Roadmap for Cholera Control by 2030."
