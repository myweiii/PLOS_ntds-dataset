Cholera outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and severity across sub-Saharan Africa, despite long-standing evidence on the effectiveness of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), the protective role of oral cholera vaccines (OCV), and the guidance of the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) Roadmap. In Zambia, cholera has become endemic in many settings, yet the true burden remains underreported due to incomplete and inconsistent data. This scoping review synthesises available evidence on the cholera situation in Zambia and identifies critical gaps. It highlights the strong influence of climatic variability, unplanned urbanisation, and fragile WASH infrastructure in driving recurrent outbreaks. Despite the national goal to eliminate cholera by 2025, the findings suggest this target is unrealistic without urgent course correction. The review supports shifting toward a decentralised, community-centric approach to cholera control—emphasising pre-emptive vaccination campaigns, locally tailored WASH investments, and improved surveillance. It also underlines the need for more patient-level research, including on host and environmental factors that influence survival or asymptomatic infection. Findings from this work will inform Zambia’s next National Cholera Control Plan and may guide similar efforts in other countries aiming to control or eliminate cholera amid climate and demographic pressures.
