Together, unsafe water, unimproved sanitation, poor hygiene, and dirty environment make it easier for people, especially babies, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to catch enteric diseases. Generally, babies can get sick when they drink dirty water, eat contaminated food, do not wash their hands, play in dirty environment, or stay with other sick people. But what is the riskiest behavior for babies as they are growing up in LMICs is unknown. In this study, the authors examined the changing behavior of babies in rural Ethiopia and how those changes increase or decrease their chances of getting sick. The authors found that eating contaminated food and poor hygiene for breastfeeding mothers are the major concerns for little babies between 4 to 8 months old. As babies grow to 11 to 15 months old, additional risk is posed by their increasing abilities to crawl or walk around, which enables them to eat dirty soil in the environment. This research provides insights for how to reduce risk of disease for babies in the rural settings of Ethiopia.
