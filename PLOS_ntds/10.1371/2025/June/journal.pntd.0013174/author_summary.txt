Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral infection primarily affecting young children. It is caused by a few enteroviruses, which are mostly transmitted through the faecal-oral route. HFMD outbreaks have been reported extensively across the Asia-Pacific region over the last twenty years, imposing an important burden on the healthcare systems. Here, we analysed HFMD case surveillance data over an 11-year period before the COVID-19 pandemic (2009â€“2019) in Malaysia, to explore the dynamics and drivers of HFMD epidemics. We found that HFMD is endemic and does not exhibit a regular seasonal pattern in Malaysia, contrary to other countries, where outbreaks tend to occur in summer. HFMD epidemics were highly synchronised across districts within Peninsular and East Malaysia, but less so between these two regions. Meteorological factors had a very small effect on transmission, potentially because of the low weather variability across the year in Malaysia, given its tropical climate. The depletion of susceptible individuals in the population and school closures were the factors most strongly associated with HFMD transmission.
