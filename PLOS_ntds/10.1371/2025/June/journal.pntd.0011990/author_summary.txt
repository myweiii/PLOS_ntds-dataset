Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, remains a major health concern in Southeast Asian cities. This study examines how urbanisation, mobility, and migration patterns influence dengue risk in Vientiane, Laos, between 2012 and 2018. Using high-resolution datasets, we assess how land-use change and population movements shape transmission dynamics.
Our findings reveal that dengue risk is highest in recently urbanised areas with high daytime population influx. These areas, often lacking adequate infrastructure, provide favourable conditions for Aedes mosquito breeding while also concentrating human activity at day, facilitating virus transmission. Migration patterns also play a role: villages with more foreign residents and Lao individuals born outside Vientiane—who may have lower immunity—reported higher dengue incidence. In contrast, villages with higher access to piped water exhibited lower dengue incidence, highlighting the role of infrastructure in disease prevention.
Importantly, while urban expansion consistently shaped dengue transmission, its influence varied across different epidemic phases, particularly with the emergence of Dengue 4. This suggests that urban factors interact with serotype dynamics, reinforcing the need for adaptive public health strategies. As Vientiane undergoes rapid transformation, integrating health risk assessment into urban planning will be crucial to prevent the unintended consequences of development on vector-borne disease transmission.
