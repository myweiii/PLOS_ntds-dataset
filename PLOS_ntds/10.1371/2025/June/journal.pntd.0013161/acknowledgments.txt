We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our participants in this study and the parents of our minor participants, without whom this achievement would not have been possible. We would also like to thank all the CERMEL laboratory teams (parasitology and clinical laboratories), as well as the field team, particularly the drivers, the nurses (Moussavou Saguiliba Hilda Scholastique, Tchibinda Bibalou Rebecca Debora Zoé, and Bibina Mihindou Jessica), and the field workers (Kengué Mbamba Daniella, Bissiélou John Steve, and Massandé Jean-Aimé) for their dedication to their work. AAA, MPG and JCDA are members of the EDCTP-NoE CANTAM.
