Helminths and protozoan infections pose major public health problems worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas where the climate and living conditions are favourable for their development. For a better estimate of their morbidity and better control of helminths in particular, epidemiological data are necessary for each endemic area. This information should help identify the impact of these infections in communities and establish more appropriate health policies. Gabon, a country in Central Africa, is endemic to both helminths and protozoa. While some epidemiological data on helminths exist, although they are sometimes old, epidemiological data on protozoa are rare. To fill this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in Moyen-Ogooué, one of Gabon’s nine provinces, during which we were able to randomly include 1,084 participants aged one year and over. Blood, stool and urine samples were obtained for the diagnosis of endemic helminths and protozoa via reference methods. Our results revealed that the prevalence of helminths and protozoa is moderate in Moyen-Ogooué Province and that their morbidity is linked to factors such as locality, occupation, age and gender, depending on the species of the parasite. Overall, these data highlight the need to implement control strategies adapted to the realities of our study area, which could, as we strongly believe, improve the health of these populations.
