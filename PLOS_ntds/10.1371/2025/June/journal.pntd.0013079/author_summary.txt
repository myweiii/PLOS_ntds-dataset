Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty and mainly affects deprived populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to control schistosomiasis have greatly reduced its prevalence over the past decades, but some hotspots of transmission remain. To achieve elimination, integrated interventions are recommended by the World Health Organization. We aimed to assess the contribution of multidisciplinary interventions that were adapted to the local micro-epidemiology for schistosomiasis elimination in Pemba, Tanzania, and to identify drivers for the occurrence of hotspots. Based on the results of annual surveys, we stratified our study area into “hotspot” and “low-prevalence” areas. In hotspots, interventions included the mass deworming of people, mollusciciding against the intermediate host snails, and health communication to induce a behavior change. In low-prevalence areas, we implemented a surveillance-response system. Every year, the intervention approach was adapted to the current endemic situation. Over the 4 study years, the adaptive multidisciplinary interventions maintained the very low prevalence in Pemba but failed to interrupt S. haematobium transmission. The comprehensive integrated intervention package reduced the number of hotspots. However, some hotspots persisted or resurged once interventions were adapted to surveillance-response. Schistosoma haematobium infections were particularly found in people residing near a water body containing intermediate host snails and in very rural areas and/or in households which had a very low economic score. To achieve complete elimination, poverty needs to be reduced and investments in global health equity, including the water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, are essential.
