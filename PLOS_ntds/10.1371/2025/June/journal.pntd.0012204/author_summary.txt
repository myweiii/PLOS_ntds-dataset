This study analyzed retrospective hospital-based data from individual AB cases for 2022 and 2023, as well as monthly case counts from 2016 to 2024, at S.K Hospital in Mymensingh. We observed a notable increase in severe bites (category 3) treated with Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG), rising from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% in 2023. Although only a small percentage of victims received vaccines on the same day as the bite (9.7% in 2022 and 16.9% in 2023), most were vaccinated within 24 hours. The study revealed seasonal patterns and a yearly increase in AB cases, with males and children under 14 being the most affected. Dogs and cats were the primary animals responsible for bites, and legs were the most frequently bitten body part. Four Upazilas were identified as high-risk areas. The findings emphasize the need for improved timely vaccination and healthcare practices. To reduce rabies risk, targeted awareness campaigns for high-risk groups such as males and children under 14, along with dog-focused prevention programs, are necessary. Collaboration among healthcare workers, veterinarians, policymakers, and communities is vital to control AB cases and eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030.
