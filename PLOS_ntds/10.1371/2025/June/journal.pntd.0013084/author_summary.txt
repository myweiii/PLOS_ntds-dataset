Dengue fever is a viral infection that can cause blood vessel leakage, leading to low blood pressure and shock. One sign of blood vessel leakage is hemoconcentration, whereby red blood cells becomes more concentrated in the blood stream. Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell (sTREM-1) is a molecule on the surface of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) that can be released into the circulation upon neutrophil activation. To investigate the relationship between sTREM-1 and vessel leakage, we conducted a prospective study of children and young adults with dengue fever in the Philippines. Elevated sTREM-1 level at the time of presentation to an outpatient clinic was associated with hemoconcentration. In turn, hemoconcentration was associated with a higher likelihood of hospitalization and greater need for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Patients with higher sTREM-1 levels also had elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, as well as elevated markers of endothelial activation (Ang2, sFlt1, and sVCAM-1). Our study highlights a potential role for sTREM-1 as a clinically informative marker to identify dengue patients at risk of vessel leakage.
