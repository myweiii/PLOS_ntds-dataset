Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmit dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, making their control crucial in India. Pyrethroid insecticides are widely used for mosquito control, but resistance is rising due to genetic mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene. These mutations, known as knockdown resistance (kdr), reduce insecticide sensitivity and pose a growing challenge to vector control efforts. We analyzed Ae. aegypti from eight Indian regions to identify five key VGSC mutations—S989P, V1016G, T1520I, F1534C, and F1534L—and examined their association with two intron types (A and B) between exons 20 and 21. Our findings reveal distinct mutation patterns across India, forming three haplogroups with no evidence of recombination among them. Importantly, we did not detect the highly resistant triple mutation (989P + 1016G + 1534C) on a single haplotype, which has been associated with extreme pyrethroid resistance in other regions. These findings suggest that pyrethroids may still be effective in India for now, but the spread of resistant mutations highlights the need for continuous surveillance and alternative control strategies, such as insecticide rotation and integrated pest management, to sustain effective mosquito control and protect public health.
