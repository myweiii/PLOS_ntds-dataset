Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and vertical transmission and is an important problem to solve. However, the immunopathology of pregnant VL remains unclear. Our study not only demonstrated reduced pregnancy rates and vertical transmission in pregnant VL mice, but also elucidated the immunopathology of the placenta, the maternal-fetal interface. It is suggested that IFN contribute to cellular immunosuppression and collapse of the placental barrier in the VL placenta, leading to vertical transmission. Importantly, placental degeneration and vertical transmission occurred even though few infected cells were observed in the placenta. The results indicate that the maternal immune response to Leishmania infection, rather than the direct interaction with Leishmania parasites, induces immunopathology and degeneration of the placenta and contributes to vertical transmission. Pregnant VL can have diverse effects on mother and child depending on complex factors such as the parasite species, host resistance, timing of infection, and gestation period. Based on our pioneering work, it is expected that further research on the pregnant VL immunopathology will be developed in the future.
