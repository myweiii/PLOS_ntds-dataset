Mehdi Elharrak, Bachir Harif, Sehhar El Ayachi, Elbia Abdelatif and Ahmim Mourad for their precious contribution during field work. We would also like to thank all the other people who took part in the sample collection work in the field, without whom this study would not have been possible. We are also grateful to the Laboratory for Urgent Response to Biological Threats (CIBU) at Institut Pasteur, and in particular Christophe Batéjat, for providing us with different materials for the validation of the pan-rhabdo RT-nqPCR. Lastly, we thank Gaston for his excellent technical experience in bat design.
