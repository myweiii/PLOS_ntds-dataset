Leishmaniasis is a neglected parasitic disease that causes significant health problems in humans as well as canine reservoirs. A safe and protective vaccine against leishmaniasis has not yet been developed. Leishmania spp. express glycoprotein 63 (GP63) which is a metalloprotease that acts as one of the parasiteâ€™s major surface antigens. In this study, we aimed to analyze the multi-copy GP63 gene in three different Leishmania species and determine a novel vaccine candidate antigen against leishmaniasis using sequencing data of locally detected Leishmania strains isolated from humans and in silico approaches. According to the results, the GP63 proteins selected for each Leishmania species were antigenic and contained many B and T cell epitopes. Each epitope selected was non-toxic, non-allergenic and soluble, with different antigenicity values. Among them, the epitopes EMEDQGSAGSAGSAGS, STHDSGSTTC and AEDILTDEKRDILRK were found to be more suitable for the development of vaccines and serologic tests. Furthermore, conserved epitopes identified between two or three Leishmania species can be valuable for vaccine development purposes.
