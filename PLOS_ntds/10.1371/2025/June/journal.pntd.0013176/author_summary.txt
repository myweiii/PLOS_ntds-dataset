Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting millions in sub-Saharan Africa, triggers complex immune responses that vary with age. This study, conducted in Zambia’s Mulobezi District, analyzed 143 participants (aged 5–55) to identify age-specific immune markers linked to infection. Using urine microscopy for diagnosis and blood tests to measure cytokines and blood cells, we found that 39% of participants had schistosomiasis.
Key findings revealed that interleukin-4 (IL-4), a protein driving immune defense against parasites, was strongly associated with infection in adults but not children. Lymphocytes, white blood cells critical for adaptive immunity, were elevated in both age groups, suggesting sustained immune activation. Traditional markers like eosinophils (allergy-related cells) and anti-inflammatory IL-10 lost significance after adjusting for other factors, highlighting their limited diagnostic specificity.
The age-dependent role of IL-4 implies that chronic exposure reshapes immune responses, potentially worsening tissue damage in adults. Persistent lymphocyte elevation across ages underscores their importance in combating infection. These findings advance our understanding of how immune mechanisms evolve with age and exposure, offering insights for improved diagnostics and tailored treatments. By identifying IL-4 and lymphocytes as robust biomarkers, this study paves the way for better surveillance strategies in high-risk regions, emphasizing the need for age-specific approaches in managing schistosomiasis.
