Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes symptoms such as fever, headache, rash, joint pain, and nausea. These symptoms are very similar to those of other common illnesses like malaria, making it difficult to diagnose correctly. In West Africa, many dengue cases go unrecognized or are confused with malaria or bacterial infections. A review of studies from Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Nigeria found that healthcare providers often rely on symptoms alone rather than using proper tests to confirm dengue. In many cases, patients were given antimalarial or antibiotic treatments even when tests for malaria were negative or there was no sign of bacterial infection. This inappropriate use of medication can harm patients and contribute to drug resistance. The most commonly used test in the reviewed studies was a rapid blood test for dengue. However, these tests were not used in all healthcare settings. The review highlights the urgent need to improve diagnostic practices in West Africa. By using proper testing, doctors can better distinguish dengue from other diseases. This would lead to more accurate treatment, reduce the misuse of antibiotics and antimalarials, and improve health outcomes in the region.
