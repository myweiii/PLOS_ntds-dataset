Lymphatic filariasis is a vector-borne disease that can cause significant disability. There is evidence that insecticide-treated nets used by malaria programs can contribute to lymphatic filariasis elimination, but current lymphatic filariasis programs primarily focus on mass drug administration. As funding for programs has stalled and interventions have become more costly, there is a greater interest and need for vector management to be better integrated across sectors and diseases, with WHO promoting integrated vector management specifically for countries co-endemic with LF and malaria. We sought to review the overlap in lymphatic filariasis prevalence and malaria insecticide-treated nets across endemic African countries to identify areas where net distribution can be enhanced. We used previously published, publicly available lymphatic filariasis prevalence and malaria insecticide-treated net coverage results from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the Malaria Atlas Project, respectively. Areas with high lymphatic filariasis prevalence were largely found to have low insecticide-treated net coverage. There is a need for disease programs to work together to maximize effective tools and methods to help achieve elimination goals. The impact of insecticide-treated nets on lymphatic filariasis prevalence will be location-specific and depend on a variety of epidemiological and programmatic factors.
