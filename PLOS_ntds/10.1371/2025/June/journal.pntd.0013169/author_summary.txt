Hantaviruses are known to be transmitted by rodents and cause severe diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Although there have been few reports of typical HFRS in Sri Lanka, there are many antibody-positive individuals. The antibody positivity rate is particularly high in patients with chronic kidney disease by unknown etiology (CKDu), and the relationship between hantavirus infection and CKDu is being discussed. Meanwhile, rodent surveys have identified Lanka virus in little Indian field mouse (Mus booduga) and Anjozorobe virus in black rat (Rattus rattus) in Sri Lanka. However, it was unclear which virus was infecting the humans and its pathogenicity. This study showed that hantavirus infections in Sri Lanka could be asymptomatic or cause common fever-like symptoms and rarely require treatment in an ICU. It was also shown that the main source of infection is Lanka virus. This study leads us to the starting line of clarifying the Lanka virus-related health risks, such as its association with CKDu.
