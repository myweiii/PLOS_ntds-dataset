    "Background": "In Sri Lanka, a high seroprevalence of antibodies against hantaviruses was reported in communities affected by chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). Recently, two rodent-borne hantaviruses, Lanka virus and Anjozorobe virus, were identified in these areas. However, it is unclear which virus is the source of infection in humans, and its pathogenicity is unknown.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "A total of 181 sera from febrile patients from two CKDu-endemic regions, Girandurukotte and Polonnaruwa, were examined and Lanka virus genome was detected in two IgM-positive febrile patients. Of 76 serum samples from patients with fever of unknown etiology collected during 2016 examined to identify hantavirus genomes, antibodies, and serotypes, 10 were IgG-positive with five of them having IgM also. They were all without clinical features of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, but three patients required treatment in the intensive care unit. A serotyping strategy was established based on the antigenic difference of the glycoprotein Gn of Lanka and Anjozorobe viruses. Using this method, febrile patients were found to be infected with the Lanka virus and none of the patient sera showed Anjozorobe virus infection pattern. Additionally, a total of 373 previously diagnosed seropositive serum samples from CKDu patients and healthy residents were serotyped to categorize 87% of seropositives as Lanka virus infection.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "Lanka virus carried by little Indian field mouse (Mus booduga) is transmitted to humans, likely causing febrile illness occasionally while leading to severe disease in some of the febrile patients."
