Clonorchis sinensis is a zoonotic parasite that can induce host liver fibrosis and even cholangiocarcinoma. Further study of the pathogenic mechanism of C. sinensis will help us develop new therapeutic targets for clonorchiasis. Ferroptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death, which is closely related to the occurrence of liver fibrosis, but the role of ferroptosis in C. sinensis-induced liver fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. In our study, ferroptosis was measured in vitro and in vivo by C. sinensis infection of C57BL/6 mice and stimulation of mouse normal hepatocytes AML12 with C. sinensis ESPs, respectively. And the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostain-1 (Fer-1) was used for treatment. The treatment with Fer-1 alleviated the C. sinensis-induced liver ferroptosis in vivo and the ESPs-induced AML12 ferroptosis in vitro, in addition to reducing the parasite load, alleviating liver lesions, and decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, inhibiting ferroptosis suppressed the TGF-Î²/Smad2/3 pathway and liver collagen deposition in C. sinensis-infected mice. These results indicate that inhibiting ferroptosis can alleviate liver fibrosis caused by C. sinensis. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of C. sinensis-induced host liver fibrosis and provide insights into developing novel therapeutic targets for this disease.
