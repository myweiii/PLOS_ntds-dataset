Autodissemination traps are an exciting new approach to controlling mosquito populations. These traps are especially useful for fighting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes because of their unique egg-laying behavior, where they spread their eggs across multiple sites. Testing the effectiveness of In2Care stations, a type of autodissemination trap, in real-world conditions in areas with high dengue transmission is important for understanding their potential. A total of 3,250 In2Care stations were set up in Goiânia, one of Brazil’s largest cities with a population of 1.45 million people. The fieldwork lasted for 14 months, and each trap was serviced every two months. To monitor the results, small egg traps called ovitraps were installed and checked weekly. This helped measure how effective the In2Care stations were in reducing mosquito breeding compared to areas without them. Over the course of the study, 666,204 mosquito eggs were collected. The number of In2Care stations varied by neighborhood, with densities ranging from 220 to 555 stations per square kilometer. The area with the highest number of stations saw a big drop in mosquito breeding: the number of positive ovitraps fell from 56.9% to 31.5%, and the number of eggs per trap dropped by 56%, from 41.2 to 18.1. However, in the other three sites, with In2Care density ranging between 220–340, no significant changes were seen. Overall, these findings suggest that In2Care stations can significantly reduce mosquito populations over large areas, especially when enough traps are in place.
