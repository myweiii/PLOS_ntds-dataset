    "Background": "Schistosomiasis is the world’s second-most important parasitic disease affecting humans. Among the two main forms of the disease, intestinal schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni is predominant in Cameroon, where its intermediate host Biomphalaria spp. is widely distributed, particularly in the Adamawa plateau. As a prerequisite to targeted vector control for effective elimination of intestinal schistosomiasis infection, we mapped the geographical distribution of Biomphalaria snails in the Adamawa Region.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A total of 43 human-water contact sites were visited across the Adamawa Region for snail collection. Snail species were identified morphologically and with PCR-RFLP technique at the ITS2 rDNA region using the HpaII restriction enzyme. The genus Biomphalaria was identified at 13 sites (30.2%), four sites (9,3%) harboured Gyraulus species firstly identified as Biomphalaria with shell morphology, and 22 sites (51,16%) were free from any snail species. Two Biomphalaria species were identified, Biomphalaria pfeifferi in 12 water contact sites, and Biomphalaria camerunensis was found only in one site (Djalingo, Vina Division), and it was the first report of this species in the Northern Cameroon (above the 6° latitude North). Morphologic identification was supported by PCR-RFLP results and sequencing revealed three haplotypes for Biomphalaria pfeifferi and one haplotype for Biomphalaria camerunensis. The studied populations were stable according to neutrality tests (Tajima’s D and Fu Fs) and no signal of gene flow was observed between them.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study confirmed the presence of Biomphalaria pfeifferi in the Adamawa Region and reported for the first time B. camerunensis above 6° of Latitude North, thus deserving further monitoring to assess its current distribution in Cameroon."
