The transmission of schistosomiasis depends on the distribution of specific freshwater snails that act as intermediate hosts for the parasiteâ€™s larval form. The World Health Organization recently recognised that efforts to interrupt schistosomiasis transmission through mass drug administration solely have not been sufficient in some regions to eliminate the infection and encouraged the control of these intermediate hosts as a complementary intervention. In this study, we mapped the distribution of Biomphalaria snails throughout the Adamawa Region of Cameroon and assessed the phylogenetical relationship between different populations as a prerequisite to snail control. Biomphalaria snails were found in four of the five Divisions of the Adamawa Region. In addition to B. pfeifferi that was the only species reported in previous studies, B. camerunensis was identified in the region for the first time. Genetic analysis revealed a slight intraspecific variation in B. pfeifferi and, that snail populations are stable on the field.
