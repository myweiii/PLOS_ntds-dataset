EV-A71 is the causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can occasionally progress to severe neurological complications and even death in young children. Inactivated monovalent EV-A71 vaccines have recently been marketed in China and Taiwan. However, vaccine potency can be permanently and irreversibly lost when exposed to extreme heat or UV light. Currently, no commercial tools are available to assess the stability of the EV-A71 vaccine. Therefore, developing an antibody to monitor vaccine potency is essential — not only to reduce the use of experimental animals, but also to minimize the wastage of both licensed and under-development vaccines due to potency loss. Here, we developed the monoclonal antibody NHRI2016–1, which can be used to quantitatively monitor vaccine potency in vitro and reflects its correlation with the in vivo immunogenicity of the EV-A71 vaccine antigen. This antibody-based approach offers a rapid, reproducible, and ethical alternative to traditional animal-based potency tests. Furthermore, the development of NHRI2016–1 represents a critical step toward ensuring consistent vaccine quality and safeguarding public health, particularly in regions where HFMD outbreaks are common.
