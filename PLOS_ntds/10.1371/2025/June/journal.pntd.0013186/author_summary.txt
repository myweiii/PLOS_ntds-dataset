Intestinal parasite burden consisting of helminths and protozoa causes serious public health problems worldwide. Studies conducted in Turkey indicate that this phenomenon is particularly prevalent among school-aged children. The primary motivation for this meta-analysis was the imperative to tackle this problem from a holistic perspective. Turkey consists of seven regions and 81 provinces. In a country with 86 million inhabitants, it is obvious that bringing together studies on the subject in such a study and sharing their problems with the scientific community and the public will raise awareness in the fight against intestinal parasites. In this study, the prevalence of IPI was 29% (I2 = 99.88, P < 0.001). When the regional subgroup analysis results were analyzed, it was 41% (I2 = 99.44, P < 0.001) in the Southeastern Anatolia region. A second subgroup, i.e., parasites, was examined separately and it was found that G. intestinalis/duedonalis/labmblia (11%; 95% CI: 9%-13%, I2 = 99.85) was the most frequently detected parasite in school-age children, followed by Blastocystis spp., Enterobius vermicularis, Entamoeba coli, Ascaris lumbricoides and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. The prevalence of IPI among school-age children is high in Turkey, especially in the Southeastern Anatolia, Mediterranean, and Eastern Anatolia regions. Socioeconomic conditions, education, and geography are the main factors contributing to this situation. It is of utmost importance that local authorities and the State initiate awareness raising and awareness training on IPI among school-age children and their families, focusing on mechanisms to prevent the transmission of parasitic agents.
