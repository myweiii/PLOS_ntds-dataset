Man-made water bodies such as dams and irrigation schemes, are built to improve water supply, provide energy, and enhance food security. However, dams and irrigation schemes may lead to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of schistosomiasis (Bilharzia), a neglected tropical disease (NTD) with water snails as intermediate hosts. Schistosomiasis poses a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly in low-income countries with inadequate water supply and poor sanitation. This scoping review and multi-case study assessed the impact on schistosomiasis following the construction of dams in Africa. Our results show that epidemiological data are available for only a tiny fraction of the ~ 1600 dams in operation in Africa. Data show that schistosomiasis does increase with the construction of dams but engineering and biological snail control measures, implemented in a few African countries, can reduce transmission risk. Example case studies further reflect on the successes and failures of implementation measures. We provided key recommendations which could be adopted by the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) as part of the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa Priority Action Plan. Dams are earmarked to be part of the AIP delivery towards climate resilient water and sanitation investments by 2030. Political commitment, advocacy and multisectoral collaboration to support a health and environment integrated approach to dam development will be essential for achieving success.
