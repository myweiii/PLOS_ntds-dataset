    "Background": "Water resources development (WRD), specifically infrastructural man-made water bodies such as dams and irrigation schemes, are built to improve water supply, provide energy, and enhance food security. However, dams and irrigation schemes may lead to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of schistosomiasis.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We conducted a scoping review of WRD impacts on schistosomiasis transmission risk in Africa using electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and grey literature. From 1483 retrieved records, we assessed 186 full-text papers and identified 122 articles covering 54 dams and irrigation schemes in 32 African countries. We found that, although the relationship between WRD and schistosomiasis transmission risk is well-documented in the scientific literature, the vast majority of the approximately 1,600 medium- to large-sized dams currently operating in endemic regions of Africa lack before-and-after prevalence data necessary to evaluate their actual impact on schistosomiasis transmission. Our analysis revealed that rigorous epidemiological data to assess WRDâ€™s effects exist for only 11 dams across 9 countries. Additionally, only a limited number of studies provided information on schistosomiasis control methods, surveillance, or monitoring for WRD. Few countries have implemented engineering and biological snail control measures, some of which have proven effective, enabling us to identify successful interventions employed at various stages of the WRD lifecycle. Lastly, to assess these measures in detail, we selected case studies from Africa that illustrate the success and challenges of schistosomiasis control with regard to WRD, thus gaining insights of the global relevance of lessons learnt for the future development of water resources.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our analysis highlighted that an integrated and coordinated approach is vital for the successful control of schistosomiasis transmission risk associated with Water Resources Development. We provide key recommendations which could be adopted by the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) with the ultimate goal of decreasing prevalence and moving towards elimination."
