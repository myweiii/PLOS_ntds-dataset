In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV remains a leading cause of premature adult death. Recent data suggest a link between rising HIV prevalence and the global increase in Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS), particularly in SSA countries like Ghana. The emergence of co-existing HIV-FGS cases has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to call for integrated services. This study explored stakeholder perspectives on integrating FGS prevention and control with HIV care in endemic areas of Ghana, specifically the Ga South Municipality in the Greater Accra Region. Qualitative interviews and discussion were conducted with Community Health Officers, healthcare stakeholders, individuals living with FGS, female household members, and community leaders. Participants were purposively selected, and data were thematically analyzed using NVivo 13. Findings revealed limited knowledge of FGS among both community members and health workers, with frequent misclassification of FGS as a sexually transmitted infection. Barriers to integration included stigma, resource shortages, provider attitudes, and cultural beliefs. The study recommends developing clinical protocols, training health workers, and enhancing collaboration to support early detection and integrated care for FGS and HIV.
