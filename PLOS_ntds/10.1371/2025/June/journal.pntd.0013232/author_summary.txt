Dengue is a serious health issue worldwide, spread by mosquitoes and affected by multiple factors. By studying multi-source factors, including historical cases, population, climate, air travel, forest, anemia, vector, serotype and socioeconomic factors, machine learning models were developed to predict annual dengue cases globally. In addition, impact of the factors on dengue was explored. Historical cases of dengue were found to be the most important factor and the presence of Aedes mosquitoes, changes in the main type of dengue virus and the level of anemia in a population can increase the risk of dengue. Additionally, in areas where dengue is hyperendemic, historical cases and population play a bigger role, showing how important community immunity is in controlling dengue. In conclusion, dengue is affected by many different factors, and strategies to prevent and control it need to be tailored to each regionâ€™s specific circumstances to effectively manage dengue outbreaks.
