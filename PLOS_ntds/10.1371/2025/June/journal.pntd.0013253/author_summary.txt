This study evaluated the use of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing to identify and analyze species of Sporothrix spp., a group of dimorphic fungi that cause sporotrichosis. The research focused on the calmodulin gene as a more reliable tool for species identification and phylogenetic analysis compared to the commonly used Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. By sequencing isolates from humans and felines in Thailand, the authors found that ONT sequencing of the calmodulin gene effectively classified the isolates as S. schenckii sensu stricto, offering better resolution than ITS sequencing, which struggled with species discrimination. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered within a specific subclade of S. schenckii sensu stricto, with a distinct geographic association to Southeast Asia. Additionally, the study highlighted the presence of elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to itraconazole in several isolates. Altogether, these findings underscore the utility of ONT calmodulin sequencing for accurate identification and phylogenetic studies of Sporothrix.
