Intestinal parasite infections (IPI) and co-infections with several parasite species (multiparasitism) are considered to cause significant disease among young children in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and elimination of mortality and morbidity attributable to IPI among preschool children by 2030 has been prioritized by WHO. We followed a random sample of children from a birth cohort to 8 years of age in a rural area of coastal Ecuador for the acquisition of IPI with parasite detection being done using highly sensitive molecular methods. Almost all children acquired IPI during follow-up and approximately half had multiparasitism by 8 years. Risk of multiparasitism was associated with indicators of marginalisation (Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicity and peri-urban residence), household poverty (low household income), exposure to other children inside (being lower in the birth order) and outside (day care attendance) the household, and parasite infections among household members. IPI during childhood was associated with reduced growth (height and weight), and lower hemoglobin levels, while children with multiparasitism suffered the greatest growth deficits. There remains a need for the implementation of integrated control strategies including access to clean water and improved sanitation, health education, and preventive chemotherapy that could target whole communities to reduce the infection reservoir. Preventive chemotherapy with broad-spectrum drugs (e.g., nitazoxanide) with anthelmintic and antiprotozoal effects, even if targeted only to pre-school and school-age children and women of child-bearing age, could improve growth during childhood in marginalized populations living in endemic settings.
