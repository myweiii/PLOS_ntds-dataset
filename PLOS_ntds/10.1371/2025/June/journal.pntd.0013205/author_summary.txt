Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in Argentina is a devastating disease with a fatality rates up to 50%. Andes virus (ANDV) is the most frequent causative agent of this infection in Argentina, and was associated with two outbreaks of sustained person-to-person transmission. The paucity of studies for vaccine development and other medical countermeasures (MCMs) against hantaviruses was partially due to the limited access to wild type viral strains and the lack of animal models of diseases. American hantaviruses are very difficult to isolate “in vitro” and “in vivo”, and there are only three strains of ANDV from Chile and Argentina that could be propagated in cell culture, but none of them were associated to person-to-person transmission. Also, the ANDV strain most used in “in vitro” and “in vivo” studies were not involved in human disease and has a unclear history of cell passages. In our work we report the isolation of an ANDV strain associated with disease in humans but, most importantly, with person-to-person transmission (Epuyén outbreak in 2018). In this article we also describe the results of the characterization of this strain proving its ability to infect and spread efficiently between hamsters. Our work represents a critical step towards the development of MCMs against this emerging pathogen.
