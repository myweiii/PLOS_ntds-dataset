Mosquitoes are vectors of diseases that affect humans and animals. Despite their global significance, there is still much to learn about their diversity and behavior. We examined host-seeking adult female mosquito diversity, abundance, and activity patterns in southern Mexico’s semi-conserved coastal area of Isla del Carmen. Human landing collection sampling was conducted monthly in mangrove and semideciduous forest habitats for over a year, covering an entire 24-hour cycle during different seasons. Among the 26 recorded species, 84% are known vectors of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and encephalitis. The results revealed mosquito diversity and activity peak during the norte season, characterized by cooler temperatures and moderate rainfall. The black salt marsh mosquito, Aedes taeniorhynchus, was the most dominant species due to its ability to thrive in the region’s brackish and freshwater habitats. Other medically important mosquito species were recorded, highlighting the potential health risks for humans and wildlife. This research provides essential baseline data for understanding mosquito populations in tropical coastal ecosystems, designing disease control strategies, and preserving ecological balance, particularly as climate and land use changes may alter mosquito distribution and activity in the future. This work bridges the gap between mosquito ecology and its public health and conservation implications.
