Melioidosis is a tropical infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. The diagnosis is confirmed by the growth of B. pseudomallei. Pulmonary melioidosis is the most common organ involvement of melioidosis with a high fatal rate. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is life-threatening lung injury characterized by poor oxygenation and non-compliant (stiff) lungs. Poor outcome has been reported in pulmonary melioidosis with ARDS. We aimed to identify clinical characteristics and potential risk factors between patients with pulmonary melioidosis with and without ARDS. Our study demonstrated that excessive alcohol consumption and a low BMI status in patients with pulmonary melioidosis could predict the development of ARDS.
