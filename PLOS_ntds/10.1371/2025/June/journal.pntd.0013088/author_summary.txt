Our research focuses on the interplay between schistosome infection, host microbiome composition, host behavior, and inflammation in a mouse model. This work aimed to understand the potential effects of schistosome-induced microbiome disruption on childhood cognitive development as schistosome infection is a common early childhood disease in many under-resourced areas. Using two cohorts of mice, we ran well-established behavioral tests looking at anxiety, fear, compulsion, spatial learning, and memory, comparing results between schistosome-infected and uninfected mice. The marked taxon shifts in the fecal microbiota communities during the chronic stages of infection were those typically associated with protective effects on liver disease and inflammatory gut conditions, suggesting a possible protective role of the shifted microbiome. This work uncovers behavioral and cognitive impacts of schistosome infection and fits well within the scope of exploring microbiome interactions towards supporting future global health efforts.
