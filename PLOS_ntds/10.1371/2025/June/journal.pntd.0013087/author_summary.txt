Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe disease that affects thousands of people worldwide, particularly in areas with limited healthcare resources. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial because VL can be fatal if left untreated. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed to offer fast, simple, and affordable diagnoses, making them particularly useful in remote regions. However, these tests donâ€™t always perform equally well across different patient groups, such as children and individuals with weakened immune systems, including those co-infected with HIV. This study evaluated three commercially available RDTs for VL, focusing on their accuracy across diverse patient profiles in Brazil. The results showed that while these tests are generally reliable, they are less sensitive in children under 3 years of age and in HIV-positive patients. These findings highlight the importance of considering patient characteristics when using RDTs in the field, as certain groups may require alternative or supplementary diagnostic approaches to ensure accurate detection of the disease.
