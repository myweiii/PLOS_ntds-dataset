A multimethod approach in paleoparasitology, combining microscopy, ELISA and aDNA, provides a more complete reconstruction of past parasite diversity. Applying this multimethod approach to a diverse set of archeological sediment samples from 6400 BCE to 1500 CE provided insights into temporal changes in parasite diversity in the human past. Microscopy can be used as an effective screening tool for helminths in paleofecal samples, while ELISA is necessary for detection of protozoa, and sedaDNA using targeted enrichment can identify additional taxa and confirm species identification. Targeted enrichment using a comprehensive parasite bait set allows for detection of ancient human parasites and recovery of ancient parasite DNA from as little as 0.25â€‰g of sediment. This multimethod approach reveals that parasite diversity decreased in the Roman period due to a decrease in zoonotic parasites and concurrent increase in fecal-oral parasites, a pattern which is consistent during the medieval period.
