Leptospirosis is a significant public health problem in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounting for one-third of all reported outbreaks globally between 1970 and 2012. In the Dominican Republic (DR), 2,860 human leptospirosis cases were reported to the General Epidemiology Directorate of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance between 2013 and 2023. The countryâ€™s warm and humid climate facilitates leptospirosis transmission. However, environmental and sociodemographic drivers can vary across regions, resulting in a geographically heterogeneous distribution of infection. This study aimed to identify areas with a higher prevalence of leptospirosis seropositivity (clusters) of leptospirosis seroprevalence in two provinces of the DR using flexible spatial scan statistics. This approach allowed us to investigate the existence of clusters in each province. Additionally, we used logistic regression to identify environmental and sociodemographic drivers associated with clusters in each province. Our findings suggest the presence of clusters in both provinces, with different sets of significant drivers identified in each province. Notably, drivers associated with clusters in both provinces were highly indicative of socioeconomically vulnerable populations, highlighting leptospirosis as a disease of poverty. These results underscore the need for geographically targeted and tailored interventions to reduce leptospirosis disease burden in at-risk communities.
