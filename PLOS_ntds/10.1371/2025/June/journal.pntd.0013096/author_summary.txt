In areas nearing malaria elimination, where only a few cases remain, these are either sporadically disseminated throughout the country or found in hotspots where epidemics are recurrent. These persisting pockets need to be thoroughly investigated to understand the human, entomological, and environmental conditions that explain their persistence.
Our work focuses on one of these areas in French Guiana, where two micro-epidemics occurred in 2017 and 2018 in a border village of 200-inhabitants. We described the location and nightly dynamics of the main malaria vector in the area, Anopheles darlingi, as well as the potential at-risk and protective human behaviours when and where that vector is present. The inadequacy of anti-vectorial protection for outdoor and evening activities, despite the presence of the vector, highlights the need to supplement bed nets with other acceptable and free protection. New acceptable protection needs to be developed against outdoor bites, with complementary strategies added in the meantime. The persistence of malaria vectors at night indicates that frequent bed net distribution should be maintained, along with education about bed net care. Additionally, education campaigns about protective tools and prompt healthcare-seeking are also required.
