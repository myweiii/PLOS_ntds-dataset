SFTS is a zoonotic disease with high mortality. While research has implicated HLH as a leading fatal complication of SFTS, the majority of these studies have focused on isolated cases, lacking comprehensive correlation analysis. This study identifies a decreased alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ratio, along with elevated levels of LDH and DD, as independent predictors of HLH development in patients with SFTS. Additionally, age ≥ 64 years, fibrinogen levels ≤2.23 g/L, and procalcitonin levels ≥0.9 ng/mL collectively serve as significant prognostic markers for mortality in cases of SFTS complicated by HLH. Continuous monitoring of fibrinogen and procalcitonin levels enhances the real-time assessment of disease progression, facilitating timely interventions to reduce mortality.
