There is an urgent need for a sensitive, specific, and rapid test for congenital Chagas disease (CD) infections. A urinary test detecting protein fragments deriving from the causative agent Trypanosoma cruzi would be well-suited to congenital CD diagnostics due to the ease of collecting urine from infants and the potential for highly accurate detection, with minimal false positive and false negative results. Here, we present a pipeline that led to the discovery of many T. cruzi-specific peptides in urine samples collected from infants born to infected mothers in rural Bolivia. We designed antibodies against the most promising biomarkers and validated those antibodies in patient samples. Due to our use of innovative affinity concentration techniques, which allow for the concentration of low-abundance biomarkers and the exclusion of potentially interfering host proteins, we were able to achieve greater than 85% sensitivity and specificity using these biomarkers. One of these biomarkers has never been used in CD diagnostic testing. We also include experimental evidence validating the reagents for a lateral flow immunoassay, which requires minimal training and equipment to perform and therefore has transformative potential to increase access to care for individuals in rural and remote communities, where CD is most common.
