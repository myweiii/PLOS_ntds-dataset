Mumps is an inflammatory disease caused by the mumps virus. High-risk groups include children and adolescents, which may be related to a weaker immune system or ineffective vaccination. Serological surveillance of mumps is key to estimating population susceptibility and evaluating the effectiveness of the current vaccination strategy. China has adjusted a two-dose MMR program for approximately four years, but there is limited research on the immunological effects of the two-dose MMR on mumps. In this study, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the levels of anti-mumps IgG antibodies in the serum of healthy population participants in China, and analyzed the mumps seroprevalence between different groups. We found a declining trend in the healthy population after two doses of vaccination. The findings in this study will guide the reform of public health strategies for mumps control and prevention, as well as the adaptation of vaccination program.
