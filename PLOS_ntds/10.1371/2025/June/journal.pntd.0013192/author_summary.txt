Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by filarial worms. Indiaâ€™s successful implementation of the elimination strategy in all 345 endemic districts has resulted in stopping MDA in 138 districts, and 68 have completed all three serial TAS. As more districts stop MDA, India will move towards certification, and the process requires showing that even the non-endemic or unsurveyed areas are free of LF. We have evaluated the existing sampling strategies used in endemic areas for assessing transmission and found that both school- and community- based confirmatory mapping tools (Mini-sTAS, and Mini-cTAS) and the molecular xenomonitoring for vector infection were sensitive strategies to assess LF endemicity in non-MDA or unsurveyed areas.
