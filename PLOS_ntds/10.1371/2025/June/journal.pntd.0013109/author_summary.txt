Burkholderia pseudomallei was first discovered in 1912 and is prevalent in tropical regions. It primarily persists in subsurface soil layers at 30â€‰cm depth; extreme weather events such as tropical storms or sustained heavy precipitation can induce groundwater elevation and rainfall-driven soil erosion, mobilizing the pathogen to surface environments. Contact with the human respiratory tract and broken skin may lead to infection. B. pseudomallei can remain latent in the human body for months to years, with a rapid onset and high mortality rate. It also has natural resistance to a variety of first-line antimicrobial drugs. Timely, convenient, and easily accessible surveillance methods are crucial for diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited areas. We have proposed a detection method using Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) combined with RNase HII and a lateral flow strip, which meets the application conditions of the aforementioned regions. It is also suitable for screening during large-scale outbreaks, providing a new strategy and method for practitioners who are limited by various conditions and cannot identify B. pseudomallei. This method offers a timely, convenient, and easily deployable surveillance approach that is crucial for areas with limited resources.
