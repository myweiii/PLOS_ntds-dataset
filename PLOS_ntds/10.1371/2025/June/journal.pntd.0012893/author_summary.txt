Anthrax is a recurring zoonotic disease in Zambia, particularly in Game Management Areas (GMAs), where human-wildlife-livestock interactions are high. This study examines the socio-economic impacts of anthrax outbreaks on rural communities, focusing on food insecurity and livelihood vulnerabilities. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected quantitative data from structured surveys and qualitative insights from focus group discussions across three study sites: Simalaha Community Conservancy, Lochinvar, and Blue Lagoon National Parks. Our findings highlight that most households depend on subsistence farming and livestock rearing as their primary livelihoods. However, frequent droughts, limited access to education, and inadequate social safety nets exacerbate economic hardship. The study reveals that anthrax outbreaks significantly disrupt food security by decimating livestock, an essential source of nutrition and income. Communities adopt alternative coping strategies such as charcoal burning, fishing, and gardening, yet these activities may inadvertently increase exposure to anthrax spores and other zoonotic risks. This study underscores the urgent need for integrated interventions to enhance community resilience. Policies promoting livelihood diversification, such as beekeeping and poultry farming, could help mitigate the dual threats of climatic shocks and zoonotic diseases. Moreover, gender-sensitive approaches are essential, as women bear a disproportionate burden of food insecurity. Strengthening disease surveillance, improving access to veterinary services, and supporting sustainable economic activities are crucial steps toward safeguarding both public health and rural livelihoods in GMAs in Zambia.
