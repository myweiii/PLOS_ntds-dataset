The Ebola and Lassa fever viruses are both causative agents of hemorrhagic fevers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite garnering global attention during the West African Ebola Epidemic of 2014 the mechanisms through which these viruses cause disease and their immunopathology remain poorly understood. This is problematic as both continue to plague the region through new epidemics, re-emergence of disease in those previously infected, and devastating Post-viral syndromes. Both viruses are rare diseases limiting the ability of researchers to generate robust data which hinders the understanding of both the acute and convalescent phases of disease. This systematic review synthesizes the known evidence of immune dysfunction and provides further analysis to generate more generalizable data to aid in identifying key pathways in the immune response. In this way, this work may lead to the development of therapeutics to reduce disease severity, improve survival, and the prevention and treatment of convalescent post-viral syndromes.
