    "Abstract": "Schistosomiasis affects more than 230 million people worldwide. Control and elimination of this parasitic infection is based on mass drug administration of praziquantel (PZQ), which has been in use for several decades. Because of the limitations of the efficacy of PZQ especially against juvenile worms, and the threat of the emergence of resistance, there is a need to consider alternative formulations or delivery methods, or new drugs that could be more efficacious. We use an individual-based stochastic model of parasite transmission to investigate the effects of possible improvements to drug efficacy. We consider an increase in efficacy compared to PZQ, as well as additional efficacy against the juvenile life stage of schistosome parasites in the human host, and a slow-release formulation that would provide long-lasting efficacy for a period of time following treatment. Analyses suggest a drug with a high efficacy of 99%, or with efficacy lasting 24 weeks after treatment, are the two most effective individual improvements to the drug profile of PZQ. A drug with long lasting efficacy is most beneficial when MDA coverage is low. However, when prevalence of infection has already been reduced to a low level, a high efficacy is the most important factor to accelerate interruption of transmission. Our results indicate that increased efficacy against juvenile worms can only result in modest benefits, but the development of a new drug formulation with higher efficacy against adult worms or long-lasting efficacy would create an improvement to the community impact over the currently used formulation."
