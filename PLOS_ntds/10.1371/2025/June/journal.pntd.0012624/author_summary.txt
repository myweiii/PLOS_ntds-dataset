The World Health Organization has set the target of elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. Currently, praziquantel is the sole drug used in mass drug administration (MDA) for schistosomiasis, raising concerns about the potential evolution of resistance and whether an improved drug profile would be necessary to achieve elimination and the more ambitious goal of interruption of transmission. We present the results from an individual-based stochastic mathematical model that simulates schistosome transmission and the impact of MDA. Three potential improvements to the properties of the drug are considered: improved efficacy, long lasting efficacy post a single treatment and improved efficacy against the juvenile life stage of the schistosome. Our findings reveal that with good coverage, an improved drug efficacy is best at reducing prevalence and achieving interruption of transmission. However, when MDA quality is compromised due to low coverage, infrequent treatment or high rates of non-adherence, then a long-lasting efficacy performs best. There is only a modest benefit of improved drug efficacy against juvenile schistosomes. These results highlight the importance of providing frequent treatment at high coverage levels in the population and inform future drug development aims.
