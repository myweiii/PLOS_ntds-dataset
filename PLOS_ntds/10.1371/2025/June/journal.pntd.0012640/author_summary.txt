Urogenital schistosomiasis and female genital schistosomiasis continue to be among the neglected tropical diseases, posing challenges in accurately determining the true burden of these diseases. Female genital schistosomiasis, a gynaecological manifestation of Schistosoma haematobium, affects a significant number of women and young girls in regions where schistosomiasis is endemic. Some women suffering from female genital schistosomiasis are frequently misdiagnosed with conditions such as human papilloma virus (HPV) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Integrating the surveillance of these neglected diseases into existing healthcare programmes, such as cervical cancer screening and HIV/STI and existing reproductive health services, offers opportunities for a comprehensive approach to patient screening and disease control. This study outlines the current neglected tropical diseases programme in South Africa and identifies opportunities for enhancing surveillance. Despite the neglect and challenges related to sustainability and under-reporting, the presence and utilization of surveillance systems in South Africa highlight the country’s potential for prioritization and integration to improve the prevention, surveillance, reporting, and management of schistosomiasis, as well as the introduction of surveillance for female genital schistosomiasis. Furthermore, establishing sentinel sites would provide opportunities to establish baseline prevalence and enhance monitoring of progress towards elimination.
