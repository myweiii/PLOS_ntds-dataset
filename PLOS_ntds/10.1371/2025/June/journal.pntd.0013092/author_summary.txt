Ticks have become a critical public health concern after the emergence of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, a deadly tick-borne disease, in Türkiye. This systematic review shows the distribution of human-biting ticks in Türkiye according to their genera and species. We report that Hyalomma and Ixodes as primary vectors for disease. These ticks are known disease spreaders for Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Lyme disease. Depending on the ecological conditions in the following years, new vector-borne infections may occur. We recommend standardized methodologies and reporting systems to avoid false identification and reduce unidentified tick species in future reports because they affect the assessment and management of the patients having tick bites.
