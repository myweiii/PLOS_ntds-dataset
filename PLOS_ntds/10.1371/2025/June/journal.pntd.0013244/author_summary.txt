Epilepsy is a serious neurological condition that affects millions of people worldwide. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa where river blindness (onchocerciasis) is common, epilepsy prevalence is often high, and many individuals develop a severe form called nodding syndrome. In this study, we conducted house-to-house surveys in five counties of South Sudan, in a region where onchocerciasis remains widespread. We found that epilepsy prevalence was 4%—more than twice the regional average—and people with epilepsy were nearly seven times more likely to die prematurely than those without epilepsy. The highest epilepsy prevalence (up to 7%) was observed in villages near fast-flowing rivers, where blackflies—the insects that transmit onchocerciasis—breed. In these same areas, we found that young children had high levels of antibodies against the parasite that causes onchocerciasis (up to 44%), suggesting ongoing transmission despite control efforts. These findings add to the growing evidence that ongoing onchocerciasis transmission may contribute to epilepsy burden. Our results highlight the urgent need to strengthen onchocerciasis elimination programmes and improve access to antiseizure medication for affected communities to potentially reduce new epilepsy cases and prevent epilepsy-related deaths.
