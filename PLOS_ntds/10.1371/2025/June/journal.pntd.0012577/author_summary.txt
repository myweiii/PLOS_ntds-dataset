Neglected tropical diseases disproportionately affect impoverished populations, primarily in tropical regions. With increasing global migration, individuals infected with neglected tropical diseases may move to countries where these diseases are not typically found, making early diagnosis and treatment essential. We demonstrate how statistical models can be used to aid the identification of people who may be infected with these parasitic diseases. Our focus is on showing how publicly available information on the country of origin of migrants, can be combined with individual-level information collected from screening centres, to improve the predictive performance in the identification of infected cases. We look at a specific neglected tropical disease known as soil-transmitted helminth infections and use a case-study of migrants in the Campania region, southern Italy to conduct our investigation.
