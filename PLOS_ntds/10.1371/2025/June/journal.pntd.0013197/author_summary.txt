Sleeping sickness is a neglected disease caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. If left untreated, sleeping sickness is fatal. Until recently, treatment has been limited and toxic, affecting community participation in screening and treatment. This has been a barrier to achieving the 2030 WHO elimination goal. Today, however, a new oral drug with no side effects is being tested: acoziborole. The use of this single-dose oral drug would simplify the process of screening and treatment, allowing a “screen and treat” strategy to be used for all suspected cases on the spot, without the need for complex confirmatory testing. For this to succeed, it will be necessary to have full community participation in active screening and treatment. Ensuring community participation can be a real challenge in the fight against sleeping sickness. A number of studies have highlighted the various barriers that prevent people from participating in active gHAT screening and treatment. We therefore undertook a qualitative with to aim to identify potential bottlenecks and encourage participation in a future screening and treatment strategy. We found that the community was receptive to the new oral sleeping sickness drugs, but had some concerns about possible side effects.
