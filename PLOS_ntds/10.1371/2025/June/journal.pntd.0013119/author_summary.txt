Scabies is a skin infestation due to the mite Sarcoptes scabei var homini which causes intense itch, negative impact on quality of life, and commonly leads to secondary bacterial skin infections and their sequelae. Anecdotal reports suggest high burdens of scabies and bacterial skin infection in French Polynesia, but prevalence data have been missing. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of these skin diseases in the main islands of Tahiti and Moâ€™orea. In a cross-sectional survey, we used validated simplified diagnostic criteria to diagnose scabies, and found that 11.9% of 1770 participants had scabies, and 5.5% had bacterial skin infection, which is comparable to rates found in other Pacific contexts. Participants with scabies were ten times more likely to have bacterial skin infection, and children carried the highest burden of both diseases. These results support the need for community-wide public health interventions to reduce the prevalence of scabies, such as through mass drug administration.
