Loiasis is endemic in Western and Central Africa and affects more than 10 million individuals. Currents knowledge of its ocular manifestations is limited to the transient subconjunctival passage of the adult worm and anecdotal case reports of severe lesions such as optic neuritis and retinal hemorrhage. Consequently, loiasis has repeatedly failed to meet WHOâ€™s morbidity and mortality criteria for inclusion in the strategic plan for neglected tropical diseases. We aimed to provide additional evidence to support this inclusion by studying the relationship of Loa loa microfilaremia and recent eye worm passage with chronic ocular lesions by performing a systematic ophthalmological assessment of community-dwelling adults in an endemic area. For the first time, we provide evidence that, contrary to prior knowledge, severe ocular lesions such as chorioretinitis are highly prevalent (14.3%) in people with high Loa loa microfilarial loads (MFL) and significantly associated with moderate-to-severe visual impairment. Specifically, people with a high MFL (>8000 mf/mL) are 5 times more likely to have chorioretinitis than those with low MFL or without infestation, independent of age, sex, co-infestation with other filaria, and cardiovascular risk factors. We also report that people with recent eye worm migration were 3 times more likely to have unilateral ametropia. Our findings contradict perceptions that loiasis is a benign disease and suggest that it should be classified as a neglected tropical disease. Such reclassification will boost the design and funding of cost-effective public health strategies to eliminate loiasis.
