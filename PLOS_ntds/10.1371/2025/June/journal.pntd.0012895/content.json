    "Introduction": "Sentinel (active or proactive) surveillance is defined as the repeated collection of information from same selected individuals or groups to identify changes in the health status of a specified population over time [1]. It is complementary to passive (reactive or clinical) surveillance designs where health adverse events are reported by stakeholders (e.g., hospitals, veterinarians, …) as part of their usual activities [2–4]. Sentinels may also specifically refer to animals that are periodically monitored and positioned nearby human populations for the surveillance of human health hazards [5]. Although it often requires substantial resources, active surveillance has the advantage to provide a less biased and more complete picture of an infection occurrence [3,6]. It is particularly useful for pathogens that are under-reported by passive surveillance, for instance when asymptomatic infections are frequent as with arboviruses [7,8] or in settings with limited routine surveillance capabilities [9]. Active surveillance is also adapted to zoonotic diseases arising from wildlife, because human infections then result from incidental transmissions from an animal reservoir source with generally less known demographic (movements, interactions between individuals and populations) and epidemiological (pathogen prevalence and mortality) patterns [10]. When such wildlife zoonotic pathogens circulate endemically, it then becomes appropriate to monitor infections in sentinels from better-followed populations such as domestic animals [11–13].\nWest Nile virus (WNV), an Orthoflavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes mostly of the Culex genus, meets most of these criteria. Indeed, wild birds are primary WNV reservoirs, although the virus can spread to mammals including horses and humans [14]. In both species, WNV infection is most often asymptomatic but may result in febrile forms (dengue-like symptoms in humans) and, in some cases, in severe neurological symptoms sometimes leading to death. These species are considered “dead-end hosts” since biting mosquitoes cannot get infected after feeding on them nor further transmit the virus [14,15]. However, WNV can still spread among humans through blood transfusions and organ transplantations from asymptomatic infected donors [16,17]. It is therefore of interest for both human and animal health to monitor its circulation over time and space. This is why simultaneous multi-host surveillance of this pathogen has been emphasized [7,18]. Indeed, WNV sentinel surveillance in many countries has been implemented in multiple host species such as horses, wild and domestic birds or zoo animals, and in vectors [19–35].\nIn the Americas, WNV was first reported in New York (United States) in 1999, and subsequently spread to the rest of North America, Latin America and the Caribbean [36,37]. Guadeloupe archipelago (French West Indies, Caribbean) has a tropical climate and is populated by ~384,000 inhabitants. WNV circulation in this island was first documented in 2002 when anti-WNV antibodies were found in horses [38]. Following this discovery, a surveillance program was implemented in humans, horses, chickens and mosquitoes using several designs, namely serosurveys, active, sentinel (including based on risk areas) and passive surveillance [39]. Although no clinical case in humans nor horses was reported on the archipelago until 2024 [40,41], anti-WNV antibodies were occasionally detected in horses and chickens throughout two decades [39,42], suggesting its silent circulation.\nMathematical and statistical models may allow inferring the dynamics of pathogens’ force of infection in both competent and incidental hosts, using serological data as markers of past infection [43–46]. Such models were used to infer on transmission patterns of other mosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, Japanese Encephalitis, Dengue or Chikungunya viruses [47–53]. Previous studies also fitted or validated mechanistic models of WNV transmission to serological data [54–56], although not using more than two years of data.\nHere, our objective was to quantify the level of silent circulation of WNV in Guadeloupe between 2002 and 2017. We developed a Bayesian model fitted to longitudinal serological data collected in sentinel chickens and horses, to reconstruct both within-year (seasonal) and between-years variations in the WNV force of infection and to estimate key parameters of its epidemiology and testing.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAnimal samplings have been performed following guidelines and legislation applicable to the surveillance of animal and public health risks (Regulation (EU) 2016/429 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on transmissible animal diseases and amending and repealing certain acts in the area of animal health (‘Animal Health Law’)); they have been performed by veterinarians with sanitary authorizations upon request of the veterinary services (DAAF971).\n\n\nSerological surveillance data\nFor this study, we analyzed longitudinal serological data collected between 2002 and 2018 in domestic animals in Guadeloupe (Fig 1). Because no clinical case was detected on the archipelago before 2024, the sampling in our study was not driven by animal sickness. Following the introduction of WNV in the Caribbean, almost exhaustive serosurveys were carried out in Guadeloupe horses (2002–2004) [38,42]. Then, a sentinel surveillance scheme was implemented, with horses (starting in 2005) and chickens (starting in 2013) sampled repeatedly in sites assumed to be at higher risk for viral circulation based on a previous study [57]. Finally, we also performed more extended serosurveys following the detection of anti-WNV antibodies in sentinel sites. Our serological dataset collated these multiple surveys. Identifiers associated with each sample allowed us to reconstruct the sequence of serological results for each animal, and individuals with only one result were discarded from the analysis. Some horses moved within Guadeloupe during the period of the study, as part of activities related to the equine industry (e.g., horse riding tours or competitions) or because they changed stable.\nPanels A, C and D represent the number of sampling sites per commune, respectively in equine, chicken and mosquito populations. The location was missing for two horse sampling sites (representing 8 out of 1,022 samples). Panel B represents the location of Guadeloupe archipelago in the Caribbean. The base layer maps for this figure were obtained from GADM (https://gadm.org/license.html) and geoBoundaries (https://www.geoboundaries.org/).\nOverall, WNV serological statuses were determined from 1,022 sera sampled from 256 horses in 10 equine centers between July 2002 and February 2018, and from 3,649 sera sampled from 317 chickens in four chicken farms between November 2013 and August 2018 (Figs 1 and 2). The median number of samples per individual was 3 (interquartile range [2; 5]) in horses and 7 (IQR [2; 18]) in chickens (S1 Fig).\nData is represented aggregated by quarter and the x-axis scale is standardized with S4 Fig.\nAnti-WNV IgG antibodies were detected in sera using inhibition or competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Epitope Blocking ELISA, targeting respectively anti-NS1 and E antibodies) as previously described [38,58,59]. Both ELISA assays were validated for horse and chicken sera. Threshold values defining ELISA-positives were as specified by the manufacturer for the ELISA E commercial kit, or as determined during the development and validation for the ELISA NS1 [60]. Positive samples were then tested by virus neutralization test at the French Reference Laboratory (ANSES).\nWe did not have the information on animals’ age at sampling to compute their past exposure to the virus. Therefore, we used the time between consecutive samples taken from same individuals (i.e., pairs of samples) to infer the virus’ force of infection (FOI) most likely to explain serological transitions (e.g., seroconversions). The median duration between consecutive samples in same individuals was 376 days, i.e., 54 weeks, in horses (IQR [306; 593]) and 14 days in chickens (IQR [14; 14]). We discarded two pairs of samples separated by more than 5 years, because we could not reasonably exclude that these animals had undergone more than one serological transition during that period (seroconversion followed by a seroreversion, or the opposite).\n\n\nEntomological surveillance data\nAn entomological surveillance program was set up bi-monthly from November 2015 using CDC CO2 mosquito traps (John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL) at four sites located near sentinel chicken farms to monitor mosquito population abundances [39,61] (Fig 1). The entomological data used in this study was the abundance of Culex mosquitoes. To better capture the time dynamics of vector populations, we used all data available even beyond the period studied – hence collected between November 2015 and May 2021.\n\n\nSerological model\nOur model aimed to predict the true WNV serological status Si,k (valued 0 and 1 for negative and positive status, respectively) of the kth sample taken from individual i. For any k ≥ 2, Si,k followed a Bernoulli drawing of probability pi,k:\n(1)(2)Where ti,k was the week when sample k in individual i was collected, λi(t) was WNV FOI (i.e., the rate at which hosts become infected) that applied to individual i on the week t, and μ was the seroreversion rate. We assumed that μ was constant over time and had the same value for horses and chickens. Moreover, we supposed that the FOI could vary within each year between a baseline and a maximum value (peak height). The maximum FOI was assumed to occur on the same week every year but its value depended on the year. The seasonal variations of λi were represented by a sinusoid expressed as:\n(3)Where βi was the relative risk of WNV infection in an individual i compared to a horse individual, with βi = 1 if individual i was a horse, and βi = β if it was a chicken. y(t) corresponded to the year of week t and Λ(y(t)) was the maximum FOI reached on year y(t). ε was the fraction of the FOI that did not vary over the year, hence εΛ(y(t)) was the baseline FOI reached on year y(t). δ was the week of the year when the peak of FOI was reached (Table 1).\nWe defined four scenarios for the model, depending on whether the FOI varied over time, within and/or between years (Fig 3 and Table 1). In “FlatStable” and “FlatVary” models, ε was forced to 1, meaning that the seasonal (i.e., within-year) variations of the FOI were ignored. In “SeasoStable” and “SeasoVary” models, ε was estimated. In “FlatStable” and “SeasoStable” models, Λ(y(t)) = Λ for all weeks t, meaning that we ignored between-year variations. Formulae for each model scenario are summarized in S1 Table.\n“SeasoStable” and “FlatVary” models accounted respectively for only within-year (seasonal) and only between-years variations of the force of infection (FOI). “SeasoVary” model accounted for both within- and between-years variations of the FOI. “FlatStable” model did not account for any variation of FOI with time.\n\n\nObservation model\nThe serological result Yi,k (observed WNV serological status) depended on the test sensitivity η and specificity Ψ, which we both estimated (Table 1). For any sample k ≥ 2 in any individual i:\n(4)We did not have the information on animals’ age – hence on their previous exposure to the virus – when they were first sampled. Therefore, in order to initialize the model and infer the true serological status of the first sample in each individual i, we introduced parameters NPV1 and PPV1, the negative and positive predictive values of the first sample result for any individual (Table 1). They were respectively defined as the probability of true negative given a first negative test result, i.e., P(Si,1 = 0|Yi,1 = 0), and as the probability of true positive given a first positive test result, i.e., P(Si,1 = 1|Yi,1 = 1). NPV1 and PPV1 depended on η and Ψ, and varied according to hyperparameters as detailed in the S1 Note. For any individual i:\n(5)\n\nModels fitting and selection\nModel parameters were estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, implemented with the R package rjags [62]. In this Bayesian framework, most prior distributions were uninformative, although not for parameters ε and δ. Indeed, we assumed that seasonal variations in WNV FOI (determined by ε and δ) are partly related to seasonal variations in mosquito abundance. Therefore, we performed the model’s fitting in two steps. In Step 1, we fitted a model analogous to the “SeasoStable” model to the weekly mosquito abundance data, which allowed estimating posterior distributions for seasonality parameters ε and δ (see details in the S2 Note). These two distributions were then used as informative priors in Step 2, where the four models were fitted to the serological data (S2 Table and S2 Fig). Moreover, in Step 2, we also considered rather informative priors for parameters η and Ψ using a Beta distribution (S2 Table), because previous publications tended to show a good reliability of serological tests for the detection of WNV antibodies [59,63,64]. In particular, the virus neutralization test is considered the gold standard serological test regarding specificity [59,65]. The usual MCMC convergence diagnostics were performed in both steps. Serological model scenarios were then compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and the best fitting model was selected based on the smallest DIC [66].",
    "Results": "Surveillance results\nWe analyzed the presence of anti-WNV IgG antibodies in domestic animals sampled repeatedly as part of a sentinel surveillance scheme in Guadeloupe (Figs 1, 2, and S3). Among 764 consecutive pairs of samples collected from horses between 2002 and 2018, 82 (10.7%) seroconversions and 9 (1.2%) seroreversions were observed (Table 2). Among 3,332 consecutive pairs of samples collected from chickens between 2013 and 2018, 6 (0.2%) seroconversions and 6 (0.2%) seroreversions were observed (Table 2).\nCulex mosquito abundance data collected bi-monthly between 2015 and 2021 is displayed in S4 Fig. It showed seasonal patterns that were used to derive informative priors for fitting the serological model.\n\n\nModel predictions\nAfter fitting the seasonal model to the mosquito abundance data (Step 1), we fitted the four serological models to the longitudinal serological data (Step 2). The model scenario with the lowest DIC was “SeasoVary” (S3 Table), suggesting both within- and between-years variations of WNV FOI in Guadeloupe archipelago. This model predicted that three main episodes of WNV circulation occurred on the island between 2002 and 2017 (see Fig 4): an important one in 2002, followed by another one of smaller intensity in 2007, and finally in 2010–2012, although uncertainty in outbreak intensity (amplitude) was greater for the latter due to less serological data collected. The model scenario with the second lowest DIC was “FlatVary” (ΔDIC = 12, see S3 Table), and also predicted the three same main episodes of WNV circulation (S5 Fig).\nIn panel A, the black line represents the median of predictions (using 5,000 repetitions of the model), while the gray area represents the 80% prediction interval. In panels B and C, each row is a pair of consecutive blood samples, and only the observed negative-to-positive and negative-to-negative serological transitions are displayed.\n\n\nParameter estimates\nFollowing Step 1 (fit of the seasonal model to the mosquito abundance data), the median of δ was estimated to week 45.3 (95% credible interval: [43.5; 47.4]), implying that the yearly peak of Culex mosquito abundance in Guadeloupe occurs around October-November (S4 Fig). Then, after Step 2 (fit to serological data) and for the “SeasoVary” model, the median posterior estimate of δ was slightly earlier (week 44.9 [42.9; 46.7]), suggesting a marginal time shift for the yearly peak of WNV FOI. Nevertheless, ε was estimated to 0.099 [0.023; 0.222], showing the potential of WNV to circulate all year long in Guadeloupe (Table 3 and S6 Fig).\nWe were not able to estimate β, the relative risk of infection in chickens as compared to horses, since its posterior distribution (median of 2.63 [0.002; 8.99]) was almost similar to its prior distribution (S6 Fig), reflecting a lack of information in the data regarding this parameter. We estimated the seroreversion parameter to 1.73x10-3 [6.08x10-4; 2.83x10-3] per week, i.e., 1/578 weeks or 1/11.1 years.\nFurthermore, we estimated the sensitivity η to be 0.90 [0.769; 0.999] and the specificity ψ to be 0.999 [0.996; 1.0], confirming the good reliability of serological tests (Table 3 and S6 Fig). NPV1 and PPV1 were estimated to respectively 0.998 [0.995; 1.0] and 0.926 [0.811; 0.998].\nWhat is more, posterior estimates for the “FlatVary” model were similar to the “SeasoVary” model (S7 Fig).",
    "Discussion": "Some infectious diseases that are transmitted to humans from wildlife reservoir sources, such as WNV, may not be well detected by passive surveillance systems, especially when asymptomatic forms are frequent, sparking a possible silent circulation of the pathogen. In this study, we quantified this silent circulation for WNV in Guadeloupe archipelago using a serological model fitted to sentinel surveillance data collected in horses and chickens. We assessed different hypothesis on the variations of WNV force of infection (FOI) by comparing several versions of a phenomenological model that represented over time the rate at which sentinel animals become infected, capturing multiple mechanisms (mosquito abundance, biting rate, density of infectious reservoir hosts, …) all at once. The best selected model was “SeasoVary”, suggesting that the FOI changes both within-year and between-years on the island.\nSeveral ecological and epidemiological mechanisms could explain between-years FOI variations. First, variations of climatic factors across years – including occurrence of extreme weather events – may cause heterogeneity in vectors abundance, species composition and/or competence resulting in dramatic changes of epidemiological patterns [56,67–71]. Specifically, previous studies highlighted a correlation between yearly mosquito abundance and the number of WNV human cases, while others did not or rather put forward vector capacity, partially related to the weather-dependent extrinsic incubation period [69,72–74]. Second, wild bird population renewal over the years may lead to decreasing levels of herd immunity, hence allowing WNV outbreaks to occur again every few years [75]. Third, WNV infection prevalence in migratory birds might vary across years, leading to hypothetical between-years fluctuations in the virus’ introduction risk [76].\nMoreover, within-year variations in FOI might also be attributed to various factors. First, we found that the abundance of Culex spp. mosquitoes – main WNV vectors – can vary seasonally in such a tropical climate, which was expected [77,78]. Additionally, the distribution of species within the Culex genus (including potential enzootic and bridge vectors which are yet to be fully characterized in Guadeloupe) may also change seasonally and may have implications on WNV transmission [79,80]. Second, mechanisms other than mosquito abundance might affect the timing of WNV FOI peak over the year. Indeed, the FOI is also driven by the infection prevalence in vectors, which depends on the seasonal dynamics of infection in wild birds, among other factors. They may depend on demographic traits such as the hatching season, which abruptly supplements the population in susceptible individuals [81]. Furthermore, bird populations on the island fluctuate according to migrations that are highly seasonal, with for instance shorebirds species flying from North America to Guadeloupe archipelago around August-October [82]. Migratory birds might either seasonally introduce the virus, and/or change the total density of susceptible individuals in the island’s wild bird population [54,83–85]. Seasonal patterns were also observed from sentinel chickens in Florida (United States), where seroconversions mostly occurred between July and August [24].\nA limitation of this work is that we did not account for spatial heterogeneity of WNV FOI on the island, whereas it may be impacted by environmental risk factors at the local scale [57]. Therefore, we might have overestimated the FOI, especially in years when the sentinel surveillance scheme was implemented in sites considered at higher risk for viral circulation. However, given Guadeloupe surface area (1,628 square kilometers) and the time between successive blood samples in horses (median of 54 weeks), we cannot preclude that individuals were exposed to mosquito bites in unrecorded locations, as part of horse riding tours, competitions or other events related to the equine industry [57], or when changing stable.\nFurthermore, we did not directly relate the mosquito abundance measured on the field (between 2015 and 2021) with serological transitions observed in vertebrate sentinels (between 2002 and 2018), because of the small time overlap between sampling periods. Instead, our two-step fitting approach had the advantage to beneficiate from the information present in the mosquito abundance data (in Step 1) for quantifying the seasonality of WNV FOI (in Step 2), while accounting for other potential drivers of these fluctuations, and without the need of concomitant sampling in vectors and hosts. Therefore, our modelling framework was able to detect a hypothetic time lag between the peak in mosquito abundance and the occurrence of infections in incidental hosts, which was previously suggested [86,87]. In our study, we found that the former (estimated from the mosquito trapping data) was close to the time of FOI peak (estimated from the serological data), with overlapping credible intervals. Although this result is not fully comparable to previous works that rather considered the dynamics of infectious mosquitoes [35,72], because mosquito infection prevalence may not be constant within a year [69].\nPrevious studies showed the frequent persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least several months or years in birds [88–91], and data is scarce in equids. Here, our estimation of the rate of IgG antibodies loss (seroreversion parameter) suggests a lifelong carriage of such antibodies in many individuals, especially in chickens which have a shorter lifespan, even though seroreversions remain possible. Therefore, these individuals may benefit from a long-term protection against WNV symptoms and contribute to herd immunity. In the absence of published data comparing the seroreversion rates in horses and chickens, we assumed the value was the same for the two species in our model, which might have biased the estimate for each individual species. In the future, it would be informative to quantify this parameter for multiple species by inoculating several individuals with WNV and longitudinally testing the presence of antibodies several months or years later.\nThe estimation of the relative risk of infection in chickens as compared to horses (β) was not conclusive, probably because, in our dataset, the time overlap between sampling periods in horses and in chickens was short and with a low-level WNV circulation. Again, sampling longitudinally both species during an outbreak or as part of an infection experiment would allow assessing this parameter by comparing FOI applying to both species simultaneously. It would be an important metric to consider when comparing different sentinel surveillance strategies, and to prioritize either horses or domestic birds surveillance [92]. At equal Culex vector densities in the environment, hosts’ relative risk of infection notably depends on mosquitoes feeding preferences. While Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. nigripalpus are the two main candidate vectors for WNV in Guadeloupe Island [57], the former has been suggested to bite birds (including chickens) more than mammals, whereas it might be the opposite for the latter [79,93–96]. However, host selection have been shown to depend on environmental factors (urban vs. rural settings, hygrometry, etc.) and host availability [79], and they have yet to be fully determined for Culex spp. in Guadeloupe. Feeding preferences may also change with host skin surface area availability – which depends on animals’ size – rather than at the host individual level [97].\nOur study quantified the regular circulation of WNV in Guadeloupe after 2002, based on sentinel surveillance data, despite no clinical report in humans or horses before 2024. However, it did not allow to determine whether it was due to series of virus introductions or as a result of a local enzootic circulation. Although no blood samples were collected earlier than July 2002, an earlier circulation of WNV on the island cannot be ruled out since a West Nile human case was detected as early as August 2001 in the Cayman Islands, a northern Caribbean territory [98]. From our median estimates of WNV FOI (e.g., in 2007 and 2012), the annual incidence rate in horses during outbreak years can be estimated to 5%-7%. Considering a total estimated equine population between ~500 (in 2003–2004) and ~1,000 (in 2017) on the island [57,99] – which is an overestimation of the susceptible equine population – and a proportion of neurological symptoms of ~10% of WNV infected horses [100,101], we could expect up to ~3–7 equine neurological disease cases in 2007 and 2012. Therefore, the lack of WNV clinical case evidence in both domestic animals and humans until 2024 may suggest a low sensitivity of WNV passive surveillance [39]. Indeed, in both horses and humans in the Caribbean, it may be jeopardized by the frequent co-occurrence of other pathogens with similar pathogenesis (e.g., equine piroplasmosis) and serological cross-reactivity during the diagnosis, especially for circulating flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV) or Zika (ZIKV) viruses [102,103]. This highlights the potential of a complementary sentinel WNV serological surveillance scheme in domestic animals, subject to the results of a more thorough costs-benefits analysis, as well as the importance of cross-sectoral collaborations. In our study, because neutralization test (NT) cross-reactivity remains theoretically possible with DENV and ZIKV, the misattribution of a seroconversion to WNV cannot be excluded. However, in a previous study led in French Polynesia and New Caledonia, no horse showed positive NT results to both WNV and DENV or ZIKV, suggesting a low NT cross-reactivity [103]. Moreover, in our model, we estimated the specificity parameter to be close to 1, which is consistent with the NT being a highly specific test [59,65].\nIn the future, building a mechanistic model fitted to infection data in vectors and wild birds would allow to unravel the processes underlying temporal changes in WNV FOI [104]. Based on such a model, a simulation study would help to determine what cost-efficient surveillance strategies (involving a seasonal component or not) could be implemented in the Caribbean to monitor WNV emergence or re-emergence [92], and therefore to mitigate its impacts on human and animal health."
