West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that can infect birds, humans, and horses. While birds are the main hosts, humans and horses are considered “dead-end” hosts, meaning they cannot further transmit the virus to mosquitoes. In Guadeloupe, WNV was first detected in 2002, but no clinical cases were reported in humans or horses until 2024. Because infections can go unnoticed yet still pose risks – such as transmission through human blood donations – understanding how the virus circulates silently is important. To better characterize WNV circulation, we analyzed over 4,600 blood samples collected from chickens and horses between 2002 and 2018. Using mathematical modeling and serological data, we reconstructed the virus force of infection, the rate at which individuals became infected. The results revealed both seasonal and year-to-year variations, with peaks in transmission around October–November. We identified three significant periods of virus activity. Infected animals tended to retain antibodies for a long time, indicating long-term immunity. This study shows how combining field data and modeling can reveal hidden patterns of viral circulation. It highlights the value of active surveillance and quantitative tools for detecting and managing zoonotic diseases like WNV, especially in regions where they circulate silently.
