Rabies remains a significant public health challenge in China, with 202 human deaths reported in 2020. Domestic dogs are the primary source of human rabies cases, but vaccination rates among these animals are low. This study analyzes 1,733 human rabies case investigations in China from 2016-2020, providing insights into exposure history, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, and clinical characteristics. The majority of individuals affected by rabies did not pursue PEP, especially those with category II wounds or those bitten by domestic animals from their own households. Among the domestic animals involved, 95.7% were unvaccinated against rabies. The findings highlight the need for targeted educational initiatives on rabies prevention directed at high-risk groups like rural inhabitants, males, farmers, and older adults. Increasing accessibility and affordability of PEP for humans and enhancing management and vaccination of domestic dogs, especially in rural areas, are crucial for decreasing human rabies mortality. Achieving the goal of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030 in China requires sustained, multisectoral commitment to the One Health approach.
