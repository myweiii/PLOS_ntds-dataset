Sand flea disease (tungiasis) is a common poverty-associated disease in many tropical countries that affects humans and animals. It causes pain, itching, and walking difficulties and can lead to social isolation and life-threatening bacterial or viral infections. In absence of effective treatment, local communities commonly resort to the dangerous and painful practice of removing sand fleas with sharp objects like pins or thorns. Small studies have shown that applying a mixture of dimeticone oils (NYDA) is a simple and effective treatment. To demonstrate the real-life effects of a comprehensive control strategy for tungiasis, we evaluated a two-year long tungiasis control project in 17 villages in the rural Napak district, Karamoja region, Northeastern Uganda. This included regular detection of cases of sand flea disease among village residents and domestic animals, case treatment with the dimeticone oils, as well as conducting meetings with the residents to provide information about sand flea disease, its treatment and prevention. Throughout the study, the occurrence of sand flea disease in the study area decreased from 62.8% to 5.7% among residents and from 14.2% to 0% in animals. Walking difficulties due to sand fleas among residents dropped from 11.5% to 0.5%, and pain and itching were also greatly reduced. This study shows that the regular treatment of sand flea disease in humans and domestic animals with the dimeticone oil mixture, together with community engagement regarding sand flea control, can effectively reduce the burden of the disease to very low levels within two years, even in an area where sand fleas are widespread.
