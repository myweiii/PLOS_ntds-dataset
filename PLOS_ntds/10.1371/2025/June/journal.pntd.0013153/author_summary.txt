In Brazil, when the community finds insects suspected of being triatomines, the insects vectors of the agent that CD, they should take them to a TIP, which may be located in public infrastructure, like schools, basic health units, or other community facilities. This study was conducted in municipalities in Minas Gerais, Brazil, which have a high risk of new cases of CD. Different data collection tools were used to characterize the TIPs, and health professionals were interviewed to describe problems related to the TIPs. No municipality recorded the delivery of insects to the TIPs. Some municipalities had never had a TIP installed; some municipalities had disused TIPs, especially in rural areas. However, the TIPs located in areas common to primary health care had a lower disuse rate. The following were mentioned: lack of knowledge among the population about TIPs; shortage of qualified professionals; distribution of TIPs in difficult-to-access areas; and lack of feedback on insect tests to residents. There is a scenario of heterogeneous distribution of implementation and operation of TIPs in the region, with low adherence and use by the population, making it urgent to carry out actions to raise awareness among the population and strengthen the TIPs.
