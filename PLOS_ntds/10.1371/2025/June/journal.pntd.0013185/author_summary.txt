Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect domestic and wild animals worldwide. Diagnosis of the disease is not straightforward and usually requires several tests to be conducted for an accurate conclusion. Guidelines for recommended use of assays are provided by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) which describe the experimental protocols and interpretation of the results for each test. However, the vast number of available assays and the numerous ways they can be combined make it challenging to gain a clear understanding of brucellosis epidemiology worldwide. This systematic review provides an overview of the different diagnostic tests and strategies used worldwide for the diagnosis of brucellosis in livestock. Experimental methods and interpretations were analyzed and compared with WOAH recommendations to assess compliance with their guidelines in an effort to provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease worldwide.
