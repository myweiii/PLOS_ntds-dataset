Schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease, is caused by infection with parasitic worms of the Schistosoma species, including Schistosoma mansoni. Individuals can be repeatedly re-infected, and there is no available vaccine. An initial stage of vaccine development is testing in a pre-clinical animal model. Here we have summarised tests of Schistosoma mansoni vaccines in the last three decades. 100 + vaccine candidates have been tested, with only 10 of these achieving efficacy of over 60%, and only 2 at over 90%. When the same vaccine candidate (antigen) is tested in a different formulation, or using different study design, the efficacy varies greatly. We have summarised the formulations and study designs used, and highlighted how certain parameters affect efficacy. Finally, we have assembled a series of recommendations to researchers on how to perform vaccine tests in the future.
