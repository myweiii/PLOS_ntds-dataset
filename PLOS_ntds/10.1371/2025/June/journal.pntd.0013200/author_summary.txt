Leprosy is a chronic infectious neglected tropical disease. Leprosy has a high burden of visual impairment if left untreated, with both cataracts and corneal opacification being the main contributors to ocular morbidity. Lagophthalmos in those affected by leprosy, an inability to close the eyelids fully, can lead to exposure keratitis and eventual corneal opacification and blindness. The main way to avoid and prevent the progression of visual impairment once lagophthalmos is established is corrective surgery. We identified 12 studies from seven countries researching five main techniques for surgical correction of lagophthalmos, with the majority of papers (seven) investigating methods of temporalis muscle transfer. With three papers studying weight implantation, and one paper each covering scapha grafting, modified tarsorrhaphy and lateral tarsal strip. Surgical techniques were mostly well tolerated with minimal side effects noted across techniques. Of note however was the high incidence of extrusion and local allergic reactions within the gold weight technique. Ultimately, this paper presents a compelling case for more comparative studies between different techniques for lagophthalmos correction secondary to leprosy. Our recommendations emphasise the need to evaluate these techniques further in lower-resources settings and to prioritize techniques that allow good outcome with the minimal need for follow-up.
