The olfactory perception of characteristic scent emitted by infected hosts is a critical component in comprehending the ticks’ foraging behavior, and consequently, formulating odor-based methodologies to combat tick-borne diseases. In this study, two salient infection scents, indole and 3-methylindole, were identified from the Ifnar-/- mice infected by Bandavirus dabieense (SFTSV) with differential volatile metabolite assays. The two indolic scents were then validated for their olfactory response of H. longicornis by a combination of field studies, laboratory experiments, and molecular analyses. We conclude that H. longicornis smell the characteristic scents from the SFTSV-infected hosts using its unique OBPL protein in the olfactory apparatus (Haller’s organ) and adjusts the tick’s foraging behavior to target infected subjects. The findings of this study offer insights into the intricate interactions between ticks, their hosts, and pathogens, which could inform novel strategies for the prevention of tick-borne diseases such as SFTS.
