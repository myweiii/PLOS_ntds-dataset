Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has become a global public health concern and demonstrates a strong capability for population-wide transmission. Compared to incidence, transmissibility can more directly indicate the effect of driving factors on dynamic transmission of infectious diseases and the critical period for prevention and control. In this study, we defined the HFMD epidemics, estimated transmissibility quantified as the instantaneous reproduction number (), and employed a general additive model to investigate the association between potential factors and HFMD transmissibility in Zhejiang Province during 2013-2019. Furthermore, the case time series design was applied to investigate the association between temperature and HFMD incidence at township-level. Our results identified an inverted V-shaped relationship between temperature and HFMD incidence, as well as a similar nonlinear effect of temperature on HFMD transmissibility. Interestingly, the temperature corresponding to the highest transmissibility (around 19.69°C) was lower than the temperature where incidence risk peaked (around 28°C). Other factors including the depletion of susceptible individuals, school holidays, vaccination program, relative humidity and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index potentially contribute to changes in HFMD dynamic transmission. These findings could offer important insights into the implementation of targeted policies aimed at HFMD early intervention.
