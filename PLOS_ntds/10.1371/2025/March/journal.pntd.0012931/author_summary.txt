Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease transmitted in 78 countries, and over 250 million people worldwide are infected. Schistosomes are multi-host parasites, including obligatory asexual amplification in the intermediate snail hosts and sexual reproduction in the definitive mammalian hosts. Schistosoma japonicum was thought to be the most virulent species because of the high egg productivity and over 40 species of mammalian hosts. The genetic variation of S. japonicum populations among the different hosts becomes more complicated, as the selective pressure by host switching and co-evolution with different hosts would drive the parasite consequently to evolve in the infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmission pattern. However, the genetic diversity of S. japonicum by host switching is less understood. This investigation could help elucidate the genetic evolution of S. japonicum under host pressure and provide instruction for host sampling and the infective pattern to make optimal infection models. The authors found that the population genetic diversity of S. japonicum differs in different developmental stages. Host species and sampling number significantly affect the distribution pattern of alleles and the genetic structure of S. japonicum at the suprapopulation level.
