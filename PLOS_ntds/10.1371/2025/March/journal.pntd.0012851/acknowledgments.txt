We appreciate the support of residents in the study villages and their willingness to provide stool samples and blood for the current study. We thank Mrs. Kerstin Fischer at Washington University in St. Louis for the training and technical support regarding STH diagnostic methods. In addition, we appreciate the support of PNG IMR staff (Bethuel Kotty, Zebede Kerry, Stephen Kumai, Anna Samuel, and Lina Lorry, who helped collect the samples as part of the parent study) and to staff from Case Western Reserve University (Mike Payne, S. Cade Howard, and Catherine Bjerum).
