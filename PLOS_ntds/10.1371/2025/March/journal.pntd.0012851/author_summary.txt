The study examined the benefit of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) compared to diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) on soil-transmitted helminths and Strongyloides worms as part of a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign for lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea. Villages were randomized to receive IDA or DA, and all eligible community members received one or the other treatment regimen. At baseline, overall hookworm infection was present in 78% of individuals on stool examination using the Kato Katz assay, and 62-68% were serologically positive for Strongyloides in both treatment arms. One year after a single round of MDA, residents of villages receiving IDA had a 45% greater reduction in hookworm prevalence versus DA, after adjusting for potential influencing factors. Notable was a 47% reduction in hookworm prevalence and an 89% reduction in the intensity of infection among untreated individuals surveyed 12 months after MDA in IDA-treated communities, much greater than that observed in DA-treated villages. This shows a community effect of MDA on hookworm, suggesting a decrease in hookworm transmission. MDA reduced strongyloidiasis seroprevalence in IDA-treated villages by 49% 12 months later, but no significant change in seroprevalence was observed in DA-treated villages. This highlights IDAâ€™s added public health benefit for controlling soil-transmitted helminth infections.
