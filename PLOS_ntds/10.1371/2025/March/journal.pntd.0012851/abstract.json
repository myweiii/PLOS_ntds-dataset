    "Background": "Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "This study was conducted as part of a cluster randomized trial of MDA with IDA versus DA for LF in individuals willing to provide stool and blood samples at baseline and 12 months after MDA. Participants from 23 villages were included in the clinical trial. Primary outcomes were changes in hookworm prevalence and infection intensity assessed by Kato Katz and Strongyloides prevalence by serology.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "MDA with IDA was more effective than DA for reducing hookworm and Strongyloides infections in PNG, extending the benefit of MDA with IDA beyond its effect on LF."
