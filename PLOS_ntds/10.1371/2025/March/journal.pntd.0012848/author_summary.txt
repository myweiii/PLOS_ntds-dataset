The frequency of asymptomatic HIV/Leishmania infantum (HIV/Leish) infections and the immunological status of subjects with HIV residing in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, between 2014 and 2016 were studied. A high frequency of asymptomatic HIV/Leishmania infantum infections (PLHIV with positive anti-IgG L. infantum antibodies) was found. Asymptomatic HIV/Leish subjects had CD8+ T cells with higher markers of activation and senescence than PLHIV with negative serology to L. infantum, however, they were similar to AIDS/VL. At the time of this study, there was still poor availability of antiretroviral therapy. Asymptomatic HIV/Leish had high relative risk of developing AIDS/VL. Thus, PLHIV residing in endemic areas for VL should be assessed for their L. infantum infection status and advised to closely adhere to antiretroviral therapy to decrease the risk of developing VL or any other co-morbidity.
