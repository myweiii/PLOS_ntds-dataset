Animal Trypanosomosis (AT) is a parasitic disease that affects livestock, causing major economic losses and harm to animal health. Cheap effective diagnostics that can be easily used in the field would have a major impact on the disease burden by enabling better treatment practices. However, parasites causing the disease - trypanosomes - are often undetectable via conventional methods, especially during chronic disease stages. More accurate diagnostics are not suitable for use in the field and are therefore unavailable to farmers. This has led to the overuse of drug treatments that can lead to the emergence of drug resistance. We previously discovered a trypanosome-specific small RNA, called 7SL-sRNA, that can be detected in the blood of infected cattle, even during the chronic stages of AT when parasites are not detectable via microscopy. However, detecting this RNA has required complex equipment, limiting its use in field settings. Building on this work, we have now developed a test for trypanosomosis that uses Cas10 technology to detect 7SL-sRNA via a simple lateral flow assay. This test is easy to use and accurately identifies active infections, including during the chronic phase of the disease. This is the first time Cas10 technology has been used to detect small RNAs using a lateral flow assay, offering a promising, cost-effective tool for diagnosing AT and potentially other neglected parasitic diseases.
