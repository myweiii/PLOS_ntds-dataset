We would like to thank the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health and the National Onchocerciasis Control Programme, who provided a wealth of information and data that enabled us to understand the evolution of control activities and onchocerciasis endemicity trends in Cameroon. We would also like to thank Dr Alfons Renz (University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany) for insights into the declining biting rates in the North and Adamoua regions, and Dr Mathew Dixon-Zegeye (Imperial College London, UK) and Aditya Ramani (Royal Veterinary College, UK) for valuable discussions on EPIONCHO-IBM-projected microfilarial trends for Cameroon.
