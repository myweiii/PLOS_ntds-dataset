Onchocerciasis (‘river blindness’) is a severely debilitating neglected tropical disease proposed for elimination of transmission by the World Health Organization. The main intervention strategy consists of prolonged treatment of endemic communities with ivermectin. Ivermectin treatment started in Cameroon approximately in the year 2000, but after more than 20 years of treatment the disease remains endemic in many areas of the country. Understanding changes in onchocerciasis prevalence geographically and with time under intervention is crucial for planning where control efforts should be intensified and with which strategies. Geostatistical mapping is an ideal tool for this purpose. Therefore, we produced onchocerciasis predicted prevalence maps for 1971–2000 (before treatment began), 2001–2010 and 2011–2020 using published, unpublished and publicly-available data. Prior to the start of treatment and in the decade following its commencement, the country exhibited high prevalence (more than 60% in many areas). In 2011–2020 predicted prevalence declined in most but not all areas, remaining above 20% in some areas of the South West, Littoral and Centre regions. These hotspots would benefit from more efficacious medications and complementary control measures. Our results can be combined with transmission models to generate infection trends under simulated strategies until 2030 and beyond.
