Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that spreads through contaminated water and soil, often affecting people who work in wet and muddy conditions. Soldiers are at high risk of infection, especially in tropical regions, where the disease is more common. In this study, we reviewed research on leptospirosis in military personnel to understand how often it occurs and why it is a concern. We analyzed studies published between 2000 and 2024, focusing on those that investigated the seroprevalence among soldiers. Out of 67 studies, only three met our criteria. These studies were conducted in Malaysia, Hawaii, and Honduras, with seroprevalence ranging from 1.4% to 16.2%. We found that leptospirosis is often overlooked in military settings because its symptoms resemble other illnesses, and proper testing is not always available. Our findings highlight the need for better awareness, improved protective measures, and more accessible diagnostic tools to prevent infections among soldiers. By improving surveillance and health strategies, we can help protect military personnel from this potentially serious disease.
