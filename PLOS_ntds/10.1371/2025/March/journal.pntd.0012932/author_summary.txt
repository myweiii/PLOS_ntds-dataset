In the past three decades, dengue has rapidly proliferated, significantly impacting global health. In order to comprehensively analyze the global epidemiological trends of dengue from 1990 to 2021, we utilized the latest data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, incorporating a multifaceted analysis considering variables such as age, sex, geographical region, and socioeconomic development. Our results indicated that the global burden of dengue approximately doubled during the study period, with the global incidence surging from 26.45 million to 58.96 million cases and the number of related deaths climbing from 14,315 to 29,075 between 1990 and 2021. Moreover, disability-adjusted life-years increased from 1.25 million to 2.08 million years. We also analyzed the factors contributing to these varying trends, including sea level rise and the impact of global dengue epidemiology at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings revealed a gradual escalation of the global dengue epidemic against the backdrop of climate warming and increased population mobility. This research provided insights that could assist policymakers in implementing effective control and management strategies for dengue.
