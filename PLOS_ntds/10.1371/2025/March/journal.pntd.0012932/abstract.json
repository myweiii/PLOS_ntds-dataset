    "Background": "Dengue, the fastest-spreading vector-borne disease (VBD), significantly burdens global health systems. This study analyzed the trends in the global burden of dengue from 1990 to 2021, utilizing data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021 (GBD 2021).",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We retrieved data from GBD 2021 regarding dengue, including the number of incidences and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), the number of deaths and age-standardized death rate (ASDR), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and age-standardized DALYs. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of ASIR, ASDR, and standardized DALYs rate was calculated to quantify trends over time. In addition, the correlations between dengue burden and sea level rise, as well as the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), were evaluated. In this study, it was observed that from 1990 to 2021, the global incidence of dengue escalated from 26.45 million to 58.96 million cases, accompanied by an increase in related deaths from 14,315 to 29,075, and DALYs rising from 1.25 million to 2.08 million years. These data collectively indicate that the disease burden approximately doubled, with South Asia, Southeast Asia, and tropical Latin America being the most severely affected regions. The disease burden remained substantial in middle and low-middle-SDI regions, whereas high-middle and high SDI regions experienced pronounced growth rates in ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs rate. Adolescents and the elderly showed higher incidence, yet children under 5 had the highest DALYs. Correlation analyses revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between the SDI and both the ASDR and age-standardized DALYs rate, and changes in sea level height strongly correlated with the overall dengue burden.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The global dengue burden has surged due to climate change, vector transmission, and population mobility. Increased focus and tailored control strategies are essential, particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America."
