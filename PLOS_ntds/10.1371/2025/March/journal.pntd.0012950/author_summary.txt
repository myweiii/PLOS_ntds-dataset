In this study, the GP63 gene family was explored in the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Eleven distinct groups of GP63 genes were identified, each occupying specific regions within the parasite’s genome. Some groups are located in the core genome, often organized into clusters, while others reside in more variable regions of the disruptive compartment, surrounded by other surface protein genes.
Our analysis revealed that the GP63 groups exhibit different patterns of gene expression, with certain groups showing higher expression during the infective stage of the parasite’s life cycle. This suggests that these proteins may play a crucial role in parasite invasion and pathogenesis. Additionally, key domains of the GP63 proteins were analyzed, revealing unique features within each group that could influence their function.
Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that most GP63 groups are exclusive to the genus Trypanosoma, indicating they diversified before the speciation of the genus. However, each Trypanosoma species has amplified certain GP63 clusters differently, following distinct evolutionary paths.
This study enhances our understanding of the diversity and evolution of these important genes, providing insights that could support the development of new strategies to combat Chagas disease.
