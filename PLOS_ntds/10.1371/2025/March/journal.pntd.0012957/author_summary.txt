Loiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Loa loa, used to be considered a mild condition. However, individuals with high numbers of larval stages (microfilariae) in their blood (microfilarial density or MFD) can experience serious adverse events (SAEs), such as severe neurological complications, after taking drugs that kill the microfilariae (ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine). There is currently no international guideline for the treatment of loiasis, leading to varied practices worldwide. The objective of this paper was to operationalize the results of previous modeling, to provide turnkey information to prescribers on the risks incurred for a given MFD, sex and age, and to provide additional elements for reflection on these risks. Using data from clinical trials conducted in Cameroon, we found that the probability of SAEs for a given MFD level varies between age and sex categories. We identified that men and individuals in specific age categories might be at a higher risk than previously thought. For example, males aged 31-40 might be at risk at lower MFD thresholds than currently used. Our findings suggest that treatment guidelines should be adjusted to consider these factors, and that more research is needed to understand why males seem to be at higher risk for L. loa-related post-ivermectin SAEs.
