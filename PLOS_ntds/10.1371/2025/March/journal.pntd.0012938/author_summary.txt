O’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is a mosquito transmitted virus capable of causing debilitating arthritis and myalgia in humans. While the virus is currently circulating in Africa, there is a lack of FDA-approved countermeasures to prevent or treat ONNV infections and disease. Additionally, there has been a general dearth of contemporary ONNV clinical isolates to study the biology of the virus or to aid in the development of vaccines or therapeutics. We aimed to clone a 2017 ONNV strain from Uganda called UVRI0804 from a published sequence and examine the virus isolate’s ability to cause disease in mouse models. The recovered strain ONNV0804 replicated in several cultured cell types but had reduced in vitro growth when compared to ONNVUgMP30, a highly passaged strain also from Uganda. However, ONNV0804 replicated better than ONNVUgMP30 in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. This new isolate caused significant arthritogenic disease and viral RNA was detected in joint and muscle tissues more than 40 days post infection. A hydrogen peroxide-inactivated chikungunya virus vaccine protected against infection and disease. The infectious clone for 2017 ONNV UVRI0804 clinical strain will contribute to our understanding of ONNV pathogenesis and aid in the development of anti-infectives against ONNV.
