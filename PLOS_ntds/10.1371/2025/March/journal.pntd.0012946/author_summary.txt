In our study, we set out to address the challenges posed by re-emerging dengue fever, a significant infectious disease globally. The goal was to create a comprehensive risk assessment framework that enhances the early detection and evaluation of potential dengue outbreaks, especially in regions with limited surveillance and diagnostic capabilities. By combining clinical signals, contextual data, and public health risk indicators, we developed an integrated approach to assess the likelihood and impact of dengue outbreaks. Our evaluation involved analyzing real-world data from the World Health Organization and Tanzania. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in accurately predicting the risk of dengue outbreaks. Specifically, our disease classification algorithm successfully matched suspected cases (outbreak signals) with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, and we found a strong association between site-specific public health risk and the incidence of dengue fever cases. These findings are crucial as they provide a practical tool for predicting and preparing for dengue outbreaks. By improving early detection and risk assessment, our framework can help stakeholders plan and implement interventions more effectively, ultimately contributing to better public health outcomes. This research highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in tackling infectious diseases and underscores the significance of proactive measures in controlling outbreaks.
