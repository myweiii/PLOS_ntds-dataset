In early 2023, the Town of Metahara experienced a significant outbreak of dengue. The authors conducted an investigation into how the disease spread, what factors enhanced the outbreak, and the strategy to manage the dengue outbreak. Accordingly, the outbreak was by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue transmission. Intermittent rains, inappropriate water storage practices, and numerous old tires in town before the outbreak created ideal breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. Additionally, the author identified poor sanitation, lack of vector control measures, and limited public awareness as contributing factors. The outbreak escalated quickly, with hundreds of cases reported between July 25 and September 5, 2023. Demographic and geographic distribution of cases and identified neighborhoods and vulnerable population that were disproportionately affected had been assessed. The author’s comprehensive approach, such as active surveillance and case reporting, vector control activities, improved access to diagnostic testing and clinical management and launching public awareness campaigns, provided valuable insights into outbreak control. The authors’ investigation provides the challenges faced by the health system in managing the outbreak, such as limited resources, infrastructure constraints, and coordination issues between different agencies. The author recommended the town’s preparedness and response to future dengue outbreaks. These include improving vector surveillance and control, investing in healthcare infrastructure, and enhancing community engagement and education programs. The thorough investigation carried out by the author sheds light on the dynamics of the dengue outbreak in Metahara town and provides valuable recommendations for enhancing the management of similar public health emergencies.
