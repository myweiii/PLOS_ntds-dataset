There is an urgent need to develop a detection test for venomous snakebites in patients. In this study we have reported a method for diagnosis of venoms from the ‘Big Four’ Indian snakes and Naja kaouthia in the plasma of Wistar strain albino rats injected with these venoms. Custom peptides designed and synthesized from toxins identified from the proteome of ‘Big Four’ venomous snakes of India were used to raise five polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. The polyclonal antibodies were combined in a certain ratio to obtain a formulation. The antibody formulation demonstrated recognition for the ‘Big Four’ snakes and Naja kaouthia venoms under in vitro and in vivo conditions and these recognitions were higher than that of commercial polyvalent antivenom. Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with these venoms and the antibody formulation was able to detect the venoms in envenomed rat plasma until 4 hours post-injection. The antibody formulation was further conjugated to gold nanoparticles and the conjugate was characterised by biophysical techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. Upon interaction with the envenomed plasma, the antibody formulation conjugated to gold nanoparticles changing colour from burgundy to blue which was recorded using smartphone camera. Calibration curves for the venoms were attained after colourimetry analysis of smartphone images and these curves were used to quantify the venom in envenomed plasma at different time intervals.
