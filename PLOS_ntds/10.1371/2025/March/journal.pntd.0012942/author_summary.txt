This study highlights unexpected genetic characteristics of imported schistosomiasis in non-endemic areas of Europe, mainly focusing on hybrids between the non-phylogenetically related human species Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium, which cause intestinal or urogenital schistosomiasis, respectively. The genetic identification, by molecular analysis of each individualized egg in urine, was performed on six migrant males from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mali diagnosed with urogenital schistosomiasis in Spain. Genetic scrutiny was applied to both lateral-spined and terminal-spined schistosome eggs allowing to corroborate the frequent hybridization of S. mansoni x S. haematobium, but also the more common S. haematobium x S. curassoni hybrids, in addition to the simultaneous presence of hybrid eggs involving three Schistosoma species in the urine of the same patient, including SmxSh in S. mansoni-like eggs and ShxSc or ShxSb/Sc in S. haematobium-like eggs. This study genetically characterizes the hybrids between S. mansoni and S. haematobium, their presence in migrants living in non-endemic countries, and the diversity of hybrid types and haplotypes, including even up to six different haplotypes within a single patient. Results highlight the need to assess differences in the clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment responses, and the epidemiological impact regarding the potential transmission and establishment in non-endemic areas.
