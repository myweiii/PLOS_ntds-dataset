Monitoring vector populations for vector-transmitted pathogens is one means by which to survey endemic areas for potential transmission, hotspots of infection intensity, and pathogen prevalence. In the case of many parasitic pathogens, this is a labor-intensive endeavor and is complicated by the fact that insect vectors can carry multiple parasite life-cycle stages, only some of which are infectious. During Leishmania infection of the sand fly vector, the parasite undergoes a maturation process in the gut of infected flies over time and only mature infections, as indicated by high numbers of the metacyclic promastigote life cycle stage, are associated with efficient transmission and enhanced disease. Therefore, developing a large-scale, field-adaptable surveillance assay is advantageous to determine the prevalence of infected sand flies with mature infections. Here, we report a molecular methodology to identify infected sand flies with mature infections based on the expression of a metacyclic promastigote associate gene, sherp. This assay could be applied in field and laboratory settings to determine pathogen prevalence, vector competence, and transmission potential.
