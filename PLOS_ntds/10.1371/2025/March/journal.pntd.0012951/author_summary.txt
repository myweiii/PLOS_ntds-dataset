Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer an affordable and scalable method for diagnosing symptomatic malaria with reduced need for equipment, electricity, and training compared with light microscopy. These tests are particularly helpful in remote settings with the heaviest burden of malaria. However, appropriate parasite densities to accurately diagnose patients with symptomatic Plasmodium vivax malaria remain poorly defined. To inform the use of current and the design of novel RDTs for P. vivax malaria, we combined data from 50 clinical trials and used parasite concentrations in symptomatic patients at enrolment to determine the proportions of patients who would have been diagnosed at different parasitaemias. We found that detecting a parasitaemia >278/µL would diagnose 90% of patients presenting with a fever. Our analyses also explore how the P. vivax parasitaemia-fever relationship varies between regions and patient populations and include estimates of P. vivax pyrogenic densities at the first detected recurrent infection. These findings will inform P. vivax RDT use and development to support clinicians managing febrile patients in malaria endemic areas. The results highlight that while pyrogenic density estimates for recurrent P. vivax may be epidemiologically informative, they have relatively low sensitivities for defining symptomatic malaria.
