Mycobacterium abscessus complex pulmonary disease (MABC-PD) is a chronic, relapsing lung infection that causes significant health problems, especially in patients with preexisting lung conditions. Distinguishing infection-related symptoms from those caused by underlying lung disease presents a major clinical challenge as there are currently no useful biomarkers available to guide treatment decisions and assess response to treatment. In this study, we analyzed the blood immune profiles of MABC-PD patients across different stages of the disease and treatment. Our findings showed that patients with disease progression during intensive phase treatment had increased activity in genes related to the innate immune response and inflammation, but reduced activity in genes associated with T and NK cells. Out of the 45 immune proteins we measured in the blood, only four were significantly altered in patients with disease progression: TNFSF10 was reduced, and IFNγ, IL17F and IL17C were elevated. This pattern suggests that T cells were being activated and likely recruited to infection sites in the lungs. Using ROC curve analysis, we found that the levels of IFNγ and IL17F could predict for relapse. These findings provide insights into the immune response in MABC-PD and suggest that IFNγ and IL17F could be useful biomarkers for identifying patients at risk of disease progression, aiding in earlier and more targeted interventions.
