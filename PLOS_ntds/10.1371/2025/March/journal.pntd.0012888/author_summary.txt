Leptospirosis is a neglected bacterial disease that often affects vulnerable populations in urban areas of developing tropical countries. Due to overlapping clinical symptoms with dengue, many cases of leptospirosis remain undiagnosed, especially among patients who test negative for dengue. This study represents the first large-scale investigation aimed at detecting possibly underrecognized cases of leptospirosis among dengue-negative patients. In São Paulo, Brazil, a centralized system for processing suspected dengue samples enabled this large-scale investigation of underrecognized leptospirosis cases. Among 6,936 patients tested, 786 had anti-Leptospira IgM antibodies, with a higher prevalence observed among women. Spatial analysis identified 18 high-risk clusters for potentially unrecognized leptospirosis, predominantly in peripheral regions with socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Notably, two significant high-risk areas were located in the North and South regions of the city. We hope that these findings should provide a critical foundation for local health authorities to design and implement targeted strategic interventions aimed at reducing the underrecognition of leptospirosis. Such interventions include educational campaigns targeting local populations, field training for family medicine professionals on the importance and risk factors of the disease, as well as raising awareness among primary care teams about the high number of underdiagnosed leptospirosis cases. Additionally, providing instructions to local healthcare workers on clinical and laboratory differentiation between leptospirosis and dengue based on previous studies that have identified comprehensive screening schemes and algorithms should be also considered. Furthermore, it is hoped that the design of this study may serve as a model for assessing risk areas for unreported leptospirosis in other locations that share the same epidemiological and socioeconomic features found in São Paulo city.
