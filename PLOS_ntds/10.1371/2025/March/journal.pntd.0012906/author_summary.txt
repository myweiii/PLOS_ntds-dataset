The single-celled eukaryote Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite which causes Chagas disease in humans, a condition that can result in debilitating enlargement of the esophagus and colon and which can additionally cause premature death by heart failure. T. cruzi is primarily transmitted to people from the feces of a blood-feeding insect vector known as a kissing bug or triatomine. Characterization of host-pathogen interactions of T. cruzi have largely focused on this parasiteâ€™s mammalian, rather than insect, hosts. However, a comprehensive understanding of how T. cruzi proliferates within kissing bugs is paramount to forming new strategies to disrupt transmission. In this study, we demonstrate that the Y strain of T. cruzi colonizes the major vector species Rhodnius prolixus and we characterize multiple aspects of parasite development within the insect digestive tract. We propose the T. cruzi Y strain - R. prolixus system as an ideal model for future interrogation of parasite-insect molecular interactions.
