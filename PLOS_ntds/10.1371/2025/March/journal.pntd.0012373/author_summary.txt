Our study explores the potential of detecting Salmonella Typhi in wastewater, informing public health strategies, guiding vaccination campaigns, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions, contributing to better disease control and prevention policies. S. Typhi positivity rates of 7.50% and 15.28% were observed in grab samples and Moore swabs, respectively, and significant correlations were found between S. Typhi positivity in Moore swabs and fecal contamination marker levels in wastewater samples. The study also estimated that the community seroincidence for typhoid was 10.40/100 person-years and that S. Typhi detections in WW positively correlated with seroincidence. The study reveals significant associations between wastewater S. Typhi positivity and typhoid seroincidence, seasonal variations, and population dynamics, providing deeper insights into the epidemiology of typhoid fever. Findings from this study suggest that surveillance of pathogens from environmental sources like wastewater might serve as an alternative to direct estimation of disease burden in areas where traditional surveillance methods are either not feasible or not cost-effective.
