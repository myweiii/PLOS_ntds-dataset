    "Background": "Blood culture-based surveillance for typhoid fever has limited sensitivity, and operational challenges are encountered in resource-limited settings. Environmental surveillance targeting Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) shed in wastewater (WW), coupled with cross-sectional serosurveys of S. Typhi-specific antibodies estimating exposure to infection, emerges as a promising alternative.",
    "Methods": "We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of wastewater (WW) and sero-surveillance for S. Typhi in Vellore, India, from May 2022 to April 2023. Monthly samples were collected from 40 sites in open drainage channels and processed using standardized protocols. DNA was extracted and analyzed via quantitative PCR for S. Typhi genes (ttr, tviB, staG) and the fecal biomarker HF183. Clinical cases of enteric fever were recorded from four major hospitals, and a cross-sectional serosurvey measured hemolysin E (HlyE) IgG levels in children under 15 years of age to estimate seroincidence.",
    "Results": "7.50% (39/520) of grab and 15.28% (79/517) Moore swabs were positive for all 3 S. Typhi genes. Moore swab positivity was significantly associated with HF183 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.08, 95% CI: 1.59–5.95) and upstream catchment population (aOR: 4.67, 1.97–11.04), and there was increased detection during monsoon season - membrane filtration (aOR: 2.99, 1.06–8.49), and Moore swab samples (aOR: 1.29, 0.60–2.79).",
    "Conclusions": "These findings underscore the utility and effectiveness of alternate surveillance approaches to estimating the incidence of S. Typhi infection in resource-limited settings, offering valuable insights for public health interventions and disease monitoring strategies where conventional methods are challenging to implement."
