Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant global public health challenge. The prevailing forms of CL in Morocco and Iran are caused by Leishmania major (L. major) and L. tropica. L. major is transmitted following the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies from animals to humans, while L. tropica spreads directly between people. Currently, there is a lack of sufficient transcriptome studies in the lesions of CL patients induced by different Leishmania species. This study focused on transcriptome analysis of the immune responses in Moroccan patients infected with L. major and Iranian patients infected with L. tropica. Using dual-color RT-MLPA, we examined the expression of genes related to innate, adaptive, and inflammatory responses in both patient groups. There are significant changes in the expression of several inflammatory genes in each group. Notably, patients with L. tropica lesions exhibited a higher number of differentially expressed genes compared to those with L. major, indicating a stronger inflammatory response associated with L. tropica infection. Itâ€™s crucial to highlight that genes involved in the IFN signaling pathway were significantly altered in the skin lesions of both groups. Understanding these differences will be pivotal in identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention to control the disease effectively.
