    "Background": "Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). Leprosy is believed to have originated initially in Eastern African regions and spread worldwide through the migration of people. Leprosy causes skin and nerve infections. It has been investigated that the Hansen’s bacillus, M. leprae, predominantly targets peripheral nerves.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The present study reviewed charts of 380 patients with complete records fulfilling the inclusion criteria. An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed. The study was conducted at Boru meda General Hospital, located in the South Wollo zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia from September 2019 to August 2021. In the current study, the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy among leprosy patients is found to be 60%. Male sex, advanced age, presence of leprosy reactions, presence of more than four skin lesions, longer duration of the disease, and MB leprosy were the risk factors associated with leprosy peripheral neuropathy. Sensory impairment was the most common presentation followed by motor impairment.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In Ethiopia, data is scarce regarding the prevalence, pattern and determinants of leprosy peripheral neuropathy. Hence, this study was intended to assess the prevalence, pattern and determinants of leprosy peripheral neuropathy. The result of this study would be served as an important input to develop recommendations that inform some clues for future researchers in this area. This study showed high prevalence of leprosy peripheral neuropathy among registered leprosy patients reflecting how much significant the study is."
