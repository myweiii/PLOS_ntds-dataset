Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by M. leprae. It is characterized by loss of sensation, muscle weakness, Skin lesions, nerve damage, and deformities. This study investigates the prevalence, patterns, and determinants of peripheral neuropathy in individuals with leprosy. We found a notable prevalence of 60% for leprosy-associated peripheral neuropathy. The most common pattern observed was sensory neuropathy, indicating a significant impact on sensory functions in affected individuals. The study further explored various determinants contributing to this high prevalence, offering insights into potential areas for targeted intervention and management strategies.
