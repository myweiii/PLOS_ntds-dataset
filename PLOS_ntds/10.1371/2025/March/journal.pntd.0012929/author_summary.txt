Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite responsible for causing onchocerciasis, is the second-leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is the target of elimination efforts by the World Health Organization (WHO), using widespread community administration of ivermectin. Occasionally, adult female worms develop pleomorphic neoplasms (PN), with a higher occurrence observed following ivermectin treatment. Research into this infection has been challenging due to limited animal models and invasiveness of collecting samples from patients. Most available clinical samples are frozen or chemically fixed tissues or paraffin embedded nodules. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using this fixed and embedded tissue to investigate worm biology. We used laser capture microdissection coupled with highly sensitive mass spectrometry analysis to determine the protein composition of PN and identify proteins potentially associated with tumor development. Our research let us develop a system to analyze the proteome of O. volvulus from nodule sections and identified proteins that are potentially linked to the development of PN and may contribute to worm infertility and mortality. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications of these findings.
