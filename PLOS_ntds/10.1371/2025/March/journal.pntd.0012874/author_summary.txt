Rabies virus infects all mammals with a fatality rate of nearly 100%. More than 99% of human rabies cases are transmitted via dog bites. Becoming one of the neglected tropical diseases, rabies occurs in several geographical areas. In Ethiopia, rabies vaccination coverage among dogs is far below the optimal 70%. This is due to the limited anti-rabies vaccination, lack of awareness among dog owners, and a high number of stray dogs. However, the overall risk of rabies has not yet been estimated in the country. Information on rabies incidence is important for notifying the population at risk and for planning effective prevention, control, and elimination strategies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies in Ethiopia. The annual pooled incidence rate of human exposure to suspected rabid animals was 33.65 per 100,000 humans. The suspected rabies deaths in humans were also estimated to be 4.57 per one million humans annually. Among animals, the highest combined estimate per 100,000 populations was recorded in dogs, 120.99, followed by equines and cattle, with pooled incidence rates of 19.57 and 18.08, respectively. We also found that human exposure to rabid animals and human rabies deaths were more common among children.
