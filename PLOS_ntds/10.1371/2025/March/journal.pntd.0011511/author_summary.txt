Onchocerciasis control is mainly based on mass treatment of populations with an annual dose of ivermectin. At the early implementation stage of onchocerciasis control activities, it was suggested that an onchocerciasis-endemic community using the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) approach should become free of the disease after 15 years, a period corresponding to the maximum lifespan of the parasite adult worm in humans. CDTI contributed to eliminate onchocerciasis in few foci in East and West African countries (e.g.,: Uganda, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Nigeria). In Central Africa, the elimination of this disease remains uncertain after 20 consecutive years of mass treatment in certain foci. The data presented in this study are very promising and suggest that the CDTI approach may stop in the short term the transmission of O. volvulus in the Adamaoua Region. In order to achieve the objective of eliminating onchocerciasis in the near future in this part of the country, efforts of population to comply with ivermectin treatment are essential. This will involve active raising awareness among men and women of all eligible age groups of the population in Adamaoua Region.
