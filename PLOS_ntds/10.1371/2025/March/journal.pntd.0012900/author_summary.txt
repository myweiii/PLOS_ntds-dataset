Persistent trachoma is increasingly recognized as a serious concern for the global trachoma program. Persistent trachoma is defined as those districts that have had two or more trachoma impact surveys in which the trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular (TF) prevalence has never been less than 5%, the elimination threshold for the TF indicator. Enhanced tools such as infection and serological monitoring can elucidate long-term transmission patterns within persistent districts. This study aimed to clarify trachoma intensity via both traditional indicators (TF) and Chlamydia trachomatis infection and serologic markers in four districts experiencing persistent trachoma. Surveys were conducted in these four districts in 2019 after more than 10 years of interventions. Although all districts had a TF prevalence greater than 5%, one remained highly endemic, with a high prevalence of TF, infection, and antibodies. Trachoma indicators were lower in the other three districts. Serological patterns across the age-span detected a significant decline in seroprevalence in one district approximately 12 years prior to the survey, coinciding with the beginning of trachoma interventions. Infection and serology may be useful tools for clarifying transmission, particularly among persistent districts. However, some districts may require more intense interventions to reach trachoma elimination within acceptable timelines.
