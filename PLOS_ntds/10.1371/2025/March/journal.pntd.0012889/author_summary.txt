Filarial nematodes are thread-like worms that can cause debilitating diseases such as river blindness (onchocerciasis) or elephantiasis (lymphatic filariasis). Similar to most helminth infections, filarial infections lead to eosinophilia, an increase of eosinophil granulocyte numbers in the peripheral blood. Although eosinophils have been shown to contribute actively to the protective immune responses, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of the eosinophil granule proteins major basic protein (MBP) und eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) against the filarial progeny, the microfilariae, of the rodent filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. Eosinophils lacking MBP or EPO inhibited microfilariae motility in vitro to a lesser extent than wild-type eosinophils. Consistent with these results, the addition of MBP and EPO inhibited microfilariae motility in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrate that eosinophils from the natural host of L. sigmodontis, the cotton rat, did not inhibit microfilariae motility in the same way, indicating either intrinsic differences among cotton rat and mouse eosinophils or an adaptation of the parasite to its natural host.
