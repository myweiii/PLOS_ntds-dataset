Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi transmitted via larval mite bites, is a re-emerging public health threat on Hainan Island within the Tsutsugamushi Triangle, offering a unique setting for studying disease transmission and genetic diversity. Utilizing gene flow analysis of the tsa56 gene and multilocus sequence typing, we identified 12 major sub-genotypes and traced their origins by integrating new and published data. Our analysis revealed that Hainan’s sub-genotypes share origins with the second and third recombinant generations of the tsa56 gene from isolates in Southeast Asia and China’s coastal regions, while also exhibiting unique local adaptations. Notably, the highest incidence and genetic diversity were observed in the inland city of Qiongzhong, and nine key regions showed significant genetic diversity with evidence of long-distance transmission of identical MLST sequence types, prompting us to consider whether birds play a role in the transmission process. The newly classified Karp_B_2 sub-genotype exhibited a more pronounced increasing trend in pathogen density during fever, while Gilliam sub-genotypes showed less distinct trends. These findings regarding pathogen density highlight general patterns rather than definitive conclusions, given the potential influence of confounding variables and the limited sample size. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted public health interventions in rural and agricultural areas of Hainan island where high genetic diversity and pathogen spread are prevalent. The broadly applicable genotyping methods used provide a foundation for more effective disease management and control strategies, focusing on hotspot regions and specific genotypes.
