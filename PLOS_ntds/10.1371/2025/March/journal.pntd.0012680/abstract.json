    "Abstract": "Leishmaniasis affects military personnel deployed to endemic areas following exposure to sand flies infected with the protozoa Leishmania. This systematic review and meta-analysis of data specific to military populations aims to identify knowledge gaps to mitigate sand fly exposure and Leishmania transmission during deployments. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463687). Random-effects meta-analyses and narrative synthesis were performed. Thirty-six studies were included, most of which reported on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), showing a mean cumulative incidence of 10% (95% CI: 5–16), suggesting higher rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region (14% [95% CI: 12–16]) compared to the African region (8%) and American region (9%). Asymptomatic Leishmania infection had a cumulative incidence of 11% (95% CI: 6–17), with higher rates in Eastern Mediterranean countries (20% [95% CI: 14–25]). Diagnosis involved parasitological, serological, and molecular methods, with L. (L) mexicana and L. (V.) braziliensis identified as the predominant CL pathogens in deployed troops in the Americas. Visceral leishmaniasis cases were less frequent, all reported from the Eastern Mediterranean and associated with the Leishmania donovani/infantum complex; whereas CL cases in the Old World were due predominantly to L. major and L. tropica. Regular use of long-lasting insecticidal nets to mitigate sand fly exposure demonstrated high potential effectiveness than other reported personal protective measures (PPMs) which yielded mixed or inconclusive results. In summary, the systematic review revealed the substantial variability between study designs and statistical integrity. There is need for more consistent and robustly designed studies including well-define controls and replication. Future studies would be advised to explore the long-term effectiveness and practicality of PPMs, both individually and in combination, across diverse deployment settings."
