Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies that affects populations worldwide, with particularly increasing incidence among military personnel deployed to endemic regions. This systematic review and meta-analysis focuses on leishmaniasis among military populations, examining rates of infection, regional variations, and the effectiveness of preventive measures. Our study synthesises data from thirty-six studies, revealing a 10% overall incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) among deployed troops, with the highest rates found in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Additionally, asymptomatic infections were observed at a cumulative rate of 11%, with significant regional variations. The review identifies L. (L) mexicana and L. (V.) braziliensis as the primary CL pathogens in the Americas, while L. major and L. tropica were the most common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The analysis also highlights the effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets in reducing sand fly exposure, though other personal protective measures (PPMs) showed mixed results. Despite these findings, our study notes substantial variability in study design and statistical rigor across the included research, highlighting the need for more standardised, well-controlled studies with reproducible methodologies. This study provides recommendations for future research on leishmaniasis in military settings and beyond, advocating for long-term evaluations of PPM efficacy across diverse regions. The findings emphasise the importance of region-specific disease control strategies and add to the growing body of evidence guiding prevention, treatment, and policy in the neglected tropical disease community.
