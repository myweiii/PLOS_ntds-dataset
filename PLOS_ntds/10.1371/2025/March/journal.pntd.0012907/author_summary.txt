Ticks can transmit many viruses with public health impact on humans and livestock. Here we explore data-reuse of publicly available tick transcriptomic or metagenome sequencing freely available in open access databases as a mechanism to passively increase xenosurveillance data on the distribution and genomic identity of tick-borne viruses. Using open-source tools for de novo assembly and taxonomic classification, we recovered 127 partial virus genomes from 35 data sets. Human and animal pathogens comprise 32.8% of the genomes, including recently described pathogens Alongshan virus (ALSV), Beiji nairovirus (BJNV) and Nuomin virus, along with African swine fever virus (ASFV) and African horse sickness virus 3 (AHSV-3). Our findings demonstrate previously generated data can be leveraged for detecting tick-borne viruses, as exemplified by records of the human pathogens ALSV and BJNV in Europe, and other viruses previously detailed in screening reports. The monitoring of pathogens using publicly available data, combined with accurate sample information, can potentially support surveillance efforts, highlighting regions of preliminary spillover and identifying targets for screening.
