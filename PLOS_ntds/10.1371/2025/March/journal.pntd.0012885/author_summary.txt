The zoonotic P. knowlesi parasite is an emerging, yet understudied, cause of malaria in Southeast Asia. Sabah, Malaysia, has amongst the highest burden of human P. knowlesi infection in the world, however, the region is currently understudied. We produced a collection of high-quality P. knowlesi genomes from Sabah, and in combination with publicly available data, performed an extensive population genetics analysis. Our work contributes novel insights for Plasmodium knowlesi population genetics and genetic epidemiology.
