Dengue places a significant burden especially in low- and middle-income countries, including Vietnam. The pathogenesis of dengue is attributed to a complex interaction between the dengue virus and the host immune system. We explicitly investigated on the occurrence of arboviruses (CHIKV, DENV and ZIKA) during two consecutive outbreaks in 2021 and 2022 from Northern Vietnam and compared the results with those of previous outbreaks. From the study cohort of cases of dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs and severe dengue, we investigated whether levels of the human cytokine IL-10 and IL-10 promoter variants were associated with susceptibility and with their clinical course. The results show that DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4 were the circulating serotypes in 2021-2022. Serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-2 were more frequently observed in dengue cases with warning signs and in severe dengue, while no cases of chikungunya or Zika viruses were detected in the studied period. Plasma IL-10 levels and IL-10 promoter variants were significantly modulated in patients with varying degrees of severity.
