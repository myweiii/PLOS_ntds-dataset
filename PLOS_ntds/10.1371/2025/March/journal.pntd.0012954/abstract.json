    "Background": "The pathogenesis of dengue is attributed to a complex interaction between the dengue virus (DENV) and the host immune system. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical, virological, and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) profiles of dengue patients in Vietnam from two consecutive outbreaks in 2021 and 2022.",
    "Methods": "A total of n=306 dengue patients were examined, who were clinically stratified according to dengue without warning signs (DF; n=178), dengue with warning signs (DWS; n=115) and severe dengue (SD; n=13). Patients were screened for dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. DENV were subjected to serotype specific real-time RT-PCR. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were measured by ELISA, and IL-10 promoter variants (-1082G/A; -819C/T; -592C/A) were genotyped by direct Sanger sequencing to determine a possible association with susceptibility to dengue and disease severity.",
    "Results": "No chikungunya or Zika viruses were detected. Patients were infected by one of the three different DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -4). Plasma IL-10 levels were significantly elevated in patients (DF vs. DWS, p=0.004; DF vs. SD, p=0.001; DWS vs. SD, p=0.015). While the IL-10 allele -819C contributed to an increased risk of dengue (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.0, p=0.04), genotype -1082GA showed a protective role against the disease (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.27-0.72, p=0.009), and allele -1082G showed a protective role against DWS (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.22-0.81, p=0.049). Also, the IL-10 GTA (-1082G/-819T/-592A) haplotype was observed to confer protection (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14-0.67, p< 0.003).",
    "Conclusion": "While DENV-1 and DENV-2 were the predominant serotypes in circulation, plasma IL-10 levels and IL-10 promoter variants were also significantly associated with dengue and its severity."
