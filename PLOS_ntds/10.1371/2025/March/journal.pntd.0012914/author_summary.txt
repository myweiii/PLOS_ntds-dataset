Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), remains a significant global health issue with millions of cases annually. Accurate diagnosis and early identification of severe cases are critical challenges. This study aimed to identify potential biomarker genes associated with dengue fever by analyzing gene expression data from multiple studies. Using advanced bioinformatics tools, 163 potential biomarker genes were identified. Notably, genes such as AURKA, BUB1, and CDK1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and immune responses, were significantly dysregulated. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes are primarily associated with immune response, cell division, and RNA processing pathways, such as mitotic nuclear division and chromosome segregation. The identification of these key regulatory genes not only advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dengue fever but also provides promising targets for developing early diagnostic methods and therapeutic interventions. These insights could lead to more effective management of dengue, potentially reducing its severe manifestations and associated mortality.
