Madurella fahalii, a species closely related to M. mycetomatis, the most common cause of eumycetoma, exhibits resistance to itraconazole, the standard treatment for this neglected tropical disease. The underlying mechanism of this resistance remains unclear. Understanding it is essential for improving treatment options for M. fahalii infections. In this study, using genetic engineering techniques and a high-quality genome sequence of M. fahalii, we identified an additional gene associated with itraconazole resistance, which is absent in M. mycetomatis. This discovery could pave the way for more effective treatment strategies for eumycetoma caused by M. fahalii in the future.
