We thank everyone who assisted with establishing sites, data collection, and sample processing including J.R. Kubiszeski, R. Miranda, and A. Pepper. We would also like to acknowledge the landowners across Sinop, Mato Grosso who allowed us access to their properties for insect collection. The Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB) at Oregon State University provided access to the Illumina HiSeq 3000 for all metabarcoding.
