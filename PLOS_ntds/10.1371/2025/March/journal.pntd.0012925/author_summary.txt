The effects of land-use change on disease risk is a particularly important topic in tropical forests where deforestation is concentrated and both biodiversity and disease burden are high. Vector-borne diseases require interactions among hosts, vectors, and pathogens, any of which could be either disrupted or facilitated by deforestation. We investigated how interactions between sandfly vectors and vertebrate hosts for Leishmania parasites respond to deforestation across a landscape defined by a matrix of forest and agriculture within the Amazonian ‘Arc of Deforestation’. The most common vector was encountered less frequently where there was more pasture. The sandflies fed on a variety of vertebrates, but domestic dogs and nine-banded armadillos were the predominant hosts. The likelihood of detecting a host in sandfly bloodmeals was highest at sites with intermediate levels of forest cover and agriculture, a pattern also observed with carrion flies, indicating that increased host availability, rather than feeding preferences, drives this result. Dogs and nine-banded armadillos were the most common vertebrate taxa in sandfly pools, suggesting the importance of both domestic and wild hosts in facilitating zoonotic disease transmission in human-impacted tropical forests.
