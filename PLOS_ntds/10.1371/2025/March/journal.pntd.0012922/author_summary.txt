Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is known to exhibit a high fatality rate in immunocompromised population, and prophylactic medication has been proven effective. However, the current diagnostic methods, such as microscopic and PCR examination, are impractical to be used in primary healthcare settings for more rapid and cost-effective diagnosis and impact the effectiveness of treatment strategies. Here, utilizing Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) coupled with CRISPR/Cas12a fluorescence detection, an innovative diagnostic approach was developed and evaluated with 83 clinical samples. Considering the detection performance of this new method, it provided a reliable point-of-care solution for PJP. Further, it implied that the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a holds significant promise for advancing molecular diagnostics in both clinical and field-based settings.
