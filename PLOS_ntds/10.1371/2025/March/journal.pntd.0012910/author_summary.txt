Canine rabies is endemic in Nigeria, with low canine vaccination rates. Dog bite victims frequently resort to traditional remedies, which can lead to fatalities. We conducted a study across three states in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory to understand the factors influencing the decision to seek traditional therapy. We found that being male, residing in a rural area, and having limited access to veterinary services were significantly associated with the probability of seeking traditional remedies. Children under 17 years of age, respondents with higher levels of education, and civil servants were less likely to use traditional remedies after being bitten by a dog. Also, poverty and a latent understanding of the risks of rabies were negatively associated with the probability of seeking traditional remedies. Our findings highlight the need to improve public education, enhance access to medical care, and involve traditional healers as rabies surveillance informants in rabies prevention and control programs.
