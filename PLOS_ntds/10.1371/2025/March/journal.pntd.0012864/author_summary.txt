Malaria relapse from reactivation of the undetectable dormant liver stage parasite of Plasmodium vivax causes significant morbidity and mortality, and is a barrier to malaria elimination. The only class of drugs able to remove these liver stage parasites (8-aminoquinoline) are contra-indicated in patients with the inborn red blood cell disorder glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Testing for G6PD deficiency prior to 8-aminoquinoline prescription is recommended by the WHO. In this meta-analysis study, we collected data from published articles and other datasets of studies evaluating the performance of various field-based G6PD activity measurement devices and calculated the pooled performance of each device. The pooled analysis showed that one device, the STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, RoK), performed better at measuring G6PD activity compared to the others, although its accuracy may be impacted by the sex and malaria status of the patient. The device was also the most evaluated among the others.
