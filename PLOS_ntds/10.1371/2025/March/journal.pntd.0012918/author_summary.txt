The COVID-19 pandemic, showed surge of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 across different time points, affecting millions globally and highlighting the importance of understanding how viruses change over time. This study explored how SARS-CoV-2 evolved in India, particularly focusing on the role of age, location, and vaccination in driving substitution mutations. By analyzing the genome data of the virus collected in India from different age groups—children, working-age adults, and the elderly—we found that working-age adults showed a high number of unique substitutions. This suggests that stronger immune responses in this age group may drive the virus to adapt more quickly. We also discovered that during the vaccination period, substitution rates increased across all age groups, with these rates staying high even after widespread vaccination. This may mean that both natural and vaccine-induced immunity can encourage the virus to mutate. Our findings suggest that local conditions, like population immunity and vaccination coverage, can shape the virus's substitution patterns. Continuous monitoring of these changes is essential for preparing for future pandemics, especially in high-risk areas like India, helping us improve global health responses and prevent new outbreaks.
