Helminth infections are parasitic worm infections that are common in low- and middle-income countries, especially in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to these infections, which can lead to significant health issues for both the mother and the unborn child, including anemia and complications during pregnancy. Despite the World Health Organizationâ€™s recommendation for routine deworming during pregnancy, many women in Uganda and similar settings continue to be affected by helminth infections due to gaps in public health interventions.
In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence, common helminths, and associated factors among 334 pregnant women attending antenatal care at a tertiary hospital in Uganda. We found that 27.5% of participants were infected, with hookworm being the most common parasite. Key risk factors included rural residence, lack of access to toilet facilities, walking barefoot, and poor hand hygiene before meals. These findings emphasize the urgent need for community-wide deworming campaigns, improved access to sanitation, and strengthened hygiene education as part of antenatal care services.
Our study sheds light on the current burden of helminth infections in pregnant women and highlights practical recommendations for public health interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.
