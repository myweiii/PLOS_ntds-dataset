    "Background": "Aedes koreicus is native to Far East Asia and recorded in Europe since 2008. In Italy, Ae. koreicus is widespread throughout the Northern part of the peninsula, highlighting its invasive potential and spread. However, no clear clues about the dispersal patterns of the species have been collected so far.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Population genetic analyses were performed to assess the genetic structure of populations of Ae. koreicus and to make hypotheses about its dispersal patterns in Northern Italy. Ten microsatellite markers specific for Ae. koreicus were used to genotype 414 individuals from 13 populations in the pre-alpine area of Italy, and neighboring Slovenia. Basic and Bayesian population genetic analyses were performed to evaluate patterns of genetic variation, genetic structure, and demography of selected mosquito populations. While presenting a certain degree of structuring, the Italian and Slovenian populations of Ae. koreicus were poorly differentiated. Moreover, demographic analysis supports the expansion of a single population propagule of Ae. koreicus in Italy and Slovenia and provides evidence of the presence of overwintering populations in the studied area.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our results highlight a common origin, and stable colonization of Northern Italy and Slovenia, as a probable consequence of the expansion of a unique population. This stresses out the importance of continuous monitoring of Ae. koreicus, to finally uncover the geographic origins and entrance pathways of invasive populations and to prevent or limit further introductions."
