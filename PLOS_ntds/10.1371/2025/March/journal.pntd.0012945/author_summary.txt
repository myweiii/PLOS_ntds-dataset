In the present manuscript, the population genetics of the invasive mosquito Aedes koreicus is presented. Specifically, 13 invasive (Italy, Slovenia) and one native (Republic of Korea, ROK) populations have been analyzed, with a particular focus on individuals from Northern Italy, an area where a widespread presence of the mosquito species has been observed. Results revealed a low variability in populations from non-endemic countries, even when collected in different years. A stable colonization is thus highlighted. This is probably the consequence of a single event of importation, as supported by demographic analysis. Individuals from the ROK mainland here analyzed are not the source of this introduction, being genetically unrelated to the Italian and Slovenian individuals. This research provided novel data for the investigation of the pattern of expansion of Ae. koreicus in Northern Italy, and thus pose important basis for future studies of the invasive corridors of the species to limit/prevent its further dispersion.
