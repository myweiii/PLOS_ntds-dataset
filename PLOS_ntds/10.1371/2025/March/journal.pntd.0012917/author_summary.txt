The common roundworms of dogs and cats are also capable of infecting other animals, including humans. Infected dogs and cats can release parasite eggs into the environment, where they develop if the conditions are warm and moist enough. Accidental ingestion of these eggs can cause difficult to diagnose illness in humans. The aim of this study was to measure the number of Toxocara spp. eggs in soil samples of public parks in Dublin City. We aimed to do this in a clear and repeatable manner, using freely available software to help standardise the selection of soil sampling locations, as well as providing a detailed methodology regarding how soil samples were actually taken, information which is often lacking from similar studies. In addition, we aimed to establish the species of each egg detected using PCR, to identify whether dogs or cats were likely responsible for the presence of eggs in the environment. Based on the results of this study, park entrances were the most commonly contaminated location within each park. The majority of eggs detected were potentially infective, and dogs were responsible for the majority of this contamination.
