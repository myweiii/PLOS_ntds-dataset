Noma is a disease that mostly affects children living in poverty. It starts as a form of gingivitis that, without treatment, rapidly evolves into the death of the surrounding tissues, including the skin and bones. Survivors often face severe facial disfigurement, which affects their well-being, from eating or speaking, to socialising. However, noma is preventable. If healthcare workers could recognize it early, a simple course of antibiotics, wound care and proper nutrition—things that are widely available—could stop the disease before it causes such damage.
For this reason, we wanted to know the level of awareness of noma among health practitioners in Zambezia, Mozambique. We found that while 59% of them had heard about noma, and 26.8% had treated a patient themselves, very few could diagnose it or treat it early enough to prevent its irreversible consequences, or were aware of its fatality and rapid progression. This is similar to findings in Zambia and Burkina Faso, where noma has also been neglected.
This indicates an urgent need to raise awareness and provide training for healthcare workers. The issue stems not from a lack of access to treatment, but rather from a lack of access to a timely diagnosis.
