Buruli ulcer is a serious and debilitating neglected tropical disease of public health concern, one of several with skin manifestations known as Skin NTDs. Buruli ulcer mostly affects rural communities in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The diets of these communities are rarely studied, including potential links with infectious diseases. In this paper, we employed dietary surveys and blood analysis to investigate the potential links between nutrition and Buruli ulcer in two sets of patients and controls from the Ashanti and CentralÂ regions of Ghana. We found that the diets of the study population were inadequate in many vitamins and minerals. Their blood levels of vitamin C and zinc were also frequently lower than normal. The Buruli ulcer patients had poorer diets and were also more likely to have vitamin and mineral inadequacies compared to matched controls. Supplementing the diets of at-risk communities and patients with Buruli ulcer may therefore be valuable in its prevention and treatment, respectively. It could also be a cost-effective strategy to reduce the burden of skin NTDs more broadly.
