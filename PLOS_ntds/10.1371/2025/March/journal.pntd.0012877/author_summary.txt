Tick and tick-borne diseases present a significant threat to human and animal health. To mitigate tick bites and the spread of tick-borne diseases, chemical repellents are commonly utilized in daily life. In recent years, the resistance and toxicity of chemical repellents have been brought to light, leading to a growing interest in plant-derived repellents as a new research focus. Ticks sense their environment primarily through their sense of smell because their vision and hearing are underdeveloped. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying tick olfaction remain poorly understood. The interaction between ticks and plant-derived chemicals is a fascinating area of study. Our findings revealed Haller’s organ is the key sensory organ for tick sensing of cinnamaldehyde. We reveal an ionotropic receptor in ticks that specifically detects cinnamaldehyde, triggering repellent responses through Haller’s organs, and elucidated its binding site. A comprehensive understanding of this process is imperative for effective tick prevention and disease control.
