Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global public health, challenging the effectiveness of key antibiotics to treat infections. Haemophilus spp., particularly Haemophilus influenzae, are bacteria responsible for various serious illnesses, such as respiratory and ear infections. Macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin, are essential to combating these infections. However, resistance to these drugs is increasing, making treatments less effective.
In this study, we analyzed data from published research to assess the prevalence of macrolide resistance in Haemophilus spp. globally. We found that resistance rates vary widely depending on the region, testing methods, and specific antibiotics studied. For example, azithromycin resistance was around 9.3%, while erythromycin resistance reached as high as 79%. Clarithromycin resistance has grown significantly in recent years, rising from 0.7% to 12.6% between 2020 and 2023.
These findings highlight the urgent need for ongoing monitoring of resistance patterns and improved strategies to manage infections caused by Haemophilus spp. By understanding how resistance evolves, healthcare providers can better tailor treatments, preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics and improving patient outcomes. This work underscores the broader challenge of AMR and the importance of global efforts to address this critical issue.
