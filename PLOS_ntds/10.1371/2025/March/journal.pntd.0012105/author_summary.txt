Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease that can be eliminated by periodically treating entire at-risk communities with safe and efficacious medicines, a strategy known as mass drug administration (MDA). Prior experience shows that MDA campaigns require intense planning to ensure that every eligible person within the community can receive the medicines. We aimed to improve the campaign by better involving key MDA stakeholders such as volunteers and other important community members in the planning process, through microplanning. The participants suggested many strategies to help the campaign reach more community members, including better ways to prepare and inform the community that the campaign is happening. We invited the microplanning participants to provide feedback on how this new strategy worked compared with their experiences during past campaigns. Participants reported that they felt better engaged by health authorities, and in particular, that they had more information about the results of past campaigns, where they should be distributing medicines, and their specific tasks and responsibilities during the campaign. We found that more people received medicines during the campaign that followed the microplanning workshops compared with the previous campaigns. We conclude that microplanning helped to increase the number of people who received MDA medicines.
