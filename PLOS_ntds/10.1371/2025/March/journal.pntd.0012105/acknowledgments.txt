We would like to give special thanks to the community drug distributors, community promoters, community leaders, and other stakeholders who enthusiastically participated in the microplanning sessions and for their everyday efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in Haiti. We would also like to thank our partners, namely the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) staff, RTI International, the Carter Center, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the University of Notre Dame for their collaborative efforts to improve MDA coverage in Port-au-Prince. We would like to thank Dr. Ryan E. Wiegand and Dr. Andrew Hill for their assistance in generating the alluvial diagrams. Further, we would like to thank Andrew Berens from CDCâ€™s Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP) for creating and printing the supervision area maps for community leaders that were used as part of this project.
