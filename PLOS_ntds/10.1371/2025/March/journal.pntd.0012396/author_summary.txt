The city of El Pedregal, established in a formerly desert region through an agricultural irrigation project in southern Peru, experienced a dog-mediated rabies outbreak identified in 2021, with cases reported into 2022. Although the outbreak is currently under control, questions about the origin of the El Pedregal outbreak and its implications for maintaining effective dog rabies control in Peru remain unanswered. We examined a re-emerging dog-mediated rabies outbreak in El Pedregal, Peru, using phylogenomic analysis of 34 rabies virus genomes collected from 2010 to 2023. Our results revealed that the 2021 outbreak cases originated from a single introduction unrelated to ongoing rabies in Arequipa, while a 2022 case represented a separate introduction from Arequipa rather than rabies virus persistence within El Pedregal. All new samples fell into a recently identified minor clade (Cosmopolitan Am5), sharing ancestry with rabies virus lineages from Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. Our findings suggest that human-mediated dog movement facilitated multiple introductions, and that despite containment efforts, continued circulation in Arequipa, Puno, and Bolivia keeps El Pedregal at risk. Addressing these underlying drivers—particularly the cross-regional movement of dogs—and strengthening genomic surveillance can guide more effective interventions and sustainable rabies control strategies.
