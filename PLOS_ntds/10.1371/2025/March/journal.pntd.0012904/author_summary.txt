This study provides the first overview of chikungunya infections in mainland Europe in the time period 2007–2023. The 4730 chikungunya cases were reported in 22 countries, predominantly affecting females aged 45–64 years. The United Kingdom had the highest number of cases (21.9%), followed by France (19.6%), Germany (14.5%), and Italy (13.6%). Bubble plot illustrating the dynamics of age-standardized incidence rates by country per year showed significant variation. The majority of chikungunya infections in humans were travel-related, with most cases originating from India (11.7%), Dominican Republic (9.0%), Guadeloupe (8.7%), and Thailand (7.8%). Chikungunya cases in Europe showed a seasonal pattern with peaks mainly associated with summer vacation. Two genotypes were identified based on genome sequencing, with the II-ECSA genotype being predominant. Common symptoms included fever (97.6%), joint pain (94.3%), and fatigue (63.5%).
