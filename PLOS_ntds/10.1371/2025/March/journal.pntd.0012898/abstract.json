    "Background": "Zika produced the highest increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Latin America in the last decade. The Neuroinfections Emerging in the Americas Study (NEAS) was established in 2016 to investigate the association of emerging infectious disorders with GBS in Colombia. The present study assessed the role of preceding infections, including arboviruses and other pathogens, as risk factors for GBS.",
    "Methods": "A case-control study was conducted prospectively between June 2016 and December 2019 in 5 Colombian cities. We recruited newly diagnosed patients with GBS and a house control plus an age and season-matched-hospital control per case. Clinical information, blood, CSF, and urine samples were used to diagnose bacterial and viral infections. Anti-glycolipid antibodies were identified in serum. Statistical analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression.",
    "Findings": "Fifty-seven patients with GBS, 66·7% male, 52 years of median age, were recruited along with 77 (55 house and 22 hospital) controls. GBS was associated with presenting diarrhea (adjusted OR 10·94; 95% CI 1·8-66·29; p=0·009) and a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection (aOR 13·91; 95% CI 2·38-81·1 p=0·003). Specific recent infections did not significantly differ between cases and controls, but the number of infections was associated with GBS (aOR=1·77 95% CI 1·04-3·01 p=0·03). C. jejuni (74%), M. pneumoniae (23%), and Chikungunya (7%) were the most frequent infections. Anti-glycolipid IgG against GM1 and their heterodimer complexes were identified to be associated with GBS.",
    "Conclusions": "After the Zika epidemic, infections causing diarrhea and upper respiratory diseases contributed to the burden of GBS in Colombia. Prevention and control of food-borne pathogens could reduce the incidence of GBS in Colombia."
