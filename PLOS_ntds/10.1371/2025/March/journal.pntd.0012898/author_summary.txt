Before the emergence of the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, the incidence and risk factors associated with GBS were not well documented in Colombia and many Latin American countries. A major outbreak of GBS associated with Zika infection in 2016 and evidence of seasonality and clusters of GBS in some Latin American countries prompted the investigation of the role of infections as risk factors associated with GBS in Colombia. Our study assessed factors associated with GBS in Colombia, which included a wide spectrum of infectious etiologies, bacterial and viral pathogens, and arboviruses recently emerging in the Americas such as Chikungunya and Zika. The evidence further supports that diarrheal disease and upper respiratory infections are the dominant drivers in the pathogenesis of GBS in the post-Zika period in Colombia and possibly in other Latin American countries. Campylobacter jejuni, a gastrointestinal pathogen, was the most prevalent infection in GBS, highlighting the significance of diarrheal disease as a risk factor in GBS. The study also underlies the observation that after Zika became endemic in the Americas, particularly in Colombia, the number of cases of Zika-associated GBS decreased and paralleled the lower incidence of Zika in the overall population.
