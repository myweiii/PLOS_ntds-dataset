Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a neglected disease that causes stigmatization and carries a significant socioeconomic and personal burden in South Asia and East Africa. Currently, predicting its progression to a severe form remains largely unknown. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) methods to identify biomarkers of disease progression in PKDL using clinical, biochemical, haematological, and immunological data from a large cohort of Sudanese patients with either progressive (worsening) or stable conditions at diagnosis. For the first time, this study identified a combination of patient factors that may help provide a more accurate diagnosis of difficult-to-treat PKDL cases, with potential implications for improving patient management and quality of life.
