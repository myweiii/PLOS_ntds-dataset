Hyalomma rufipes is one of the main vectors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). We mapped the potential suitable area of H. rufipes in partial Africa and Eurasia. The model indicated that Areas with higher possibility to be suitable for H. rufipes include Northern and Southern Africa, the Western and Southern Iberian Peninsula, the Arabian Peninsula, southern coastal areas of France and Italy, Cyprus, TÃ¼rkiye, parts of Greece, the Caucasus region, and Iran and Afghanistan. By integrating data on migratory birds infested with H. rufipes with our findings, it becomes clear that the Mediterranean region warrants closer monitoring for tick surveillance and prevention. This study enhances the understanding of the potential distribution of CCHF vector and provides insights for vector and CCHF surveillance.
