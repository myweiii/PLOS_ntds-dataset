Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced cardiac pathology, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to use different viral strains inÂ future alphavirus research.
