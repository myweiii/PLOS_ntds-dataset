Mycolactone is a lipophilic molecule produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). Mycolactone displays unique cytocidal and immunosuppressive properties that are reflected locally by massive tissue necrosis and minimal inflammation. Here we investigated whether mycolactone diffuses from infected tissues and exerts immunosuppressive properties at the systemic level. We used both a radiolabeled form of the toxin and a direct LC-MS/MS analysis of lipid extracts from internal organs and cell subpopulations to investigate the pharmacodistribution of mycolactone in vivo. Using a mouse model of subcutaneous infection with M. ulcerans, we show that mycolactone distributes far beyond the sphere of its cytocidal action. The toxin diffused from infected tissues into the blood and the spleen, where it concentrated in mononuclear cell subsets. Importantly, mycolactone was detected in circulating blood several weeks before ulcerative lesions develop. The presence of mycolactone in blood cells was associated with a decreased capacity of circulating lymphocytes to produce interleukin-2 upon stimulation. In addition to providing the first evidence that mycolactone targets key immune cell populations in infected hosts, this work suggests that mycolactone detection in peripheral blood cells may form the basis of diagnostic tests of early disease.
