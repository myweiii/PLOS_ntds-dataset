Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, or Buruli ulcer, is the third most common mycobacteriosis of humans worldwide, after tuberculosis and leprosy. Buruli ulcer is a neglected, devastating, necrotizing disease, sometimes producing massive, disfiguring ulcers, with huge social impact. Buruli ulcer occurs predominantly in impoverished, humid, tropical, rural areas of Africa, where the incidence has been increasing, surpassing tuberculosis and leprosy in some regions. Besides being a disease of the poor, Buruli ulcer is a poverty-promoting chronic infectious disease. There is strong evidence that M. ulcerans is not transmitted person to person but is an environmental pathogen transmitted to humans from its aquatic niches. However, until now M. ulcerans has not been isolated in pure culture from environmental sources. This manuscript describes the first isolation, to our knowledge, of M. ulcerans in pure culture from an environmental source. This strain, which is highly virulent for mice, has microbiological features typical of African strains of M. ulcerans and was isolated from an aquatic insect from a Buruli ulcerâ€“endemic area in Benin, West Africa. Our findings support the concept that M. ulcerans is a pathogen of humans with an aquatic environmental niche and will have positive consequences for the control of this neglected and socially important tropical disease.
