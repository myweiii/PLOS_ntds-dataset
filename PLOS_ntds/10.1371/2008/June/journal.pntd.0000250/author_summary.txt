Schistosomiasis is a serious public health problem in the People's Republic of China and elsewhere, and mapping of risk areas is important for guiding control interventions. Here, a 10-year surveillance database from Dangtu County in the southeastern part of the People's Republic of China was utilized for modeling the spatial and temporal distribution of infections in relation to environmental features and socioeconomic factors. Disease surveillance was done on the basis of a serological test, and we explicitly considered the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test when modeling the ‘true’ infection prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum. We then produced a risk map for S. japonicum transmission, which can assist decision making for local control interventions. Our work emphasizes the importance of accounting for the uncertainty in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, and the potential of predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of the disease when using a Bayesian modeling framework. Our study can therefore serve as a template for future risk profiling of neglected tropical diseases studies, particularly when exploring spatial and temporal disease patterns in relation to environmental and socioeconomic factors, and how to account for the influence of diagnostic uncertainty.
