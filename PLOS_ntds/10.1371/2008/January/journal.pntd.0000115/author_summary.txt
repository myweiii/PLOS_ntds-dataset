Entamoeba histolytica is a unicellular protozoan parasite that infects about 50 million people each year and can cause potentially life-threatening diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis and extraintestinal abscesses. The infections are primarily treated by antiamoebic therapy. Drugs of choice for invasive amoebiasis are tissue-active agents, such as metronidazole, tinidazole, and chloroquine. Although drug resistance to E. histolytica does not appear to be a serious problem, there are occasional reports of failure with metronidazole, suggesting that clinical drug resistance may be developing. When identifying a drug target, it is important that the putative target be absent in the host, or, if it is present in the host, that the homologue in the parasite be substantially different from the host homologue so that it can be exploited as a drug target. Such is the case with the enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, a pathway that has been exploited as a target to control disease caused by several parasites. We report, to our knowledge for the first time, molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of the ornithine decarboxylase from E. histolytica, a rate limiting enzyme in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway.
