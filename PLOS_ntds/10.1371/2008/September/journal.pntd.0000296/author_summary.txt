The fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a severe pulmonary mycosis that is endemic to Latin America, where an estimated 10 million people are infected with the fungus. Despite the importance of this disease, we know little about the ecological and evolutionary history of this fungus. Here, we present a survey of genetic variation in putative virulence genes in P. brasiliensis in what constitutes the first systematic approach to understand the molecular evolution of the fungus. We used a population genetics approach to determine the role has natural selection played in the coding genes for proteins involved in pathogenesis. We found that nonsynonymous mutations are more common in genes that code for virulence factors than in housekeeping genes. Our results suggest that positive selection has played an important role in the evolution of virulence factors of P. brasiliensis and is therefore an important factor in the host–pathogen dynamics. Our results also have implications for the possible development of a vaccine against paracoccidioidomycosis, since gp43—the main vaccine candidate—has a high level of polymorphism maintained by natural selection.
