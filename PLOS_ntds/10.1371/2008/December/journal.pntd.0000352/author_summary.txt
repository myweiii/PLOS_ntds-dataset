Helminth species such as Necator americanus and Schistosoma mansoni are among the most prevalent of chronic human infections in the developing world. Individuals living in endemic areas are commonly infected with both species. Although the implications of being co-infected with helminths are increasingly recognized, factors influencing patterns of co-infection within human communities remain ill-defined. Here, we describe spatial patterns and risk factors for co-infection with N. americanus and S. mansoni in a co-endemic area in south-eastern Brazil. The prevalence of co-infection with these two helminths in this region was high (41%), varied across the study area and was clustered in high-risk households. We reveal that factors associated with lower socio-economic status (relative socio-economic status, household crowding) and residential environment (living in the eastern watershed or in areas with less vegetation) were significantly associated with the risk of co-infection relative to being uninfected with either species. Importantly, much of the variability in risk between households (i.e. household clustering) could not be readily explained by these risk factors. The results suggest that, whilst measures aimed at reducing exposure to infection may have an important impact on co-infection and its associated morbidity, untangling the relative contribution of intrinsic host factors (e.g. immune response) from household and environmental determinants remains critical to our understanding of helminth epidemiology.
