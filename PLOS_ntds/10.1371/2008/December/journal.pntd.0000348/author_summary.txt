Protozoans belonging to genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma are single-cell organisms that can infect humans and cause disfiguring lesions and debilitating or fatal diseases, with enormous social and economic impact in many tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. The drugs currently available to treat the different forms of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis were introduced many decades ago and have significant drawbacks, especially in terms of efficacy, length of treatment, route of administration, toxicity, and cost. In our screening program for new natural products with leishmanicidal activity, we found that the crude extract of a fungus living within the plant Piptadenia adiantoides could kill 90% of the amastigote-like forms of Leishmania amazonensis. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract resulted in the isolation of cochlioquinone A and isocochlioquinone A, which showed EC50 values (effective concentrations required to kill 50% of the parasite) of 1.7 µM and 4.1 µM, respectively. These compounds were not active against three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7/mammary, TK-10/renal, and UACC-62/melanoma), indicating some degree of selectivity towards the parasites. Our results suggest that cochlioquinones may serve as starting points for developing new drugs to treat leishmaniasis and reinforce the role of endophytic fungi as an important source of natural products with relevant biological activities.
