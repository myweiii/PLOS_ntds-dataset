The causative agent of the infectious disease, amoebiasis, is the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which targets human intestine and liver. Once in the host, this parasite attaches to human cells and matrix components via factors at its surface such as the Gal/GalNAc lectin and proteophosphoglycans (PPGs). These factors are themselves anchored to the parasite surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. To synthesise the GPI, a cascade of enzymes are necessary including the mannosyltransferase 1 (PIG-M1). A homolog of the PIG-M1 enzyme was shown to be present in E. histolytica (EhPIG-M1). To study the role of EhPIG-M1 in E. histolytica, parasites were constructed that had a reduced amount of mannosyltransferase. These parasites displayed a diminished production of GPI molecules and a lower amount of PPGs at the cell surface. Interestingly, the parasites were highly sensitive to the host blood complement and the formation of liver abscesses in hamsters was dramatically impaired. These results suggest that molecules anchored to the cell surface with the GPI moiety have a pivotal role in the survival of E. histolytica during pathogenesis.
