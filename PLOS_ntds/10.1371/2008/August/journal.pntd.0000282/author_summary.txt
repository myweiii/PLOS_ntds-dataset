Most infections with Entamoeba histolytica are asymptomatic. However, in a minority of cases, they develop into invasive and even life-threatening amebiasis. We suspect, based on prior studies of invasive amebae, that changes in amebic gene expression enable the transition from asymptomatic to invasive infection. Our long-term goal is to identify the genetic program required to cause amebic colitis. Here, we studied a transcription factor named URE3-BP that controls the expression of two virulence genes, the Galactose and Galactose N- acetyl- galactosamine inhibitable lectin (Gal/GalNAc lectin) and ferredoxin. We suspected that this factor might coordinate invasiveness by co-regulating additional virulence factors. The consensus DNA motif that is recognized by URE3-BP was identified by reporter gene assays and by electromobility shift assays. We then inducibly expressed a constitutively active form of the transcription factor, and measured the changes in total amebic gene expression mediated by overexpression of this dominant-positive version of URE3-BP. This analysis allowed for a further definition of the functional URE3 motif. Inducible expression of URE3-BP led to changes in the transcript levels of several novel amebic membrane proteins. In conclusion, this genome-wide analysis of a transcription factor and its cis-acting regulatory sequence in Entamoeba histolytica has identified new transcripts regulated by URE3-BP that may play a role in trophozoite motility within a coordinated virulence-specific gene regulatory network.
