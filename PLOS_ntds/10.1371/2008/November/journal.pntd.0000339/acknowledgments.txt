We thank the Serengeti Viral Transmission dynamics team, the livestock field-officers of the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development and staff of district hospitals and dispensaries in Mara and Arusha Regions and local community members who provided invaluable assistance with data collection. Intervet supported the project through provision of dog vaccine, and Frankfurt Zoological Society, Sokoine University of Agriculture, and the Mwanza and Arusha Veterinary Investigation Centers all provided valuable logistical and technical support. We are grateful to Tanzanian Government ministries, TANAPA, TAWIRI, NCA Authority, Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, and National Institute for Medical Research for permissions and D. Bennett for useful discussions.
Dr Magai Kaare played a critical role in the research leading to this publication and made an enormous contribution to rabies research and control in Tanzania. His loss is a tragedy and he will be greatly missed.
