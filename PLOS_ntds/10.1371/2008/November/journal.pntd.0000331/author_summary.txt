Diseases caused by parasitic worms inflict an enormous public health burden in developing countries. There is a growing effort to control worms with drugs. The success of repeated drug administrations can be assessed by measuring the decline in the prevalence and intensity of worm infections. Accurate diagnosis is a challenge, especially in areas with low infection intensities. We studied the effect of stool sampling efforts and the use of different diagnostic techniques on the measured prevalence of worms, including hookworm, large intestinal roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), and dwarf threadworm (Strongyloides stercoralis) in Zanzibar, where worm control has been implemented over the past decade. Three early morning stool samples were collected from each of 342 schoolchildren on 3 consecutive days and analyzed with different techniques. The observed prevalence of the different worms increased with an enhanced sampling effort and when different diagnostic methods were combined. Examination of 3 stool samples per individual resulted in prevalences of T. trichiura, hookworm, A. lumbricoides, and S. stercoralis of 47.9%, 22.5%, 16.5%, and 10.8%, respectively. To conclude, the examination of multiple stool samples and the use of different techniques are recommended for accurate diagnosis of worms in areas undergoing repeated mass drug administration.
