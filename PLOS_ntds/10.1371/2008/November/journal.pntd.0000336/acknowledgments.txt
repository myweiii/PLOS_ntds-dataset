We acknowledge the participation of various persons that assisted with data access in Colombia. In particular we want to thank Yaneth Zipa from the Boyacá Department of Health; Santiago Nicholls from the National Institute of Health and Victor Manuel Angulo from the Centre for Research on Tropical Diseases (CINTROP), Industrial University of Santander. All of them provided assistance in getting access to crucial information as well as to healthcare facilities. In Norte de Santander, Hector Anaya from the Departmental Institute of Health, and in Santander Gloria Ortiz from the Vector Control Programme within Santander Department of Health, assisted Mónica Florez in data collection. Dr Hernando Cardona, fellow in electrophysiology at the Fundación Clínica Shaio, collected data on patients admitted for Chagas cardiomyopathy in this institution. Finally, we appreciate the collaboration of the 13 professionals that participated in the consensus exercise. Without their inputs we could not have completed this research.
