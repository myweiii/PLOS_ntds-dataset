After first being identified in the 1950s and spreading from Africa in the 1960s, a new pandemic strain of Chikungunya virus emerged in East Africa and the Indian Ocean in 2004â€“2005, progressing to Asia. Cases have since been described in previously unaffected territories, as well as regions where Chikungunya transmission was never interrupted. Chikungunya circulated in Cambodia in the 1960s and 1970s until the tragic historical events that followed the civil war. After nearly 40 years of absence of the virus, the new pandemic strain was first detected in 2011. We undertook a field investigation of a Chikungunya outbreak in Cambodia in 2012. The usefulness of clinical signs for diagnosis of infection is discussed. Unlike studies from other settings, we show that older age was associated with a lower risk of Chikungunya infection, even after behavioural and occupational factors have been taken into account. This is the first evidence suggesting that infection in the 1960s and 1970s likely provided long-lasting cross-protection against this new strain. These findings, which will be further explored in the laboratory, are important to understand immunity against Chikungunya and to predict future epidemics and public health needs.
