Leishmania parasites cause leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, estimated to threaten 350 million people in 88 countries worldwide according to the WHO. The genome of Leishmania major harbours a number of genes, which have been proposed as acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT) from a broad variety of prokaryote donors. Such genes may prove beneficial for the parasites, e.g. by promoting survival of the parasite in new environments. We have studied orthologs to LGTs previously detected uniquely in L. major as well as LGTs shared also by other trypanosomatids. The universal trypanosomatid LGTs are more conserved within genus Leishmania, as compared to LGTs that are exclusively present in genus Leishmania. One possible explanation to this observation is that these have resided in their host genomes for a longer time period. This explanation strengthens the hypothesis that the LGTs unique to genus Leishmaina were acquired after the divergence from the trypanosomes, rather than before the divergence, and then subsequently lost from the trypanosome lineage. An in-depth analysis of a subset of the LGTs, which are present only in genus Leishmania showed that LGT within genus Leishmania is a dynamic process. LGTs, providing beneficial capabilities to the parasite, are demonstrated to become conserved throughout generic diversification, hence contributing to species differentiation, while LGTs of limited use are degraded and lost.
