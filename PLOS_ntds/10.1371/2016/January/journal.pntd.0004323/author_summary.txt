Ixodes scapularis, the blacklegged tick or the deer tick, is among the most medically important ticks that transmit human tick borne disease agents including the spirochaete Lyme disease agent. To develop new tick control methods, a deeper understanding of how the tick feeds is needed. We collected saliva from rabbit fed blacklegged ticks every 24 h through five days of feeding and towards the end of feeding. We used novel proteomic technologies (Liquid Chromotographyâ€“Tandem Mass Spectrometry) to sequence and identify proteins in tick saliva. The main finding is that ticks apparently selectively inject functionally similar but unique proteins every 24 h, which we speculate is the tick's way to avoid the host's defense to protect important tick feeding functions from host immune system. The host immune responses to proteins present in 24 h I. scapularis saliva will not be effective at later feeding stages. This will influence how to design effective anti-tick vaccine antigens to stop disease agent transmission. This is the first comprehensive study of proteins in blacklegged tick saliva that provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that are at play at the tick feeding site every 24 h.
