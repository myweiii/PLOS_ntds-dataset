Melioidosis, caused by B. pseudomallei, can be a fatal disease if not treated with appropriate antibiotics. The organism is mainly present in soil and water in endemic areas, and people become infected through skin inoculation, inhalation or ingestion. The disease has been sporadically detected in Bangladesh over last several decades. However, its actual prevalence in Bangladesh is largely unknown due to the lack of systematic study and awareness of the medical community about the disease and the organism. In order to address the issue, we have undertaken this study to assess the presence of the organism in the soil as well as its magnitude of exposure among the people of selected areas of the country. The study revealed the presence of B. pseudomallei in the soil and its exposure among the people of different areas. The information would increase the awareness of the medical community for prevention and correct diagnosis of the disease.
