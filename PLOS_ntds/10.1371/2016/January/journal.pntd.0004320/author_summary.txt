Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease in the world. With no effective treatment or commercial vaccine available, strategies to control dengue focus on its mosquito vectors, primarily Aedes aegypti. A recent effort to reduce the burden of dengue aims to replace native Ae. aegypti with those refractory to the virus. This is achieved by infecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia, bacteria which can invade insect populations by exploiting host reproduction. Some strains of Wolbachia have harmful effects on the mosquito host which can inhibit its ability to spread. While these costs have been characterized comprehensively in the laboratory, we must also consider any impacts when mosquitoes experience stresses that commonly occur in nature. For instance, Ae. aegypti larvae often develop in highly-occupied habitats where food is scarce. We investigated the effects of Wolbachia on mosquito larvae when they develop under extremely nutrient-limited conditions and found costs to survival for all strains. This will translate to a reduced ability of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to replace native populations in competitive habitats.
