Mansonella perstans is a widespread, but relatively unknown human filarial parasite that occurs in many parts of Africa. In a nationwide survey carried out in Uganda in 2000â€“2003, the distribution of M. perstans was assessed by screening school children. Here, we studied the underlying environmental drivers and ecologic correlates of the observed M. perstans prevalence patterns, produced a predictive risk map, and investigated associations with Wuchereria bancrofti (causative agent of lymphatic filariasis) and Plasmodium (causative agent of malaria). Several Bayesian geostatistical logistic regression models with and without spatially structured random effects were fitted for comparison. The model that fitted the data best was used to predict M. perstans infection risk for all of Uganda. Positive associations with M. perstans infection status were observed with cattle densities, forested areas, and vegetation greenness, whereas negative associations were observed with land surface temperature. Only a small geographic overlap was observed with W. bancrofti, and the overall level of co-infection was low (0.3%). However, where the two infections overlapped, a positive association was found. Our study presents the first nationwide geostatistical risk map for M. perstans, and gives important clues about the ecologic preferences of the still unknown main Culicoides vector species in Uganda.
