Infectious diarrhea is a major cause of illness and death among children under five years from low-income country. In order to identify infectious agents associated with diarrhea, we conducted a case-control study in the Pediatric Complex of Bangui, the sole public pediatric hospital from Central African Republic (CAR). A total of 333 hospitalized children with diarrhea and 333 controls were included, controls being pair matched to the cases according to age, sex and neighborhood. At least one of the sought-for pathogens was identified in 80% of hospitalized children, and approximately one in ten cases presented mixed bacterial/viral co-infections. Five pathogens were positively associated with hospitalized diarrhea, namely rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, Shigella/EIEC and Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum. Giardia intestinalis was negatively associated with hospitalized diarrhea. A seasonality effect—viruses during the dry season, bacteria and parasites during the rainy season—but also an age effect, were observed, which may guide clinicians in the management of diarrhea. As rotavirus was the leading cause of severe diarrhea, the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in CAR will certainly provide considerable direct health benefits in terms of reduced illness and deaths. New medicines, vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests that can be conducted bedside should be urgently developed for low-resource countries.
