It was recently described that asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) of trypanosomatids uses not only ammonia but also glutamine for asparagine formation, which was a surprising feature for a type A AS. Interestingly, Leishmania donovani AS-A was reported to be essential for parasite survival, and once a human homologue was absent, this enzyme emerged as a novel drug target candidate. Leishmania infantum encodes for a functional AS-A enzyme, which also uses either ammonia or glutamine as nitrogen donor for asparagine synthesis. In L. infantum, ASA ablation drives parasites auxotrophic to asparagine, however, LiAS-A is not detrimental for parasite survival, growth or infectivity. AS-A is therefore unlikely to be a suitable drug target against Leishmania parasites.
