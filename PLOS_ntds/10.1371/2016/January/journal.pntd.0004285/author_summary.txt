Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in balancing protective immunity and pathogenesis during diverse parasitic infections. In the context of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, some findings showed that peripheral Tregs (pTregs) might have an important role as contraregulatory mechanism, limiting tissue damage and avoiding the more severe clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. Furthermore, there are finding showing that murine lethal T. cruzi infection causes a severe depletion of pTregs and the induction of T-bet and IFN-γ expression in the remaining pTregs, which might favours immunopathology. The thymus is a central organ of the immune system that sustains thymic Tregs (tTregs) development, but which is also a target of T. cruzi infection. We previously showed profound alterations of CD4+CD8+ double positive and CD4−CD8−double negative populations during infection. The present study confirms that T. cruzi also severely influences the thymic compartment of tTreg cells, resulting in a series of phenotypic, locational and functional disturbances. These findings showed that a parasitic infection could alter the normal homeostasis of tTregs, while in the context of T. cruzi infection these data indicate that tTregs disturbances may influence the development of chronic pathology, considering the suspected autoimmune basis of chagasic cardiomyopathy.
