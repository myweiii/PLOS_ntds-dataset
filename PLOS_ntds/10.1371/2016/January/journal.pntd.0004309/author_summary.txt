Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected human systemic mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides spp. fungus that invades the hostâ€™s lungs and can disseminate to many other organs. Treatment usually involves amphotericin B, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or fluconazole for six months to two years. In this way, many adverse effects are associated with treatment, and patients can have many co-morbidities and difficulties in complying with treatment. For those reasons, more effective and less toxic drugs are needed. The discovery of a potentially bioactive molecule and its correlation with a biological target is an important step in the research and development of drugs. One of the ways in which cells adjust to environmental change is by changing the pattern of gene expression. Thus, the transcriptome is potential experimental strategy to elucidate the mode of action of bioactive molecules. Here, Paracoccidoides spp. altered the expression of genes, leading to a further understanding of the action of the compound argentilactone in the fungal cells. Argentilactone seems to be able to modulate cellular targets, to induce oxidative stress and to interfere with the biosynthesis of the P. lutzii cell wall.
