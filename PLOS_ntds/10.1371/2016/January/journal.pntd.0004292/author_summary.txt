Serological markers such as antibody responses to pathogen-specific antigens are used to inform disease epidemiology in many elimination programs. A major challenge with program-scale serological testing, and with any diagnostic test validation, is access to consistent and unlimited control reagents with which to provide assay QC and facilitate data consolidation. In the context of disease elimination, clinical positive sera will be particularly difficult to source and use as routine, inter-laboratory reagents. This study reports on a recombinant antibody specific against a key serological marker for onchocerciasis: its selection, testing, and incorporation into protocols across relevant immunoassay platforms. We have demonstrated it is a viable reagent for integration into QC and QA protocols to support long-term serological testing for onchocerciasis to support disease elimination efforts. This approach should be generalizable to other diagnostic tools supporting programs to achieve the 2020 goals of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases.
