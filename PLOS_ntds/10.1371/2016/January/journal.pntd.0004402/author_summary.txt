Chikungunya virus is a re-emerging and rapidly spreading arbovirus that has caused several outbreaks in the last decade with the most recent in the Caribbean islands and the Americas beginning in 2013 infecting over 1 million individuals. The ability to monitor such epidemics would be enhanced by characterizing the viral populations that circulate within infected individuals. To do this, we deep-sequenced viral populations from infected individuals and identified minority variants present at high frequencies, as well as the presence of a novel 3’ untranslated genome region (UTR) structure, a key determinant of chikungunya virus infectivity and evolution never before described in nature. Finally, we genetically engineered an infectious clone from this outbreak strain and established that the novel 3’UTR structure increases viral replication in mosquito cells. Taken together these studies highlight the vast diversity of viral populations in infected individuals, reveal potential novel determinants of chikungunya virus biology, and provide an indispensable tool for future studies involved in viral evolution and adaptation.
