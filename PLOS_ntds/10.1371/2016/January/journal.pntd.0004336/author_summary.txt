Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease caused by members of the genus Leishmania, which are distributed worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. More than 20 species of Leishmania are described as causative agents of human leishmaniases and clinical features are largely associated with the infective species. The parasites are transmitted by bites of female sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus in the Old World and Lutzomyia in the New World. Approximately 800 sand fly species have been recorded; of these, fewer than 10% have been confirmed as vectors of Leishmania and only a restricted number of species transmit specific Leishmania species. Therefore, sand fly surveillance is important for predicting risk and spread of leishmaniasis in endemic and surrounding areas. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by a hybrid of L. (Viannia) braziliensis/L. (V.) peruviana have been reported in the Department of Huanuco of Peru; however, the vector species has not been identified. In the present study, approximately 3,000 sand flies were examined, and the sand fly infected by the hybrid Leishmania strain was successfully identified.
