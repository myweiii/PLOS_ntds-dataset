Leishmaniasis is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by different species of protozoa belonging to the Leishmania genus that are transmitted by sand fly vectors. Visceral infections of Leishmania cause significant mortality and morbidity and development of a vaccine to prevent leishmaniasis has become a high priority. We have previously reported that intravenous immunization with a live attenuated parasite vaccine comprised of Leishmania donovani parasites lacking the centrin gene conferred protection in mice, hamsters and dogs. In the current report, we describe the immunological response and associated protection to the ID immunization with attenuated parasites in combination with a sand fly salivary protein (LJM19). We observe that protection against experimental ID challenge with L. donovani resulting from ID immunization with live attenuated parasites in combination with LJM19 is comparable to intracardial immunization and offers improved protective immunity compared to immunization with salivary protein alone and non-immunized hamsters. This study supports the potential use of the genetically attenuated vaccine and a recombinant sand fly salivary protein for control of visceral leishmaniasis.
