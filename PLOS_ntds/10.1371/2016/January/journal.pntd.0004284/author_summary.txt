Dengue fever is a viral disease, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Although for most cases of dengue fever the illness is self-limiting or asymptomatic, severe dengue can occur. Severe dengue is now classified by 1) plasma leakage, and/or 2) severe haemorrhage and/or 3) organ failure. Complications and deaths occur in this group of cases with severe dengue. Patients with dengue fever and comorbidities seem to be at higher risk of developing complications and/or severe dengue compared to healthier individuals. This study systematically reviews the evidence related to comorbidities and the severe forms of dengue fever. Sixteen studies were analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven case control studies and nine retrospective cohort studies assessed comorbidities and development of severe forms of dengue. The results showed that comorbidities are relevant to severe dengue, especially 1) cardiovascular disease, 2) stroke, 3) diabetes, 4) respiratory disease and 5) renal disease, as well as old age. The study of comorbidities in dengue fever is fundamental for improved patient outcome by differential case management of patients, reducing the burden of the disease. Further research in regions with high prevalence of dengue infection would contribute to a better understanding of the relevance of comorbidities with severe forms of dengue fever. An agreed protocol for such studies is urgently needed.
