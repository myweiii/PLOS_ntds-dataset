Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major health problem, responsible for many deaths among young children in low-income countries. SAM manifests as oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition. Oedematous malnutrition, also known as kwashiorkor, is a life-threatening condition, and even today we do not understand why some children develop oedema with malnutrition. Recently, an association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and oedematous malnutrition has been suggested. However, it remains unknown whether the gut microbiota differs between children with oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition. In the present study, we collected fecal samples from children with SAM with and without oedema and analyzed the gut microbiota composition. We found that the pattern of bacteria was different in the two types of malnutrition, and that fewer different types of bacteria, on average, were present in the guts of non-oedematous children. However, we could not identify any specific type of bacteria that explained this difference. These results may contribute to the understanding of oedematous SAM, and inspire to further research into better ways of treatment of these very ill children.
