Fascioliasis is a zoonotic food borne trematode infection with a wide distribution. The complex epidemiology of this infection makes control efforts difficult. The paucity of drugs available for treatment may further hinder their success. Triclabendazole, the only first line drug for Fasciola, has been used for many years in the livestock industry. Resistant livestock Fasciola infections have emerged in developing and developed countries. However, most human trials report triclabendazole efficacies close to 100% after a few doses. Only a few cases of triclabendazole treatment failure have been published. We document 7 patients infected with Fasciola hepatica in Cuscoâ€“Peru that failed several treatment courses with triclabendazole. This raises concerns regarding preparedness to address resistant parasite infections and calls for more research to find new medications and tools to evaluate resistance.
