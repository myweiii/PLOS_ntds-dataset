Just one drug is available to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that affects hundreds of millions of people in developing countries. In the search for new drugs and drug targets, therefore, we have been interested in the schistosome version of human polo-like kinase (huPLK)1, an enzyme with critical functions in cell division. We used RNA interference to knock down messenger RNA for the SmPLK1 –the Schistosoma mansoni parasite’s version of huPLK1. This interference caused disruptive changes in the morphology of the immature ‘somule’ stage of the parasite, indicating that SmPLK1 is an important protein for survival. We then purchased, or acquired from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), various small chemical inhibitors of huPLK1 and tested these against both the somules and adult parasites in culture. Many of these inhibitors caused severe changes in the parasite and, for somules, the differences could be computationally mapped and distinguished from unexposed parasites. For the GSK inhibitors, we observed ‘somule-adult bioactivity clustering,’ that is, chemicals active against the adults were also active against somules. This suggests that certain chemical attributes in the inhibitors are being favoured. Interestingly, many of the GSK inhibitors most active against the parasite are also known to both potently inhibit huPLK1 and kill cancer cells. Overall, our data suggest that SmPLK1 is a possible drug target and that the GSK chemistries could form the basis for developing a new drug to treat schistosomiasis.
