T. cruzi is the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, a neglected tropical illness, present in endemic and also in non-endemic countries. T. cruzi parasites are spread mainly by a vectorâ€™s bite but can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplant, laboratory accidents, congenitally and by ingestion of contaminated food. Non-human primates that are also predisposed to become infected, live in places where vectors and T. cruzi exist. Similar clinical sequelae are observed in these animals when compared to humans who are infected with T. cruzi. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of T. cruzi-infected non-human primates may bring new advances to understanding human infection. Here, we explored the immunological features of cynomolgus macaques naturally infected by T. cruzi, aiming to contribute to the validation of this species as an appropriate experimental model. Infected animals displayed a similar immunological profile to that observed in humans, with high activity of cytotoxic cells and expansion of macrophages and T-cell subsets. Furthermore, by using bioinformatics tools, we demonstrated that CD14+CD56+ and CD3+HLA-DR+ cells are major determinants to segregate CH from NI group, followed by innate and adaptive cell subpopulations. Altogether, our data suggest that non-human primates are an appropriate model to study Chagas disease.
