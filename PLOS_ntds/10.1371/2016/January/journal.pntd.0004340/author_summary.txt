Reactive oxygen species are the most studied of environmental stresses generated by the host immune defense against pathogens. Although most of the studies that have investigated the effect of oxidative stress on an organism have focused on changes which occur at the protein level, only a few studies have investigated the oxidation status of these proteins. Infection with Entamoeba histolytica is known as amebiasis. This condition occurs worldwide, but is most associated with crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. The parasite is exposed inside the host to oxidative stress generated by cells of the host immune system. The nature of oxidized proteins in oxidatively stressed E. histolytica has never been studied. In this report, the authors present their quantitative results of a proteome-wide analysis of oxidized proteins in the oxidatively stressed parasite. They identified crucial redox-regulated proteins that are linked to the virulence of the parasite, such as the Gal/GalNAc lectin. They also discovered that arginase, a protein involved in ornithine synthesis, is also involved in the parasite's resistance to oxidative stress.
