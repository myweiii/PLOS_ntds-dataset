Phlebotomine sand flies are known to transmit Leishmania parasites, bacteria and viruses that affect humans and animals in many countries worldwide. Algeria is among the top ten countries with the highest number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases. To prevent the emergence of leishmaniasis and to establish vector control and monitoring, precise identification of sand fly specimens at the species level is essential. Current morphological and molecular methods are long, expensive and laborious, limiting large-scale surveys. The recent application of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of arthropods, including sand flies, opens up new opportunities in this field. Here, for the first time, this proteomic tool was assessed for the identification of sand flies collected in the field from leishmaniasis-endemic Algerian areas. Six distinct sand fly species were found and a reference spectrum database was created. Correct identification was obtained for all non-engorged blind-tested specimens stored by freezing. As a result, this proteomic tool could be applied for the classification of phlebotomine sand fly specimens caught in the field, enabling entomological surveys to be conducted.
