Visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum is a widespread, devastating zoonotic disease. Domestic dogs are considered the major reservoir for human L. infantum infection in an area stretching from Portugal to China, and across South America. Dogs not only carry infection and transfer it to humans via sand flies, but frequently suffer from a severe and fatal disease. Allopurinol is the main drug used for treatment of dogs with leishmaniasis, by itself or in conjunction with other drugs. Following treatment, most dogs experience clinical remission, but this is often not followed by parasite elimination. We found that dogs suffer from disease relapse during treatment with allopurinol, and showed that L. infantum promastigotes isolated from treated relapsed dogs were roughly four times less susceptible to allopurinol as compared to isolates from dogs before treatment or from dogs that resolved their clinical disease during treatment. We also confirmed that resistance to allopurinol was present in axenic and intracellular amastigotes. This study describes resistance of L. infantum clinical isolates associated with disease relapse. Allopurinol resistance may increase L. infantum transmission to humans and to other dogs, as canines with uncontrolled infection are highly infectious to sandflies.
