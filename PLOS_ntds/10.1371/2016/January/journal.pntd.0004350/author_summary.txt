Human African trypanosomosis (HAT) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is a serious disease threatening 70 million people in West Africa. The parasite is transmitted by the tsetse fly, and initially multiplies in the bloodstream of the mammalian host, before progressing to the central nervous system. Using a strain of T. b. gambiense transfected with a gene for luminescent detection that causes a chronic infection with very low parasitaemia, we found that the parasite is capable of entering the reproductive organs of both male and female mice. Subsequently, crossing infected male mice with healthy females resulted in some female mice becoming infected. Furthermore, female mice infected directly with T. b. gambiense parasites and crossed with healthy males, produced offspring which were also shown to be positive for parasites. These experiments demonstrated that T. b. gambiense 1135 is transmitted both horizontally, most probably by sexual contact, and vertically in mice. If these alternate modes of transmission are analogous to the situation in humans, this has drastic implications for future control measures of HAT as parasites may avoid the immune system and treatment by accumulating in the reproductive organs as well as the CNS.
