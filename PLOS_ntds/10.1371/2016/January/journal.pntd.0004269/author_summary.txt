The manuscript describes the results of a study whose aim was to assess the tendency to coagulate in people suffering from a parasitic infection frequent in Latin America named T. cruzi infection or Chagas disease, by the study of several coagulation factors. According to the state of the art in this topic, specific treatment for Chagas disease is recommended in recent (acute) and late (chronic) stages of the infection. The effectiveness of current available drugs in the chronic stage of infection is still a topic of debate due to inconsistent results across studies and a lack of early measurable parameters of response to specific treatment. Another aim of this study was to determine if the presence of an upregulated procoagulative activity in plasma in people suffering T. cruzi infection could be used as potential marker that indicates therapeutic response in people at chronic stage of the disease. The results of this study suggest that measurements of alterations of procoagulative activity may be useful to indicate specific treatment for T. cruzi chronically infected patients and new data concerning early response to treatment biomarkers.
