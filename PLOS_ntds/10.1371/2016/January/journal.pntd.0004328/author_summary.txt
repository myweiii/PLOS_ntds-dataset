Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by Simulium blackflies. Operational between 1975 and 2002, the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) was one of the first large-scale intervention programmes ever implemented, and was successful in controlling the disease as a problem of public health importance. Currently, national control programmes in the former OCP and the World Health Organization African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) are shifting their focus from morbidity control to elimination of the infection where feasible through community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). The level of endemicity (measured as infection prevalence) prior to control interventions has been shown to be an important determinant of the feasibility of elimination by CDTI. We present the first pre-control Bayesian geostatistical map of infection (microfilarial) prevalence in the OCP with the objectives of: a) identifying important environmental covariates which help to estimate prevalence in areas without observed survey data; b) understanding the distribution of areas of initially high endemicity, where the current CDTI strategy may be insufficient to achieve elimination goals and intensified CDTI or novel/complementary tools may be required; c) re-estimating the initial numbers of persons at-risk and with onchocerciasis in 1975.
