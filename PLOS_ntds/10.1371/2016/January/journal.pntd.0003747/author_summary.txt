About 30% of Trypanosoma cruzi infected individuals will develop Chagas heart disease cardiomyopathy which is similar to other cardiomyopathies. T. cruzi induced heart disease can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and death. These cardiac disorders can be caused by several host-parasite interaction factors that lead to myocardial inflammation which remains poorly understood from the initial phase of infection. In this study, we challenged primary human cardiomyocyte (PHCM) with T. cruzi trypomastigotes and evaluated changes in gene and protein expression profile occurring early during the process of cellular infection. Paying attention to genes that have the potential of tilting the PHCM towards a fibrogenic phenotype, we observed that the parasite upregulates the expression of several transcription factors and cytokines/chemokines that have been suggested to be implicated in the development of fibrogenic responses. The validated microarray data were confirmed at the protein level where we demonstrated an increase in the protein expression of EGR1, SNAI1, JunB and IL6. Pathway analyses of our results show that early during T. cruzi infection, the parasite induces multiple factors that are profibrotic in PHCM. The operating fibrotic interactome presented in our work advances our understanding of the initiation of cardiovascular pathology in Chagas disease patients.
