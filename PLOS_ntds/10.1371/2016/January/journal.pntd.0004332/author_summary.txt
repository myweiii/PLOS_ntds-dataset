Mycobacterium africanum consists of two lineages, lineages 5 and 6, within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) that cause human tuberculosis in West Africa, but are found rarely outside of this region. Our analysis of the whole genome sequences of 26 lineage 5 and 6 isolates, and 66 isolates from other lineages within the MTC, reveal that M. africanum does not meet modern criteria to be considered an independent species. We analyzed drug resistance-associated genes and found that drug resistance evolves within these lineages through similar mechanisms as observed for the rest of the MTC in Mali. Though we did not see an elevated number of mutations in virulence-associated genes in these two lineages, we identified a number of lineage-specific mutations, pseudogenes and changes in gene content that may impact virulence and host specificity, and improve, overall, our understanding of what make these lineages unique.
