The work presented in this paper would not have been possible without the tireless and longstanding contributions made by all the previous directors, programme managers, scientific and technical advisory boards and funding bodies of the OCP. We are especially grateful to the community distributors and mobile teams who originally surveyed the villages within the OCP, collecting the valuable epidemiological data used in this study. Their work is a valuable and lasting contribution towards the goal of eliminating NTDs. We also thank Dr Bernard Philippon for advice regarding specific treatment interventions in certain watercourses of the OCP. The Malaria Modelling Group at the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Imperial College London, generously allowed us time on their HPC cluster and we thank Dr Wes Hinsley in particular for support in that regard. The authors would also like to thank members of the Malaria Atlas Mapping (MAP) project from Oxford University, UK for helpful comments and advice regarding methodological issues presented in this paper. We especially would like to thank Peter Gething, Samir Bhatt, Daniel Weiss, and Nick Golding.
