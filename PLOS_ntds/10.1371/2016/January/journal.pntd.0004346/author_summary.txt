Aiming to understand the ecology of municipal drinking water and measure the potential exposure to pathogens that cause typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A) in Kathmandu, Nepal, we collected water samples from 10 water sources weekly for one year and subjected them to comprehensive chemical, bacteriological and molecular analyses. We found that Kathmandu drinking water exhibits longitudinal fecal contamination in excess of WHO guidelines. The chemical composition of water indicated site-specific pollution profiles, which were likely driven by localized contamination with human fecal material. We additionally found that Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A could be detected throughout the year in every water sampling location, but specifically peaked after the monsoons. A microbiota analysis (a method for studying bacterial diversity in biological samples) revealed the water to be contaminated by complex populations of fecal bacteria, which again exhibited a unique profile by both location and time. This study shows that Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A can be longitudinally detected in drinking water in Kathmandu and represents the first major investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of drinking water pollution in an endemic typhoid setting.
