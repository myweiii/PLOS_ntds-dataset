In most Buruli ulcer (BU) endemic areas, laboratory diagnosis is hard to access and comes at a high cost. Clinicians are in need of new tools to assist them in identifying which patients truly require additional work-up and which can be treated directly. We analyzed the clinical data of all patients with ulcerative skin lesions that presented to Akonolinga District Hospital in Cameroon and identified which parameters were associated with BU diagnosis. We attributed a certain number of points to each parameter to build a “Buruli score”. Based on score results, clinicians can be advised either to directly treat BU (score ≥4), to look for another diagnosis (score <0) or to do a PCR test (score between 0 and 3). This algorithm was found to have a good performance. Only one out of four patients still needed an additional laboratory test to be classified between BU and non-BU. However, this score still requires validation in another context before it can be recommended elsewhere.
