Reversal reactions (RR; Type 1) and Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL; Type 2) are two types of leprosy reactions which appear episodically in a proportion of leprosy patients and lead to high morbidity and peripheral nerve damage that require immediate medical attention, ENL seen in anergic lepromatous patients, show immune complexes as well as transient emergence of T cell functions. Lesions of RR with borderline tuberculoid background show pathological features associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity. The present study shows increased Th17 cell show activity in reaction patients as compared to the matching stable leprosy type and which may contribute to the inflammation/immunopathology observed in the lesions. This increase is accompanied by reduction in Treg cells and their inhibitory activity. The balance between Th17 and Treg cells may be influenced by the combined effects of reduction in TGF-Î² and increase in IL-6, IL-21 cytokines. Of interest was the expression of more genes associated with T cells, cytokines, chemokines, signaling and transcription factors by RR as compared to ENL patient.
