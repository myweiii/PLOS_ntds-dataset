African trypanosomes are parasites that infect humans and domestic animals, causing severe socioeconomic distress in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus developing tools for laboratory- and field-based research for application to epidemiology and disease diagnosis is important if the diseases caused by these parasites are to be controlled. Although Trypanosoma congolense is the most important trypanosome pathogen of cattle in Africa, no species-specific molecules found in infective bloodstream forms (BSF) of the parasites have been identified, thus limiting development of diagnostic tests and epidemiological tools. We have biochemically characterized and modeled the structure of one such molecule, called calflagin, from this parasite and genetically engineered and purified a form of the protein for use in testing cattle for trypanosome infections. In addition, we made new monoclonal antibodies to the calflagin molecule. Our results show that the calflagin and its specific antibodies are useful tools for research in epidemiological and diagnostic applications.
