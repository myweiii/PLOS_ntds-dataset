Filariases are chronic debilitating diseases caused by parasitic nematodes affecting more than 150 million people worldwide. None of the current drugs are selective, neither able to eliminate the parasites nor to prevent new infections once the drug pressure has waned. Therefore, blocking the entry and the migration of the infective larvae (L3) could be an efficient way to control the infection. In the present study we investigated the early interaction between the host and the L. sigmodontis murine filariasis with a focus on the neutrophils in the innate host responses. We uncovered a key role of neutrophils in the control of infection provided by the CXCR4-gain-of-function mice (Cxcr4+/1013) that display a blood neutropenia as well as an accumulation of skin-infiltrating neutrophils. Overall, we reveal that in the early phase of filariasis, i.e. after L3 are delivered into the skin and before they reach their site for reproduction, neutrophils are critical elements of the host innate protective response arsenal. A better understanding of their indirect and/or effector role(s) may provide mechanistic clues to host factors implicated in parasitic nematode entry and potentially lead to the identification of new drug targets.
