Fascioliasis, caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, is a neglected tropical disease infecting over 1 million individuals annually with 17 million people at risk of infection. These worms infect the liver and can survive for many years in its animal or human host because they supress the host’s immune system that is important in clearing worm infection. Worms are similar to humans in that they are made of proteins, fats and sugars, and while there are many studies on worm proteins, few studies have examined the sugars. We are interested in the sugars because we believe that they help the parasite survive for many years within its host. To examine this, we have used a technique called mass spectrometric analysis to characterise the sugars present in F. hepatica. We also have developed systems in the laboratory to test if these sugars can suppress the host’s immune system. We conclude that F. hepatica sugars are crucial in suppressing its host’s immune system; however, the exact way the sugars can do this requires further studies. These studies are important for the development of worm vaccines or therapies.
