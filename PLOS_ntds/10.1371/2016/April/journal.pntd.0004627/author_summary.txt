We previously reported that Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) has a profound impact on vision and heath related quality of life (QoL), even when vision is not impaired. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends corrective eyelid surgery for trichiasis to reduce the risk of vision loss. However, trichiasis surgery may also improve overall wellbeing. There is very limited evidence on the long-term impact of trichiasis surgery on QoL. We measured vision and health-related quality of life of 1000 TT patients before and one year after receiving TT surgery and compared the QoL scores of these with the baseline and 1 year follow-up QoL score of 200 matched individuals who have never had trichiasis or trichiasis surgery. We found strong evidence that surgery substantially improves both vision and heath related QoL of TT case, even when there is no improvement in vision; while there was no evidence of improvement in the QoL of the trichiasis free participants. The results provide clear evidence that the benefit of trichiasis surgery goes beyond preventing the risk of blindness and improves the overall wellbeing and health perception of affected individuals, indicating the need to provide prompt surgical intervention for affected individuals.
