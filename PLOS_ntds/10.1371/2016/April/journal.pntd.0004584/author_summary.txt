Chagas disease is an important health problem in Latin America. The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to people via insects of the Triatomine family. There are currently only two treatments available, Nifurtimox and Benznidazole. These have serious problems including poor efficacy, strain-dependent drug sensitivity, resistance and toxicity to the patients. There is thus a great need to find new drugs for this disease. The first step in a typical drug discovery project is to find compounds that kill the parasite by screening large amounts of compounds in the laboratory. To do this one requires assays in which the effect of the compounds on the parasites can be seen. In this paper we describe two assays that together try to identify compounds that kill T.cruzi parasites. Such compounds are good candidates for further development and may eventually become new drugs. We tested our assays against a library of compounds with known clinical activity and identified several interesting hits. As a great deal of data already exists for these compounds they could potentially be developed into new treatments much faster than completely new compounds.
