In some areas of Africa, Australia or Japan, a specific skin infection presents as a wound which progressively increases in size in children and people of any age. The agent which causes this infection is named Mycobacterium ulcerans, close to the tuberculosis agent. This wound, also named Buruli ulcer (BU), may be confused with other common cutaneous diseases. During two years in Akonolinga, Cameroon, we evaluated the wounds of all patients who presented with suspected BU. This wound presentation was most frequently recorded in young children and males. Buruli ulcer was indeed the most frequent diagnosis in this area. However, with the help of laboratory and radiological techniques, we found that many of those patients not diagnosed with BU were suffering from: vascular insufficiency (older persons), benign superficial infections and bone infections (children). This observation is important and should help improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with skin ulcers in Africa.
