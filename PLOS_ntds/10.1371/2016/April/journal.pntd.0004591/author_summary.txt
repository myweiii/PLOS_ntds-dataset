Taenia solium, commonly known as the pork tapeworm, is a parasite that affects humans and pigs. It has a disproportionate impact on low and middle income countries, and is most common in rural areas where free-ranging domestic pigs are common, and access to sanitation is limited. Pigs acquire cysticercosis, the larval stage of the disease, when they ingest T. solium eggs that have been released into the environment through the feces of an infected human host. In this study, we tracked free-ranging pigs with GPS devices, and found that most pigs remained close to their owners’ homes throughout the tracking period, and that the majority of pigs’ interactions with open human feces occurred near their owners’ homes. These findings suggest that 100 meter radius rings around heavily-infected pigs capture the most likely area of pig infection, and support focused control interventions in areas surrounding heavily-infected pigs.
