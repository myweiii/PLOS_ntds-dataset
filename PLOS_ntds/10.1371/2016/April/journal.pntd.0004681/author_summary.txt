Climatic determinants are amongst the most frequently cited in studies aimed at understanding and explaining the dynamics of vector-borne infections, and dengue in particular. French Guiana, a French overseas territory in which the vector Aedes aegypti is well established, experiences an epidemic cycle of dengue with large and prolonged epidemics occurring approximately every 3 years. Dengue is one of the most prioritized infectious diseases, and it requires an intense mobilization of local public health authorities, health services, and health professional and vector control services. A specific surveillance, preparedness and response plan has been developed based upon these needs. Gaining an accurate understanding of the drivers of dengue transmission is required to develop a model to predict the risk of an epidemic and to plan activities aimed at controlling it. Here, we assessed the effects of climatic factors on dengue spread to develop a predictive model of the epidemics in French Guiana on a country-wide scale. The goal of the model is to anticipate and plan both preventive and control activities. Given climate conditions, the model predicts that a dengue epidemic is likely to occur in early 2016. These conditions, which are favorable for Aedes mosquito proliferation, could also enhance the diffusion of other arboviruses, such as the Zika virus, in northeastern South America.
