UKNEQAS Parasitology and participants themselves noted poor performance in examining faecal specimens that contained low numbers of parasites. Our survey of methods used showed that 96% of respondents used a concentration method based on the Modified Ridley-Allen technique, but there were differences regarding whether the formalin used was diluted in water or saline; the pore size of the sieve; the centrifugal speed; centrifugal time and the solvent used, depending on the commercial kit deployed. UKNEQAS conducted a study to investigate how differences in the various stages of the concentration method affected the recovery of parasites from faecal specimens. This study has shown that the preservative used, solvent used, differences in centrifugation time and speed, and pore size of the sieve all affect recovery. The modified Ridley Allen method was optimised when using ethyl acetate with triton X instead of ether and the centrifugation time was increased from one to three minutes. A concentration method is required for adequate detection of faecal parasites. Poor concentration technique leads to poor recovery of parasites. Variation in the procedure can reduce the recovery of parasite stages, particularly if present in small numbers.
