Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). Since first discovered in China in 2011, SFTSV has been detected from SFTS patients and ticks with expanding geographic ranges from China to Japan and South Korea. The potential for SFTS spread to other warm or sub-tropical regions makes it a serious concern to the public health. It is of great importance to detect SFTSV rapidly and specifically for the effective control of the disease. For the diagnosis of viral infections, a sandwich antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA detecting viral nucleoprotein (N) in viremic serum samples has been widely applied to detect the agents, since it is the most abundant viral antigen and has highly conserved amino acid sequence. In this study, using the novel monoclonal antibodies raised against SFSTV-N, an Ag-capture ELISA system was developed, and the validation of this system was performed using sera collected from SFTS-suspected patients. Our data show that the Ag-capture ELISA was useful for the diagnosis of SFTS patients in the acute phase of the disease. This study shows a novel methodology for the diagnosis of SFTS, which may provide helpful information for the effective control of the disease.
