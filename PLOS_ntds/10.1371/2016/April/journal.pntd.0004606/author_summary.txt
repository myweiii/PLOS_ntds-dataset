Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii are the fungal species responsible for one of the most important mycoses of Latin America, Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). These fungi can grow in soil from forests, deforested areas, sugarcane, coffee, and rice plantations, as well as pasturelands, and they are strongly associated to armadillo burrows, which can explain their frequent isolation from this mammalâ€™s tissues. The environmental detection of these pathogens in endemic and non-endemic areas of PCM is important for mapping risk areas, as well as for understanding the infection ability and clinical manifestations of these fungi. These pieces of information are not provided by isolates obtained from human patients, because these fungi have a long latency period and the human host can migrate, leading to a misinterpretation of the actual geographic distribution of these pathogens. By using two different molecular methodologies (Nested PCR and in situ fluorescence), we detected both species of P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii in soil and in aerosol samples, even in areas where PCM is only associated to one of these two species. These data might indicate different habitat maintenance strategies between the species, which means that the infection ability may change according to the climatic and soil conditions. Despite contributing new information about the ecology of these important fungal pathogens, our molecular approach for the environmental detection of Paracoccidioides species may also be applied for their detection and differentiation in clinical samples, improving the diagnosis of this important systemic mycosis.
