Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and intestinal helminth infections (IHI) are infectious diseases of poverty, and both diseases affect millions of individuals every year in China. However, a neglected topic for both diseases is their co-endemicity, which mostly occurs in poor areas. This is the first time the co-endemicity of PTB and IHI and their risk factors have been explored by means of a Bayesian geostatistical logistic regression model, a Bayesian Kriging model and a Bayesian shared component model, based on data from the national surveys. Our results indicate that active PTB and IHI prevalence are associated with economic and ecological indices, both individually and collectively, with different disease spectra in different ecosystems. Additionally, we find that the south-western regions of China are the largest clustering areas for prevalence of both diseases, where socio-economic factors, such as GDP per capita may be common risk factors. Both socio-economic factors and epidemiological patterns relevant to control strategies for active PTB and IHI are illustrated clearly in this study, so we have reason to believe that they are essential for devising effective control strategies and should be considered in the control programs for both diseases.
