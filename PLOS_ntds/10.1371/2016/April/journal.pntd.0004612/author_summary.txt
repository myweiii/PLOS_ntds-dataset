Leprosy was still endemic on Reunion Island 30 years ago but improvements in health care and treatments led to a significant decrease in the number of new cases of leprosy. Nevertheless, the long-standing lack of a surveillance system prevents a real evaluation of endemicity. This is the first study to evaluate eradication of Leprosy on Reunion Island. The prevalence rate of less than one case per 10000 inhabitants is necessary, but not sufficient to claim eradication. Remaining active transmission of the disease is to be explored. The most widely used indicator of active transmission, the absence of new cases detected in children younger than 15 years of age, and the lack of focus of transmission, confirmed the eradication assumption. Improvements in quality of life, better housing conditions and lower promiscuity have played a key role in the reduction of autochthonous transmission. Active detection among relatives, systematic declaration and rapid treatment are the most effective way of preventing disabilities and further transmission of the disease. However, if elimination of leprosy is no longer a major public health problem on Reunion Island, the risk of reintroduction of the disease through immigration from endemic neighbouring countries is a real and continuing risk. Preventing resurgence is now the challenge.
