As a non-invasive method of indirectly monitoring insect-borne disease, molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the molecular testing of insects for the presence of a pathogen, can provide important information about disease prevalence without the need for human sampling. However, given the successes of tropical disease elimination programs, including many lymphatic filariasis and malaria elimination efforts, parasite levels in many locations are declining. This decrease in prevalence requires the sampling of increased numbers of vectors for disease surveillance and recrudescence monitoring. Such increased sampling poses a challenge since it results in additional costs and labor. In light of these difficulties, high-throughput methodologies for MX are necessary to provide elimination programs with cost-reducing alternatives to long-term disease surveillance. Here we demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new method that samples large numbers of mosquitoes using PCR to screen excreta/feces for filarial or malarial parasites. If operationalized, this approach to MX will provide a practical “first-alert” system that will enable cost-minimizing surveillance in post-transmission-interruption settings. Given this potential, the applicability of this approach to the monitoring of various mosquito-borne diseases should be explored further, as this platform will prove useful for surveillance efforts for a wide variety of pathogens.
