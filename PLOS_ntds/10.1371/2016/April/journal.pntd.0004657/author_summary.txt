This study demonstrates that alterations in immunological parameters early after treatment with benznidazole in Chagas disease patients are predictors of treatment efficacy. Cure was associated with an early decline in T. cruzi-specific IFN-Î³-producing T cells and in antibody titers and with high basal levels of T. cruzi-specific T cells.
