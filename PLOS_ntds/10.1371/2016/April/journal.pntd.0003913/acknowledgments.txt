For the cysticercosis/Taenia spp. testing CDC Atlanta kindly provided a number of free EITB test strips and positive control which allowed antibodies to ES33 and T24 proteins to be detected on a single strip. This was facilitated by Dr. John Noh. The authors also wish to thank Dr. Vladimir Grosbois from CIRAD for his advice on multiple correspondence analysis.
