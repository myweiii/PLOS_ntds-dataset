We would like to thank the participants who gave up their time to participate in this study and the staff at ALERT Hospital for all their hard work. In particular, the study pharmacist Asegid Alem Tura, the study physiotherapist and the study runners. This study would not have been possible without the administrative support of Susan Sheedy at LSHTM. Advisors in the early stages of the project include Elsa Bizuneh, Wim Brandsma, Abraham Assefa, Jemal Hussein and Ahmed Bedru. Tony Griffiths and Geoff Holmes of Stiefel Laboratories Ltd. kindly donated the punch biopsies. The randomization envelopes were prepared by Dr Rea Tschopp (Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute). Peter Nicholls, the study statistician designed the database and offered guidance in the data analysis.
