Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), affects 5.7 million people worldwide and causes 12,000 deaths annually. In the chronic phase of Chagas disease the main cause of death is due to heart failure (about 80%), but cerebral vascular accident or stroke (about 10%) contributes to death mechanisms. Strokes are caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain and can be ischemic or hemorrhagic. Stroke is the leading cause of death among adults in Latin America and the second in the world. Infectious diseases, such as Chagas disease, malaria, cysticercosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis and neurosyphilis, can also contribute to the development of immunopathogenic mechanisms leading to stroke and death. In this study, we evaluated the association between inflammatory markers (cytokines, transcription factors of the adaptive immune response and iNOS) and the death risk (DR) and stroke risk (SR) of patients with different clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. Our data suggest that an inflammatory imbalance in chronic Chagas disease patients is correlated with a high DR and SR. The exacerbated inflammatory mechanism that leads to thrombus formation can lead to sudden death in patients with clinical indeterminate form without prior other clinical symptoms. These inflammatory mechanisms are also involved in atherosclerotic-related strokes. An improved understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved in ischemic stroke formation in Chagas disease patients may also contribute to the reduction of stroke-related mortality and morbidity in the general population and may lead to the development of prophylactic or therapeutic therapies.
