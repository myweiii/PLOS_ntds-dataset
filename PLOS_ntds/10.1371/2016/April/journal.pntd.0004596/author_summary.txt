Eight million people are affected by Chagas disease worldwide, almost exclusively in South America. This chronic disease is initially asymptomatic but turns out to be life threatening in 30% of the cases, years after the infection. Two therapies are available, but their efficacy is maximal if the treatment is initiated shortly after contamination. In the absence of reliable symptoms, the in vitro diagnostic of Chagas Disease is thus a crucial tool to implement accurate clinical management. In order to permit universal access and a reliable confirmation of Chagasâ€™s parasite presence, we have developed a new multiplex platform using a large number of selected antigens on easy handling 96 well ELISA microplates. In this manuscript, we present the first optimization data of the Multi-cruzi test that shows promising results for Chagas disease confirmation.
