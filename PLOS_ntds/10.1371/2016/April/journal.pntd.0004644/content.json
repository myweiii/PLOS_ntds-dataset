    "Introduction": "The interest on the topic emerged after the implantation of the service of Occupational Therapy in a University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, among the interdisciplinary team for Prevention, Physical and Surgical Rehabilitation in Leprosy.\nOnce we started investigating the functional limitations of patients in their activities of daily living (ADL), we noticed that these limitations could be reduced with assistive technology, by suggesting the use of adaptations that ease the occupational performance.\nWith the purpose of achieving a better knowledge of the possibilities of helping the process of making in the human being as its impact on the subject, we first investigated the routine of the leprosy patients, to assess the tools they do or do not use during their ADLs which would require adaptations. This initial investigation in the practice of the Occupational Therapy motivated the elaboration of this research.\nOccupational Therapy presents resources, means or technologies to rescue the inclusion and an independent life. Assistive Technology is composed of resources and services that help providing or improving functional skills. It can be considered an indispensable tool to provide the inclusion and the integration of people with deficiency, with an amplification of the context of the society [1].\nThis technology is designed especially for people with disabilities with the aim of providing a framework for considering how products and environments can be designed to accommodate the broadest range of users [2].\nBorg and Larson (2009) have observed that more attention has been given to the preventing role of assistive devices compared to the facilitating role. The focus of assistive devices facilitating functioning has been on mobility aspects of care of the self and domestic life, which might also facilitate activities and participation in other life areas such as work and employment. To achieve a better utilisation of assistive devices there should be a training of related professionals and staff on user-involved design [3].\nThe intersection between technology and subjectivity rescues the appreciation of the participation of the subject in the process of treatment and rehabilitation. The use of the assistive technology in the life of the subject influences the care of the self, that is the ability to manage their own life.\nThis paper contributes to the theoretical and practical concepts of the health care practices, research and innovation in this area, also the changes in the teaching of the occupational therapy in both inter and multidisciplinary approaches.",
    "Methods": "Design\nThis study employed a descriptive exploratory design, with a qualitative aspect, in which we used a semi-structured interview and field observation as research tools.\n\n\nData gathering\nThe room for the conduction of the research was the ambulatory of Occupational Therapy created in November, 2012, in a University Hospital placed at Ilha do Governador in Rio de Janeiro. The hospital provides assistance, teaching and research in several areas. The leprosy program has begun in 1990 and it has become a reference for diagnosis, treatment, surgeries and rehabilitation of leprosy.\nThe interviews were conducted, taped in a digital recorder and fully transcripted by the authors.\nThe interview script searched for the following aspects: report of the repercussion of the assistive technology in the autonomy of the subject's care of the self and instrumental aspects; value of the technology and subjective dimensions.\nBased on the Hermeneutic approach, we've established some wide questions to be answered by the patients, as follows below:\n\nHow many adapted utensils have you received and how many of them could you incorporate into your routine?\nHow was the care of the self before and how is it now, after receiving the adaptations?\nHow important was the adaptation for your life?\nWhat was the impact on the practical aspects of daily life?\nHow did you notice yourself?\nHow did you manage your own life?\nWhich feelings do you feel when talking about limitations and during the use of adaptations?\nThe devices to be produced were determined after a motor and sensitive evaluation of the patient. During it, it was possible to detect their physical condition and to prevent risks associated with the absence of sensation. During the study, patients were asked about the difficulties in their regular activities and the importance given to such disability.\nAll patients received at least one adapted utensil and were trained for the use of the following instruments: forks, knifes, spoons, mugs, wooden spoon, toothbrushes, shavers, pen and scissors. The work tools adapted were: screwdriver, monkey wrench and grip pliers. Orthoses for ulnar claw were also built.\nA total of 44 hours of observation were performed and registered in a field journal, that also contained the evaluation of the participants, production of the equipment and training of the adaptations.\nDuring the observational period, information about the professional care, relation aspects and process of selection of the patients for the interviews were gathered. During this period, we also took notes on the individuals' nonverbal language.\nThe main objective of adaptations was to allow performing actions, especially the ones that the subject values, letting them to become more independent and fulfilled. The training process was also a moment to discuss the adhesion of the use of devices, and all patients were able to perform tasks in a new, adapted manner.\nPatients brought their own utensils from home to be adapted, such as flatwares and tools. This way, we respected patient's culture, did not change their lifestyle and also made them responsible for their own treatment. Materials for adaptations such as lining, foam, PVC, thermomoldable and others achieved a total cost of USD100, and are shown in Fig 1.\n\n\nEthics statement\nThis research was submitted and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee from the Hospital Universit\u00e1rio da Universidade Federal Fluminense, with and acceptance letter from the coparticipant institution HUCFF/UFRJ, in the date of August 8th, 2014, by under the number 774.178, register CAAE: 30503914.5.0000.5243 according to the Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council that controls researches with human beings. All participants have provided a signed informed consent.",
    "Results": "Participants\nAfter observation, 8 patients were selected. They were older than 15 years of age, with grade 2 disability[4]. They all accepted the use of the assistive technology. There were 13 patients in the service, but 5 were excluded due to sequels of other diseases and cognitive and/or mental disturbs (Table 1).\nThe content of the interviews and the observations evidenced verbal and non-verbal expressions, emotional and meaningful contents regarding their social, family and individual dimensions and stigma related to leprosy. Unequal job opportunities, difficulties related to the physical limitation and the way patients became dependent on their family members were present in the reports and generated body expressions and gestures to be reviewed in the Discussion topic.\nThe content of the research was divided into two categories: contribution of adapted devices for the care of the self; and feelings and sensations provoked by the use of the adapted instruments (Table 2).",
    "Discussion": "Discussion aims to connect the technology and the subjectivity in the process of care in an interdisciplinary approach using the Hermeneutic analysis to interpret the data, according to the categories of the study.\n\nContribution of the self-help devices to the care of the self\nThe limitations acquired during ADL that were a topic for this research, such as grabbing, cutting, writing, screwing and performing other care of the self activities have led us to do more than build and train the devices. Such care practice approximated our group from the patients as we experienced the limitations and the search for ways to surpass them. Once we enter someone's routine, we must create an atmosphere of reception, approach and intimacy.\nSeveral gestures emerged together with the statements. \u201cthis finger (index) disrupts me, it is very small and I can't hold things\u201d(patient 4). One must consider that anesthetic, amputated or with re-absorption hands are limited in their functionality.\nThe patient above demonstrated how he performed actions, despite of his injured hands, by a reelaboration of his possibilities through adaptation as develops his own way of solving problems, such as \u201cwhen the screw head is small, I place it in a magnet, which makes it easier to get\u2026\u201d (Fig 2).\nThe contributions of adaptations for the patients' lives also aimed to prevent accidents, such as \u201c\u2026the knife sometimes cuts my hand.. I've never cut myself\u2026.the adaptation is good\u2026.the hilt is thicker\u2026\u201d (patient 1).\nThe use of adaptations promotes a distribution of the prehension forces, enhances functionality and reduces the influence of the deficiency into an independent performance of functional activities.\nTo be safe while performing an action was interpreted by the patients as a possibility for autonomy and care of the self. Patient 7, who received a wider wooden spoon refers a safer sensation by being away from the steam of the pots. Even in the absence of pain, no patient wants to have an injury, which can be seen as sign of self-neglect. To facilitate self-care, patients received flatware and toothbrushes (Fig 3).\nOur results along with the search for the autonomy in the care of the self, establishes a connection with Foucault's care of the self idea. Foucault [5] affirms that \u201cTo take care of the self is to know oneself, one's soul, as soul-subject, the element that identifies to the divine.\u201d\n\u201cThe entire surface of the care of the self is occupied by this requirement of self-knowledge which, as you know, takes the form of the soul's grasp of its own being, which it carries out by looking at itself in the mirror of the intelligible in which, precisely, it has to recognize itself\u201d [5]\n\nThe adaptation of utensils provided a possibility of safety and independence during the recovery process, which are autonomy actions for the subject's care, frequently expressed as the examples \u201cI' will be able to write again\u201d(patient 3), \u201c\u2026now I can hold the bottle and easily drink water\u201d(patient 6). Such reports connect themselves with the amplification of the subjective and bodily possibilities, as the adaptations can be considered an extension of the body and a facilitator of the restoration of the human making process.\nWhen the patients reported their perception of the use of the adapted utensil in their ADL, it was observed a re-elaboration of the making, with a new sense of the care of the self, as registered in the following sentences: \u201cto be able to finish studying, to have a high school degree is a relief, a victory.\u201d(patient 3), \u201cThe more we can do without any help, the better\u201d (patient 7).\nTherefore, to facilitate one's care of the self actions involves aspects such as: their way of living, choices, feelings, representations and other elements that act in the building of the way of being. It occurs an ethical implication of respecting the autonomy of the subject, rescue their dignity and providing social interactions.\nWhen observing the frequent expressions of joy and satisfaction facing the rescue of the ADL, it is observed an aesthetics of existence, which, according to Foucault[6] aims for the constitution of one's self as the artesian of the beauty of one's own life.\nThis aesthetic dimension shows that the taste for the new form of living, the satisfaction for the autonomy, brings up the promotion of health and quality of life in a context of treatment and rehabilitation. A patient's report was \u201cDo you know how it feels to ask someone who doesn't want to help?\u201d(patient 3) followed by \u201cThis adaptation increased my self-steem\u201d (patient 5). \u201cIt brings happiness and joy\u201d(patient 1), and another one affirmed \u201cWe feel safer inside\u201d (patient 7).\n\n\nFeelings and sensations provoked by the use of adapted instruments\nFoucault [6] affirms that the hermeneutics analysis is a joint point between the body and the history. It evidences the body as marked by the history, and denotes the need to interpret the interpretation of the routine activities incorporated. In the field of the hermeneutics analysis there are the corporeality and its historical representations, throughout the subject's sensibility.\nThe unique reports show the need for acceptance and integration in the society, which they have been denied due to the body sequels and social stigma historically produced. \u201cWe just feel equal, right?\u2026other people, the normal ones, then I become normal\u201d (patient 1). \u201cHow come someone else can cut and I can't?\u201d(patient 5), \u201cI used to watch people sitting at a table holding knives and forks, and I felt powerless, you know?.. Now I don't, when I cut, I also participate\u201d, \u201cI was sad because I couldn't do anything\u201d (patient 1) (Fig 4).\nSubject is submitted to mercy of distinct factors linked to someone else by control and dependence; and tied to his own identity by a conscience or self-knowledge. Despite one's individual perception of unique and owner of its own destiny, we also have a tendency to totality and fullfillness [7].\nSocial indifference leads to a feeling of sadness, described as a psychic suffering, which must be carefully identified and discussed when working with such clients. That is due to an affective sequel between the bodily representation and the subject's history. Once we faced such situation, we could understand it and help the subject when developing its own the care of the self. The assistive technology was applied to help achieving autonomy, social participation and a will to live, reducing one's suffering. Once we discussed the differences, emotion emerged along with a search for comprehension, as the following quotes affirm: \u201cDoctor, you don't know what it feels like!!\u201d (patient 2) and indignation and sadness looks manifested. This reflexion leads us to believe that technical knowledge is not enough to comprehend the complexity, one must also listen, welcome and follow the process of care of the subject.\nSome overcome sentences manifested as \u201cIt's like we are reborn, learning it all again\u201d(patient 3), \u201cI couldn't get anything with this hand, but now I can\u201d(patient 4), \u201c\u2026it's a good exercise to learn what I couldn't do before\u201d(patient 7). That evidences the desire, the possibility to make choices and avoid placing oneself as a victim as reinventing through the limits and possibilities of life.\nThese are evidences for relearning and reconstruction of the making (Fig 5). It is fundamental, during this period, to deal the patient's resistance, to avoid them from keeping in the process and to maximally enjoy the opportunities for a nurturing and interactive relearning. Such changing moment was observed through manifestations of joy, satisfaction and surprise throughout the possibilities. Also gestures and lines of conquer emerged, accompanied by hopeful smiles and looks, provided in a comprehensive and conscious manner by the assistive technology.\nAlthough the sensation of happiness was manifested, feelings of anger and indignation were also observed. Objective and subjective limitations appeared in a few reports: \u201cThis is not good to use, but a lot of people need it.\u201d(patient 8) \u201cI become so angry that I call names, sometimes\u201d \u201c\u2026I don't eat to avoid disturbing others\u201d(patient 2). Sometimes movements could not be performed even in the use of the adapted devices, so frustration appeared. This topic was also discussed in our sessions, without giving up the new possibilities. To live with pleasure and the lack of it, love and hate are indispensable parts of the human learning process, and can't be removed from the health care.\nThe use of self help devices causes social awkwardness and can attract as much attention as the deformities caused by leprosy. This is probably one of the reasons of the low adhesion of the use of adapted devices when in public. Some patients affirm the use of adapted equipment at a restaurant as an award. Others demonstrate shame and report to be more observed in the use of the adaptations. \u201cI don't use it outside, people look at it\u201d(patient 2). The truth is that society does not easily tolerate differences. One will always search for the appropriate behavior, the desire for uniformness. This problematic was also discussed, the adhesion of the use of the orthoses and adaptations, with a focus on the adapted action, and how this subjectively affects the person.\nThe hermeneutics analysis points the need for the interpretation to constantly interpret itself, especially the re-signification and re-codification of the messages and signs. The sign begins to hold the contradictions, oppositions, tensions, negativity and positivity required to play a dialectic of interpretation [8].\nHermeneutic procedure allows to \u201cspeak again\u201d and provides a wide possibility to new destiny on the speech.\nWhen a patient with injured hands sadly says \u201cEverything we do is more difficult\u201d(patient 4) and follows that by \u201cI won't need to ask for help to open a bottle anymore\u201d(patient 7) it is important to allow them to listen how they can give a new meaning to this impotence and tiredness towards their difficulties.\nThe professional must recognize this endless building process. As Paulo Freire says [9], \u201cThe unfinished or inconclusive is part of the vital experience of the human being. Where there's life, there is something unfinished\u201d, it can be realized that this impulses self knowledge and the appearance of latent desires, such as fantasies, dreams and other subconscious manifestations.\nThis is a perennial, never conclusive movement. We don't walk only forward, but we can walk back, go deeper, walk in any direction. The same occurs for the interpretations, they need to relate through a complex net of symbols. It has been a priority in our research to guarantee this environment of welcome and rebuilding.\nThe main findings of our research appeared in the rediscovered feelings during the use of the self-help devices, through expressions of overcome or frustration during the training sessions, smiles, moments of silence, and strengthening of the therapeutic bonding between patient and health care professional.\n\n\nConclusions\nAssistive technology is a worthy therapeutic instrument in the care of people with special needs. It must be involved in a context of a symbolic net that involve the body, he function, social role and the society when dealing with the inclusion, among other existential and relational aspects.\nThe lack of more information on the use of the assistive technology in leprosy has led us to continue this research. The number of cases is high, and new forms of sensitive and effective care must be searched, to change the profile of the rehabilitation offered, providing forms to rescue the autonomy and independence.\nTo affirm that the patient is autonomous, free and conscious of their choices, facing the embarrassing economic and social moments that difficult the access to information, it is fundamental to equal the relation of power between patient and health care professional. Aspects as one's desires, potentials and rights must be valued.\nWhen analyzing the contribution of the devices in the routines and care of the self, feelings and sensations provoked, it was verified how important it is to provide instruments to the patients that allow the care of the self and how much this interferes in the preservation of the autonomy and social inclusion of the individual. The use of the devices does not represent a high cost for one's treatment, but has an impact in the rescue of the abilities lost with the evolution of the leprosy disabilities, which should be funded as research.\nWe must consider through gestures and speaking that the body of the patient with leprosy expresses scars of a collective history of suffering. Each subject express its own issues towards body and symptoms, but the conditions at the moment can not be ignored. The perception that the assistive technology represents a tool with a changing power for the rescue of these patients' identity leads to believe in new possibilities of care."
