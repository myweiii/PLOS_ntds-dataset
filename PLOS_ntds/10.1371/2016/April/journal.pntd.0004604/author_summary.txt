Bacteremia caused by nontyphoidal Salmonellae are a major health burden in Africa. While antibody-induced complement-mediated killing protects healthy Africans against Salmonella, increased levels of anti-LPS antibodies in some HIV-infected Africans block this killing. Little is known about the mechanism of the interference of killing by these antibodies. Here, we compared sera and affinity-purified antibodies from African HIV-infected adults that are unable to kill invasive S. Typhimurium D23580, with sera from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected subjects with bactericidal activity. We found that the blocking effect of anti-LPS antibodies is a factor of antibody concentration, rather than antibody structure or specificity. While all three isotypes (IgG, IgA and IgM) can inhibit killing of Salmonella at grossly high concentrations, the IgG and IgM isotypes of the anti-LPS antibodies have in vitro bactericidal activity against invasive African S. Typhimurium. Inhibition of killing did not associate with antibody affinity or avidity, or complement deposition or consumption. It is possible that a LPS-based vaccine would induce antibodies at bactericidal rather than inhibitory concentrations in HIV-uninfected individuals. In HIV-infected individuals, it is uncertain whether vaccination will induce a protective response or a dysregulated excess of anti-LPS antibodies that impairs serum killing of Salmonella.
