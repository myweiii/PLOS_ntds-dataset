However, malaria has not been reported in Vientiane City for decades, but others diseases such as dengue fever, rickettsioses, typhoid fever, leptospirosis and Japanese encephalitis, have. In this prospective hospital-based study of the causes of fever in pregnancy, dengue fever was the most common diagnosis, followed by pyelonephritis with Escherichia coli, murine typhus, scrub typhus and typhoid fever.
