Schistosomal myeloradiculopathy is a rare and severe form of schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni, a blood-dwelling worm that lives in the intestinal veins of infected people. The parasite produces eggs that travel in the blood flow and can be trapped in different organs, including the spinal cord. Local inflammation leads to myeloradiculopathy, whose classical symptoms are back pain, numbness and weakness of the legs, erectile dysfunction and urinary retention. Precocious and long-duration therapy with high dose of corticosteroids is necessary to avoid severe sequelae, such as disability to walk. The recommended duration of the treatment varies from three weeks to six months. The physician usually decides when to stop steroids based on physical examination. A neurophysiology exam could improve the evaluation of therapeutic response and the diagnosis of recurrences. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) with Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), which is a simple, non-invasive and inexpensive exam, could be used in this context. We assessed the characteristics of VEMP with GVS in patients and found that it was altered in comparison to controls, demonstrating that this exam is a promising tool to add electrophysiological information on the spine to the physical examination.
