Snakebite is an important medical problem in sub-tropical and tropical regions, including Nepal where tens of thousands of people are bitten every year. Snakebite can result in life-threatening envenoming, and correct identification of the biting species is crucial for care providers to choose appropriate treatment and anticipate complications. This paper explores a number of methods, including molecular techniques, to assist care providers in identifying the species responsible for bites in rural Nepal. Out of 749 patients with a history of snakebite, the biting species could be identified in 194 (25.9%). Out of these, 87 had been bitten by a venomous snake, most commonly cobras (n = 42) and kraits (n = 22). This study is the first to report the use of molecular techniques for snake species identification. The diagnostic accuracy of this method appears high but needs to be confirmed in larger studies.
