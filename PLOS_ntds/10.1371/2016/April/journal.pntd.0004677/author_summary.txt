New approaches to preventing chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are needed because the endemic range of this virus is expanding and because current methods are limited to controlling mosquito populations, and this approach has not effectively controlled this virus. A promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention relies on the introduction of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia biocontrol has advanced from laboratory experiments demonstrating that Wolbachia reduces virus replication to small-scale field trials demonstrating that Wolbachia are capable of spreading through wild Ae. aegypti populations. This primarily has been proposed as a tool to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission; however, Wolbachia infections confer protection for their insect hosts against a range of pathogens including CHIKV in Ae. aegypti. Medium-scale Wolbachia deployments are imminent or in certain instances have commenced. Therefore, assessing whether or not Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti are effective against CHIKV will help inform the viability of Wolbachia biocontrol for CHIKV control. Our study provides valuable evidence that could justify expanding this type of control program to other Ae. aegypti-transmitted arboviruses, primarily CHIKV.
