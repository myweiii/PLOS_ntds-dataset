Intestinal parasites can infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans. Means of exposure include ingestion of contaminated fruits and vegetables, consumption of infected water and personal contact. Protozoa are considered one of the major groups of parasites. Children are particularly susceptible to infection by these microorganisms, and when they are infected, diarrhea can be the main clinical manifestation. In developing countries, people are at particular risk of infection. However, intestinal parasites, and in particular protozoans, have been taken into account only in a few epidemiological studies. Thus, we conducted an investigation to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and epidemiological information associated with 4 intestinal protozoan infections: Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Blastocystis and Dientamoeba, among children attending two schools of Tripoli, Lebanon. A high prevalence of protozoan parasites was found. Although only 50% of children reported digestive symptoms, asymptomatic infection was observed very often, suggesting that these children may act as unknown carriers. In addition, we found that personal contact plays an important role as a risk factor associated with protozoan infection. This epidemiological survey shows the burden of parasitic infections in Lebanese children and provides necessary information to public health authorities for creating prevention and control strategies.
