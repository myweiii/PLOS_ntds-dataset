The sand fly Phlebotomus orientalis is the main vector of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa. During bloodfeeding, sand flies inject saliva into the host skin and repeated bites result in a specific antibody response in the bitten hosts. Antibody responses are directed against sand fly salivary proteins and the levels of these antibodies reflect the intensity of exposure to biting sand flies. The antibody reactions can be measured using salivary gland homogenates (SGHs), but for large-scale testing its use is impractical because of the amount of work required to obtain sufficient quantities of SGH. Recombinant proteins prepared based on the antigens in the sand fly saliva can substitute whole SGH in large-scale studies. We tested five recombinant proteins from Ph. orientalis saliva expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that the yellow-related protein rPorSP24 can replace the SGH in estimating exposure to sand flies of dogs, goats, and sheep in Ethiopia. Immune reactions to vector saliva in endemic areas, provides useful information on levels of exposure and, thereby, on the effectiveness of vector control programs.
