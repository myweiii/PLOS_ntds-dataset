A patient reported an arthropod bite on her dorsal metatarsal region 2/3 of her anterior foot during a trip to the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa. Eventually, a rash developed at the site of the bite and high-grade fever started 8 days later. Spirochetes were detected in the blood smear and the patient was treated with the suspected diagnosis of tick-borne relapsing fever. The presence of Borrelia spp. in fresh patient blood could be confirmed using DNA amplification and sequencing techniques. Homology searches of the obtained sequences from 16S rRNA, flaB, and uvrA revealed surprisingly distant relationships to known Borrelia species. It is concluded that the infection was caused by a new species of tick-borne relapsing fever Borrelia capable of infecting humans that we propose to name “Candidatus Borrelia kalaharica”, which is described within this manuscript. The blood sample was discarded after initial analysis; therefore, no successful culture could be obtained.
