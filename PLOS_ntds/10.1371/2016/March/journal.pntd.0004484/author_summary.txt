Coral snakes are a group of deadly venomous snakes that exhibit a characteristic red, yellow/white, and black coloured banding pattern. Accidents involving these snakes tend to be very severe or even lethal, causing peripheral nervous system depression with muscle paralysis and vasomotor instability. The only acceptable medical treatment for snakebite accidents is the administration of an antivenom, generally produced by immunising horses with the snake venom. Nonetheless, for what concerns the antielapidic serum production in Brazil, the total amount of venom available for horse immunisations is insufficient. This is mainly due to the small size of coral snake glands, their underground life style, combined with its very low survival rates in captivity. Moreover, cases of patients being intubated and ventilated as a consequence of antivenom shortage in USA have also been registered. In this work, we present an alternative method for the development of antielapidic serum, which does not rely upon snake capture. This serum was produced by a heterologous DNA prime—with a multiepitope DNA string coding for the most reactive epitopes from the most abundant toxins of M. corallinus, a coral snake which occupy highly populated areas in Brazil—followed by recombinant multiepitope protein boost immunisation of mice.
