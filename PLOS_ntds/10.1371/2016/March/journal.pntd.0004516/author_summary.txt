Japanese encephalitis virus infection is widespread in Asia, and primarily affects children in poor, rural areas. The virus spreads to the brain and spinal cord resulting in significant death and disability. Diagnosis requires testing for the immune response ‘antibody’ specific to Japanese encephalitis virus in the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. However, in most areas where the infection occurs there are no laboratory facilities. In the absence of laboratory diagnosis, we have poor knowledge of the extent of the problem in these areas. Dried blood spots on filter paper have been used widely for many years as simple, cost-effective tools for transporting samples for testing. However, there have been few attempts at using dried cerebrospinal fluid spots. We developed a technique for using dried spots to store and test cerebrospinal fluid for antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus. We compared the results of dried spots with routine neat cerebrospinal fluid in 132 patient samples, and demonstrated excellent agreement between the two tests. This novel method for saturating dried cerebrospinal fluid spots has the potential to enhance our knowledge of Japanese encephalitis virus epidemiology, and inform health policies where they are most needed. It could also be transferred for use in diagnosing other infectious diseases, including using other body fluid samples.
