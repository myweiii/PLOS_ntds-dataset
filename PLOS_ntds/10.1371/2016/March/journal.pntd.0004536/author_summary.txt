Severe dengue has been linked to secondary heterologous infection or to primary infection in 6–9 month old babies born to dengue immune mothers. The leading hypothesis for such observations is the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon in which cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing, heterologous antibodies, or sub-neutralizing levels of homotypic antibodies, enhance uptake of dengue virus into host cells. We report here the development of a dengue ADE mouse model that is mediated by maternal antibodies acquired during gestation and breastfeeding. Dengue infection of mice born to mothers immune to a heterologous dengue serotype resulted in rapid death of the mice, accompanied by increased virus titers, severe liver damage and heighted systemic inflammation. Anti-TNFα therapy fully rescued the animals. This novel mouse model may help further understand dengue pathogenesis and provides a platform for testing the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates.
