Dengue virus is a human pathogen that causes dengue fever, which can either resolve after mild fever or lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. The role of dengue virus levels in the blood and the kinetics of infection and immune response that results in severe dengue disease in humans is not well characterized. In this study, we analyzed 97 children with varying degrees of dengue disease, and we show that the dengue virus quantity in blood does not show any significant association with severe disease. However, most severe dengue patients had lower levels of interferons and Th1 cytokines and increased levels of secreted factors such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 that could potentially cause leakage in blood capillaries. Our results indicate that monocytes, which are infected with dengue virus in patients, could possibly play a major role in dengue pathogenesis. Furthermore, using computational analysis we identified association of some of the secreted factors with severe disease and also predicted the markers that could serve as indicators of recovery from severe dengue.
