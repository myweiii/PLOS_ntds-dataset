Zoonoses are diseases that are naturally transmitted between animals and humans. In Tanzania, research has shown that several zoonoses, including brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever, are common, but under-diagnosed, causes of human illness. We conducted a mixed methods survey, combining quantitative and qualitative research techniques, of healthcare providers in Moshi, Tanzania. Four (40%) of 10 animal sector respondents and 15 (29%) of 52 human sector respondents reported seeing brucellosis cases in the past 12 months, while none reported cases of leptospirosis or Q fever. Nineteen (31%) respondents reported awareness of a local diagnostic test for human brucellosis, while one reported locally available diagnostic tests for human leptospirosis and Q fever. One (2%) respondent reported a locally available animal brucellosis test, and none reported tests for leptospirosis or Q fever in animals. Many respondents mentioned a lack of diagnostic testing resources during interviews. Our findings suggest that diagnostic testing capacity improvements alongside public health campaigns and healthcare provider education are key steps toward improving recognition and accurate diagnosis of zoonoses in this setting. An improved understanding of healthcare provider awareness, perceptions, and practices regarding zoonoses is critical for the design of effective programs to improve diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.
