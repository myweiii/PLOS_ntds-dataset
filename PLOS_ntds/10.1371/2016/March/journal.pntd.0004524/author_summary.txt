Current treatment of dengue virus infection is supportive; however, iminosugars have been widely investigated as an antiviral strategy. The means by which these molecules are thought to exert their antiviral effects is through inhibition of host-resident glycoprotein processing enzymes, the endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidases, but many iminosugars are also capable of inhibiting host glycolipid processing and are utilized clinically for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher’s and Niemann-Pick type C diseases. The work presented here is the first to conclusively differentiate the antiviral properties of these two major mechanisms of action of iminosugars, and our data support the long-standing hypothesis that inhibition of glycoprotein processing is the essential antiviral property of iminosugars in the case of dengue virus infection. These results indicate that further development of iminosugars as dengue antivirals should focus on optimization of glycoprotein inhibition efficacy with reduction or elimination of glycolipid modulating properties to minimize off-target effects. These results are supported by the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the bicyclic iminosugar, celgosivir, which we demonstrate to lack capacity for inhibition of glycosphingolipid processing.
