Drug discovery for neglected tropical diseases must use efficient methods due to limited resources. One preferred drug discovery strategy is target-based drug discovery. In this strategy it is assumed that drug action begins with binding of a drug to its target. However, while binding is required, it is not sufficient to describe all the molecular interactions that translate binding to a therapeutically useful response. The contribution of aspects of the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) such as time-dependence and substrate competition can influence concentration response relationships. To address this, a four point MMOA methodology was developed to evaluate time-dependence and substrate competition. We used this method to evaluate the MMOA for T.brucei GSK3β inhibitors, and observed tideglusib to have a time-dependent, ATP-competitive mechanism that differentiated it from rapidly reversible inhibitors, such as GW8510. Adjusting the enzyme assays to account for these mechanisms showed that GW8510 and tideglusib had similar activities for TbGSK3β. However, this similarity did not translate to cellular activity, where GW-8510 was more active than tideglusib (0.12 μM to 2.3 μM, respectively). These data suggest that factors other than TbGSK3β MMOA differentiate the effect of these molecules against T. brucei.
