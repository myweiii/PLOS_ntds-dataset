Loiasis is a big obstacle for the elimination of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in Central Africa in areas where loiasis is endemic. In these areas, some subjects who are heavily infected (microfilaraemia > 30 000 microfilariae/ml blood) can develop severe and serious adverse reactions to ivermectin. In rare cases, these have been fatal. A way of preventing these reactions could be to administer a treatment that decreases the microfilareamia in all subjects below the risk level before mass treatment with ivermectin. Building on results of previous studies, this randomised placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of two or six doses of albendazole administered every two months on the microfilaraemia of Loa loa. Six doses led to a decrease in microfilaraemia by at least 50% for at least four months in 53% of participants. However, it did not reduce the microfilaraemia below the risk level in all participants. Therefore, this regimen has not sufficient efficacy to prevent severe adverse reactions to ivermectin.
