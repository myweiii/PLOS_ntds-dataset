Cystic echinococcosis is a neglected disease caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus complex affecting both humans and livestock. The disease is considered one of the worldâ€™s major zoonoses, and represents a public health problem. Clinical diagnosis and follow-up is mainly based on imaging, while serology should complement imaging-based diagnosis when imaging features are unclear. However, current commercial immunoassays lack satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. They are mostly based on crude antigen preparations of E. granulosus hydatid cyst fluid, a heterogeneous mixture containing molecules of both parasite and host origin, thus standardization is also an issue. Ag5 is one of the most immunogenic proteins present in the hydatid cyst fluid. In a previous work, we described a method enabling the preparation of a highly enriched Ag5 fraction. Here, we present the evaluation of the diagnostic performances of this preparation in two ELISA setups, using a large number of human sera. The influence of several clinical variables on the performance of the tests was also assessed. The results obtained by the Ag5 ELISAs, combined with the robustness of the Ag5 preparation method, make this antigen a promising candidate for the serodiagnosis of CE.
