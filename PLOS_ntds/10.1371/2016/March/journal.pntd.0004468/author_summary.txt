The leishmaniases, a group of diseases caused by Leishmania parasites, belong to the most neglected tropical diseases: they are mainly found in low-income countries and affect the poorest populations. These parasites infect cells of the immune system called macrophages, which can kill the intracellular parasites in response to soluble mediators they receive from other cells of the immune system, the lymphocytes. Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the leishmaniases and is characterized by enlarged liver and spleen, fever, weight-loss and anaemia and represents a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Currently there is no vaccine available, the existing treatment has many severe side effects and drug-resistance is increasing. In the present study, we worked with patients suffering from visceral leishmaniasis. This form of the disease is fatal if the patients are not treated. We studied the ability of lymphocytes isolated from their blood to produce soluble mediators before and at different times after the end of treatment. Our results show that the lymphocytes have an impaired capacity to produce the soluble mediator required to instruct infected cells to kill the intracellular parasites, but that this lack of response is gradually restored with time after successful treatment.
