The elimination of T. infestans in wide areas of the Southern Cone countries of South America and good results in other vector control initiatives showed the high susceptibility of triatomines to pyrethroid insecticides. Despite the constant efforts of vector control, the success was not complete in several areas of the Gran Chaco region of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay and parts of the Inter-Andean Valleys of Bolivia, and southern Peru, where persistent populations of domestic and wild T. infestans still persist. Additionally, high levels of insecticide resistance leading to control failures were described in the biogeographic region of the Gran Chaco, within the area of persistent house reinfestation after insecticide application. The influence of environmental variables on the geographic distribution of triatomine was previously studied for several species, showing significant correlations between Triatominae species occurrence and a number of environmental variables. We investigated the association between the spatial distribution of pyrethroid resistant populations of T. infestans and environmental variables. This study shows that pyrethroid resistance in T. infestans causing control failures is a highly localized event, spatially associated with the putative dispersion origin of the species, the location of the intermediate cytogenetic group, and with a particular combination of environmental variables, near the border between Argentina and Bolivia. The strong linear relationship found between LD50 and RR50 suggest RR50 might not be the best indicator of insecticide resistance in triatomines.
