Leishmaniasis is a vectorial parasitic disease caused by flagellate organisms from the genus Leishmania. Infection is present in over 80 countries and visceral forms are the second most fatal human parasitic disease. Control relies on chemotherapy but available drugs have important shortcomings such as toxicity, side effects, unaffordable price of the safest presentations and increasing reports of parasite resistance and clinical failures. Thus, new drugs are needed. Allicin, a molecule obtained from garlic, has shown antiproliferative effect against different cancer cells, bacteria, fungi and Protista including Leishmania. Insofar its mechanism of action is poorly known. Our results with L.infantum point towards allicin inducing high levels of intracellular calcium, redox inbalance, and mitochondrial dysfunction with reduction of ATP. These events lead to cell necrosis without evidence of apoptotic-like markers. The proposed model suggests the potential use of allicin against leishmaniasis, alone or in combination with other drugs with different mechanisms of action.
