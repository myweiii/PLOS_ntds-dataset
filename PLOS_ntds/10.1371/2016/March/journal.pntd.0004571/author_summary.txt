The intestinal protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis and many other medically important protozoan parasites must encyst and form infective cysts in order to transmit to new hosts. Encystation efficiency is in that way connected to efficiency of transmission. We have developed new in vitro differentiation protocols and made the first RNA-seq based gene expression study of the complete Giardia encystation process. Our data provides a road map of Giardia encystation and a starting point from where it is possible to further explore important processes occurring during encystation. Information about this vital process for survival in the environment of this and other cyst forming parasites can be used in the development of new types of interventions.
