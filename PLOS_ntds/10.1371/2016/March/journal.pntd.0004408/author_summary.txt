Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc), which consists of seven major, phylogenetically distinct lineages and their families. West Africa is the only region in the world where, besides the common M. tuberculosis lineages, the two M. africanum lineages are endemic. We demonstrate that the composition of the mycobacterial population in the western part of West Africa significantly differs from the one in the eastern part. This documented variation will impact on generalizability and interpretation of clinical trials outcomes. Therefore future trial designs need to consider the geographical diversity of underlying mycobacterial populations.
