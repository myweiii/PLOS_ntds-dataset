Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma spp) is an intestinal parasitic infection that causes anaemia, stunted growth, impaired cognition, and decreased physical fitness among other pathological effects. Currently, the control of schistosomiasis relies principally on mass drug administration of praziquantel. In addition, the implementation of further interventions such as snail (intermediate host) control, improving access to safe water and sanitation are required to achieve elimination of transmission in humans. An updated epidemiological situation will help countries to design tailor-made interventions enabling a step-up in prevention and control measures with the goal of elimination of transmission of this disease by 2020. In the region of the Americas, Schistosoma mansoni is the only species present that infect humans. This systematic review shows that in this region there is a need for re-mapping the schistosomiasis epidemiological situation in certain areas and countries in order to implement and optimize the best public health interventions needed to interrupt transmission or verify elimination of transmission. The methodology for monitoring and evaluating schistosomiasis control programs are well defined by current WHO guidelines. However, further investigations and guidelines on suitable tools for monitoring and evaluating schistosomiasis elimination programs and criteria and procedures for validating the elimination are required, and are currently being undertaken by WHO.
