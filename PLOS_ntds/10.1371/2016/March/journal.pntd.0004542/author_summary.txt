Leprosy is caused by a bacterium that affects peopleâ€™s nerves, giving rise to deformities. Leprosy largely affects the poor, and many people around the world are disabled due to leprosy. The deformities that the disease causes are largely preventable through early detection of the disease. In countries such as Brazil, where high rates of leprosy cases still exist, this disease remains a public health issue. However, long delays in the diagnosis of leprosy patients have been reported. In this study we observed that many patients were ignorant to the early symptoms of leprosy, and that the negative image surrounding leprosy within communities can hinder patients from seeking treatment due to the fear of being isolated. In addition, we noted that doctors often do not reach a conclusive diagnosis of leprosy promptly. This misdiagnosis appears to be contributing to the overall delay in the diagnosis of leprosy patients in areas of Brazil. Although more research exploring this subject should be conducted, this study highlights a possible need for further educational interventions for both patients and doctors.
