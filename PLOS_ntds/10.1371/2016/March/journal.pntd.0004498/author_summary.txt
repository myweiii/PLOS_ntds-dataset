Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a severe illness that is usually spread from person to person through caring for someone who is sick, or if they die, contact with their body during their funeral. The recent EVD outbreak in West Africa caused illness and death in many thousands in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. It has been the largest and most difficult to control of any EVD outbreak in history, and this led to doubts as to the effectiveness of established control measures. Our study describes the successful control of EVD in a rural district of Sierra Leone. As in previous outbreaks, we found that control was achieved by working with communities to identify people who may have been exposed to EVD; if they then became sick, their early admission for testing and care to specialised centres that have equipment and procedures to prevent EVD passing on to staff or other patients, and safe burial of those who die of EVD by trained workers with appropriate protective equipment. We describe the resources and response structure needed to implement such measures effectively, information that will assist in controlling future outbreaks.
