Leprosy remains a public health problem in Brazil. With over 30,000 new cases detected annually, it has the second-largest number of leprosy cases detected worldwide. Although the overall number of new cases is declining, there are still areas with a high disease burden, such as Pará State. In this study, we used the individual-based model SIMCOLEP to predict the future trend of the new case detection rate of leprosy (NCDR) in Pará State given the current control strategy. Additionally, we explored the potential impact of contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis on the NCDR. Our results show that the NCDR continues to decrease in Para State, reaching elimination around 2030. Contact tracing alone would not further reduce the NCDR. However, when contact tracing is combined with chemoprophylaxis the NCDR would be reduced up to 40% and elimination could be brought forward by two years.
