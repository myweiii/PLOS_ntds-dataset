Mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are zoonotic pathogens representing a serious health problem for humans and animals worldwide. The life cycle of mycobacteria is complex, and the mechanisms resulting in pathogen infection and survival in host cells are not fully understood. Eurasian wild boar are natural reservoir hosts for MTBC and a model for mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis. The results of this study broaden our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of zoonotic tuberculosis and fill important gaps in knowledge of this topic. The results suggested that mycobacteria manipulate host immune response by reducing the production of immune system proteins. However, as infection progresses, wild boar immune response recovers to limit pathogen multiplication and promote survival, facilitating pathogen transmission. As previously reported in other obligate intracellular bacteria, host-mycobacteria interactions probably reflect a co-evolutionary process in which pathogens evolved mechanisms to subvert host response to establish infection, but hosts also evolved mechanisms to limit pathogen infection and promote survival. Subsequently, mycobacteria benefit from host survival by increasing the probability for transmission to continue their life cycle. These results provide relevant information to develop tools to evaluate risks for tuberculosis caused by MTBC and for disease control in humans and animals.
