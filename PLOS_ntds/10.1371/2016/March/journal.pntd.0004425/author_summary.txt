Surveillance programs for environmentally-mediated infectious diseases in the developing world present challenges to public health authorities in acquiring adequate resources for their widespread use as well as in the availability of practical and reliable methods. These challenges are exacerbated in cases where transmission is suppressed to low but persistent levels, as is currently the case for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis in China. In this paper we use epidemiologically-based computer modeling to explore the potential utility of new approaches based on human susceptibility on one hand and exposure-related methods on the other. Our intent is to motivate the development of new methods based on one or both of these strategic approaches and aimed at the low transmission environment. We conclude that there is considerable motivation to search for a biomarker of susceptibility to infection in humans and also to develop a method for monitoring surface waters for the free-swimming forms of the parasite in endemic or formerly endemic environments as an early warning of infection risk.
