Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) is a parasitic skin disease caused by the penetration of animal hookworm larvae into the human skin. In this compartment the larvae cannot pass the basal membrane and reproduce, but migrate in the outer skin layer for several weeks, causing skin inflammation and intense itching. Thus, humans are a biological impasse. Although HrCLM is a common skin disease in tropical and subtropical regions, studies on prevalence and risk factors are scarce. We clinically examined the population of a resource-poor neighbourhood in Manaus, capital of Amazonas State, Brazil, and investigated HrCLM-associated risk factors. HrCLM was very common with an overall prevalence of 8.2%. Children in general, and boys in particular, were most frequently infected. We could confirm that walking barefoot on sandy ground is a significant risk factor, and we identified the presence of animal faeces on the compound as another important predictive factor. Clearly, HrCLM was associated with low income and poverty-related living conditions. The poorest of the poor were identified as the most vulnerable population group.
