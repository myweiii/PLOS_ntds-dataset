Anemia is one of the major clinical manifestations during visceral leishmaniasis (VL), whereas mechanisms behind this symptom remain elusive. To get a better understanding of the responsible mechanism(s), we have developed for the first time a mouse model of VL exhibiting anemia. Mice chronically infected with L. donovani had low hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocyte counts while having up-regulated erythropoiesis, suggesting hemolytic events due to infection. We propose here that hemophagocytosis is one of the hemolytic events associated with anemia in the infected mice. The spleen is the major place for hemophagocytosis; there, multinucleated giant cells heavily infected with amastigotes are markedly observed and are the major cell type phagocytosing erythrocytes. These results suggest that heavy infection of macrophages with Leishmania parasites triggers phagocytosis of erythrocytes resulting in anemia during murine VL. Because hemophagocytosis has been reported in human VL cases, reproduction of the pathology in mice may facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms leading to anemia during VL.
