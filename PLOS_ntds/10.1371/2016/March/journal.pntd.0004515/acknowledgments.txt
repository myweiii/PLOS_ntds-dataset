We are very grateful to the many children who provided stool and urine samples, the enumerators who collected the data, and Mr Nigussie Dejene, who organized the data entry. Thanks are due to the data clerks who carried out the data entry, and to the international team of supervisors and trainers, particularly Dr Jimmy Kihara, Dr Narcis Kabatereine, Dr Betty Nabate and Dr Bruno Levecke. We also thank Professor Sir Roy Anderson for his advice on the statistical analysis.
