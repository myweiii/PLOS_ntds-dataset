Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are potentially important control measures for parasitic worms, but few large-scale and well-designed research studies have aimed to quantify the relationships between WASH and infections with these parasites, or demonstrated the practicality of integrating WASH assessments into large-scale worm mapping. Here we use data from 80,475 children in 1,645 schools visited during the 2013–2014 Ethiopian national mapping of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases, to compare school WASH conditions with the mean intensity of infection with these parasites, using Kendall’s τb, a statistic that assesses for correlation between two variables by comparing their rankings. More frequent collection of water for schools was associated with statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher-intensity intestinal schistosomiasis infections, better sanitation significantly with lower roundworm burdens, and better hygiene with significantly lower hookworm burdens. No statistically significant associations (P > 0.05) were found for sanitation and intestinal schistosomiasis or whipworm infections, or hygiene and roundworm or whipworm infections, but better sanitation was associated with a borderline statistically significantly less hookworm infections (P = 0.067). The results suggest that WASH improvements might have different impacts on infection with the various parasites. These differences should be borne in mind when designing WASH interventions to reduce transmission of, and prevent infection with, these parasites.
