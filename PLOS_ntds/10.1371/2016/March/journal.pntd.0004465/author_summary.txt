Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease transmitted by tsetse flies in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease leads to death if not treated. Recent control efforts have reduced the burden of disease from hundreds of thousands of cases per year to fewer than 10,000 cases annually. A potential strategy to completely eliminate sleeping sickness involves genetically modifying the symbiotic bacteria, which are vertically transmitted from mother to offspring, in order to investigate which factors are most important for the successful elimination of human African trypanosomiasis. We found that sleeping sickness was eliminated only when the genetically modified symbionts were successfully transmitted from mother to offspring, and did not reduce fertility or increase mortality in tsetse. We additionally identified tsetse migration rate as an important factor for sleeping sickness elimination.
