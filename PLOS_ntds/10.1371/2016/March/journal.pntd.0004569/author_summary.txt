Leptospirosis (infection with pathogenic Leptospira spp.) is a public health concern worldwide. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), as the most ubiquitous animal of urban wildlife, is potentially the primary source of Leptospira spp. for humans, dogs and livestock. For understanding the Leptospira maintenance in rat colonies, the experimental studies required the use of natural route of transmission between the rats. We investigated the effects of the mucosal and biteâ€™s transmission (conjunctival-mucosal and subcutaneous routes) compared to the reference route (intraperitoneal) during infection in adult rats. With serology, we showed that the antibody production was independent of the inoculation route. By isolation, molecular and histological analyses, we found that the mucosal route was more efficient at renal colonization and leptospires excretion than the subcutaneous route. These results can be useful in understanding the infection modalities in rat that could prevent the human leptospirosis.
