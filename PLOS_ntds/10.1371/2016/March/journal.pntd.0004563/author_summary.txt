Malaria remains an important public health problem worldwide, with 13.8 million cases caused by Plasmodium vivax, a parasite species that predominates in South-East Asia and the American continent. Despite the epidemiological importance of this species, studies of the immune response and their potential for vaccine development are limited. Here we use a high-throughput technique (protein microarray) to identify antibodies in serum from malaria na√Øve and semi-immune Colombian volunteers experimentally infected with P. vivax. We show a higher response in semi-immune individuals before the challenge. Meanwhile, at day 45 after infection, both groups had the highest antibody response to several P. vivax proteins. Additional analysis indicated that semi-immune volunteers without fever recognized new antigens, which may represent promising targets for vaccine development. Taken together, these findings represent a significant step forward in the understanding of the humoral immune response to P. vivax malaria infection, particularly the extent of immune priming upon a first parasite encounter.
