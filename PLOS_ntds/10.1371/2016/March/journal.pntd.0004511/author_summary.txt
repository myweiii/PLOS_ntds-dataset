Dengue is a mosquito borne disease prevalent in more than 100 tropical and sub-tropical countries. In this study, we carried out phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis of dengue serotype 2 strains found to be circulating in Delhi, India, in 2011â€“2014. All the study strains were found to belong to the Cosmopolitan genotype of dengue 2 viruses. Further we also detected a lineage replacement event in the 2013 dengue fever outbreak. We identified a novel mutation in the stem region of the Envelope protein. We also determined nucleotide substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor of dengue 2 viruses. Further a change in the population size of dengue 2 viruses in India as depicted by Bayesian Skyline plot is reported.
