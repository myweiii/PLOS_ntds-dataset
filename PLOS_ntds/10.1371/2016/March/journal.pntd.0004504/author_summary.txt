Schistosomiasis is one of the 17 ‘neglected tropical diseases’ as classified by the World Health Organization. It is a parasitic disease of poverty that affects around 300 million people each year, causing chronic ill-health and severe morbidity. The disease, which is spread through contact with freshwater contaminated with the parasite, can be prevented and controlled in two ways: by distributing drugs on a mass scale (“mass drug administration”) and by changing hygiene and sanitation practices to reduce contact with the parasite. A prerequisite for both strategies is that communities have an understanding of the disease and what solutions are available for its prevention and control.
In order to better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices surrounding schistosomiasis, Malaria Consortium carried out a survey in Nampula province, Mozambique, where the organisation is implementing a community engagement intervention with a focus on this disease. The findings indicate that while awareness of the disease itself is high, knowledge of how it is acquired, transmitted, prevented and treated is low. This suggests a need for greater efforts to improve knowledge of schistosomiasis in affected communities in order to increase uptake of mass drug administration and ensure that communities take appropriate measures to prevent infection.
