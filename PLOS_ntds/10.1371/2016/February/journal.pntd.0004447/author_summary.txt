Blood-sucking bugs are vectors of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. Triatoma brasiliensis is the main Chagas disease vector in the Caatinga eco-region of northeastern Brazil. We showed that T. brasiliensis exhibits gene flow between sylvatic and anthropic (domiciliary and peridomiciliary) populations. This finding represents a challenge for vector control because sylvatic foci are not reached by control activities. Bugs from sylvatic foci harbor high T. cruzi prevalence (52â€“71%). The potentiality that the rodent Kerodon rupestris may act as a parasite reservoir was suggested because bugs infected by T. cruzi, were found in the same insects that fed on this animal. Peridomestic T. brasiliensis populations exhibited high prevalence for feeding on another sylvatic rodent, Galea spixii, which exhibit the potential to connect T. cruzi between ecotopes. The use of an individual-based approach directed to T. brasiliensis, linking vector population genetics to host and parasite identification, may help to better understand the eco-epidemiology of Chagas.
