The dramatic spread of epidemic dengue underscores the urgent need for better surveillance and control of this disease. The main purpose of surveillance is to provide timely and more accurate information to institute preventive or control measures for epidemic dengue. Dengue has emerged as a major public health problem in Sri Lanka. To obtain more data on the burden of dengue, a laboratory-based enhanced sentinel surveillance system was established in metropolitan Colombo. In this paper we describe how we set up the sentinel sites and report the results of the first two years of enhanced surveillance (2012–2014). Of 3,127 patients presenting with acute onset of fever, 43.6% had laboratory confirmed dengue (PCR of NS1 positive), mainly caused by dengue serotype 1. Clinicians’ diagnoses were associated with high sensitivity, but our findings also show that laboratory confirmation is required to enhance specificity. There were 5 deaths, all due to dengue hemorrhagic fever.
