The lack of diagnostic tests that are sensitive, affordable and user-friendly is the impediment to early detection and containment of infectious diseases. For these reasons, African trypanosomosis continues to pose serious threat to the communities that are unable to access laboratory services. Assays that are able to address above-mentioned challenges would greatly reduce the disease burden. Although few relatively sensitive agglutination assays for some forms of African trypanosomosis have been adapted to field conditions, the tests are not reliable indicators of active infections given the fact that they only detect antibodies. The barrier in the development of alternative tests capable of revealing ongoing infections through antigen detection is the lack of potent monoclonal antibodies that can compete with infection-induced host antibodies for the circulating parasite antigens. Using T. congolense as a model system, we demonstrate that Nanobodies (Nbs) targeting the parasite glycosomal aldolase can detect active infections. The strategy described addresses the technical shortcoming of conventional monoclonal antibody-based assay development by adopting an unbiased proteome screening approach combined with a phage panning strategy that is adapted to avoid interference of the infection-induced host antibody response. Hence, this study shows prospect for future development of Nb-based tests for other infectious diseases.
