The spirochete Borrelia persica is a tick-borne bacterium that is transmitted by the vector Ornithodoros tholozani to its vertebrate host in the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian peninsula. Current migration of vast numbers of individuals from this area increases the likelihood that B. persica infections will be introduced into new geographic regions. After infection and distribution by the bloodstream, relapsing fever episodes occur in humans. Since no reliable in vivo tools have existed so far to study this organism, a murine model was established in this study to characterize the infection kinetics in immunocompetent mice. Aspects of the potential infectivity of the laboratory strain and of potential clinical signs, spirochetemia and antibody response as well as organ tropism and histopathological reactions were studied. With the successful infection model presented here, further studies are conceivable in order to gain advanced insights into the pathogenesis of B. persica infection and to characterize in detail the host immune response mounted against the bacterium. We propose that this model could also be used for the development of new rapid diagnostic approaches to initiate or monitor treatment regimes in order to clear or prevent the infection with B. persica.
