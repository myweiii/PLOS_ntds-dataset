Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are required to prevent transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Nucleic acid diagnostic tests are highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus. The RT-LAMP assay using a portable platform equipped with a battery is a useful technique for detecting the virus in the field or laboratories with limited infrastructure. In the present study, RT-LAMP assay detected Zaire ebolavirus in clinical specimens with diagnostic accuracies corresponding to that of the standard RT-PCR test. In addition, the assay could detect positive samples within 15 minutes. These findings have raised the prospects for developing a rapid molecular diagnostic test for EVD. With further improvements in methods for pretreatment of clinical specimens, the RT-LAMP assay may provide a highly accurate rapid diagnostic test for EVD at point-of-care in endemic rural areas.
