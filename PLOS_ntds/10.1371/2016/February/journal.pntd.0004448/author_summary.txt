Rabies is a killer disease caused by the rabies virus that is present in the saliva of rabid animals, mainly the dog. Once symptoms become apparent, death is inevitable. However, rabies can be prevented if correct post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is instituted as soon as possible after a dog bite and before symptoms of rabies begin. In Pakistan, government hospitals treat 50â€“70 new bite victims each day. Many still dispense the free but poor quality nerve tissue vaccine that is often ineffective and fraught with serious adverse reactions. Hospital administrators consider PEP too expensive to be administered free of cost. The Indus Hospital (TIH), Karachi is a private teaching hospital which provides free medical care to all. From July 2013-June 2014, 2,983 new bites were seen in the ED, and rather than use the Essen regimen of five full vial intramuscular doses per patient over 28 days, we administered the WHO-approved Thai Red Cross-intradermal (TRC-id) 4-dose regimen. The use of the TRC-id regimen resulted in 80% cost savings over the Essen regimen. In resource-poor settings, we advocate training of ED personnel in TRC-id regimen, which, ultimately, will result in less vaccine consumption, more patient compliance and complete treatment, resulting in more lives being saved.
