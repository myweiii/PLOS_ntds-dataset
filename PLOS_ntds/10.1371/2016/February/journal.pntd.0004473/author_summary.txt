Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in an urban city could expand due to increased urbanization, population density, and travel. Dengue, as a mosquito-borne viral disease, has rapidly spread from endemic areas to dengue-free regions, with social, demographic, entomological, and environmental factors affecting its transmission. In recent decades, Guangzhou has again suffered from several big outbreaks of dengue; as have its neighboring cities. In this study, we demonstrated that the dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou could impact outbreaks in Zhongshan, one of its neighboring cities, if suitable climate conditions are present. Such associations between dengue epidemics in two cities may also suggest the important role human movement has played in the transmission of the disease. Based on the association between dengue epidemics in Guangzhou and Zhongshan, and the association between dengue epidemics and weather conditions, we developed a reliable and robust model that predicts the occurrence of epidemics at diffrent thresholds in Zhongshan. These results could be used by local health departments in developing strategies towards dengue prevention and control, and push the public to pay more attention to social factors like human movement in disease transmission.
