Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonosis causing infiltrative liver lesions. A subgroup of patients presents with central liver lesions and biliary obstruction. At present there is no clear concept for the treatment of biliary obstruction in AE of the liver, and data from high quality trials to base treatment decisions on evidence are missing. In rare neglected infectious diseases with very low prevalence, clinical data can mainly be generated from case series. In our study we aim at the proof of principle of serial ERC balloon dilation for biliary pathology associated to alveolar echinococcosis. This approach is in accordance with current ERC guidelines and is minimally disruptive for patients.
