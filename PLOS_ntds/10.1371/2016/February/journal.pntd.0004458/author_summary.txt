Recent projections on global warming indicate a constant rise of temperatures in the Mediterranean subregion in the near-mid future. While this phenomenon already caused geographical expansion of several arthropod-borne diseases, it is likely to affect also temporal parameters of seasonally transmitted diseases such as leishmaniasis, a protozoan infection spread by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. Phenology of sand flies consists in the periods of emergence of adults and their disappearance from collections following an activity period during warm months, which can be characterized by peaks of abundance. Current phenological observations can be important for continuing investigations on sand fly dynamics that may impact on leishmaniasis transmission in the future. With this aim, partners from eight Mediterranean countries identified sites with documented Leishmania infantum transmission by six different vector species and performed multiannual trappings. From the high number of 56,000 specimens collected throughout an area spanning from Portugal at west to Georgia at east, the current seasonal dynamics of Mediterranean vectors was obtained. Both, period of adults emergence and type of density trend were found to be significantly correlated with latitude or mean annual temperature of trapping sites. At the southernmost latitudes, vector activity started as early as begin of April and ended by late November, showing that the no-risk period of potential exposure to L. infantum lasted only 4 months.
