High-throughput proteomics offers an approach to evaluate changes in cell protein levels following arboviral infection. Research to understand the molecular basis of human-flavivirus interactions has advanced significantly over the past decade, but comparatively little is known regarding interactions between ticks and tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFs). Here, we employed a proteomics approach using an I. scapularis ISE6 cell line infected with the TBF Langat virus (LGTV) to identify proteins and biochemical pathways affected by viral infection. An LC-MS/MS approach was used to identify proteins that were subsequently assigned to putative cellular pathways based on orthology to proteins in the KEGG database. Biochemical pathways common among arthropods in response to infection with flavivirus and possibly unique to tick-flavivirus interactions, were identified. In vitro cellular assays using small molecules suggest the involvement of the ISE6 proteins, malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), and mitochondria in viral replication. These analyses provide a basis for further studies to identify tick proteins associated with viral replication that could be targeted to disrupt TBF transmission.
