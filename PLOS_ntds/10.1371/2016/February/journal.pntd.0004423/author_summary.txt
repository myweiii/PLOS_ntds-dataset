Plasmodium vivax malaria has several unique features. Two of the main features are the inability to culture this parasite in vitro and its propensity to form dormant stages within the liver, which can only be treated with a single class of drugs that are contraindicated for a proportion of the population. Therefore, vaccines will play an important role in preventing this geographically widespread malaria species. In this clinical trial, we tested increasing amounts of the vaccine candidate VMP001/AS01B for safety and immunogenicity. In order to test if the vaccine can afford protection, we challenged the volunteers via the bite of infected mosquitoes, the first time such a human infection model has been used to evaluate vaccine efficacy for P. vivax malaria. While the vaccine did not protect any of the vaccinated subjects, this study resulted in some important findings, including the observation that a significant proportion of the subjects displayed a trend towards a delay in infection in individuals that correlated with antibodies to the repeat region of the vaccine antigen.
