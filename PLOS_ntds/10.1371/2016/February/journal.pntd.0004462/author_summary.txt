Trachoma is the most common cause of blindness from a bacterial infection in the world. It is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The WHO (World Health Organization) seeks to control this disease worldwide using SAFE which includes mass antibiotic administrations (MDA) with azithromycin. The Nepal National Trachoma Program was started in 2002 with the goal of controlling trachoma as a public health problem. We did a survey in Achham District in early 2014 and found the prevalence of clinical signs of trachoma, chlamydia trachomatis infection and antibodies against chlamydia trachomatis were all below 1% in 1â€“9 year olds. Trachoma has been controlled and is no longer a public health problem in Achham district Nepal.
