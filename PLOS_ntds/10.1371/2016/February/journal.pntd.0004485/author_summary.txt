The different clinical forms of the Leishmaniases range from cutaneous to visceral infections and are caused by organisms belonging to the genus Leishmania. Controversy over the validity of different molecular methods to correctly identify a species hinders the association of a given species with different clinical forms, complicating the prognosis and the development of suitable treatment protocols. A correct identification leads to a better understanding of the action and consequent development of new drugs and immunological reactions. It also provides important information about the relationship of each species with its hosts (humans, animal reservoirs and sandflies) in different geographical areas and ecological situations, helping to design control strategies. Today, PCR is the most commonly used method for Leishmania identification, but even though several targets have been described, no simple and direct protocol has emerged. In this paper, we coupled hsp70 real-time PCR with the determination of amplicon melting profiles in order to explore polymorphic regions by HRM analysis. This methodology yielded discriminatory melting temperature (Tm) values for Brazilian and Eurasian/African Leishmania species. The protocol has proven to be 100% reliable with both clinical and experimental samples. The major advantage of the presently described method is that it is simple, less expensive, highly sensitive and easily automated.
