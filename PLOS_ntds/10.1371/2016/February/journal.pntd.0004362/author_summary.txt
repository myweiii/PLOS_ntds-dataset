Sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis [HAT]) is caused by parasites, and has a chronic progressive course that may last from several months to several years before death occurs. The present studies were done to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pafuramidine versus intramuscular pentamidine (the standard treatment), in patients with first stage HAT. The results indicated that, several months after treatment, pafuramidine administered for 10 days was as effective as pentamidine administered for 7 days, and it had a better safety profile than pentamidine. With further study, pafuramidine could be a promising alternative for patients with first stage HAT. In addition, the design of the studies can be used a guide for future studies for identification and delivery of treatment to affected individuals in rural Africa.
