The scabies mite is a skin parasite that infects humans and other animal species, causing scabies, a contagious disease characterized by extreme itching. Scabies infections are a major health problem in developing countries and in indigenous Australian populations, where scabies is associated with pyoderma (skin sores) and linked to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Little is known about the genetics of the scabies mite. We have assembled the mitochondrial genome of scabies mites obtained from human patients in Australia and from a pig model. While investigating the genetic diversity of each infestation, we found that mitochrondial genomes clustered into two broad clades and showed limited genetic diversity within each infestation. Remarkably, one closely related clade included both human and pig mites, suggesting that mite transmission from pig to human may be possible. This could have major implications in the management of porcine mange and human scabies.
