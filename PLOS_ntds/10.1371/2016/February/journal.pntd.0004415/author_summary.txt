Despite a decline in the numbers of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases and the availability of drugs to treat patients, there is still a need for more efficient treatment options. This is especially important as many VL endemic areas enter phases of disease elimination where parasite burdens need to be reduced as far as possible to minimize the risk of future parasite transmission. Immunotherapy involving the activation of anti-parasitic immunity in infected individuals is a promising approach to help achieve these goals. We tested whether immune modulation could improve anti-parasitic immunity using VL patient samples and an experimental mouse model of infection. Our results provide guidance on the utility of the experimental model, as well as highlighting potential problems associated with immune modulation to improve disease outcomes. These findings have implications for understanding how immunotherapy should be tested and implemented.
