Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) not only have impact on health and life expectancy of mostly disadvantaged populations, but can also lead to economic consequences, including reduced ability to work. Investments in health improvement of the populations affected by NTDs would also help to increase economic growth of the affected regions, since healthier populations are more economically productive. We performed a systematic literature review to better understand how much NTDs affect peopleâ€™s economic welfare. Here we present the results for the NTDs that are controlled with preventive chemotherapy (PCT): lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths (ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infection) and trachoma. Our findings show that PCT NTDs clearly affect productivity, although the actual impact depends on the type and severity of the NTD as well as on the context where the disease occurs. Variation in estimated productivity loss is also caused by differences in research methods. Publications should provide enough information to enable readers to assess the quality and relevance of the study for their purposes.
