Death outcome of dengue infection were mainly involved in pediatric patients with severe plasma leakage, or shock. No biomarker was addressed in the early stage of disease course for timely clinical management. Nineteen differentially expressed proteins were significantly detected in severe dengue patients with severe plasma leakage prior to the time of circulatory collapse occurrence. Angiotensinogen and antithrombin III level were verified to be significantly increased in early stage plasma of shock patients.
