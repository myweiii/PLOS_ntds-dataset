Leishmaniasis is an important neglected disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania and affects more than 12 million people worldwide. Pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B have been used for decades to treat leishmaniasis; however, these drugs result in numerous adverse side effects, have variable efficacy and are subject to parasite resistance. The lack of suitable therapy necessitates the development of novel antileishmanial compounds. In this study, we investigated the antileishmanial activity of apigenin in vitro and in vivo and described the mechanism of action against intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis. Apigenin reduced the infection index in a dose-dependent manner and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Additionally, apigenin induced an increase in the number of macrophages autophagosomes after the infection, surrounding the parasitophorous vacuole, suggestive of the involvement of host autophagy probably due to ROS generation induced by apigenin. Furthermore, treatment with apigenin was also effective in vivo, showing oral bioavailability and significantly reducing lesion sizes and parasite burden without altering serological toxicity markers.
