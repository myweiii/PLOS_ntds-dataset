Leptospirosis is a common tropical illness that results from exposure to the urine of animals infected with Leptospira bacteria. Because leptospirosis shares signs and symptoms with other common tropical illnesses such as dengue, identification of patients with leptospirosis can be challenging. Early identification of patients with leptospirosis is necessary to initiate antibiotic therapy and in some cases provide in-hospital management. During an epidemic of leptospirosis in Puerto Rico that occurred during a concomitant dengue epidemic, we identified leptospirosis patients by screening specimens from suspected dengue patients. Of 175 leptospirosis patients identified, 26 (15%) died. After comparing leptospirosis patients that died to patients of a similar age that were hospitalized but survived, we observed that fatal cases were more often sent home after their first medical visit. We next identified several routinely available laboratory values from patientsâ€™ first medical visit that were associated with patients that died. Clinicians can use such laboratory values to diagnose and hospitalize leptospirosis patients at increased risk for fatal outcome.
