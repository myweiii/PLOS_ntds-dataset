Organisms belonging to the species Salmonella enterica are a major cause of infection globally. Such infections can be zoonotic in origin or transmitted between humans. One of the most notable features of the genus Salmonella is that the dominant serovars that cause human infections change over time, with new threats periodically emerging. These trends often go unnoticed and are underreported in low-income locations. There is good evidence that Salmonella Weltevreden is emerging (particularly in low-income countries in the tropics) as a significant cause of diarrhea and sometimes invasive bacterial disease in humans. However, little is known about the phylogenetic structure or virulence potential of this unstudied serovar. Here, we provide a detailed phylogenetic analysis of S. Weltevreden through whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools. We identify that specific phylogenetic clusters are associated with geographical regions, providing novel data regarding the global distribution of different clades and high quality reference genomes to facilitate future work. We additionally show that S. Weltevreden has a distinct virulence-associated phenotype in conventional laboratory Salmonella pathogenicity assays that will guide future investigations on this serovar.
