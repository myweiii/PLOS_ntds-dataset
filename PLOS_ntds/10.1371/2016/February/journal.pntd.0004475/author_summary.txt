The 2013â€“15 Ebola outbreak has been much larger and lasted longer than any previous Ebola emergence, and is further unusual because of the thousands of survivors left behind. In 2014 the World Health Organization stated that lack of evidence made it impossible to give confident guidance about which body fluids of Ebola patients or survivors are infectious. This review summarises published evidence on presence of Ebola and the closely related Marburg virus (filoviruses) in body fluids of infected people and survivors though end July 2015. Scientific and other reports were searched for tests to detect filovirus in human body fluids on otherwise confirmed cases. 33 reports had relevant test results. Blood products were confirmed as likely to be highly infectious among actively ill cases. In actively ill patients, filovirus was often found in non-blood body fluids. However, (apart from in semen), it is rare for viable virus to be found in survivors. It is not apparent how relatively infectious most body fluids are, due to inconsistencies in testing techniques and lack of data about how much virus is present at different points of illness and recovery.
