Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease prevalent in tropical climates, especially Africa. To control morbidity and eventually eliminate the disease, the World Health Organisation recommends that populations living in endemic areas be preventively treated with praziquantel. This means hundreds of million treatments over time, which calls for careful monitoring of drug efficacy. Meta-analyses of aggregated data from clinical trials support this policy, but conclusions are limited because studies use diverse methodologies, and detailed analyses (e.g. by age-groups) are not possible. Access to primary data generated by trials would strengthen the evidence and allow answering key questions, such as what the optimum paediatric dose is. This review assesses the number of trials conducted on antischistosomal drugs and their characteristics (where studies were conducted, in which population, what drug(s)/dose(s) were administered, and the methodologies applied), to determine the merit and scope of a common database of antischistosomal efficacy data.
