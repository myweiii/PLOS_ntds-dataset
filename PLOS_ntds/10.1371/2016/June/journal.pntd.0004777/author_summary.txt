Human onchocerciasis (also known as ‘River Blindness’) is a parasitic disease of the skin and eyes whose etiological agent (Onchocerca volvulus) is transmitted by black flies. Guatemala was the country in the Americas most afflicted by onchocerciasis, and the largest focus of onchocerciasis in Guatemala was the Central Endemic Zone (CEZ). In the late 1980’s the Guatemalan ministry of health launched an onchocerciasis transmission elimination program based on mass drug administration (MDA) with the medicine ivermectin (Mectizan) in affected communities. Health education messages based on community knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys were designed to enhance understanding and sustain participation in the MDA program. The first KAP survey (published 1991) recommended the elements of the health education program. The second KAP survey (published 1995) identified barriers preventing the achievement of adequate treatment coverage, and recommended adjustments to program activities to improve participation. This third KAP survey was conducted in 2014, almost 3 years after cessation of the MDA program. Results indicated that many respondents wanted ivermectin MDA to continue in their community because of uncertainty about onchocerciasis elimination, or in order to treat intestinal worms. The ministry of health outreach services should be prepared to address ongoing concerns of the populations residing in post endemic, post MDA onchocerciasis Guatemala.
