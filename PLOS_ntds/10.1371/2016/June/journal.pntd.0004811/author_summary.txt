Transmission is an essential aspect in the life cycle of obligate pathogens, and the ability of a pathogen to be transmitted while simultaneously limiting the chances for other pathogens of the same species could provide an important selective advantage. One mechanism whereby a pathogen could accomplish this is by co-opting its host’s immune response to prevent super-infecting pathogens from becoming established, thus effectively gaining exclusive transmission rights from that host. Several pathogen species have evolved the ability to persist indefinitely within their hosts despite the host’s acquisition of protective immunity against subsequent infection by that pathogen, a condition known as concomitant immunity. We asked whether ‘exclusivity’ was a force underlying the evolution of concomitant immunity using the protozoan parasite Leishmania major as a model. Using genetically marked parasite lines derived from the same Leishmania strain, we show that prior infection does not prevent the entry and survival of subsequently infecting parasites, even though the pathology induced by the secondary infections was markedly reduced. Thus, while persistent Leishmania parasites may vaccinate their hosts against pathology, they do not confer protection against superinfection. This finding has important consequences to the maintenance and generation of Leishmania genetic diversity, especially through sexual processes.
