Lung fungal infections are caused by pathogens inhaled as spores which convert into invasive yeast forms in the lungs. This type of infection can spread to other sites in the body through the blood and lymphatic systems, sometimes leading to ulcerations and skin lesions. The drug of choice for treatment is Amphotericin B (AmB). AmB is a typical polyene with broad-spectrum antifungal activity that encounters some use limitations because of its side effects. We developed a magnetic carrier nanocomplex comprising of amphotericin B loaded onto the surface of magnetite nanoparticles pre-coated with a double-layer of lauric acid. We evaluated this approach for its antifungal activity against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (strain Pb18) and its cytotoxicity in mammalian cell culture. We found that this nanocomplex exhibited antifungal activity without cytotoxicity to human urinary cells and low cytotoxicity to peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, the nanocomplex did not induce genotoxic effects in bone marrow cells and was effective against experimental paracoccidioidomycosis without inducing clinical, biochemical or histopathological alterations.
