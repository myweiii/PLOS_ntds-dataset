Aedes aegpyti is one of the most important vectors of yellow fever and dengue fever. Pyrethroid insecticides are emerging as the predominant insecticides for vector control, and resistance of vector mosquitoes to pyrethroid is a major problem for the vector control program. Several mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel were reported to play important roles in pyrethroid resistance of Aedes aegypti. Recently, a novel F1534C mutation was reported to be strongly correlated with resistance to DDT and pyrethroid. We observed a high resistance to DDT and moderate resistance to permethrin in both Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) and Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf) colonies collected in Ghana. Concurrently, high frequencies of F1534C mutations were found in the above mosquito colonies, and this was its first detection on the African continent. We found a strong linkage of F1534C mutation and the introns between exon 20 and 21 commonly found in South East Asian and South and Central American countries. The DDT and pyrethroid resistance in Ghanaian Ae. aegypti population was suggested to be caused by the introgression of Aaa genes from the above area.
