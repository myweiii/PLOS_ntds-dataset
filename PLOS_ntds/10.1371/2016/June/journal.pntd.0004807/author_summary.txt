Here we assessed the host, vector, and parasite factors for membrane feeding assay using Plasmodium vivax and Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes and samples from endemic regions of Colombia. This membrane feeding assay method allowed more efficient assessment of the presence of TB activity in sera of individuals from malaria endemic regions as well as in sera of immunized animals and humans. This method can contribute to better assess the TB immune responses elicited by natural infection as well as further evaluation of protective efficacy of malaria TB vaccines.
