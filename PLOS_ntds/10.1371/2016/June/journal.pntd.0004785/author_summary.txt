Typhoid fever is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. The disease is generally restricted to those living in low-income settings with poor sanitation. Typhoid fever is a common cause of fever requiring hospital treatment in Cambodia, but limited data is available on the epidemiology of the disease. To better understand typhoid fever in Cambodia, we accessed routine hospital data for typhoid fever from a single healthcare facility treating sick children in Siem Reap in the central Cambodia between 2007 and 2014. We mapped the location of these cases and examined population-based risk factors for reported disease. Additionally, we decoded the genomes of the S. Typhi isolated from children attending the hospital to understand how the organism has evolved and spread throughout the population. We found a large burden of typhoid fever in children in this largely rural setting in central Cambodia. We also found that disease was associated with the rainy season and that living close to Tonle Sap Lake increased the risk of disease. The genomes of the sequenced bacteria showed that a diverse range of strains were circulating during the study, and allowed us to identify signatures of location- and time-specific outbreaks. Our work provides baseline data for additional typhoid fever studies in the population living in this location and findings suggest that rural Cambodia would be a suitable setting in which to introduce a school-based vaccination program with new typhoid vaccines.
