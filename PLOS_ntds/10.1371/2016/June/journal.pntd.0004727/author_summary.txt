Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects at least 33 million people, most of who live in low-resource environments. RHD is a cumulative process and there exists a latent period between early valve damage and presentation with symptoms. Echocardiographic screening (ultrasound of the heart) has proven highly sensitive for latent RHD detection, but implementation research is needed to effectively develop sustainable public health strategies. Critical to this research is determining whom to screen. As family members have both a shared environment and shared genetic susceptibility, they may represent a high-risk group that could be targeted once a case of RHD is identified. We conducted an echocardiographic family screening study to determine the risk of RHD in families with and without an RHD positive child and found that siblings of children with latent RHD are more likely to have latent RHD themselves. Our data suggest that siblings may represent a particularly high-risk group that could be targeted for echocardiographic screening. Future studies are needed to answer questions of how RHD screening can best be integrated into existing healthcare structures, ensuring practical and sustainable RHD screening programs.
