Predicting the course of infectious disease outbreaks in real-time is a challenging task. It requires knowledge of the particular disease system as well as a pipeline that can turn raw data from a public health surveillance system into calibrated predictions of disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that places an immense public health and economic burden upon countries around the world, especially in tropical areas. In 2014 our research team, a collaboration of the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and academic researchers from the United States, implemented a system for generating real-time forecasts of dengue hemorrhagic fever based on the disease surveillance reports from Thailand. We compared predictions from several different statistical models, identifying locations and times where our predictions were accurate. We also quantified the extent to which delayed reporting of cases in real-time impacted our predictions. Broadly speaking, improving real-time predictions can enable more targeted, timely interventions and risk communication, both of which have a measurable impact on disease spread in epidemic and pandemic scenarios. It is vital that we continue to build knowledge about the best ways to make these forecasts and integrate them into public health decision making.
