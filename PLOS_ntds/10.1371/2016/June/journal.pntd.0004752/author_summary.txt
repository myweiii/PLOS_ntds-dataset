Progressive scarring of the conjunctiva in individuals with trachoma causes the eyelids to contract, drawing the eyelashes inwards (trichiasis) so that they scratch the cornea, causing pain and eventually blindness. Disease is initiated in childhood by repeated conjunctival infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), however, infection is not commonly found in adults, yet chronic inflammation and fibrosis progress throughout the lives of many individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms driving inflammation and fibrosis are required in order to develop treatments to halt disease progression. The tissue expression and localization of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth and matrix factors were investigated in eyelid tissue from 20 individuals with trichiasis and from 16 control individuals. By staining tissue sections with dyes and specific antibodies, pro-inflammatory signaling molecules IL-1β and S100A7 and pro-fibrotic growth factor CTGF were found to be more highly expressed in individuals with trichiasis. CTGF and S100A7 were highly expressed in the epithelium; the outermost layer of the conjunctiva, whereas IL-1β was more highly expressed deeper in the tissue, where scarring occurs. Numerous inflammatory cells were found in the tissue of trichiasis patients even in the absence of clinically apparent inflammation. Future research should seek to describe a causative mechanism linking these factors.
