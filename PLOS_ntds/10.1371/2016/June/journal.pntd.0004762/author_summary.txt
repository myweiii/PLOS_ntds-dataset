The tropical mosquito Aedes albopictus is a vector for several viruses that can be transmitted to human hosts through infectious bites. In the last 20 years, Aedes albopictus has rapidly expanded its habitat to temperate climates and it is now widespread in a large part of southern Europe and the United States. Here, it may cause outbreaks of local transmission of exotic diseases, such as chikungunya and dengue, after the arrival of infected patients through international travels. In this study, we estimate Ae. albopictus abundance in a subalpine region of Italy, by means of a mathematical model calibrated to data from adult mosquito captures throughout 2014; we then proceed to estimate the probability that an outbreak of local transmission of chikungunya and dengue will occur, following the importation from abroad of a single infectious case at different times in the year. These estimates are useful for planning preventive actions, such as programs of vector population control, as well as for increasing the preparedness of public health authorities in responding to an outbreak.
