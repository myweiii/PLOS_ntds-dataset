Handheld light microscopes are new technologies that may be helpful in enabling better access to diagnostic testing for people living in resource-constrained settings in tropical and subtropical countries. Recent studies evaluating the accuracy of such devices have focused on their use by expert microscopists and were mainly conducted in laboratories. We evaluated the operating performance of two handheld microscopes (Newton Nm1 microscope and clip-on version of the reversed-lens CellScope) in comparison to conventional microscopy for the diagnosis of urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis, when integrated into routine use in a community-based survey carried out in Côte d’Ivoire. Additionally, we evaluated the same microscopist’s diagnostic performance with the Newton Nm1 microscope for intestinal protozoa in a laboratory set-up. The Newton Nm1 microscope demonstrated excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for schistosomiasis and intestinal protozoa. The CellScope had high specificity but only modest sensitivity for schistosomiasis diagnosis. Taken together, handheld diagnostic tools show promise to improve the quality of clinical and public health care delivered in resource-constrained settings.
