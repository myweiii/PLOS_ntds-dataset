The authors thank the Direction de l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement (DEAL Reunion) for issuing permits, the Office National des Forêts (ONF), the Parc National de La Reunion and the Réserve Naturelle Nationale de l’Etang St Paul, which gave authorization for the trapping of Tenrec ecaudatus (DIR/I/2013/008) and allowed us to sample inside protected areas. We also acknowledge Jean-Paul Dussud from Services Vétérinaires de La Réunion for providing cow samples, and CIREST and intercommunal pound of St André for allowing the dog sampling. We thank Amélie Desvars for providing four cow samples collected in 2009 during her PhD and Jean-Sébastien Dehecq for providing Reunion Island maps.
