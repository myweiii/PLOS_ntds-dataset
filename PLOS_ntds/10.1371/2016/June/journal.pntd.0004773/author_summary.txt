Chikungunya is a viral disease primarily characterized by high fever and joint pain. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by infected Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitos. Although chikungunya was first described in 1952 and CHIKV has circulated in parts of Africa and Asia, since then, it was not introduced into the Americas until late 2013. Chikungunya poses a threat in tropical countries where the vector mosquitoes reside and in particular in CHIKV-naïve populations. In this study, we aimed to explore the dissemination of CHIKV through the first epidemic in Nicaragua and evaluate possible factors associated with infection. By analyzing the sera of two study populations, pediatric (2–14 years old) and ≥15 years participants, for anti-CHIKV antibodies, we determined who was infected during the first outbreak in Nicaragua. The seroprevalence of anti-CHIKV antibodies in the pediatric and ≥15 year-old study populations was 6.1% and 13.1%, respectively. Furthermore, using a demographic/household survey, we found that age, water availability, household size, and socioeconomic status were associated with CHIKV seropositivity. In conclusion, this study indicates the level of protective immunity the population has developed and can help government institutions develop intervention strategies.
