Scrub Typhus is a common and potentially severe febrile illness in certain tropical regions in Asia. This infection is treatable with specific antibiotics if diagnosed correctly, but there is no effective vaccine available at present. The bacterium causing this disease is called Orientia tsutsugamushi; it is transmitted by small mites and it has variable surface proteins, which make diagnosis and vaccine development difficult. In this study, we tested how well the antibodies in the blood of patients with scrub typhus recognise different strains of bacteria, and used these results to create a map of the relationships between the bacteria and sera. From examining this map we can see that some sera have activity against a wider range of bacteria than others. These methods and findings will help with selecting bacteria strains and evaluating immune responses, which will potentially help us to improve diagnosis and vaccine development.
