Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease which is common in tropical countries, and spreads via contaminated rat urine. It has a potential for mortality and can cause failure of multiple body systems. The features of the disease mimics several other tropical diseases prevalent in the region. The modalities for laboratory confirmation of the disease are not readily available in resource limited settings. This study utilizes prospective data and proposes diagnostic criteria using simple clinical presentations and easily accessible laboratory data.
