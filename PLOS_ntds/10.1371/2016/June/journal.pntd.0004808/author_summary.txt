Mycolactones A/B (also simply referred to as mycolactone) are macrolide exotoxins produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the neglected tropical skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). The potent cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities of mycolactones lead to severe destruction of the subcutaneous fat tissue with minimal inflammation in the core of the lesion. Due to the lipid-like nature of mycolactones, the production of antibodies against these molecules has so far been unsuccessful. By using the classical approach of fusing immortal cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with a protein conjugate of a truncated non-toxic synthetic mycolactone, we were able to generate hybridoma cells producing mycolactone-specific monoclonal antibodies. Mammalian cell-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that these antibodies have neutralizing activity and can fully block the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone, resulting in survival of the target cells. These findings support the concept to target mycolactone by a vaccine. Furthermore, the anti-mycolactone antibodies may represent useful tools for BU diagnostics development.
