Histoplasmosis is a potentially severe fungal disease of mammals caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The highest incidence of the disease is reported on the American continent, and approximately 30% of HIV and histoplasmosis co-infections are fatal. Previous studies have suggested at least 7 phylogenetic species within H. capsulatum, however by increasing taxon sampling and using different phylogenetic and population genetic methods, we detect at least 5 additional phylogenetic species within Latin America (LAm A1, LAm A2, LAm B1, LAm B2, RJ and BAC-1). These phylogenetic species are nested in the former LAm A clade. We found evidence that bats may be a cause of speciation in Histoplasma, as well-supported monophyletic clades were found in association with different species of bats. The radiation of the Latin American H. capsulatum species took a place around 5 million years ago, which is consistent with the radiation and diversification of bat species. Previous phylogenetic distribution of Histoplasma is upheld and strong support is indicated for the species delineation and evolution of this important pathogen.
