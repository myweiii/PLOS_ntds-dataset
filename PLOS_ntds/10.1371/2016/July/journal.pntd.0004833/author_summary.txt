With 40% of the world’s population at risk of infection, dengue imposes a significant public health burden. Yet estimates of baseline transmission intensity are still sparse, making it difficult to implement efficient control programs. The authors used incidence data, which are abundant compared to seroprevalence data, to estimate dengue transmission intensity in 13 countries. Estimates derived from incidence data were comparable to those from seroprevalence data, an important conclusion for areas where seroprevalence data are not available. Additionally, the estimated baseline reporting rates and the contribution of primary to tertiary/quaternary infections to observed disease in each country will help to highlight potential weaknesses in the country or region’s surveillance system.
