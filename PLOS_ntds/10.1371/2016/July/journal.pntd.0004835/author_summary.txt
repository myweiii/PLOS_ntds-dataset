In this study, 8786 pediatric (0-15years old) cutaneous leishmaniasis (PCL) patients were retrospectively evaluated for the epidemiological and clinical characteristics. From the records of PCL patients, we focused on the patients' age, gender, lesion type and location, diameter, number and duration of the lesions, and the treatment given. Of the patients, 4050 (46·1%) were males and 4736 (53·90%) were females, with a mean age of 7·52 years (range 0–15 years). Mean lesion diameter was 12·77±0·11 mm (range 1-100mm), while the average lesion duration and the number of lesions was 8·58±0·21 weeks and 1·76±0·01, respectively. The area most involved in the lesions of PCL patients was the head and neck region at a rate of 32·55% (n = 2230). The most (78·79%) of the PCL patients who received intralesional pentavalent antimonial therapy responded to the first cycle of treatment. It was observed that the PCL patients who applied systemic pentavalent antimonial therapy, resistant to intralesional pentavalent antimonial therapy, were completely recovered. We believe that this study will contribute to clinicians to evaluate the clinical features and therapy choice of pediatric CL patients.
