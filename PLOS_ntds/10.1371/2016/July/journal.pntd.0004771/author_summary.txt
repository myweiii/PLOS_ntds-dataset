Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by a parasite transmitted to the host by the bite of an infected sand fly. Sand fly saliva contains biologically active components that allow the sand fly to take a blood meal and also the parasite to spread in the host by countering the host immune mechanisms that fights the parasite. Research on sand fly saliva has allowed us to understand the biological functions of some of these proteins, to identify salivary proteins producing an immune response in different hosts and to select potential salivary vaccine that could be used to protect the host against the parasite. However, vectors transmitting different species of Leishmania in diverse regions of the world are still neglected. The present work focuses on the identification of the secreted proteins from the saliva of B. olmeca, a vector of Leishmania mexicana in North and Central America. We catalogued these proteins with those previously identified in other sand fly species from Old and New World. We showed here how conserved or divergent are these proteins families when comparing different sand fly species. We also report the anti-Factor Xa activity of Lofaxin, a salivary anticoagulant protein identified in the saliva of this sand fly species.
