Rickettsia africae is a bacterium mainly vectored by Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus species of ticks. It is the etiological agent of African tick bite fever (ATBF), a spotted fever rickettsiosis that presents as an acute febrile illness characterized by petecheal skin hemorrhages, from which the name is derived. This bacterium is probably the most important in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, in terms of incidence and prevalence. This notwithstanding, the disease is poorly understood and is often mistreated as malaria, and therefore qualifies as a highly neglected disease. This study examined the genetic relationships of R. africae collected from diverse eco-regions of Kenya. We present data that indicate high genetic diversity in Kenyaâ€™s R. africae and corroborate a recent study that reported similar genetic diversity in R. africae samples collected from a localized area in western Kenya. Importantly, we describe a divergent lineage and propose the name Candidatus Rickettsia moyalensis.
