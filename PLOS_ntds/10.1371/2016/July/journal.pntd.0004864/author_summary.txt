The nematode Anisakis spp. is a parasite of marine mammals that can parasitize humans when a raw or undercooked fish containing live Anisakis spp. larvae is consumed. As a result, gastrointestinal and/or allergic symptoms are reported. The allergic reaction can be diagnosed by quantifying the serum specific IgE against some parasite allergens. To avoid the appearance of symptoms, sensitized patients are advised to consume frozen or heat-treated fishery products because these treatments kill larvae to prevent new parasitism and allergic reactions. We have analysed the changes in Anisakis spp.-specific IgE levels through repeated measures during a long follow-up period of sensitized individuals whose diets did not include fishery products and subjects who regularly consumed fishery products. We have found that IgE sensitization to Anisakis spp. allergens persists over several years (more than 8 years in some cases) even in subjects who did not include fishery products into their diets. On the other hand, specific IgE titres increase in some allergic patients during the follow-up period and this increase was coincident with the introduction of previously frozen fish into their diet. These findings indicate that Anisakis spp. allergens induce long-lived IgE responses.
