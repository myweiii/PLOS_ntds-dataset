The parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia frequently cause diarrhea in children worldwide. They can be transmitted from animals to humans and between humans, either through direct contact, from sewage, or by contamination of food and water. The importance of these infections in Cambodian children is unknown. Animals are an essential part of life in Southeast Asia with livestock as well as domestic animals living in close proximity to humans. We previously conducted a prospective study to determine the intestinal parasites causing disease in symptomatic children attending hospital in Siem Reap, Northwestern Cambodia. This study examines these two parasites in more detail using molecular methods which provide better detection and are more discriminating. We were able to determine the different”strains” of Cryptosporidium and Giardia and, along with risk factor data, concluded that most of the infections were spread between people or within households suggesting that public health programmes should concentrate on improved sanitation, community handwashing initiatives and better food and water hygiene practices.
