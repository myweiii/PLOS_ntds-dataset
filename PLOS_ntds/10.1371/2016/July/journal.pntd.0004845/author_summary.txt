Nematodes within the genus Anisakis (i.e. A. simplex and A. pegreffii, also known as herring worms) are the causative agents of the fish-borne gastrointestinal illness known as ‘anisakiasis’, with infections resulting in symptoms ranging from mild gastric forms to severe allergic reactions leading to urticaria, gastrointestinal and/or respiratory signs and/or anaphylaxis (‘allergic anisakiasis’). Despite significant advances in knowledge of the pathobiology of allergic anisakiasis, thus far, the exact number and nature of parasite molecules acting as potential allergens are currently unknown; filling this gap is necessary to the development of robust and reliable diagnostics for allergic anisakiasis which, in turn, underpins the implementation of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we use RNA-Seq and bioinformatics to sequence and annotate the transcriptomes of A. simplex and A. pegreffii, and, as an example application of these resources, mine this data to identify and characterise putative novel parasite allergens based on comparisons with known allergen sequence data from other parasites and other organisms.
