Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans causes the debilitating skin disease Buruli ulcer. Until today, transmission pathways and reservoirs of this emerging pathogen are not well understood. Generally, it is assumed that infection occurs after contact with potential environmental sources of M. ulcerans through puncture wounds or lacerations or via invertebrate vectors, such as aquatic insects contaminated with the bacteria. Comparative genome analyses of M. ulcerans strains isolated from patients living in the same BU endemic areas have revealed a close relationship between the genotype detected and the geographical origin, indicating that the reservoir of the pathogen is relatively fixed in space. In the present study, we report the co-circulation of two distinct M. ulcerans clonal complexes in the same BU endemic area over space and time. Since members of these two clonal complexes were closely related to strains from either the Densu river valley or the Asante Akim North district of Ghana, we conclude that a mobile reservoir of M. ulcerans may be involved in the occasional spread of the bacteria across different regions.
