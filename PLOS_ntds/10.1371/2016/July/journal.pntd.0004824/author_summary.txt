Rabies is a devastating disease that is estimated to result in the death of approximately 60,000 people every year. Most humans contract rabies following a bite from an infected dog and it has been demonstrated that provided a large enough proportion of the dog population is vaccinated; rabies incidence can be markedly reduced in both humans and dogs. However, few studies have described the vaccination of large numbers of dogs in a short period. An increasing incidence of childhood rabies has been reported in Blantyre, Malawi’s second largest city, over the past decade. This study reports the development and implementation of a mass canine rabies vaccination campaign which used a combined approach of static point and door-to-door vaccination strategies. 23,442 dogs were vaccinated at static point stations and 11,774 dogs were vaccinated during door-to-door vaccination during 20 working days of vaccination. Post vaccination surveys revealed vaccine coverage of 79.3% (95% CI 78.6–80.1). This study, through the unique approach of using novel mobile technology and two vaccination strategies, demonstrates the feasibility of vaccinating over 35,000 dogs within a one month period in an African city where rabies has a high prevalence in the human population.
