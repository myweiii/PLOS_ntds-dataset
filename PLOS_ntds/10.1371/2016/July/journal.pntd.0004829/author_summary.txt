Onchocerciasis or “river blindness” is a chronic parasitic disease which is mainly found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Onchocerciasis is endemic in both mainland and insular Equatorial Guinea. Huge achievements have been made on onchocerciasis control in Bioko Island in the last years, and the country is moving fast towards elimination. In the new elimination context, monitoring and evaluation activities with more sensitive diagnostic tools become especially necessary in order to confirm that transmission has been interrupted. Previous data on the epidemiological situation of onchocerciasis in Bioko Island are mainly based on microfilaria (MF) skin snip assessments. We aim to create evidence towards the fact that onchocerciasis transmission might have been achieved in Bioko Island after more than sixteen years of onchocerciasis control activities by using molecular and serological technics for onchocerciasis diagnosis.
