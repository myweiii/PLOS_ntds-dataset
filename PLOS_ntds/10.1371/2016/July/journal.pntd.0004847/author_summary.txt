Melioidosis is a potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Since the clinical presentations of melioidosis are extremely variable and no specific signs or symptoms exist, early laboratory-based diagnosis is highly desirable to start appropriate antibiotics. Routine methods for culture detection of B. pseudomallei are highly specific but take several days for a result, and depending on the clinical sample and other factors, sensitivity can be low. The standard serology test for melioidosis is an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) based on crude B. pseudomallei antigen preparations. Due to the variable prevalence of background seropositivity in endemic areas and the low diagnostic sensitivity of the IHA upon admission, the test is currently not recommended for the diagnosis of melioidosis, but still widely used. Thus, we generated a protein array containing 20 B. pseudomallei antigens previously shown to have serodiagnostic potential. Our array allows highly specific and sensitive antibody recognition in blood sera and plasmas from patients with melioidosis. The standardized microarray device is simple to use and fast, and is thus applicable in a routine diagnostic laboratory. In this study, the multiplex testing of antibodies in melioidosis sera from different time points after admission allowed the detection of short- and long-term antibodies to various antigens. Further studies will examine the potential role of those antibodies to discriminate different stages of the disease. Furthermore, the protein microarray might be useful in studies aimed at elucidating the exposure of humans and animals to B. pseudomallei in different parts of the world.
