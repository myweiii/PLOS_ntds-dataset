Plasmodium vivax has a tremendous impact on public health; accounting for 13.8 million cases of clinical illness estimated in 2015, causing a wide spectrum of symptoms including severe disease. Development of new therapies requires a better understanding of the parasite’s biology, however, understanding the fundamental biological properties of P. vivax is challenging as there currently is no robust in vitro blood-stage culture system available. Unfortunately, this lack of understanding of the parasite’s basic biology, especially understanding the main variables that control blood-stage development such as nutrient-dependence, preferred host cell age, and successful in vitro format, is a major hurdle to the establishment of long-term in vitro P. vivax culture that is needed for basic and clinical research. In our present study, we used the P. vivax primate-adapted strain, Sal-1, obtained from Aotus lemurinus lemurinus, and investigated a set of the variables that control blood-stage development described in the literature. We specifically focused on addressing important parameters: host cell invasion, maturation within the invaded host cell, and egress and re-invasion into new host cells. All of which are critical for robust blood-stage growth and development.
