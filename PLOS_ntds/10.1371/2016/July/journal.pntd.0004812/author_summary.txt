Rabies is an infectious disease of humans and other mammals caused by lyssaviruses. It has one of the highest mortality rates of any infectious disease. Rabies has been known since Antiquity, but it continues to cause approximately 59,000 human deaths per year, particularly in low-income areas in Asia and Africa, where it is still a neglected disease. In these regions, rabies surveillance remains limited, leading to considerable underreporting of rabies cases in humans and animals. One of the principal obstacles to effective surveillance is the difficulty confirming human rabies cases. Clinical diagnosis remains challenging, so all cases must be confirmed by laboratory tests. We describe here the development and validation of a molecular diagnostic tool for lyssavirus infection based on the detection of viral RNA. We evaluated this technique against one of the largest panels of biological samples from animals and humans ever assembled. It was found to be useful and practicable in national reference centers in enzootic regions.
