Human strongyloidiasis, a soil-transmitted infection mainly caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, is one of the most neglected among the so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The difficult diagnosis lead to an underreporting of infection rates. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because many infections remain asymptomatic and the lack of sensitivity of the conventional fecal-based techniques for morphologically identification of infective larvae in feces. Although serologic tests are useful, a limitation in standardization to avoid cross-reactions still remains. There is an urgent need to improve more sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly in immunocompromised patients or candidates to immunosuppressive treatments. Several molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have already been assayed, but they have a very limited use in routine diagnostic, particularly in endemic areas. In addition, all molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have always been mainly assayed for stool samples and no other more advantageous biological samples, such as urine, have been investigated for molecular purposes. In this study we have developed, for the first time, a molecular assay using LAMP methodology as a simple, sensible and robust method for the detection of S. venezuelensis DNA in a well-established Wistar rats experimental infection in both stool and urine samples. The LAMP assay was also successfully evaluated in patientsÂ´ stool samples. Our LAMP assay (Strong-LAMP) is an useful molecular tool in a strongyloidiasis experimental infection model and could be a potential field-friendly diagnostic test in a clinical setting, following further validation.
