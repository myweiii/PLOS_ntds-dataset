In some regions in Africa, elimination of onchocerciasis may be possible with mass drug administration, although there is concern based on several factors that onchocerciasis cannot be eliminated solely through this approach. A vaccine against Onchocerca volvulus would provide a critical tool for the ultimate elimination of this infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that immunization of mice with two antigens induced protective immunity and it was hypothesized in the present study that the levels of protective immunity would be improved by formulation with other agents known to enhance immune responses. Protective immunity was observed in mice immunized with the two antigens using three different adjuvants. The vaccines developed in this study have the potential of reducing the morbidity associated with onchocerciasis in humans.
