Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms, contributing to morbidity and mortality in 261 million people, mainly in poor, rural communities. In an effort to control schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization advocates for regular mass treatment to at-risk populations, administering free praziquantel (40mg/kg). The WHO Tablet Pole, which estimates the number of tablets for each individual by height, is recommended for the dosing of praziquantel. A Modified Dose Pole with two additional height intervals has been developed for adults. In addition, the developers of the Modified Dose Pole suggest to add an extra tablet to the indicated dose if the person appears to be overweight/obese (“correction for body mass index (BMI)”). This study explored the accuracy of these dose pole programmes in 3157 school-girls in schistosomiasis-endemic KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Overweight or obesity was found in 35% of the study population. With the WHO Tablet Pole, only 73% would have received an acceptable dose (30-60mg/kg), whereas when correcting for overweight/obesity almost all the girls would have been adequately treated. We suggest adding one tablet to the dose recommended by the WHO Tablet Pole if a person appears to be overweight/obese to prevent under-dosing of these individuals.
