Cryptosporidium is a protozoan that causes diarrhea and malnutrition in young children in developing countries, and is associated with diarrhea cases and outbreaks in developed countries. To date, limited information exists on the burden of Cryptosporidium diarrheal disease in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where most diarrheal disease deaths occur. We estimated the burden of Cryptosporidium-diarrhea and associated deaths in these regions using data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS). Cryptosporidium was associated with diarrhea mainly in children aged <24 months. Infections began in the first few months of life but clinical episodes of Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea illness peaked at age 6â€“11 months. The annual number of Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhea episodes was estimated at 2.9 and 4.7 million in children aged <24 months in sub-Saharan Africa and in the India/Pakistan/Bangladesh/Afghanistan/Nepal region of South Asia, respectively. In both regions combined, Cryptosporidium is estimated to contribute to approximately 202,000 deaths per year, and to ~59,000 more deaths in Cryptosporidium-attributable cases than if those cases had been negative for Cryptosporidium. Our study highlights the enormous burden attributable to Cryptosporidium in Africa and Asia, which underscores the need for developing vaccines and treatments to reduce this burden.
