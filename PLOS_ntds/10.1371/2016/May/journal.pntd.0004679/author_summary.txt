Cholera burden in Africa remains unknown, often because of weak national surveillance systems. Reporting is non-exhaustive for various reasons, such as individual and community fears of stigmatization and economic loss. Furthermore, only 3% to 5% of all cases are laboratory confirmed. A variety of case definitions are used across countries, which could lead to cholera over or under-reporting. Our study presents the first data from prospective multi-country cholera surveillance in Africa, and the only such data based on culture confirmation and that includes a description of clinical presentation. We show how confirmed cholera cases varied over time by setting, and identified three epidemiological patterns that can guide decision-making processes. We documented that reliance on suspected cases–as is usually done in national surveillance–rather than confirmed cases can over-estimate substantially cholera incidence. Finally, our surveillance strategy of using case-based reporting and a standard comprehensive case reporting form provided more information on at-risk populations and geographical hot spots than is currently available in the literature; this is turn should facilitate development of efficient preventive strategies.
