The fluctuations of multi-serotype infectious diseases are often highly irregular and hard to predict. Previous theoretical approaches have attempted to disentangle the drivers that may underlie this behaviour in dengue dynamics with variable success. Here, we examine the role of such drivers using a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach. In POM, multiple patterns observed at different scales are used to test a modelâ€™s proficiency in capturing real-world dynamics. We examined dengue models with combinations of cross-immunity, cross-enhancement, seasonal fluctuations in the transmission rate, and with sensitivity analyses of asymmetric transmission rates between serotypes as well as the possibility for four subsequent heterologous infections. We demonstrate the ability of POM to model dynamical drivers that have gone unnoticed in single pattern or synthetic likelihood approaches. Further, our results present a determining role of seasonality in the selection and operation of these processes in governing dengue dynamics, in particular when full, heterologous immunity is assumed to occur after a secondary infection. We show that this structural model uncertainty can have important practical significance, as demonstrated by the differences in control efforts required to disrupt transmission. These results highlight the importance of localised model selection and calibration using multiple data-matching, as well as taking explicit account of model uncertainty in predicting and planning control efforts for multi-serotype diseases.
