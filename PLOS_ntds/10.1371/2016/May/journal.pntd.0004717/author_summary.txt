West Nile virus (WNV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) is a mosquito-borne virus maintained in a bird-mosquito enzootic cycle. WNV can occasionally infect other animals and humans, which are considered dead-end hosts because they produce too little virus in blood to re-infect mosquitoes. Most human infections (~80%) do not cause symptoms, and when symptoms do occur, they may vary from mild flu-like illness to fatal neuroinvasive disease (~1%). WNV can be transmitted by transfusion of blood and blood components and by organ transplantation, posing a risk to the blood supply and public health. There is no specific therapy or vaccine for WNV in humans. WNV now is one of the most widely distributed flaviviruses in the world. Comparative studies of WNV genetic sequences have described two major groupings of WNV, lineages I and II, and up to five newer lineages, which correlate well with the geographical point of isolation. Since 1999, WNV has spread from New York City throughout the U.S. and the Americas including Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean and South America. The emergence of WNV in the U.S. with annual outbreaks represents a unique opportunity to understand how a mosquito-borne virus adapts and evolves in a new environment. Viral adaptation to domestic mosquitoes and birds is considered to have played an important role in the spread of WNV in the U.S. Continuous surveillance of WNV genetic variation is needed to protect public health because the tests used to diagnose infection and screen blood, as well as vaccines and drug therapies currently in development, may not perform as well against newer genetic variants of WNV.
