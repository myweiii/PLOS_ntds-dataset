The disease visceral leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (LD). One of the hallmarks of the disease is immune suppression. The parasites replicate within the macrophages and dendritic cells, and such cells are known as antigen presenting cells (APCs). APCs present peptide to T-helper cells in association with the transplantation antigen-II (MHC-II). The infected macrophages show decrease in membrane cholesterol leading to increase in membrane fluidity. The membrane cholesterol is important for maintaining conformation of membrane proteins. Here we show that conformation of MHC-II protein is altered in parasitized macrophages, which results faster dissociation of peptide from peptide-MHC-II complex as compared to normal counterpart. The conformational change in MHC-II protein is also supported by molecular dynamic simulation studies, as there is considerable structural fluctuation of MHC-II peptide binding domain in presence and absence of cholesterol. This observation indicated that cholesterol is important for maintaining conformation of MHC-II protein and stability of the peptide-MHC complex. Thus, Leishmania parasites by modulating membrane cholesterol influence above processes leading to defective T-cell stimulation in leishmaniasis. The above defects displayed by infected macrophages could be corrected by liposomal delivery of cholesterol indicating a possible therapeutic role of liposomal cholesterol in infection.
