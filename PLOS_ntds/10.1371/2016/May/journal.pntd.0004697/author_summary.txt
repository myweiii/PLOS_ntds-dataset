Entamoeba histolytica is a prevalent human parasite requiring sensitive and specific detection. Assays available for Entamoeba detection utilize antibodies to detect parasite protein in stool, and they distinguish E. histolytica from nonpathogenic commensal amoeba. However, these tests have exhibited suboptimal sensitivity in some studies. This may have occurred because the tests do not detect the cyst stage of the parasite, which is more prevalent and stable in stool. Moreover, they cannot be used on formalin-fixed material, which creates logistical problems in some settings. Here, we have generated antibodies against a region of an E. histolytica cyst surface protein that has a unique sequence relative to nonpathogenic amoeba. One of these antibodies bound to E. histolytica cysts in fixed, xenic cultures without cross-reacting to nonpathogenic E. dispar and E. bangladeshi, while another antibody bound to both E. histolytica and E. dispar. The antibody that selectively bound to E. histolytica cysts also labeled cyst-like objects in fixed stool specimens from E. histolytica-positive patients. As they detected fixed organisms, these antibodies could ultimately make specimen collection and processing for Entamoeba diagnosis a simpler process. Additionally, this study indicates that the antibodiesâ€™ cyst protein target may be a useful biomarker for E. histolytica detection.
