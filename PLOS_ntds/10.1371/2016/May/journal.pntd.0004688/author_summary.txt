Fasciola hepatica is a parasite responsible for the zoonotic disease fasciolosis, prevalence of which has increased in recent years because of the emergence of triclabendazole-resistant strains as well as changing climatic conditions. A number of F. hepatica protein antigens are used for assessing the immune response of the definitive host for the development of recombinant vaccines but no such vaccine has been commercialised yet. Glycans that may contribute to the antigenic, immunological and protective properties in F. hepatica have not been characterised. Using a panel of plant lectins with defined sugar binding specificities alongside mass spectrometric analysis, we found that high mannose and oligomannose N-glycans are the most abundant in the surface of the juvenile fluke and identified eighteen proteins likely to be glycosylated. Additionally, we found that the proteases cathepsin B1 and L3 contain a glycosylation site occupied by an unusually short Man2GlcNAc2 N-glycan. This work is the starting point for understanding how F. hepatica glycans interact with the definitive host at the initiation of infection. Additionally, it provides useful information for including glycans in the design of new vaccine candidates.
