Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar, is a fatal form of leishmaniasis that is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. In the Indian sub-continent, the parasite is transmitted between people by the sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes. There are four different groups of infected people that can carry the parasite: active cases, cured cases, cases of post-kala azar dermal leishmanisis, and people with asymptomatic infections. The relative contribution of these different groups to sustaining the transmission cycle is not known. In the current work, we explore the feasibility of forensic DNA methods that could be applied to directly trace the human source of an infected blood meal in flies collected from high transmission areas. We report that a readable human DNA profile can be generated from the majority of sand flies so long as the flies are sampled within 24 hours after blood feeding. We developed a highly sensitive nested-PCR method that was able to detect parasites present in a fresh, 24 hour blood meal after feeding on an infected host.
