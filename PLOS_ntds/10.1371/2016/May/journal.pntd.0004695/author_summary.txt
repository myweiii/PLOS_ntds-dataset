A robust cell-based antiviral assay was developed that allows to screen for and validate novel inhibitors of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. The viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2â€™-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) was identified as a potent ZIKV inhibitor. A mouse model for ZIKV infections, which was validated for antiviral studies, demonstrated that 7DMA markedly delays virus-induced disease in this model.
