There are few data available on the natural history of electrocardiographic abnormalities among children with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Also, few studies analyzed the effect of benznidazole to prevent electrocardiographic abnormalities in this population. In the current study, electrocardiographic abnormalities were frequent among children with chronic T. cruzi infection. Results from the current study also suggest that treatment with benznidazole may not be associated with less electrocardiographic abnormalities. The current study highlights the need of further research to prevent cardiovascular manifestations associated with chronic T. cruzi infection.
