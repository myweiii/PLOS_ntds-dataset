Burkina Faso is a West African country endemic with soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH). Mass treatment with albendazole has been implemented for over a decade in the country through annual mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis for population aged five years and over, biennial treatment of school age children with albendazole together with schistosomiasis MDA, and biannual treatment of pre-school age children through Child Health Days. A sentinel site survey in 2013 showed that STH infection in Burkina Faso was very low at 1.3%. Hookworm was the main species detected, but infection was low and light. An assessment was also conducted with two age groups in Centre Nord region through lymphatic filariasis transmission assessment survey in 2014. The results confirmed the low level of infection with soil-transmitted helminths in the region. Through large-scale preventive chemotherapy, Burkina Faso has effectively controlled STH in school age children in the country. The future STH deworming strategy may focus on consolidating the gain and interrupting the STH transmission in the country.
