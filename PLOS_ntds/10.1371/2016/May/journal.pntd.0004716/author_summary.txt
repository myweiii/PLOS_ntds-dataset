Cutaneous forms of leishmaniasis are characterized by lesions that progress over months or years and that often leave permanent scars. Toll like receptors play an important role in the recognition and initiation of immune responses, and the intracellular TLR9, a sensor of pathogen double-stranded DNA, plays a crucial role in host resistance to Leishmania parasites. To achieve functionality, proteolytic enzymes, like cathepsins B, L, or S or asparagine endopeptidase, must cleave TLR9. Using mice deficient for different cathepsins, we demonstrate that these cathepsins do not seem to be individually involved in TLR9 processing. Interestingly we observed that Cathepsin B-deficient mice were more resistant to Leishmania major infection, meaning they resolve lesions and reduce parasite burdens faster than wild-type C57BL/6 mice. We found that this resistance is based on adaptive rather than innate immunity, with a central role of Cathepsin B-deficient T cells that contribute to faster controls of leishmania probably by higher IFNÎ³ production. Cathepsin B inhibitors were already shown to have favorable effect in leishmaniasis, but the mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. Our study highlights a new role for cathepsin B at the T cell level and provides new clues to how targeting this molecule is beneficial for treating leishmania infections.
