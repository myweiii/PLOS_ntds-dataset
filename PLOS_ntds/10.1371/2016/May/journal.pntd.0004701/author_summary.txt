In the Gambia tuberculosis is caused my two major lineages within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), M. tuberculosis lineages 4 and M. africanum lineage 6. Our analysis of 26 M. africanum- and 49 M. tuberculosis -HIV-negative tuberculosis patientsâ€™ clinic parameters and antigen-stimulated blood cytokines concentration and genes expression reveal that heterogeneous response to standard anti-tuberculosis treatment might depend on the diversity of MTBC lineages. Before treatment, the two groups of patients had similar clinical parameters, but greater improvement was observed in M. tuberculosis- compared to M. africanum -infected patients post-treatment. This was supported by higher production of inflammation-associated cytokines and genes in unstimulated blood samples from M. africanum-infected patients compared to those infected with M. tuberculosis, who instead had higher level of disease resolution cytokines. In contrast, there were lower cytokine responses in antigen-stimulated blood samples of M. africanum- compared to M. tuberculosis-infected patients post-treatment indicating a poorly recovered immune profile. Our results suggest that M. africanum patients respond relatively poorly to the standard anti-tuberculosis treatment or might have a pre-existing defective immune profile; this could explain why they succumb to less virulent mycobacteria.
