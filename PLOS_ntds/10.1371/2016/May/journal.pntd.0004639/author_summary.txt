Plasmodium vivax is now the predominant malaria parasite outside Africa. Because P. vivax can remain dormant in the liver for months, identifying and treating P. vivax in asymptomatic individuals is difficult. Additionally, current widely-used vector control measures are less efficient against mosquitoes that transmit P. vivax. An effective vaccine would therefore immensely facilitate P. vivax elimination. Unfortunately, little is known about P. vivax biology and only a few proteins have been investigated as targets for vaccine development. To address these knowledge gaps, we measured antibody levels to 34 entire ectodomain proteins predicted to be involved in P. vivax invasion of erythrocytes, in samples from individuals living in 2 malaria-endemic Asia-Pacific countries. We found that antibodies in malaria-exposed Solomon Islanders were reactive to the majority of proteins in our panel, and that antibodies to 12 of these proteins strongly reflected cumulative life-time exposure to P. vivax. In samples from Papua New Guinea children, we identified an association between antibodies to 3 proteins and protection against clinical malaria. Our results demonstrate that screening antibodies to a large number of P. vivax proteins is a useful approach in identifying novel targets of immunity. Functional studies are now required to establish whether these proteins are biomarkers of an individualâ€™s immune status, potential vaccine candidates that warrant further development, or both.
