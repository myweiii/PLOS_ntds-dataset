Since first being recognised in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) has mainly been associated with a mild illness with symptoms including a limited fever and rash. In 2007 the virus spread from Africa into French Polynesia and then onwards across Pacific regions and into South America. In these new regions, ZIKV has been associated with more severe clinical conditions including Gullain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. There are no currently approved antivirals or vaccines available with proven activity against ZIKV, and the World Health Organisation declared the spread of ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Here, we have used a mouse strain with a deficiency in the type-I interferon receptor (A129) and shown that these mice are susceptible to ZIKV infection after an inoculation that closely resembles the natural route of infection via mosquito bite. Although A129 mice are deficient in the innate interferon response, they retain their adaptive immunity and thus have successfully been used as suitable models for the testing of vaccinations and antivirals. Our study provides details on a suitable small animal model for the testing of future interventions against ZIKV.
