Opisthorchiasis, caused by the food-borne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini, affects more than 8 million people in Southeast Asia, and in its chronic phase it might lead to cholangiocarcinoma. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the sole drug available to treat the disease and is administered as a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers, of which R-PZQ is considered active. As PZQ is rapidly metabolized, its disposition and efficacy in patients might considerably vary according to disease state, sex or age. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on the disposition of PZQ enantiomers and its main metabolite, R-trans-4-OH, in diseased patients are lacking. To allow the collection of PK samples in a large number of patients, we implemented a dried blood spot (DBS) technique, which is less invasive than venipuncture. The aim of our study is to provide first data on the disposition of PZQ enantiomers and the main metabolite of PZQ in opisthorchiasis patients and to validate the use of DBS over venous sampling. Standard PZQ treatment was administered to nine O. viverrini infected patients, and plasma, blood and DBS were simultaneously collected within 24 h post-treatment. We observed a 100-fold higher disposition of the metabolite compared to R-PZQ, which questions its role in the opisthorchidal activity of PZQ. DBS sampling appears to be a valid alternative to venous sampling and will be a valuable tool for future PK studies in PZQ-treated patients.
