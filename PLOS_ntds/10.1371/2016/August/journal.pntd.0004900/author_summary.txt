Leishmaniasis is a complex of diseases caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus, which affects thousands of people around the world. The parasite lives within the cells and the disease manifests itself in different ways, one of them is wound-like lesions on the skin that do not heal. The treatment, with a medicament discovered in 1912, causes several side effects, its intramuscular administration is painful and it is given daily over a long period of time. These characteristics show the need for new alternatives for leishmaniasis treatment justifying works like this. The Morinda citrifolia is a plant native to the Polynesian islands and has a fruit commonly known as Noni. Noni has been analyzed for various targets such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects; however, the antileishmanial has not yet been fully evaluated. This work proves that Noni treatment can promote a fast clinical cure in mice with leishmaniasis by decreasing parasite number, acting on the immune system and repairing skin components.
