Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are fungal agents responsible globally for almost one million cryptococcosis cases yearly, mostly in immunocompromised patients, such as those living with HIV. Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening mycosis, frequently causing meningoencephalitis. Infections due to C. gattii were originally described in tropical and subtropical regions, but its adaptation to temperate regions was highlighted by the emergence in the Pacific North West of North America by C. gattii molecular type VGII. The present work aimed to assess the genetic diversity within the Brazilian C. gattii VGII population to gain new insights into its origin and global dispersal from the South American continent using the ISHAM MLST consensus typing scheme. Our results corroborate that the Brazilian C. gattii VGII population is highly diverse, and strongly supports the emergence of highly virulent strains from ancestors in the Northern regions of Brazil. Numerous genotypes represent a link between Brazil and other parts of the world, and the isolates from the transitional ecological area in Northeast Brazil are the most likely ancestor lineages, translocating from caatinga/cerrado by adapting progressively throughout Amazonia in South America, and spread to the North American Pacific Northwest region and other parts of the world on multiple occasions.
