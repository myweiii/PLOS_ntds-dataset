Strongyloides stercoralis is an intestinal parasite that can replicate within its host, leading to long-lasting and potentially life-threatening infections. Occurring worldwide, it thrives where the climate is warm and sanitation is poor. S. stercoralis is not well detected by standard field techniques and its global prevalence is largely underestimated. Strongyloidiasis is arguably the most neglected of neglected tropical diseases. No control strategy currently exists for it. Ongoing control programs against other similar parasites regularly deliver treatment that has little effect on S. stercoralis. This parasite is a major public health issue in Cambodia, where prevalence rates of up to 40% were recently found. We diagnosed, treated and followed-up (over two years) more than 1,200 villagers in rural Cambodia to assess the impact of ivermectin on S. stercoralis at community level and assess whether S. stercoralis control could be integrated into existing programs. Our results indicate that ivermectin treatment was highly beneficial, with more than 85% of participants testing negative one year after treatment. All ages were at similar risk of acquiring an infection. The effect of community-based treatment was enhanced by increasing village sanitation coverage. We conclude that S. stercoralis control is feasible and strategies should be designed without further delay.
