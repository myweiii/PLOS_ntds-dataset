African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that affect both humans and animals in poor rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, and are a major constraint on health and agricultural development. Disease control is principally dependent on the administration of drugs, which are old and largely unsatisfactory. Humans are naturally resistant to infection by most African trypanosomes species because of a lytic protein component in their blood, called APOL1. However, human-infective trypanosomes, T. b. rhodesiense in East Africa, and T. b. gambiense in West Africa, have evolved separate mechanisms to disarm this lytic protein and cause disease. Recently, variants of APOL1 were discovered in some primates that are able to kill the East African human disease-causing sub-species. These APOL1 variants form the basis of current attempts to create novel therapeutic interventions that can kill both animal and human-infective trypanosomes. In this study, we show that another variant of the same protein from a West African baboon species is able to kill, not only East African human-infective trypanosomes, but also the West African parasites, which causes the majority of human African trypanosomiasis cases. This new APOL1 variant could be a potential candidate for anti-trypanosomal therapies targeted at all pathogenic trypanosome species.
