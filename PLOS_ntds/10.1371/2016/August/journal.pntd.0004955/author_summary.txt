Leprosy reactions are an acute exacerbation of a patientÂ´s clinical condition. Reactions are classified into type 1 (reversal reaction; RR) and type 2 (erythema nodosum leprosum; ENL) according to the etiopathogenesis. Early detection of both types of reactional states is fundamental to treatment management with the most adequate available drugs to ameliorate symptoms and avoid permanent disabilities. The current study investigated whether or not CD64 is expressed during ENL. Analyses of circulating neutrophils revealed that ENL patients expressed higher levels of surface CD64 in comparison to those with nonreactional leprosy and that the severity of ENL was coupled with high levels of CD64 expression. Despite the limited number of patients included in this study, it demonstrated that measurement of neutrophil CD64 expression could be used as a prognostic biomarker of ENL and that quantifying the CD64 response could also help indicate the severity of ENL. Indeed, the methodology adopted found that circulating neutrophil CD64 expression could provide a rapid and non-invasive ENL diagnosis capable of detecting reactions in outpatient clinics as well as leprosy reference centers, leading to more effective therapeutic decisions.
