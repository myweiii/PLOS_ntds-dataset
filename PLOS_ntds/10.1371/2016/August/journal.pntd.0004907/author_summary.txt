Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei is an opportunistic thermal dimorphic fungus most prevalent in Southeast Asia. Our team has previously shown that Mp1p, a protein encoded by the MP1 gene, is an immunogenic surface and secretory protein of T. marneffei. In this study, we showed that mice challenged with T. marneffei with the MP1 gene died but those challenged with T. marneffei without the MP1 gene did not die. There was also significantly higher fungal load and more necrosis in organs of mice challenged with T. marneffei with the MP1 gene than T. marneffei without the MP1 gene. Furthermore, T. marneffei with the MP1 gene survived better in macrophages than T. marneffei without the MP1 gene and Pichia pastoris with the MP1 gene survived in mice better than P. pastoris without the MP1 gene. Our data support that Mp1p is a key virulence factor of T. marneffei and Mp1p mediates virulence by improving the survival of T. marneffei in macrophages.
