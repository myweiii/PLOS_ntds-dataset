Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, an important illness for Latin American countries that is now afflicting other continents due to the immigration of infected people. The available chemotherapy is limited to the chronic phase of the disease, being the development of novel active compounds essential, and the search for specific molecular targets for drugs in T. cruzi is necessary. In this context, our group has synthesized and screened many compounds ranging from natural to semi-synthetic naphthoquinones and derivatives on T. cruzi, displaying naphthoimidazoles N1, N2 and N3 the highest activity. Previous studies correlated phenotypic alterations by cell biology techniques as well as investigated mode of action by proteomic approaches in insect stage epimastigotes as a model. However, T. cruzi presents three morphologically distinct life stages with their own specific biological peculiarities and requirements that could be potential targets to drug intervention. Here, we evaluated the mechanism of action of N1, N2 and N3 in clinical relevant form of the parasite, bloodstream trypomastigotes, by proteomics. Our data pointed to 61 differentially abundant protein spots, being these proteins involved with cellular trafficking, protein synthesis, transduction signaling and energetic metabolism, among others, open interesting perspectives for trypanocidal strategies.
