We are very thankful to Marcos Meuser for his excellent technical support for the trypomastigotes purification, to Maria do Carmo Freire Ribeiro Pinto for the synthesis and isolation of naphthoimidazoles, and to Dr. Daniela Beghini for the experimental help in DIGE assays. We are also grateful to Drs. Solange L. De Castro and Ant√¥nio Ventura Pinto (in memoriam) for the early studies about trypanocidal activity of naphthoquinones and derivatives, and all contributions that they did in this research field that make this study possible.
