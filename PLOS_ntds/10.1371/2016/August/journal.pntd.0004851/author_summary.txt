Dengue virus is currently threatening 40% of the worldâ€™s population. An approximately 60% efficacious vaccine has been registered for use in Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Paraguay and El Salvador, but there are no approved antiviral treatments available. We have shown that celgosivir, an endoplasmic reticulum alpha glucosidase inhibitor, has submicromolar activity against all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and also efficacious in mouse model of infection. The strong preclinical pharmacology motivated the conduct of an investigator-initiated, Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of celgosivir in 50 adult dengue patients. Although the trial did not meet the primary endpoints of lowering viremia or fever, the safety profile of the drug prompted extended hematological, pharmacokinetic, immunological and viral sequence profiling. Here we report several non-significant trends of pharmacological effect of celgosivir on platelet count, hematocrit, and NS1 clearance in secondary dengue patients. In addition, pharmacokinetic modeling identified an alternate dosing regimen that is predicted to achieve a 4.5-fold increase in minimum drug concentrations during treatment (Cmin) with only a modest increase in overall dose. A new Phase 2a clinical trial with an optimized dosing regimen of celgosivir (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02569827) is scheduled to start in the latter part of 2016.
