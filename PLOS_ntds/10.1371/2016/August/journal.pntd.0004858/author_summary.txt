Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Despite its relatively common frequency, mild/moderate leptospirosis often goes unrecognized, due to its usually non-specific symptoms of fever, vomiting, and malaise. Knowledge of leptospirosis in Uganda is limited, and the disease may often be misdiagnosed as malaria. This study sought to define the percentage of healthcare seeking Ugandans in rural Western Uganda who have antibodies to Leptospira in their blood, suggesting prior exposure. We found 35% of study participants had antibodies to at least one Leptospira serovar, predominantly L. borgpetersenii sv Nigeria representing the Pyrogenes serogroup (20% of all participants). Individuals with increased odds of having antibodies to leptospires included participants who skinned cattle and those who reported monkeys near their home. Individuals who self-reported recent diagnosis of malaria were more likely to have leptospirosis antibodies. Antibodies to leptospirosis are not lifelong, typically lasting a few years. The high 35% seroprevalence suggests there is ongoing exposure. Further studies are needed to understand the burden of leptospirosis in rural Africa, the risk factors associated with exposure, and the public health opportunities to mitigate leptospirosis.
