Dengue is a major global health concern, particularly in tropical countries, and affects all age groups. Mortality rates among patients who have been hospitalized with severe dengue are 1.6–10.9%, and death in adults is mainly due to the development of dengue shock and organ dysfunction. In states of poor tissue circulation or shock, lactate is produced. Additionally, procalcitonin is a highly specific biomarker of systemic inflammation. Therefore, we assessed whether procalcitonin and peripheral venous lactate could be used to predict the incidence of dengue shock and/or organ failure in patients with dengue. Our study showed that a combination of serum procalcitonin levels ≥0.7 ng/mL and peripheral venous lactate levels ≥2.5 mmol/L at admission could discriminate between patients who did and did not develop shock and/or organ failure, with high sensitivity and specificity. These parameters may therefore be useful as prognostic biomarkers. Our results suggest that serum procalcitonin is indicative of an extensive early inflammatory response, which may occur during the systemic phase of dengue. Peripheral venous lactate may be produced as a result of the poor tissue circulation that precedes dengue shock. Our findings may help clinicians to predict dengue shock and/or organ failure earlier to reduce in-hospital mortality.
