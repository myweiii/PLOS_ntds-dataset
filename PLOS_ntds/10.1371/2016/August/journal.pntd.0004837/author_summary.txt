Ascaris infection is a significant burden on the people who live in developing countries with infection being linked to poor hygiene and low socio-economic status. The parasite causes a range of symptoms, especially in children, which include both chronic morbidity, such as growth retardation, and acute outcomes, such as intestinal obstruction. Certain people tend to be more heavily infected than others, with those individuals experiencing worse morbidity. The understanding of the difference between susceptible and resistant people is an essential first step in the development of new therapies in order to eliminate this neglected parasitic disease. Using an established mouse model involving a susceptible and resistant strain, we aimed to gain insight into the host-Ascaris interaction at the hepatic interface and elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in resistance. A number of key intrinsic differences were determined between both strains including major differences in mitochondrial and ROS associated processes which may present the nematodes with differing oxidative conditions and explain the failure of the nematode to establish a successful parasitism in the resistant strain. In addition, we resolved signatures of the innate and early adaptive immune response and a major reduction in the proteins associated with translation in both strains under infection. Our findings need to be further explored, but could be the foundation for a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the differential parasite burden and in the future, potential new therapies for control.
