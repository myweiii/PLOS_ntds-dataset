Sand fly control is one of the main priorities of the Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) Elimination Program in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. Currently, indoor residual spraying with insecticides (IRS) is the most effective method available for sand fly control. The efficacy of other methods of vector control remains poorly understood. To reach elimination, these additional techniques need to be explored in order to complement IRS or replace it if it is unavailable. In this multi-country study we investigated the efficacy, safety and cost of lime wash of household walls plus treatment of sand fly breeding places with bleach (EM), insecticide impregnated durable wall lining (DWL), and bed net impregnation with slow release insecticide (ITN) for sand fly control in the Indian sub-continent. Among these vector control methods, we found DWL to be the most effective tool for sand fly control followed by ITN. DWL and ITN should be considered, in addition to IRS, for sand fly control by the VL elimination program in the Indian sub-continent depending on need and affordability.
