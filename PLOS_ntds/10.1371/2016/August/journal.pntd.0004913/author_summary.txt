The unicellular parasite Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) causes the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with approximately one quarter of a billion people infected annually. Tv infections are linked to pre-term and low-weight infant birth, increased susceptibility to and transmission of HIV infection, and increased aggressiveness of urogenital tract cancers. How the immune system responds to Tv, and how the parasite persists in the presence of the immune system, is not well understood. We show that Tv can kill human immune cells. We found that a clinical isolate of Tv is more efficient at killing immune cells than a laboratory-adapted strain, and that Tv preferentially targets B-cells. This killing activity is mediated by both contact-dependent and soluble factors. Killing immune cells could allow Tv to subvert or disable the immune system. Conversely, we found that cells of the immune system respond to Tv by secreting soluble inflammatory mediators called cytokines, mainly interleukin-8. However, these cells secrete greater amounts, and a broader profile of inflammatory cytokines when they encounter Tv harboring its symbiont bacterium, Mycoplasma hominis. We conclude that Tv may interact with immune cells in different ways, depending on the strain of Tv and the symbiont it harbors.
