While Plasmodium vivax is generally not as virulent as P. falciparum; severe manifestations of vivax malaria do occur. While little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of P. vivax, most agree its ability to increase the deformability of stiff host reticulocytes is key adaptation to avoid splenic clearance. We show that P. vivax-infected red blood cells (PvIRBCs) rosette irreversibly with normocytes and are significantly more stiff than non-rosetting PvIRBCs. We discuss how these stiff PvIRBC rosettes are removed from the peripheral circulation and its rheopathological consequences.
