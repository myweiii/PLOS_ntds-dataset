Machupo virus (MACV), a member of Arenaviridae family, causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) in humans. No approved vaccine or treatment are available to date despite the high case fatality rate of BHF. rMACV/Cd#1-GPC is fully attenuated and protects mice from lethal MACV challenge. Although one virulence determinant was found in the transmembrane domain of GPC (F438), other virulence determinants in GPC are very likely. Our new data indicated that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC is necessary, but not sufficient, for complete attenuation of the rMACV/Cd#1-GPC. This new finding may help generate highly attenuated MACVs for vaccine development and/or for drug screening purpose.
