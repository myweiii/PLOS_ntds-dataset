When a vaccine is developed, it undergoes a series of tests to assess its safety and effectiveness. The last of these is called a Phase III clinical trial, in which the vaccine is tested on a subset of the population before it is approved for general use. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which individuals are randomized to receive vaccine or placebo is the most direct and efficient trial design to assess the efficacy of a vaccine. However, in circumstances where a disease has a very high mortality rate (such as Ebola virus disease), the use of placebo is ethically questionable, especially when there is strong evidence that a vaccine will be safe and efficacious. Vaccine trials often must also address logistical constraints that prevent the introduction of the vaccine to the entire trial population in certain resource-poor settings. These issues were front and center in discussions about vaccine trials during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The medical community faced questions on the clinical trial design that best balanced tradeoffs between ethical concerns, logistics, and statistical rigor. In this study, we propose and assess novel “ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial” designs as an alternative to mitigate these tradeoffs.
