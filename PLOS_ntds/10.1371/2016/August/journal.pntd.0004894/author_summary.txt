Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms that affects over 250 million people. The global control strategy is regular deworming of school-aged children. Before deworming campaigns can be conducted, one must know where the disease is present. The current method requires collection of individual stool and urine samples that are examined under a microscope by trained laboratory technicians. We present an alternative method that can inform where schistosomiasis is present in above 10% of the population, which is the threshold at which school-based deworming is recommended. The proposed strategy involves pooling multiple urine samples and using a rapid diagnostic test. The goal is to reduce the number of tests, cost, time, and laboratory infrastructure to guide decision-making. We collected data in Côte d’Ivoire to evaluate this new diagnostic procedure of pooling urine, and used computer simulation to predict its performance in classification of communities above or below the 10% threshold. We found that the urine pooling strategy with a pool size of 4 reduced the number of tests and cost compared to the current standard method, while maintaining the same accuracy. Our findings suggest that this strategy may be an effective and cost-saving method compared to traditional microscopy.
