Hand mycetoma is a serious condition due to the complexity of the hand anatomy and functionality. The disease and the surgical intervention can both produce distortions, deformities and disabilities which interfere with patient daily activities of living. Thus producing huge burden on the patients, the families and inflicts numerous socio-economic bearings on the communities in endemic regions.
The present study, identified that, most patients were young adult males, of poor socioeconomic status and from rural areas of the Sudan. Compared with patients with mycetoma in other parts of the body, they presented rather early having noticed the lesion earlier because they frequently wash and examine their hands. No predisposing factors were evidenced in the study. Several diagnostic tools and techniques were required to establish the diagnosis of mycetoma in these patients and hence there is a need for a simple, affordable, field friendly diagnostic test which is of reasonable sensitivity and specificity. The treatment is prolonged and in most cases the outcome was unsatisfactory, thus new novel treatment is desirable. Until that time, a well-structured health education programmes are required to encourage early presentation and treatment compliance.
