Scrub typhus is a vector-borne disease carried by the chigger mite and is endemic in the Asia-Pacific region. Now scrub typhus causes a considerable burden on public health and the economy in China. We explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of scrub typhus cases in China between January 2006 and December 2014, and explored the potential risk factors affecting the spatial distribution of the disease. The majority of cases were reported between July and November, with peak incidence during October every year. Several high-risk clusters were identified in southwest, southern, and middle-east China. Scrub typhus incidence was positively correlated with the percentage of shrub, and temporal variation in temperature and precipitation in China.
