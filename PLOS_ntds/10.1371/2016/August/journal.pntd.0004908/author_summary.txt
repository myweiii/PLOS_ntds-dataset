Schistosomiasis and trichuriasis affects millions of people worldwide and are caused by blood flukes and whipworms, respectively. Only a handful of anthelmintic drugs exist to treat these infections and the pipeline for the next generation of anthelmintic drugs is sparse, precipitating the need for new drug development. In this context, medicinal plants present a viable source of novel anthelmintic compounds. This inspired us to study the selected naturally occurring compounds derived from a Bhutanese daisy medicinal plant, Ajania nubigena for their anthelmintic activities. Here, using the xWORM motility assay, we demonstrate that two compounds, luteolin (3) and (3R,6R)-linalool oxide acetate (1), display significant broad-spectrum anthelmintic activity against two of the most important genera of human helminth parasites, the nematode whipworm and the platyhelminth blood fluke. Luteolin exhibited the best activities with IC50 values of 5.8 μg/mL against schistosomes and 9.7 μg/mL against whipworms. Using scanning electron microscopy we showed that luteolin damages the tegument of blood flukes and induces abnormalities in the bacillary bands/glands and cuticles of whipworms. Intriguingly, our previous study showed that luteolin (3) was effective against multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Due to its broad-spectrum anti-parasitic activities, luteolin (3) is a desirable drug lead scaffold, which could be used for developing effective compounds to control and treat numerous tropical diseases.
