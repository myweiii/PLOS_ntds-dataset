Hookworm infections remain a major public health problem in both tropical and subtropical parts of the world. To control the disease burden attributable to hookworms, large-scale deworming programs, in which drugs are administered to schoolchildren regardless of their infection status, are currently being implemented in endemic regions. However, these programs face some difficulties. One of them is the uncertainty about the role of animals in the transmission of hookworm infections. It is commonly believed that human-specific hookworms cause these infections, but there is growing evidence that the role of some animal-specific hookworms as cause of infection in humans should not be underestimated. We determined the different hookworms in humans, dogs and soil (eggs excreted by adult hookworms in stool are non-infectious, and need to develop and hatch on the soil before larvae can transmit disease by penetrating the skin) in a tribal area in India. In this area, the transmission of hookworms between humans and dogs is possible. Our results highlight the presence of DNA from animal-specific hookworms in both soil and human stool. Although these findings suggest that these animals could act as reservoir for zoonotic hookworm infections in humans, they should be interpreted with caution. This is because we lack the evidence to confirm A. caninum infections in our study population. Other potential reasons for the presence of DNA in stool are contamination of stool with environmental eggs or larvae during sample collection and passive passage in which eggs or larvae are ingested but did result in any infection.
