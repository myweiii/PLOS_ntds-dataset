Rabies is an infectious disease causing 59,000 deaths and millions are exposed each year worldwide. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against rabies consists of a combination of passive (immune globulins) and active immunisation (vaccine) directly after viral exposure. Currently used plasma-derived anti-rabies immune globulins are expensive and scarce, urging the development of alternatives. Nanobodies or VHH are the smallest antigen-binding fragments of camelid heavy chain antibodies and are easy to produce with intrinsic good thermal stability and solubility. Combined treatment with anti-rabies VHH and vaccine gave significantly better protection than either compound alone in an intranasal rabies challenge model in mice, which validates the potential use of anti-rabies VHH as replacement of immune globulins in PEP.
