Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. There is no effective vaccine available against VL for any age group and importantly, there are no previous studies regarding immune responses against experimental Leishmania vaccines tested in aged animals. We have reported earlier that immunization with a live attenuated L. donovani parasites (LdCen-/-) induced protective immune response in young animals viz, mice, hamsters and dogs. In this study we analyzed LdCen-/- mediated modulation of innate and adaptive responses in aged mice and compared to young mice. We observed that LdCen-/- infected dendritic cells from young and aged mice resulted in enhanced innate effector functions compared to LdWT parasites both in vitro and in vivo. Further, upon virulent challenge, LdCen-/- immunized young and aged mice displayed protective Th1 immune response which correlated with a significantly reduced parasite burden in the visceral organs compared with na√Øve challenged mice. Although there was no difference in the LdCen-/- induced dendritic cell response between aged and young mice; adaptive response in aged was reduced, compared to young which correlated with less protection in aged compared to young mice. This study supports the potential use of LdCen-/- as vaccine candidate across all age groups against VL.
