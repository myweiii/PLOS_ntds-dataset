Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused large epidemics of fever, rash, and joint pain around the world in recent years. Three different CHIKV genotypes exist. Infection with one genotype is likely to lead to immune protection (or cross-protection) against future infections with a different genotype. However, little is known about the nature of this cross-protection. In this study, we used serum from Malaysian patients infected with CHIKV of either Asian or East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotypes. We compared the ability of the serum antibodies to bind to and neutralize two different viruses, from either Asian or ECSA genotypes. We found that both Asian and ECSA serum were more effective in binding and neutralizing ECSA virus. We identified the key amino acids/epitopes within the E1-E2 surface glycoprotein, and showed that variation of these impacts the efficacy of antiserum in cross-neutralizing different genotypes of CHIKV. We showed how sequence variation of a known linear neutralizing epitope could alter the cross-neutralization efficacy. This study aids understanding of the importance of different circulating genotypes within a country and has implications for the design of vaccines and diagnostic antibody tests.
