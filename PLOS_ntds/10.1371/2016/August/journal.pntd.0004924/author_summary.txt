With increasing globalization, the threat of dengue is rising in areas that were previously unaffected. Japan has been experiencing a rise in notifications of imported cases, and in 2014 confirmed the first domestic outbreak in nearly 70 years. Such events prompted the country to more actively utilize existing imported dengue case data among travelers to inform situational awareness, risk assessment, and evidence-based decision-making. Using both national disease surveillance data and publically available traveler statistics, we compared monthly and yearly trends between reported numbers of dengue cases among Japanese travelers and those of domestic dengue cases in the countries visited. By using the number of Japanese travelers to a dengue-endemic country as an approximate denominator, we estimated the risk of dengue infection among travelers to the country. This method is more appropriate than simply monitoring the number of reported imported cases because it accounts for fluctuating numbers of travelers, such as during vacation periods. This study demonstrated that the trends in dengue notifications among travelers were consistent with local dengue trends, both yearly and seasonally. Our simple approach, which takes advantage of existing data, may be readily adopted elsewhere to help inform risk of importation and potential subsequent domestic transmission.
