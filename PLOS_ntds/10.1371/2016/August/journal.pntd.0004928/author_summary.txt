Schistosomiasis is one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases prioritized by the World Health Organization. It affects hundreds of millions of people in developing countries in the poorest tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Today, essentially a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), is available to treat this parasitic disease. PZQ incomplete efficacy across all stages of the Schistosoma mansoni life cycle in the definitive host and the potential risk of drug resistance prompted us to search for novel schistosomicidal molecules. We screened a compound collection library using the larval stage of the parasite and discovered novel anti-schistosomal properties of perhexiline maleate (PHX). Overall, our study demonstrated that the anti-anginal drug PHX, still used in some countries, is active in vitro against parasite life stages poorly sensitive to PZQ. In addition, we showed that PHX impairs egg production in mature worm couples in vitro and damages the female and male reproductive systems and the male worm tegument. PHX could therefore represent a promising starting point for novel schistosomicidal drug discovery programmes.
