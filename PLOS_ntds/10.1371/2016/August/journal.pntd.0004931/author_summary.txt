Usutu and Zika viruses are arboviruses of significant medical and veterinary outbreaks in recent years. Currently, standard laboratory methods for these viruses are limited to 2â€“3 cell lines. Here, our studies demonstrate that Zika and Usutu viruses are able to replicate in cells from a wide range of animal cell lines. The data will allow for further study of the potential for evolution of these viruses in other hosts.
