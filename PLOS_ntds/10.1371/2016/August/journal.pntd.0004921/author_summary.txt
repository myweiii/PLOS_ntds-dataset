DENV is the most important mosquito transmitted viral disease in humans causing almost 400 million infections each year. Early detection is possible; however, there are no antivirals or vaccines available for this potentially lethal virus. Host factors that are required for viral amplification provide an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics for rapidly evolving RNA viruses. However, only a handful of DENV host factors are known. This study reports identification of 79 novel dengue RNA binding proteins using a large-scale analysis of cellular proteins that interact with the DENV RNA during a live infection in human cells. Importantly, this analysis proved to have a remarkably low false discovery rate and the confirmed host factors appear to be specific to DENV without compromising the fitness of the cell for viral amplification of other unrelated viruses. Furthermore, these host factors were shown to be required at both early and late stages of the viral life cycle, consistent with the dynamic nature of dengue viral RNA.
