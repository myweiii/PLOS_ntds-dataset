Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, has unique physiological features including being uncultivable in artificial media. This fact raises the possibility that M. leprae possesses specific metabolism that are different from other cultivable mycobacteria. Among the components of M. leprae, the glycolipids are known to be involved in pathogenicity, while the dynamics of intracellular metabolites such as organic acids, amino acids and nucleic acids remain unclear. Aiming to understand the metabolism of M. leprae, we characterized the profile of intracellular metabolites. Unexpectedly, we found that amino acid species are significantly accumulated, while most of intermediates related to central carbon metabolism markedly decreased in the metabolite fraction of M. leprae, as compared with that of other mycobacteria. These specific metabolic features of M. leprae was presented for the first time and these insights may contribute to understanding the mechanism of physiology including obligate growth in vivo, which is one of the key characteristics of leprosy.
