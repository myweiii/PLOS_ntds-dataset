The results presented in this article demonstrate the need to assess the clinical disease burden due to lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas of the world where this disease occurs. There are effective strategies that can be implemented to reduce the suffering and morbidity associated with chronic filarial infections. These include lymphedema management programs that teach basic hygiene to decrease limb infections that contribute to lymphedema progression. These interventions should be implemented on a broader scale and can be integrated with other chronic disease prevention programs at subnational and national levels. However, knowledge of the scale and distribution of individuals suffering with lymphedema in countries with LF is required to decide where and how these health services should be implemented. Countries with LF are encouraged to conduct burden assessments to decide how best to implement lymphedema management programs. Providing health services for those with lymphedema is an important component of reducing LF as a public health problem.
