Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a virulent vector-borne parasite transmitted to man by phlebotomine sand flies. Fipronil-based drugs, administered to cattle orally, provide a potential means of sand fly control by permeating in cattle blood and being excreted in cattle feces, targeting adult females feeding on cattle blood and larvae feeding on cattle feces, respectively. An agent-based, stochastic simulation model was developed to represent sand fly population dynamics in a village in Bihar, India, at all developmental stages, with the goal of predicting the impact of various vector control strategies, utilizing drug treated cattle, on vector population numbers. Results indicate that success of treatment is dependent on the number of treatments applied annually and the seasonality of the sand fly lifecycle. Results further suggest that treatment schemes are most effective in reducing vector populations when high drug efficacy is maintained in cattle feces during periods of high larval density. Our approach incorporates detailed representation of the vector population and provides an explicit representation of the effects of insecticide application on adult and larval sand flies. Hence, this model predicts treatment schemes that may have the greatest potential to reduce sand fly numbers.
