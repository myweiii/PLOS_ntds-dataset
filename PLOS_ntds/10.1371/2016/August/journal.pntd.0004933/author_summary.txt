Islands are exceptionally prone to species introduction, including pathogens with detrimental public health consequences for which the invasive alien species could act as reservoirs. Our study shows how the local non-native mammal fauna of Mayotte Island is associated with the introduction and epidemiology of human leptospirosis, a zoonosis strongly affecting tropical islands. Data presented herein identify Tenrec ecaudatus (Family Tenrecidae), an omnivorous species introduced from neighbouring Madagascar, as a reservoir of the recently named Leptospira mayottensis. Further, we suggest a Malagasy origin of L. mayottensis, which occurs naturally within the Tenrecidae radiation endemic to Madagascar. Finally, we provide evidence that dogs and rats are reservoirs for other Leptospira lineages of medical importance on Mayotte. Altogether, our study highlights the impact of species introduction on human health and further suggests that the biogeography of microorganisms in insular ecosystems, including pathogenic endemic lineages, should be considered from evolutionary and medical perspectives.
