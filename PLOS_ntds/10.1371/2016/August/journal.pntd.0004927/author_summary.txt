Yaws is a neglected tropical disease caused by a bacterium closely related to the agent of syphilis. Mass treatment is recommended by WHO for the control of both yaws and the blinding eye disease trachoma, but the dose used for trachoma is lower (20 mg/kg versus 30 mg/kg). We have previously shown that a single round of mass treatment with azithromycin for trachoma had a significant impact on the number of cases of yaws in a community, suggesting that the lower dose of azithromycin might be effective for yaws and that trachoma and yaws programmes in the Pacific might be integrated. We repeated our survey 18 months following the initial round of mass treatment to see if the benefit seen at 6 months had persisted. In this study, the number of yaws cases remained significantly lower than before mass treatment even without any additional public health interventions taking place in the 18 months between MDA and this follow-up. This might suggest that annual mass treatment could be used rather than the current recommendation of six monthly treatment. An annual treatment strategy might facilitate integrating yaws eradication efforts with other NTD control programmes.
