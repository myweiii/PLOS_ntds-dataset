West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that has caused outbreaks in humans in many regions of the world. Birds are the natural hosts for WNV. However, different strains of WNV cause different disease outcomes in birds. Here, we compared two WNV strains, one of which causes higher mortality and generates more virus in American crows than the other. Previous research has shown that this difference is due in large part to a difference between the two strains at a single amino acid in the NS3 gene; however, this difference does not completely explain the observed effect. Here we show that another region of the viral genome also affects disease outcomes in American crows, and changes the sensitivity of the virus to temperature when grown in bird cells. These findings help us to understand the genetic features that affect WNV infection and disease outcomes in its natural host. Detection of such features in new strains of WNV and related viruses could help to understand and predict future outbreaks.
