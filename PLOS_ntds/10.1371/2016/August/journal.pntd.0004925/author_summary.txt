Control of Hansen’s disease, or leprosy, requires understanding how quickly the infection moves through the population and how long it takes to detect the disease. These rates vary regionally, resulting in differences in the number of people detected with disease each year. We have estimated the risk of infection and the rate of detection for this disease in each of the 5 regions of Brazil. This allowed us to predict the long-term impact of Brazil’s current leprosy control program, which found that some regions of Brazil will require 44–45 years to eliminate leprosy as a public health risk, primarily due to the long delay in detection of cases.
