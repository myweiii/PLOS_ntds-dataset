Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is caused by either direct contact with the urine of animals infected with pathogenic forms of Leptospira, or indirectly, through contact with contaminated water or soil. Because many people become infected through the environment, where the bacteria can live for many months if the conditions are suitable, we tested water samples from the peri-domestic area in twelve different communities from Los Rios region, Chile, to examine whether the Leptospira species were different in urban, rural village, and farm areas. We found that all three community types had L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. weilii. No evident associations were seen between animal infection and the frequency or diversity of Leptospira. The proposed surveillance method has potential for systematic monitoring of surface waters that will help us better understand the importance of animal, climate, and environmental factors in the variation of Leptospira species present in a community in order to predict infection risk and inform prevention programs.
