Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has been classified into six genetic groups (discrete typing units, DTUs) named TcI-TcVI and a seventh one called TcBat. Currently, several genetic molecular markers are used to classify the strains after their isolation in culture or directly from biological samples. The current inventory compiling the published works aiming to identify the DTUs of T. cruzi strains accumulated a total of 6,343 identifications. Although this inventory is not free of sampling bias, like all samples, it is the largest sampling to date and hence likely represents the closest picture of the current diversity of T. cruzi strains (i) circulating throughout the endemic area from the southern United States to Argentina and (ii) circulating in vectors as well as in wild and domestic mammals, and humans. Data analysis helps identify trends and provides a basis for further comparisons of new data, in a context where human factors (migration, vector control, urbanization, deforestation, agricultural expansion, resource exploitation) influence the epidemiological patterns of Chagas disease.
