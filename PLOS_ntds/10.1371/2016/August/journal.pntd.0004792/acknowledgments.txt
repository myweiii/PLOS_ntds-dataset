Permits were issued by Direction de l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement (DEAL) of Mayotte. We thank Office National des Forêts, Conseil Général of Mayotte and Association Naturalistes Environnement et Patrimoine de Mayotte for allowing animal capture on conservation sites. For Madagascar samples, permits were provided by Malagasy national authorities: Ministère de l’Environnement et des Forêts, Madagascar National Parks and the Département de Biologie Animale of the Université d’Antananarivo (N°238/14/MEEF/SG/DGF/DCB.SAP/SCB). We are also grateful to Catherine Dioniso in helping to locate some bat roost sites. COOPADEM provided the field group laboratory space on Mayotte and we would like to thank Marion Pannequin and Laure Dommergues particularly. We also thank Voahangy Soarimalala for helping in preparation of samples at Réserve Spéciale Ambohitantely. We deeply think Dr Bénédicte Contamin and Fondation Mérieux in Madagascar for providing logistical supports. Computations were performed on the “Université de La Réunion” supercomputer facility. We are thankful to both anonymous reviewers who thoroughly examined the original manuscript and contributed to substantial improvements.
