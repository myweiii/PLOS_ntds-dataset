Facial cleanliness is a core component of the SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements) strategy for trachoma control. We conducted a mixed methods study in a trachoma hyperendemic region of rural Ethiopia to better understand knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to face washing. Overall, knowledge of the benefits of face washing was high, and participants reported regularly engaging in face washing practices. However, the use of soap for face washing varied more between communities. Participants cited cost and forgetting to use soap as the primary barriers to using soap for face washing. Trachoma prevention, including keeping flies from landing on childrenâ€™s faces, was a commonly-cited motivator for face washing discussed in focus groups. Given the near-universal knowledge of the benefits of face washing, interventions focused on changing face washing behavior for trachoma control should focus on habit formation and removal of barriers to the use of soap rather than simply educational interventions.
