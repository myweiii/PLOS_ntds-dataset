With over two billion people infected and many billions of dollars of lost crops annually, nematode infections are a serious problem for human health and for agricultural production. While there are drugs to treat infections, many pockets of parasites have been identified worldwide that are developing immunity to the standard treatment regimen. In this study we describe a strategy using the model organism C. elegans as a surrogate parasite to identify several new chemical compounds that may offer additional treatments for infection. We demonstrate how to use our platform to identify compounds that are specific in their effect to nematodes and are not simply biocides. We also show through genetic and molecular analysis in this organism that we can quickly identify the mode of action of any new compound. Most critically, we show that a compound first identified in a free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is also effective on a parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne hapla. With this result and considering the level of sequence conservation across much of the nematode phyla we believe our strategy can be more widely applied to find new anthelmintics.
