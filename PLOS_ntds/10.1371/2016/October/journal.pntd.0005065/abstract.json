    "Abstract": "Melioidosis is caused by the facultative intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei and is potentially fatal. Despite a growing global burden and high fatality rate, little is known about the disease. Recent studies demonstrate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition is an effective post-exposure therapeutic for pulmonary melioidosis, which works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This treatment, while effective, was conducted using an experimental COX-2 inhibitor that is not approved for human or animal use. Therefore, an alternative COX-2 inhibitor needs to be identified for further studies. Tolfenamic acid (TA) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) COX-2 inhibitor marketed outside of the United States for the treatment of migraines. While this drug was developed for COX-2 inhibition, it has been found to modulate other aspects of inflammation as well. In this study, we used RAW 264.7 cells infected with B pseudomallei to analyze the effect of TA on cell survival, PGE2 production and regulation of COX-2 and nuclear factor- kappaB (NF-ĸB) protein expression. To evaluate the effectiveness of post-exposure treatment with TA, results were compared to Ceftazidime (CZ) treatments alone and the co-treatment of TA with a sub-therapeutic treatment of CZ determined in a study of BALB/c mice. Results revealed an increase in cell viability in vitro with TA and were able to reduce both COX-2 expression and PGE2 production while also decreasing NF-ĸB activation during infection. Co-treatment of orally administered TA and a sub-therapeutic treatment of CZ significantly increased survival outcome and cleared the bacterial load within organ tissue. Additionally, we demonstrated that post-exposure TA treatment with sub-therapeutic CZ is effective to treat melioidosis in BALB/c mice."
