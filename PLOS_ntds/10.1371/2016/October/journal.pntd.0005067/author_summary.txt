In Latin America, bloodsucking bugs are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, which is one of the most important public health problems for rural human populations. Though chemical control campaigns have been effective against vectors, the disease persists because native vectors from natural habitats have been able to recolonize human habitations. This is the case of Triatoma brasiliensis. Its capacity to adapt to a new habitat could be linked to changes in the number and/or the expression of chemosensory system genes, particularly those encoding odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs), which are important for detecting odor stimuli. This study looks at the chemosensory system of Triatominae in an attempt to document the adaptation process and the domiciliation of disease vectors. We used RNAseq to annotate chemosensory genes and to evidence differential gene expression in T. brasiliensis samples from different habitats.
