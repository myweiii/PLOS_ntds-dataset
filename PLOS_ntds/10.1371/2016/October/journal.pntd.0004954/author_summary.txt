We present evidence of Haiti’s successful neglected tropical disease (NTD) program targeting lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths and the methods used to achieve this success. By 2012, Haiti’s NTD program had reached full national scale, with such consistently good treatment coverage that the program is now able to stop treatment for lymphatic filariasis in much of the country. These findings are in line with the predictions and expectations of the global community for countries where high coverage is achieved for program implementation. In addition to the evidence of successful program outcomes, we present a detailed description of how the program was implemented—from facilitating the effectiveness of the drug distributors to improving drug logistics and supporting a well-informed population. These methods described can be used to inform the design of other mass drug administration programs and enhance the development of global “best practices” guidance.
