Rickettsia philipii, a spotted fever group rickettsia, is the etiologic agent of Pacific Coast tick fever, an emerging tick-borne disease transmitted by the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis). The Pacific Coast tickâ€™s range, and thus potential for exposure to R. philipii, includes most of California, southern Oregon, and northern Baja California, Mexico. This study describes the clinical manifestations of the 14 human cases reported to date in California and the known acarological risk factors for encountering PCTF. While Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is genetically similar to R. philipii, PCTF is a milder disease than RMSF; the two diseases share key clinical features such as headache and fever but differ in that PCTF presents with a localized eschar (necrotic wound) but without a petechial rash. Most case-patients have illness onset dates in the summer (peak: July and August) which is coincident with the activity period of immature D. occidentalis. Results from this study support the premise that larval and nymphal D. occidentalis are the vectors of PCTF to humans in California. While only three ticks have tested positive for R. rickettsii over decades of surveillance in California, the prevalence of R. philipii in D. occidentalis ticks averages 0.4% in larvae, 0.9% in nymphs, and 2.1% in adult ticks, indicating a higher risk of acquiring PCTF than RMSF statewide.
