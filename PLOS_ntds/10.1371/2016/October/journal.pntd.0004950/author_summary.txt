Buruli ulcer disease is a subcutaneous necrotizing skin disease caused by ecological Mycobacterium ulcerans. The availability of antibiotic treatment makes it imperative for early detection of the disease to avoid the disfiguring and morbid effects associated with the disease. Currently available detection methods include: microscopy for detecting acid-fast bacilli, culture to isolate viable organism, and PCR for detecting pathogen specific DNA which is usually IS2404 and histopathology. However, most of these methods have major drawbacks, they are done in referenced laboratories and cannot be used in the field where the disease is most prevalent. M. ulcerans produces a lipid chemical called mycolactone, which is accountable for the virulent nature of the disease and has been postulated as a diagnostic target. The lipid nature of the mycolactone however makes it difficult for the body to produce antibodies against it. We therefore designed nucleic acid detection molecules that have high affinity to its target called aptamers. This aptamers were selected to detect mycolactone and hence M. ulcerans. The selected aptamers were tested with clinical samples and concluded preliminarily that, aptamers can be raised against mycolactone and this be used as point of care upon optimization and subsequent incorporation into a diagnostic platform.
