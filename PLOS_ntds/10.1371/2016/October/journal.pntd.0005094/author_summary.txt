Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects approximately 220 million people and causes serious morbidity and economic problems mainly in (sub)tropical regions. After Schistosoma japonicum or Schistosoma mansoni infection, parasite eggs are trapped in host liver and induce liver inflammation and fibrosis, leading to irreversible impairment of the liver, and even death of the host. Meanwhile, schistosomes also induce strong regulatory mechanisms to suppress inflammation and prevent excessive immunopathology. Considering it is well known that PD-1 plays a critical role in suppressing T cell function, understanding the role of PD-1 in modulating immune responses during schistosome infection is necessary for the development of PD-1-based control of liver damage in schistosomiasis. Here, increased PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells from both humans and mice with schistosome infection was shown. We further showed that PD-1 blockade preferentially augmented Th2 cell responses and ultimately resulted in more severe liver immunopathology in mice with Schistosomiasis japonica, suggesting that PD-1 signaling is beneficial to further explore therapeutic possibilities for preventing the excessive liver immunopathology.
