Aedes aegypti is the principal vector for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. These viruses require a period of development inside the mosquito before they can be transmitted to humans. Depending on environmental factors, dengue and Zika viruses take an average of 8–10 days to replicate inside the mosquito [1,2] whereas chikungunya virus takes 2–7 days to replicate [3]. The age of mosquitoes is therefore a critical determinant of disease transmission. A mosquito control strategy utilizing an endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, has been proven effective at blocking dengue transmission in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes [4]. For effective virus blocking, mosquitoes infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia must survive long enough to cover the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of infected mosquitoes while those infected with wMelPop are expected to have a reduced lifespan to limit the period available for virus replication. These strategies therefore require routine monitoring using age grading techniques. In this study, we investigated the applicability of a rapid and cost effective near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique as an alternative age grading tool for wild-type and Wolbachia infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. We show that NIRS can rapidly predict on average, the age of male and female Ae. aegypti to ±3 days of their true age and can determine which mosquitoes are old enough to be potentially infectious with an accuracy of up to 91%.
