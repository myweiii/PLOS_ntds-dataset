The primate knowlesi malaria has now emerged in human populations throughout South East Asia. Our limited knowledge of where and when people get exposed to the vector (Anopheles balabacensis) has resulted in poor control measures, although it is assumed that exposure occurs primarily when people are working in forest areas. We investigated the role of peri-domestic (outdoors but around the household) and domestic transmission. Mosquitoes were collected at 28 pairs households composed of one where an occupant had a confirmed knowlesi malaria infection and an associated “control” where no infection was reported. Most of the vectors were caught outdoors from 6pm - 9pm. The vectors were also significantly more abundant in the peri-domestic area than inside houses (5.5-fold), and also higher at case than control households. Ten Anopheles (out of 641) were found positive for primate malaria parasites. This study shows that humans can be exposed to knowlesi infection around their homes. Given the vectors are mainly outdoor biters, interventions using insecticide treated bednets inside households may have relatively little impact. A paradigm shift in control methods is required to reduce infection of this primate malaria.
