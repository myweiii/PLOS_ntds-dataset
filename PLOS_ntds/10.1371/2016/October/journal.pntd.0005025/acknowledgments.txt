We thank the staff members at the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico for facilitating the review of death certificates including Zulma L. Escalera, Ivonne Vasallo, Wanda Llovet, Alejita Santos, and Nancy Vega. In addition, we would like to acknowledge the medical management information offices from hospitals in Puerto Rico for working with us to access medical records from the deceased case-patients. Last, we would like to acknowledge the support of Dr. María Conte, CEO of the PRIFS during the planning phases of our project, Daniel López, Manager at PRIFS, and all the pathologists at PRIFS and Centro Médico. Without their interest in and support of this project, EFASS would never have been possible.
