Dengue is a major public health problem in the tropics. Despite its global importance, population-based mortality rates attributable to dengue are largely unknown. Dengue vaccines are now in late stage clinical trials and one vaccine has been licensed in several countries. Evidence-based decisions regarding the future use of dengue vaccines will depend on robust estimates of disease burden which should include mortality. To estimate mortality due to dengue in Puerto Rico, where dengue is endemic, we developed an enhanced surveillance system to detect fatalities due to a preceeding dengue-like acute febrile illness using more sensitive case identification and laboratory methods than the previous passive method. This surveillance system found the dengue mortality rate was 1.05 per 100,000 Puerto Rico residents in 2010, the highest rate ever detected. Among adults aged 19â€“64 years, mortality from dengue (1.17 deaths per 100,000) was higher than from other infectious diseases, including influenza. The utility of this enhanced surveillance system was further proven through the identification of an outbreak of leptospirosis as well as detection of other diseases of public health importance, including melioidosis and meningitis.
