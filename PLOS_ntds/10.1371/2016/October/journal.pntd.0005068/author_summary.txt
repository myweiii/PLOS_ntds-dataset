In the U.S., the Hawaiian Islands have the highest number of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease cases per capita. The tropical climate, geographical isolation of the islands, and aquifer water sources may have influence such prevalence. Previous studies suggest that NTM thrive in water biofilms and soil. To broaden our understanding of potential environmental reservoirs and species composition of NTM in the Hawaiian Islands, we sampled environmental sites and examined patient isolates. Our recovery and identification of Mycobacterium chimaera and several other clinically relevant NTM species and the absence of Mycobacterium avium in both the indigenous environment and clinical specimens underscore the need for further studies to define the environmental factors that drive NTM lung disease and species composition in high prevalence locations such as the Hawaiian Islands.
