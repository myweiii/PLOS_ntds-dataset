Severe fever with thrombocytopenia (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease that was first discovered in China in 2009. Subsequently, SFTS has also been found in South Korea and Japan. Here, we report the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of 172 confirmed SFTS cases in South Korea that occurred since the first case was reported in 2013. SFTS was prevalent throughout South Korea, except for in urban areas. The incidence was relatively low in the western and southwestern rice field areas and the scarcely populated eastern mountainous area. Hilly areas were the major endemic regions. The incidence was increasing annually, and the case fatality ratio was 32.6%. A mental status of confusion, elevated levels of C-reactive protein, and prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time were associated with mortality in patients with SFTS. Two outbreaks of nosocomial SFTS transmission were noted.
