In sub-Saharan Africa, tsetse and tick borne disease are the main constraints to livestock production. Providing farmers effective products to control animal pests is a challenging task in the context of increasing resistance to insecticide in many vectors and reduction of available insecticide molecules. Moreover, the spread of invasive species of high economic importance such as the tick Rhipicephalus microplus stress the development of new tools. In this study, we evaluated the protective effect of a new pour-on formulation against tsetse, trypanosomosis and ticks in experimental and field trials. This product based on a mix of two insecticides, a repellent and a synergist prove to be very effective with an immediate effect on ticks and tsetse and low treatment frequency to maintain a low ticks infestation and trypanosomosis prevalence. This new insecticide formulation represents an important innovation in the field of vector control, offering a partial individual protection in addition to a collective control method against trypanosomosis vectors and ticks.
