The specific immune responses that contribute to protective immunity in humans following Plasmodium infection are yet to be fully characterized. The species P. vivax and P. falciparum account for most human infections, yet little is known about P. vivax specific immune responses and whether they are similar to or distinct from P. falciparum. Here, we establish that P. vivax and P. falciparum elicit distinct cellular immune responses following primary infection, with the expansion of a subset of CD38+ CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic potential in P. vivax but not in P. falciparum infection. This study provides the first evidence for the activation of CD8+ T cells in P. vivax blood-stage infection and demonstrates the existence of species-dependent host immune responses to malaria. These findings have important implications for P. vivax vaccine development, and suggest that future malaria vaccine studies should be adapted according to the target Plasmodium spp.
