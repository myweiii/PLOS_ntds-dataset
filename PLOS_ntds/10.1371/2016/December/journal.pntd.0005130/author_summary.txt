Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the brain and a common cause of epilepsy in many countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa. In this study, we applied a combination of head CT, serology and symptoms screening in a rural village in northern Peru. We found that the infection was very common in this community, where nearly one in five adults had calcified lesions in the brain. While the majority of these people reported never had experienced seizures, brain calcifications are known to result in chronic intermittent seizures in some. Follow-up studies are needed to help understand how many people with calcifications will go on to experience seizures in their lifetime, and to better predict those who are at greatest risk so that preventive intervention can be offered.
