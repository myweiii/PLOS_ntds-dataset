Leishmaniasis is a poverty-related disease threatening 350 million people throughout the world. It is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, a digenetic organism that switches from an extracellular stage in the sand fly vector to an intracellular stage in phagocytes of the vertebrate host. Drugs currently available to treat leishmaniasis are toxic to the patient and drug-resistant parasites are emerging, urging for new therapeutics. A novel strategy to tackle intracellular pathogens entails targeting the host cell, in order to indirectly interfere with pathogens growth. Here we analysed the mechanism of action of naloxonazine, a compound previously shown to specifically affect the intracellular amastigote stage of Leishmania. We show that this compound affects acidic compartments of macrophages and that these naloxonazine-induced modifications are responsible for Leishmania intracellular growth inhibition. Even though the therapeutic potential of naloxonazine itself is not proven, our results reveal the possibility of targeting host cell intracellular acidic compartments for anti-leishmanial therapy.
