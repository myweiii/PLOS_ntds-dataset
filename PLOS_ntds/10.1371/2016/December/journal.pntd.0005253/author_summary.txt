Strongyloides stercoralis, one of the most neglected helminths causes strongyloidiasis mainly in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The parasiteâ€™s complex lifecycle includes sexual and asexual reproduction outside and inside the host, respectively. The parasite can also asexually complete a life cycle within the host's body, which is called autoinfection causing life-long infection. In order to investigate the population structure and transmission patterns of this parasite we sequenced individual nematodes isolated from human faeces in Japan and Myanmar, where the parasite is present at low and high frequencies, respectively. Whole genome sequencing of small parasites is generally difficult because the amount of DNA is limiting. However, we overcame this problem by combining whole genome amplification with next-generation sequencing. Sequence comparisons revealed 0.6% of the genome is variable among samples, and the variants showed clear separation by the location of their origin. We found that heterozygosity within the genomes was higher in Japan, which is likely explained by the predominance of asexual reproduction through auto-infection, suggesting that analyses of heterozygosity are required to better understand the history of a population.
