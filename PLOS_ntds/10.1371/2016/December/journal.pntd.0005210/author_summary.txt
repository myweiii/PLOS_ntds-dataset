Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) are the primary measures for cholera prevention and control. Since 2010, oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) have been recommended as an additional tool for endemic and epidemic cholera prevention and control. Given the relatively new use of OCVs in public health programs, there is limited information on the impact of OCV use on traditional WaSH activities, i.e., can they serve as complementary tools, or will OCV use have a negative impact on WaSH-related behaviors? This study reports the findings of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys conducted before and after a preventive OCV campaign (2013) in a long-standing refugee camp in Thailand, where frequent cholera outbreaks had occurred in recent years. The surveys demonstrated high acceptability of the OCV campaign and several modest improvements in cholera and WaSH KAPs among the camp population. OCV campaigns may be used as opportunities to reinforce cholera and WaSH-related messaging towards strengthening comprehensive cholera prevention and control.
