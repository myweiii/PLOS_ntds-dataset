The huge challenge in parasitic chemotherapy development is finding a specific compound to attack the parasite organisms without damaging their host. Schistosoma mansoni, which is the causative agent of schistosomiasis, is one of the major health concerns in the developing world. Purine bases are essential for organisms that make DNA, RNA and energetic molecules during parasitic growth and egg laying. The parasites depend entirely on re-utilizing existing purines, not being able to synthesize them from more simple molecules. The adenosine phosphorylase is an important activity for this process and kinetic assays we performed with this S. mansoni MTAP confirm that it displays this specific activity that is not present in the human metabolism. Therefore, understanding the properties of this enzyme is an important step in achieving an efficient anti-schistosomiasis drug with minimal collateral effects to humans.
