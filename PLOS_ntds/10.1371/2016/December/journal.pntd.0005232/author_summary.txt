Portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is classified as type B hepatic encephalopathy. Portal-systemic shunting rather than liver dysfunction is the main cause of PSE in chronic hepatic schistosomiasis japonicum (HSJ) patients. Chronic HSJ patients with PSE are frequently misdiagnosed as suffering from dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, there are few studies of this type of encephalopathy. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used as a noninvasive tool to detect abnormalities in brain metabolism in chronic HSJ patient with PSE. The results demonstrate that MRS would be useful for the diagnosis of PSE in chronic HSJ patients. Based on the results, a diagnostic procedure for PSE has also been proposed.
