West Nile virus is endemic in Australia, and is considered benign in relation to strains that circulate globally. In 2011, a more pathogenic variant emerged which caused disease in horses. To understand the evolution of the virus, and as a background to the emergence of the pathogenic strain, we used high throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics tools to obtain an overview of the evolution of the virus over 50 years. A single lineage regardless of the collection site was apparent. This was also supported by the pattern of changes in sequence between the isolates. The most significant finding was that the single lineage nature of the virusâ€™s evolution infers that regional strains circulate for some years before becoming extinct. The regional strains must then be replaced by continual re-seeding, most likely by waterbirds that disseminate the virus across the continent after above average rainfall. There were changes in the nucleotide sequence that had become established at a population level. These were related to the structure of the viral proteins: in particular the envelope protein, the helicase (NS3) and methyltransferase domain of NS5. There were two changes in catalytic domains which may indicate some fine-tuning of replication.
