Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute tick-borne zoonotic disease. The causative agent, CCHF virus (CCHFV), has the most extensive geographical distribution of the medically important tick-borne viral diseases with a distribution over much of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and expanding areas of south-eastern Europe. Whilst the main route of human infection with CCHFV is predominantly through tick bite, it can also be spread via bodily fluids and it has a reputation for causing nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare settings. Whilst CCHFV has been identified in ticks from Nigeria since 1970, there is scarce information on human infection. Within this report, the prevalence of CCHFV-reactive antibodies has been assessed in human sera providing evidence of continued circulation of the virus in the human population of Borno state, Nigeria. Additionally, in one sample the presence of viral RNA was detected which allowed a full sequence of the CCHFV to be obtained. This is the first report of CCHFV being associated in a human case from Nigeria and the full genetic characterisation of the virus being completed. The evidence within supports the hypothesis that CCHFV is endemic in Nigeria and should be considered as an aetiological agent in febrile patients.
