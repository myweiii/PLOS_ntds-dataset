Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a relatively novel vector-borne zoonotic disease, with long and irregular periods between outbreaks. Although outbreaks are highly correlated with occurrence of abnormal rainfall and flooding regimes, there have been instances with above normal rainfall where no disease outbreaks were recorded. This suggests that while rainfall might be the major determinant for the onset and switch-off of an outbreak, it may not be the only factor responsible for the temporal characteristic pattern of RVF outbreaks. We suspect that apart from influence of environmental conditions, disease outbreaks result from build up phenomena that depend on vertical transmission efficiency. Therefore, in this study we focus on formulating a stochastic host-vector model with two routes of transmission (horizontal and vertical) without seasonality to investigate the role of vertical transmission in the dynamics of the disease. First we apply branching process theory to characterize the relationships between vertical transmission and invasion probability and between vertical transmission and extinction probability. Finally, we apply an analytic approach, van Kampenâ€™s system size expansion method to characterize disease complex fluctuations that are simply a result of interaction between demographic stochasticity, non-linearity and vertical transmission efficiency. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the frequency and intensity of RVF outbreaks by simply reducing the efficiency of vertical transmission.
