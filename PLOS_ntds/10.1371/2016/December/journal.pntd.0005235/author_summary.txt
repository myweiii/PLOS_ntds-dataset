Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive mosquito species and a competent vector of dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and other arboviruses. In the absence of therapeutics, vector control is the only means of controlling these diseases. Larvicides are important tool to limit mosquito populations. Backpack and low volume sprayers are heavily used for ground-based larvicide applications, but their potential to reach hidden or cryptic larval habitats is not well established. In the present study, we found that Ae. albopictus shows a strong oviposition preference for cryptic cups. Moreover, cryptic cups received limited droplet penetration using conventional spray methodologies, resulting in almost negligible larval mortality as compared to open cups in field experiments. We further evaluated the efficacy of an autodissemination station to deliver the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen to cryptic cups in field experiments. Autodissemination shows good efficacy in transferring toxic concentrations of pyriproxyfen to cryptic cups and may provide a significant advantage over sprayers in delivering insecticide to the cryptic larval habitats strongly preferred by Ae. albopictus.
