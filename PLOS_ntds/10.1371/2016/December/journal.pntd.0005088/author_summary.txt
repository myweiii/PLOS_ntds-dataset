Can building knowledge, increasing the awareness of rights and developing confidence through counselling empower people affected by leprosy and reduce the stigma that surrounds them? In this paper the authors describe the impact of a counselling module designed to address the widespread issue of stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia. The module ran for a two-year period and has some unique features. For example, it integrates three different types of counselling: individual, family and group. During the counselling, medical information about leprosy was provided and awareness of rights (e.g. right to healthcare, right to education) was raised. The counselling was offered by lay and peer counsellors, the latter having been affected by leprosy, to a total 260 people. This study showed that counselling can be effective in reducing stigma. The authors recommend its application on a larger scale.
