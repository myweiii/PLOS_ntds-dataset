In recent years spatial modelling studies of schistosome and soil-transmitted helminth infections have become commonplace; however there is no standard framework for uncertainty evaluation and reporting. In this study we aim to identify faults in existing studies and propose a framework for evaluation and reporting. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify the gaps in knowledge in relation to how uncertainty is dealt with in existing studies addressing the spatial modelling of helminth infections. It was found that none of the studies considered adequately all sources of uncertainty. Uncertainty in the response variables and covariates should be incorporated into the modelling framework. More attention should be given to mapping and interpreting uncertainty, and to quantify the different sources of uncertainty present in the observed covariates (environmental variables), measured response variable (morbidity indicators), used model and uncertainty representation and interpretation of the predicted morbidity indicators.
