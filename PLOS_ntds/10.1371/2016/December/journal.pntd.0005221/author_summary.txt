Addressing the vast reservoir of asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax carriers clustered in hard-to-reach rural communities is a major challenge faced by countries approaching malaria elimination across Latin America and Asia. Routine surveillance targets subjects presenting with fever or reporting recent fever, but overlooks asymptomatic infections that might be otherwise detected by periodic mass blood surveys of the entire population at risk. Here we show that subjects living in close proximity to malaria cases detected by routine passive surveillance are much more likely to carry both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections than randomly selected inhabitants in the same farming settlements in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. Four rounds of microscopy-based screening for malaria parasites targeted at these high-risk subjects would identify 49.5% of the parasite carriers (who together harbored 76.8% of the total P. vivax biomass circulating in the proximity of index cases) detected by a more sensitive molecular method. Whether subpatent and asymptomatic carriers outside the identified clusters of symptomatic infections, beyond the reach of our screening, represent a significant parasite reservoir remains undetermined. The extensive genetic diversity found in local P. vivax populations suggests that multiple sources of infection fuel ongoing residual transmission within malaria clusters, further complicating current elimination efforts.
