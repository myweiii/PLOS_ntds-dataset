Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. During its life cycle, this parasite alternates between proliferative/non-infective forms and forms that are infective but not able to proliferate. Some stressors, such as acidic pH and starvation, trigger the transition from one form to another; however, many molecules involved in this response remain to be identified. Replication Protein A (RPA) is a single stranded DNA binding protein involved in many functions of DNA metabolism, such as DNA replication and repair. Although RPA is well characterized in yeast and mammalian cells, nothing is known about this heterotrimer in T. cruzi. Here, we demonstrated that T. cruzi RPA is involved in canonical functions of DNA metabolism. Accordingly, when we reduced the expression levels of subunit 2 of TcRPA (TcRPA-2) the growth of the replicative form of T. cruzi was compromised. Moreover, we observed that the impairment of cell growth is linked with the differentiation process because the reduction of the level of TcRPA-2 increased the capacity of the proliferative epimastigote form to differentiate into an infective metacyclic trypomastigote one. In conclusion, TcRPA has canonical functions in the ancient eukaryote T. cruzi and is also involved in the control of life cycle progression.
