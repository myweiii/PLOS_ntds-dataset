The coincidental infection of a host with two different pathogens is widespread in low-income countries. Regions where helminth infections are endemic strongly overlap with areas where the incidence of viral infections such as HIV is high. HIV is a major public health issue causing more than 1 million deaths per year. To analyse the impact of a pre-existing helminth infection on a viral infection we established a helminth/retrovirus co-infection mouse model. Mice that were first infected with Litomosoides sigmodontis and subsequently with a murine retrovirus showed a more severe course of virus infection, i.e. exaggerated splenomegaly and higher viral loads. Since different lymphocytes such as B and T cells contribute to viral control we analysed the cellular and humoral immune response. While T cell responses were similar in co-infected and virus-infected mice, we observed reduced titres of virus-specific antibodies in co-infected mice. Our results suggest that helminth infection interfered with viral control by dampening the virus-specific antibody response. The viral infection itself altered the humoral immune response against L. sigmodontis without changing the worm burden. In summary, our data highlight the importance of deworming programs or vaccines against helminths in developing countries where the incidence of helminth/HIV co-infections is high.
