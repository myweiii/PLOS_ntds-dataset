There are many gaps in our knowledge of muscle damage caused by snake venoms. Russell’s vipers are more medically important than any other snake in Asia. Sri Lankan Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) bites have been reported to cause muscle damage in humans, which is not reported for other Russell’s vipers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the onset, severity and resolution of the muscle damage and to identify the toxins responsible for myotoxicity. For this, we studied muscle damage in 245 patients with confirmed Sri Lankan Russell’s viper bites. Patients reported local muscle pain in 72% of cases and generalised muscle pain in 15%. None had severe muscle damage and the symptoms resolved in 80% of patients within 4 days. Measurement of biomarkers of muscle damage in patient blood was consistent with only mild muscle injury, even in patients with symptoms. Two toxins were isolated from Sri Lankan Russell’s viper venom that had similar myotoxic activity to whole venom in chick muscle preparations. Both toxins were weak myotoxins, consistent with what was seen in patients.
