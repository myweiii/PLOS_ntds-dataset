Many of the large-scale helminth control programs around the world have primarily relied upon drug treatment. Reliance on drug treatment alone does not deal with the ultimate causes of infection, resulting in reduced infection levels only in the short-term. Re-emergence of infections and possibly even development of drug resistance in parasites are common once the programs have been terminated. There is thus a need for consideration of a broader context, including environmental influence and healthcare focus, within which infections thrive. This study examines the roles of a reservoir dam environment, inter-provincial healthcare focus variation, and socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors to highlight the varying roles of such factors contributing to this disease landscape. The findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach in infection studies in order to provide more sustainable disease treatment and elimination outcomes.
