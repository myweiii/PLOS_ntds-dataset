Raccoon rabies, a type of rabies found most frequently in raccoons, is common in the eastern U.S. Raccoon rabies is at times controlled through oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programs, in which baits containing rabies vaccine are distributed throughout the affected area to be consumed by wildlife, which then develop immunity limiting their ability to spread the disease in the population. A rabies outbreak was not detected in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island until 2004, when an ORV program was rapidly initiated in response to the discovery of a rabies-positive raccoon. As a result, raccoon rabies was eliminated in January 2009. Some questioned whether the benefits of the ORV program outweighed its costs. To find out, we performed a benefit-cost analysis of the program using avoided medical and animal testing costs to value the benefits. We also used a regional economic model to estimate the effect of the program on the economy of New York State. The results of both analyses indicated that the program had a positive economic impact, increasing employment and income in the region. The ORV program also benefited public health by reducing the need for medical treatment after possible rabies exposures. This study provides insight into the economic value of a program to eliminate rabies from an isolated area.
