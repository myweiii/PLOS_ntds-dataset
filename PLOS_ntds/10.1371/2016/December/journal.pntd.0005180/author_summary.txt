Vaccines are a mainstay for the prevention of morbidity and mortality to numerous infectious diseases. Concurrent schistosomiasis infection at the time of immunizations has been implicated in the impairment of protective immune responses to vaccines. We asked if schistosomiasis at the initiation of the hepatitis B vaccine series and tetanus toxoid boost in adults would impact the subsequent immune responses to those vaccines. We found that Schistosoma mansoni infection did not block the production of antibodies to either tetanus toxoid or hepatitis B vaccine. However, the kinetics of the antibody responses differed between the schistosomiasis-infected and control groups, with lower median antibody titers to hepatitis B vaccine and a more rapid decline of antibodies against tetanus toxoid in the S. mansoni-positive group. The data indicate that this could put the individuals who are positive for S. mansoni at the start of primary or secondary immunizations at risk for losing protective antibody levels more quickly than those without schistosomiasis.
