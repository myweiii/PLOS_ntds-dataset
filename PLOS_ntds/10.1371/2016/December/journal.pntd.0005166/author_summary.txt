Roundworms infect millions of humans and pigs throughout the world. The pig roundworm A. suum is a good model for A. lumbricoides infection in humans due to similar host physiology and the close genetic relationship between the worms. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize early larval antigens that are targeted by antibodies at the level of the intestine in immune pigs and to evaluate their protective and diagnostic potential. In order to do so, we generated highly immune pigs by repeatedly infecting them with A. suum for a long time (32 weeks). After necropsy, locally harvested antibodies from the gut were used to screen larval extracts. Hereby one particular antigen, named As12, was detected. It was characterized as a molecule of glycolipid nature that is presented on, and actively secreted from, the surface of infective larvae. Pigs immunized with this antigen are not protected from subsequent challenge infection. Experimentally infected pigs or naturally infected humans do however mount a significant serological antibody response to the antigen. These findings shed light on a glycolipid-like antigen (As12) that is secreted by infectious Ascaris larvae and is targeted by the immune system of infected humans and pigs.
