Leptospirosis, caused by Leptospira, is one of the most important neglected emerging zoonotic diseases that has important impacts on public health worldwide. An urgent need exists for novel therapeutic agents directed against Leptospira without severe side-effects. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pcAb) measured by survival rate, pathological changes and Leptospira burden. The pcAb can cure the homologous serotype and heterologous serotype Leptospira lethal infection 48 hours after challenge. We also provide a reference dose of pcAb for treating human or dog leptospirosis. In addition, combination of pcAb with antibiotic improved survival compared to antibiotic group in late treatment of homotype leptospirosis in hamster. However, additional clinical research is needed to identify the efficacy in humans.
