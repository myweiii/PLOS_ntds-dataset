Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is caused by parasitic worms which live in the lymphatic system. Though several body parts may be affected, LF characteristically leads to the enlargement of limbs, causing pain, physical disability and social stigma. Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is caused by similar worms which inhabit the subcutaneous tissue and lead to disturbing skin lesions, visual impairment and blindness. Onchocerciasis and LF affect over 146 million people, and have been targeted for elimination as public health problems by the World Health Organisation, using mass drug administration (MDA). Although the drugs used in MDA are generally well tolerated, individuals who are highly co-infected with Loa loa are at risk of experiencing serious adverse events. In order to inform decisions on whether MDA can be safely administered in a community, we investigate the relationship between community level prevalence of Loa loa and individual infection levels through the development of a statistical model. We find a strong positive correlation and show how this can be exploited to estimate the proportion of individuals highly infected with Loa loa without the need for data on individual infection levels. The model therefore provides a method to assess the risk of rolling out MDA in a specific community, or to guide policy decisions.
