Miltefosine and amphotericin B are two leading molecules in the fight against the vector-borne disease Leishmaniasis. We demonstrate here that different point mutations in a P-type ATPase could play an important role in resistance, not only to miltefosine, but also to amphotericin B. Furthermore, macrophage-infecting amastigotes that are resistant to one drug are cross-resistant to the other one. Our experimental findings demonstrate that one of the mechanisms driving miltefosine and amphotericin B resistance in Leishmania parasites involve major changes in a number of lipid species. In addition, we experimentally show that different mutations in the P-type ATPase participate in resistance against these two leading leishmanicidal agents with mechanistic differences. Miltefosine-induced mutations cause a defect in miltefosine uptake, but this mechanism of resistance is not observed for the amphotericin B-induced mutations. These results point to profound clinical implications as combination therapy involving these two drugs is being promoted for the treatment of visceral Leishmaniasis.
