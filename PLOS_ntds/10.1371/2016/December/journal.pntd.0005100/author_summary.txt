Leishmania braziliensis is the main cause leishmaniasis that affects skin and upper airways mucosa in Brazil. Atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) presentations are difficult to diagnose and treat, and do not fit the classical descriptions of the disease. It is not clear whether ACL share unique features or which are its determinants. In our research we found that ACL occur in the vicinity of the more common localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients in the study region, so individuals are equally exposed to risks of acquiring either disease. We also found that L. braziliensis from ACL share genetic traits not commonly identified among parasites from CL, so parasite strain is one plausible risk factor for ACL. Finally, blood cells from ACL produced levels of immune proteins known to participate in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis that were distinct from those of CL patients. We conclude that atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis in Northeast Brazil may be considered a clinical presentation per se, in part resulting from infection of human beings with distinct strains of L. braziliensis. Precise identification of ACL is important because it usually does not respond to drugs commonly used to treat leishmaniasis in Brazil, but readily responds to other treatment options available.
