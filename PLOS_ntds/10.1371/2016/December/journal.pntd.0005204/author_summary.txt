Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental Gram-negative bacillus and the causative agent of melioidosis. Culture and PCR assays are standard diagnostic tools used to detect B. pseudomallei in the environment. However, those tests require experienced microbiologists and are regularly conducted only in a few research laboratories worldwide. In this study, we demonstrated that the prototype lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) developed to detect B. pseudomallei capsular polysaccharide (CPS) in clinical samples could be used to detect B. pseudomallei in environmental samples. We found that the LFI can be used to detect B. pseudomallei in experimentally spiked soil specimens. Next, we evaluated the sensitivity of LFI using 105 soil samples collected in Northeast Thailand. We found that the LFI had high sensitivity to detect B. pseudomallei in the soil. We propose that the LFI could be used to detect environmental B. pseudomallei in resource-limited settings. Soil samples positive for LFI could be sent to reference laboratories for confirmation with culture or molecular methods. The use of LFI could assist in the development of a global risk map for melioidosis.
