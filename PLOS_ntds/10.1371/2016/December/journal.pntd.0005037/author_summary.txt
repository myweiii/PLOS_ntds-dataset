Advocacy around mass treatment for the elimination of selected Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has typically put the cost per person treated at less than US$ 0.50. Whilst useful for advocacy, the focus on a single number misrepresents the complexity of delivering “free” donated medicines to about a billion people across the world. Given the increasing focus of the NTD community on value for money and, in the context of universal health coverage, of the global health community on outreach beyond health facilities, there was a need for greater nuance. We performed the most comprehensive literature review and first regression analysis of differences between settings in the cost per person treated against six NTDs (excluding the cost of individual medicines). We considered more than ten possible drivers of cost. We found, for example, that the unit cost of treatment depends very much on the number of people treated (economies of scale). We then developed a web-based software application (https://healthy.shinyapps.io/benchmark/) that can be used to predict setting-specific unit costs against which programme budgets and expenditures or results-based pay-outs can be benchmarked.
