Biospeckle refers to a pattern that occurs when a laser beam illuminates a dynamic surface, such as a liquid that contains microorganisms. The movement or the roughness of its surface causes the wave fronts to interfere and produce a pattern of moving dots that resemble boiling water. This research describes the application of Biospeckle to Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The purpose was to observe the movement of the Biospeckle dots and to detect differences depending on the presence of the parasite, the quantity of the parasite and the conditions of the parasites when they are affected by a drug. We designed a method using VDRL plates where the sample has a relatively small volume and is flat shaped, a laser, a camera and a lens. The Biospeckle pattern is recorded in a video in a computer and shows the Biospeckle dots which move rapidly as the concentration of parasites increases and less rapidly as the concentration decreases or as the parasites are affected by a drug such as benznidazole. We designed algorithms which take the difference between successive frames and expressed them in a program in Java, in a script in R Commander and SAGA and in ImageJ. Thus we obtained a quantitative description of the movement of T. cruzi.
