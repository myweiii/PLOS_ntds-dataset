Vaccines are a crucial component of the current efforts to eliminate malaria, and much of the vaccine-related research on P. vivax has been focused on the Duffy binding protein II (DBPII), a ligand for human blood stage infection. A high proportion of individuals who are naturally exposed to P. vivax fail to develop neutralizing antibodies, but the host genetic factors modulating this immune response are poorly characterized. We investigated whether DBPII responsiveness was dependent on the variability of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II cell surface proteins involved in the regulation of immune responses. To obtain a reliable estimate of DBPII antibodies, we carried out a longitudinal study, collecting serum from the same individuals over a period of 12-months. The results confirmed the heritability of the DBPII immune response, with genetic variation in HLA class II genes influencing both the development and persistence of the antibody response. HLA class II genotype also influenced the ability of DBPII antibodies to block the ligand-receptor interaction in vitro. Computational approaches identified structural specificity between HLA variants, which we propose as an explanation for differences between a good or poor antibody responder. These results may have implications for vaccine development, and might lead to strategies for controlling the type of immune response activated in response to DBPII.
