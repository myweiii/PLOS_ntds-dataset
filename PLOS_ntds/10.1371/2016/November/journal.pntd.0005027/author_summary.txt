This research describes the process used to assist two districts endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Indonesia to better understand the reasons why their LF elimination programs have had suboptimal results. A novel survey design was used to collect stories about peopleâ€™s direct experiences with mass drug administration (MDA) for LF. These questionnaires also explored the reasons community members took or did not take the LF drugs. Following MDA in 2013, two baseline surveys in endemic communities provided insight into the district MDA programs. Together with district health officials, feasible recommendations were provided before the next MDA round in 2014. Uptake of these recommendations by the districts was high, although no additional funding was made available for programmatic changes. As a result, both districts reported significant improvements in their MDA coverage and compliance rates after the endline surveys were completed in 2015. This demonstrated the utility of the survey tool and process to impact change and improvement in MDA programs.
