Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease mainly affecting rural agricultural communities in tropical and subtropical countries. The acute effects of snake envenoming have been widely studied and well characterized, but the long-term sequelae remain poorly characterized. Given the known acute effects of snake venom on the musculoskeletal system, we undertook a population-based study to assess the long-term musculoskeletal sequelae including disabilities in an agricultural community in Sri Lanka, which is a country with a high incidence of snakebites. Among 816 victims of snake envenoming in a single district, we found 26 (3.2%) to have musculoskeletal disabilities persisting for months to years since the snakebite. The disabilities were mostly in the lower limbs and ranged from swelling, muscle wasting, stiff joints, reduced muscle power, impaired balance, fixed deformities, chronic non-healing ulcers, long-standing lumps to limb or digit amputations. Cobra envenoming accounted for a third of these disabilities while another third was related to Russellâ€™s and hump-nosed viper bites; the snake was not identified among the rest. Our study provides population-based data on the long-term musculoskeletal disabilities of snakebites and highlights the need for early institution of specialised care and rehabilitation in regions where snakebite is a public health problem.
