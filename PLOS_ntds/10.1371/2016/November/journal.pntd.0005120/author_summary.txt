Nipah virus is a highly fatal paramyxovirus that causes respiratory and neurologic disease with widespread vascular damage. Although end stage disease has been characterized in humans and in animal models, the early phase of infection has yet to be described. Thus, it is known where the virus replicates during the final stages of infection, but not how the virus is transported to these end stage tissues or which tissues are targeted first. Using Syrian hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with virus as a model of Nipah virus infection, we show here that Nipah virus initially targets the respiratory tract, specifically the nasal cavity and lung, with virus replication being detected as early as 8 hours after inoculation. During the first 48 hours of infection, the virus slowly penetrates into the underlying tissues of the respiratory tract, but viremia and virus replication in the brain are not detected. In the lung, Nipah virus initially infects epithelial cells lining airways, followed by spread to arterial smooth muscle cells, suggesting that localized spread of the virus within an organ can lead to viral dissemination into the vasculature. Likewise, replication in the olfactory epithelium likely precedes spread of Nipah virus along the olfactory nerve into the brain. Understanding how Nipah virus spreads through the host to cause encephalitis is important for developing effective countermeasures that can target Nipah virus replication and prevent viral dissemination.
