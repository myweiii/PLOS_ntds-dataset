Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a chronic zoonotic disease causing serious global socio-economic losses in human and animal hosts. Two main aspects make it extremely difficult to study risk factors associated with human CE, the parasiteâ€™s unknown and apparently long incubation period which may last for several years, and the predominantly fecal-oral transmission route. This systematic review (SR) summarizes findings from relevant publications on this topic and provides a detailed list of potential risk factors (PRFs) associated with CE infection in humans. Free dog roaming, dogs having access to offal, being a dog-owner and slaughtering at home or using inadequately supervised slaughterhouses have all been shown to be highly statistically significant PRFs associated with the perpetuation of the parasite life cycle in endemic areas. The effect of other risk factors identified in this SR can vary between geographically different areas and societies and could reflect socio-cultural determinants of infection.
