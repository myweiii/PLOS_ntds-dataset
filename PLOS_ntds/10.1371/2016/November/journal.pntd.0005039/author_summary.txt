Cholera is a life-threatening diarrheal disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Currently available oral cholera vaccines are less effective in young children, and some have hypothesized that this is related to environmental enteropathy, a problem in the gut characterized by alterations in intestinal permeability, absorption, and inflammation, which mainly affects young children in resource-limited settings. We measured cholera-specific immune responses in 40 Bangladeshi children aged 3â€“14 who received an oral cholera vaccine. We then identified host factors, such as enteropathy biomarkers, sex, age, and micronutrient status, associated with each immune response. Unexpectedly, we found enteropathy biomarkers to be positively associated with immune responses to vaccine, underlining the complexity of the interaction between enteropathy and oral vaccine immunogenicity.
