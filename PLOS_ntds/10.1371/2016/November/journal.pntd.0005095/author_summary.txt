Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease. As an imported disease in China, the imported cases play a vital role for the local dengue transmission. There were dengue outbreaks in three Provinces (covering nine Cities/Prefectures) of China in 2013, with several regions had their first dengue outbreak in history including the one from central China. There has been no study so far to explore the dengue transmission dynamics between different regions in China. The purpose of the study is to describe the 2013 dengue epidemiological characteristics and to explore the transmission dynamics of dengue viruses between epidemic focus. The study results indicated that repeated dengue virus introductions from Southeast Asia and subsequent domestic dengue transmission within different regions may have contributed to the dengue epidemics in China, 2013. Population movement could have played a critical role in dengue dynamic transmission, which introduced dengue viruses to non-epidemic areas at broad or finer spatial scales. Therefore, it should be considered in the design of mosquito eradication campaign for dengue control and prevention.
