Our data demonstrate that novel selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds reduced viral replication of three related New World alphaviruses, VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV, indicating that CRM1 is instrumental to their life cycle. The novel CRM1 inhibitors have a large selective index and represent a potential pan-antiviral therapeutic that targets the hostâ€™s transport proteins, which are hijacked by the New World alphaviruses.
