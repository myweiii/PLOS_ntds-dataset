The control of snails involved in transmission of trematodes plays a key role in the fight against these parasitic diseases. While some snails have been studied thoroughly, only few genomic and proteomic studies have focused on Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, the snail intermediate host for Opisthorchis viverrini, and none of them separately analyzed the cellular and humoral arms of the snailâ€™s immune system. Here, we applied a label-free proteomic approach to identify and quantify the proteins from the hemolymph of B. siamensis goniomphalos experimentally infected with O. viverrini. We identified several immune response proteins that could play critical roles at the snail-trematode interface, generating important new information on the molecular interactions between flukes and their intermediate snail hosts. This work will contribute towards generating a body of knowledge that will ultimately result in the control of O. viverrini transmission in endemic areas.
