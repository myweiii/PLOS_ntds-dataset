Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease exclusively located in sub-Saharan and southern Africa where it is transmitted by infected tsetse flies and is caused by a blood parasite named Trypanosoma brucei. Because of limited alternatives, toxicity and high expense new treatment options are urgently needed for patients with this deadly disease and related diseases. Sterols are important for building cell membranes and are precursors for the synthesis of powerful bioactive molecules, such as steroid hormones in mammals. Among the enzymes required for sterol production, one class (named CYP51), share similar functions and importantly these enzymes are found in all biological kingdoms, including in the sleeping sickness parasite. We have studied the role of trypanosome CYP51 and found that when native levels are diminished experimentally, parasite survival and division are radically diminished resulting in cell death but this can be rescued by the addition of ergosterol. We observed that parasites with diminished level of CYP51 enzyme were less virulent in mice. We also show that posaconazole, a clinically used antifungal and potential CYP51 inhibitor, augments parasite killing when used in combination with currently used trypanocidal drugs. Thus our results suggest that a specific targeting of the enzyme could be a potential strategy to treat HAT.
