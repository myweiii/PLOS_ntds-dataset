Neurocysticercosis is caused by the accidental ingestion of eggs from Taenia solium whose larvae lodge in the central nervous system. In this study we found that cysts within the cerebrospinal fluid leaded to high rates of raised intracranial pressure, meningitis, seizures and headache. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance are useful for diagnosis, identification of the compromised sites of the central nervous system and, then, for treatment guidance. The pattern of lesions identified through magnetic resonance in our paper helps physicians on searching and analyzing some typical findings of extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis.
