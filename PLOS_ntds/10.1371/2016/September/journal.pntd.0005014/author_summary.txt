In parallel with the tremendous reduction in malaria burden, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is now the predominant malaria species in the Asia-Pacific and Americas. Pv can only invade young erythrocytes (reticulocytes) and this restriction is thought to involve the Reticulocyte-Binding Protein family (PvRBP). Given their predicted role, PvRBPs are potentially interesting vaccine targets. However, the acquisition of immunity to Pv in general (PvRBPs in particular) is poorly understood, hindering vaccine development. Here, we show that out of five PvRBPs, only one (PvRBP2b) binds exclusively to reticulocytes. Furthermore, we measured antibody levels to all six PvRBPs in a cohort of young Papua New Guinean children, assessing the relationship between antibodies to PvRBPs and risk of malaria disease. Both total and specific antibody subclass levels (IgG1 and IgG3) to the reticulocyte-specific binder PvRBP2b, and the non-specific binder PvRBP1a were strongly associated with lower risk of clinical disease. Our findings indicate a diversity of roles of PvRBPs in erythrocyte invasion and highlight their importance as targets of the naturally acquired immunity to Pv. Functional studies of the role of PvRBPs in reticulocyte invasion will be required to fully understand the potential of PvRBP1a and PvRBP2b as vaccine candidates.
