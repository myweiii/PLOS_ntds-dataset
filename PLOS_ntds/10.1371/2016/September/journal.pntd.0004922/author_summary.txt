Our work quantifies the economic and health burden associated with hookworm infection by country, WHO region, and worldwide. We also evaluated the burden by age, various costing methodologies, and ran an extensive sensitivity analysis on key and debated parameters to determine the robustness of our modelâ€™s resulting estimates. We report the DALYs associated with hookworm infections with consequent health outcomes in 2016 and show the impact that varying disability weights and likelihoods of anemia have on the estimates. Additionally, our study identified potential targets for future studies and data collection. Our results provide important information for decision makers. Without a better understanding of the economic and health burden of hookworm worldwide and in different countries, it is difficult for decision makers such as funders, policy makers, disease control officials, and intervention manufacturers to determine how much time, energy, and resources to invest in hookworm control. Our results can also help decision makers know where hookworm should fall on their priority lists and allocate limited resources.
