Typhoid fever, a serious bloodstream infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, is a major cause of disease and death around the world. There have been limited data on the epidemiology of typhoid in many countries in sub-Saharan African, including Nigeria. Recent evidence, however, showed that typhoid was an important cause of bacteraemia in children residing in two regions of Nigeria. Here, we analyzed the whole genome sequences of 128 S. Typhi isolates from two studies in order to elucidate the population structure and characterize the genetic components of antimicrobial resistance. We found that the multiple S. Typhi genotypes identified were closely related to other S. Typhi from neighboring regions of Africa and that multidrug resistance (MDR) was common among these isolates, and in many cases was associated with the IncHI1 plasmid known to cause MDR typhoid. These results provide evidence that typhoid was established in Nigeria as a result of several independent introductions into the country and that there has been extensive exchange of S. Typhi in and around the region of West Africa. This study emphasizes the importance of surveillance to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of typhoid, which is needed to underpin public health measures to reduce the spread of disease and facilitate patient management.
