Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that shows tremendous genetic diversity evinced in at least six Discrete Typing Units and massive genetic diversity within TcI. Two clinical phases exist where acute phase shows high parasitemia and chronic phase shows low and intermittent parasite dynamics. One particularity of the disease is the diagnosis, because the parasitemia is highly variable during the phases of the disease. Molecular tests allow detecting DNA of the parasite in all clinical phases. Herein, we determined the operating characteristics of two molecular tests (cPCR and qPCR) to evaluate the performance of these tests for diagnosis of Chagas disease in 708 Colombian patients. We determined the parasitic loads and DTUs to assess how is the behaviour of these characteristics in relation to the clinical phases. We found that the performance of qPCR was higher compared to cPCR and the molecular tests are a precise tool for diagnostic of Chagas disease, mainly in the acute phase. The parasitemia was higher in the acute phase compared to chronic phase and the DTU predominant in Colombian patients was TcI. The behaviour of TcIDom genotype in the chronic phase patients evidenced possible relationship with the chronicity of the disease.
