West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne neurotropic flavivirus that has emerged as a human pathogen of global scale. During recent WNV outbreaks in the US, half of the reported human cases were classified as neuroinvasive disease. Although much research has been done, there are still gaps in our understanding of WNV neuropathogenesis. While WNV neuroinvasion is proposed to occur by the hematogenous route and/or by axonal transport along the peripheral nerves, how virus spreads once within the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of viral antigens in the CNS of monkeys that were intrathalamically inoculated with WNV. Next, we mapped the localization of WNV-infected neurons to specific anatomical structures, identified the intraneuronal localizations of WNV particles and investigated the role of neuronal connectivity in the spread of WNV within the CNS. Our results revealed that all structures containing WNV-labeled neurons belonged to the pathways of motor control. Virions were found in close vicinity to the axodendritic synapses, strongly indicating transsynaptic spread of the virus. Neuronal connectivity-based reconstruction of the directionality of transsynaptic virus spread suggests that, within the CNS, WNV can utilize both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport to infect connected neurons.
