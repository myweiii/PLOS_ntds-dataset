Leptospirosis is a febrile disease responsible for high morbidity rates all around the world. It is caused by spirochete bacteria in the genus Leptospira and transmitted to humans through animal urine or contaminated soil or water. The epidemiology of leptospirosis has been extensively studied in urban communities, where rats are thought to be the main animal reservoir of the disease. However, leptospirosis has been under-reported and under-studied in low-income rural areas where different conditions may result in different transmission risks. In two low-income rural communities near the coast of Ecuador, we detected and characterized leptospira from febrile patients and putative animal reservoirs. Our results show the complexity of leptospirosis epidemiology and suggest that livestock may serve as an under recognized source of leptospirosis. Understanding the epidemiology of leptospirosis in many settings provide insights into transmission that can ultimately be used to to prevent and control this disease.
