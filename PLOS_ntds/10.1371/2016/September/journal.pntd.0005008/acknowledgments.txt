We are grateful to the village chief of Moronou, Biguin and Biakale for allowing us to conduct these trials and to all the hospital staff, technicians, nurses and doctors who assisted us during the work and made it smooth and pleasant. We would like to thank the participants for having provided the samples and for their good compliance.
