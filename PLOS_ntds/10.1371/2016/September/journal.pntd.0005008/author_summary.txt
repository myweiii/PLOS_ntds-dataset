Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects millions of people all over the world and it is due to schistosomes, helminths (worms) that infect the intestine and the urinary bladder. Treatment options are limited, with praziquantel being the only used drug. The antimalarial Synriam and the anthelminthic moxidectin revealed good action against this worm in previous studies. We conducted two studies in Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium-infected adolescents in Côte d’Ivoire. Subjects positive for the infection were allocated by chance to the four groups of treatment (moxidectin, Synriam, Synriam plus praziquantel or praziquantel); participants did not know which drug they took. Our aim was to calculate how many participants were negative after the treatment and how did the intensity of infection change before and after treatment. Each subject provided stools and urines for examination. 128 adolescents were included in each study. Moxidectin and Synriam did not work well against S. haematobium. Against S. mansoni, only a small part of the participants were negative after treatment in all treatment groups, but the intensity of infections were reduced. Further studies are needed to better understand this result.
