With the growing list of Burkholderia species, which represents a genus of bacteria with economical, health and biowarfare importance, the need for specific and efficient detection systems is also growing. Burkholderia pseudomallei is reported to be endemic in India. However, limited prevalence studies have been conducted in the country to determine the presence of this pathogen in environment. The high level of phenotypic and genotypic similarities of this bacterium with other species of the genus stands as a difficult challenge to differentiate them. Several molecular detection systems have been reported in this field, with a range of identification potential restricted to Burkholderia cepacia complex. The present study addresses the former mentioned challenges by performing a surveillance study in Malabar coastal region of South India wherein we encountered 22 strains of Burkholderia. Furthermore, we determined the utility of a novel gene for specific detection of the whole Burkholderia genus by developing a novel bdha based PCR assay. The study design includes extensive bioinformatic analyses and comparative genomics for the development of the described compound detection tool. The study also includes the evaluation of the genus-specific gene of its efficiency in specifically identifying the Burkholderia species by nucleotide sequencing based method. The novel genus-specific gene is also evaluated for its role in phylogeny of Burkholderia species in comparison with that of earlier reported recA and 16S rDNA genes.
