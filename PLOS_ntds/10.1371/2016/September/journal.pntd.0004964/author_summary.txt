Dengue has been detected in Indonesia and transmission is progressively rising to account for half of all fatal dengue cases recorded in South-East Asia. However, little is known about the epidemiology of the virus, which may hamper the effectiveness of preventive strategies carried out in the country. Identifying local risk factors is critical in assuring preventive measures are efficiently targeted. In this study we carried out a spatial, long-term analysis of all hospital-reported dengue cases in the 329 villages of the Banyumas Regency of Central Java, Indonesia between 2000 and 2013. We determined which variables, including environmental factors, geography, socio-economic status, and access to health services, significantly impacted the village-level risk of dengue infection between 2000 and 2013. Our data give a large scale overview of dengue risk factors in this Regency and to our knowledge is the first study of such scale in Indonesia. Our findings have the potential to guide targeted preventive planning locally as we identify intervention points in the socio-economic make up of this Regency. The outcomes of this study need to be confirmed in other affected areas of Indonesia.
