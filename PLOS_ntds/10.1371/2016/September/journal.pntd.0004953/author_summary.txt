CHIKV is transmitted to humans via mosquitos. CHIKV induces clinical signs similar to Influenza, Dengue, and Zika viruses. We have developed a molecular assay for the detection of CHIKV genome based on isothermal„recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay”performed at 42°C. The result was obtained in maximum of 15 minutes, which is 4–6 times faster than the current molecular diagnostic techniques. Our CHIKV RPA assay is rapid and sensitive, as well as easy to use at the point of need.
