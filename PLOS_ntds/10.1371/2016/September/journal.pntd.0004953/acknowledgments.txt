This paper would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all the field workers and the families that welcomed our research team in Armenia and Arauca. We acknowledge the contributions of the health secretaries of Armenia and Arauca, especially Andrés Cuervo and Dr. Luz Geny Gutiérrez, as well as Miquel Sitjar and Pau Varela, who supported the fieldwork and the creation of the questionnaire (with emocha, a mobile health care platform).
