Local vector control programs, as part of their routine activities, often use Knowledge Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys to guide their dengue control strategies. Usually, these questionnaires are extensive and result in a large amount of data that is difficult to analyze and summarize. This study uses an analytical approach to summarize the results of these types of questionnaires about dengue and subsequently assesses the effect of sociodemographic factors. Our results suggest that Multiple Correspondence Analysis is a useful statistical technique to summarize KAP survey information. Age and higher levels of education are related to more reported knowledge about dengue, but these effects are seen only among people in groups with low and middle knowledge of dengue, according to their KAP knowledge scores. Finally, when decisions about the family healthcare are made jointly by male and female members of the household, knowledge about the disease and means of transmission improves at all levels of knowledge (low, medium, high). Preventive practices regarding dengue, specifically against adult and immature forms of the mosquito that transmit the disease do not seem to be related to sociodemographic factors. This study provides an alternative way to more effectively analyze the results of KAP in a routine setting.
