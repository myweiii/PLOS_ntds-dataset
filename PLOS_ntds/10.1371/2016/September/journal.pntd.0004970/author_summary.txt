Visceral Leishmaniasis, commonly known as kala-azar, is one of the major health concerns for Bihar state in India. Time to time estimation of kala-azar incidence plays a pivotal role in defining and evaluating control strategies under National Kala-azar Elimination programme. The house-to-house survey approach, adopted several times for estimation of kala-azar incidence, requires huge logistics and operational cost as occurrence of kala-azar is clustered in nature. Snowball sampling approach is used to locate potential subjects with help of key informants where subjects are hard to locate. This is the first ever comparative study to assess efficacy, cost and feasibility of snowball sampling approach to house-to-house survey in capturing kala-azar cases. Snowball sampling was found cost-effective, but not sensitive enough as it captured about 50% of kala-azar cases. It captured deaths possibly due to kala-azar more efficiently (77%). However, standardization of snowball approach with improved procedure, training, logistics, etc. may enhance the sensitivity of snowball sampling and its application in national Kala-azar elimination programme as cost-effective approach for estimation of kala-azar burden.
