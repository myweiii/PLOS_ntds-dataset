Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease affecting ruminants and humans. It occurs mostly in Africa, causing human deaths and important economic losses in the livestock sector. The RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted from ruminant to ruminant by mosquitoes. Different climatic, environmental, and socio-economic factors may impact the transmission of the virus. Our work uses all current available knowledge on the epidemiology of the disease and geographic data to map areas suitable for RVFV. The study area includes four East African countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, three countries which have been historically affected by RVF, and Ethiopia, where the disease has never been reported but which shares borders with infected countries. The resulting maps are compared with the locations of outbreaks reported in livestock. Our results demonstrate the capacity of the spatial multi-criteria evaluation method to map with accuracy the areas suitable for RVF occurrence. Thus, the method we developed provides users with risk maps that could be used for early warning detection and implementation of control measures.
