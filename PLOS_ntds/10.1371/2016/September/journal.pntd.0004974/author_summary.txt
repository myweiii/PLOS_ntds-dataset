Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., has been increasingly recognized as an emerging zoonosis worldwide. In human cases, clinical presentation can vary from a mild flu-like syndrome to severe multi-organ failure including hepatitis, nephritis and occasionally meningitis. Particularly, pulmonary hemorrhage has become one of the major factors leading to fatality. The host coagulation system normally can be activated to confine damage caused by bacteria. However, this spirochete has developed several virulence proteins to manipulate hemostatic factors including fibrinogen (Fg). Previously, we had observed that Leptospira immunoglobulin-like protein B (LigB) can bind to Fg and inhibit fibrin clot formation. In this study, the LigB binding site on fibrinogen was fine-mapped. The key amino acids contributing to this strong pathogen-host interaction were also identified. In addition, LigB bound to factor XIII and further interfered with the cross-linking of Fg. For the first time, a potential mechanism of leptospiral adhesin binding to fibrinogen was revealed, which should provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
