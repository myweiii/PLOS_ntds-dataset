Leptospirosis is a neglected infectious disease of public health significance. It is one of the most important zoonosis worldwide, affecting at least 500,000 people each year of which approximately 10â€“20% of cases are fatal. Most of the cases occur in tropical developing countries which lack proper sanitation facilities. The complement system plays an important role to control this infection and pathogenic leptospires developed several strategies to escape from this system, for example, binding to complement regulatory proteins such as C4b binding protein (C4BP). In this work, we fine mapped the C4BP domains important for this evasion. We also mapped C4BP interactions with LigA and LigB, two surface proteins present in all pathogenic leptospires. The available leptospirosis vaccines are based on region-specific serovars and are not very protective. Consequently, the search of better vaccines is necessary and Lig A and Lig B represent promising vaccine candidates to immunize people worldwide. We believe that deeply understanding the interactions between C4BP with LigA and LigB could open new perspectives for immunotherapy and development of new drugs to be used during the first days of infection, when the production of specific antibodies is still low and the complement system plays an important role to control this infection.
