In many parts of Africa both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are endemic, and mixed species infections can be common. However, little is known about potential within-host interactions between the causative parasites, S. haematobium and S. mansoni, and how these might influence treatment success and post-treatment patterns of re-infection. Here, we bring together datasets from three West African countries to examine the epidemiological evidence for interactions between these two schistosome species relevant to the impact of treatment programmes using praziquantel (PZQ). Encouragingly, PZQ efficacy (in a double 40mg/kg dose format) was not significantly altered by co-infection, though since co-infections tended to be heavier, complete clearance was less likely than for single species infections. Despite positive associations in infection intensity for these two species at baseline, Senegalese children that were successfully treated for S. haematobium showed less intense re-infection if they were co-infected with S. mansoni at the point of treatment. Furthermore, in all three settings, the proportion of infections attributable to S. mansoni increased over successive rounds of PZQ treatment. These data suggest asymmetric competition may occur between S. haematobium and S. mansoni in the context of drug treatment, which may alter schistosome species composition as PZQ-based control programmes proceed.
