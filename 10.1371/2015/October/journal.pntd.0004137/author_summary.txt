Across the Americas, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis is the predominant Leishmania species causing cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in humans. Transmitted by Phlebotomine sandflies, questions remain about the epidemiological contributions of the numerous zoonotic and more domestic host species. Domestication of the principal vector and human infection patterns suggest that human infection risk is predominantly peridomestic, whereas control strategies will be more complex if there is a link to a wildlife transmission cycle. Almost no studies have been conducted on the transmission potential of natural hosts of L. (V.) braziliensis. This study evaluates the infectiousness of experimentally infected natural rodent host species, that in different ecological habitats are proposed to act as a single or a multi-host reservoir. Clinical and parasitological development, and the ability to transmit Leishmania to sandflies, was observed under experimental conditions using a single strain of L. (V.) braziliensis isolated from the wild rat, Necromys lasiurus. Xenodiagnoses were performed with laboratory bred sand fly females established from a local population of Lutzomyia longipalpis. All three rodent species developed disseminated subclinical parasitological infections, but clinical signs (lesions) were transient and self-resolving. N. squamipes, N. lasiurus and R. rattus were all infectious when asymptomatic, though their competence in transmission potential appears to differ with R. rattus showing signs of lower susceptibility. These results provide further evidence that a multi-host reservoir is responsible for maintaining transmission with a bridge between infectious sylvatic and peridomestic rodent populations.
