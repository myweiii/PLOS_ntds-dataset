Monocyte/macrophage subsets following their polarization by the microenvironement serve as important immune sentinels that play a vital role in host defense and homeostasis. The polarization of macrophage function has been broadly classified as M1 (classical) and M2 (alternate) activation, wherein M1 polarised cells display a strong pro-inflammatory microbicidal response, while M2 polarization is linked to production of an anti-inflammatory milieu leading to tissue regeneration and wound healing. Data pertaining to macrophage polarization are primarily derived from murine models, but increasing evidence is highlighting the inadequacy of direct inter-species translation. In leishmaniasis, a protozoan infection caused by the genus Leishmania, manipulation of host macrophage function is central to pathogenesis. In this study we report that monocyte/macrophage subsets in Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis are polarized to an M2 phenotype. This study provides insights into systemic and local regulation of macrophage/ monocyte functions in this important human disease and highlights the influence of immunomodulatory anti-leishmanial chemotherapy on macrophage/monocyte polarization.
