Leprosy is an old disease that is nearly eradicated from the European continent but not worldwide. The infectious agent, Mycobacterium leprae, has a highly conserved genome, and this property has been used to elucidate the route of its dissemination all over the world. At the French National Reference Center for mycobacteria, 20 to 30 leprosy cases are diagnosed every year, mainly in immigrants from endemic countries or in people living in French overseas territories. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between M. leprae genotypes and the geographical origin of the patients.
