Meningitis is a common manifestation of Streptococcus suis infection. S. suis is endemic in pork consuming and pig rearing countries. We systematically reviewed the clinical characteristics, predisposing factors and outcome of S. suis meningitis. We identified 913 patients included in 24 studies, with a mean age of 49 years and a majority of male patients (82%). Exposure to pigs or pork was present in 61%, with a skin injury being present in 20%. Fever was present in 97% of patients, headache in 95%, neck stiffness in 93%. The mortality was 2.9% and hearing loss was common occurring in 53% of patients. Dexamethasone was associated with reduced hearing loss.
