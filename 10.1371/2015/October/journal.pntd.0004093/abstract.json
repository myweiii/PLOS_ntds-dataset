    "Background": "Recent studies have shown significant decline in the final cure rate after miltefosine treatment in visceral leishmaniasis. This study evaluates the efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients recruited over a period of 5 years with 18 months of follow-up.",
    "Methodology": "In this study 86 confirmed cases of PKDL were treated with two different dosage regimens of miltefosine (Regimen I- 50mg twice daily for 90 days and Regimen II- 50 mg thrice for 60 days) and the clinical outcome assessed monthly. Cure/relapse was ascertained by clinical and histopathological examination, and measuring parasite burden by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro susceptibility of parasites towards miltefosine was estimated at both promastigote and amastigote stages.",
    "Results": "Seventy three of eighty six patients completed the treatment and achieved clinical cure. Approximately 4% (3/73) patients relapsed by the end of 12 months follow-up, while a total of 15% (11/73) relapsed by the end of 18 months. Relapse rate was significantly higher in regimen II (31%) compared to regimen I (10.5%)(P<0.005). Parasite load at the pre-treatment stage was significantly higher (P<0.005) in cases that relapsed compared to the cases that remained cured. In vitro susceptibility towards miltefosine of parasites isolated after relapse was significantly lower (>2 fold) in comparison with the pre-treatment isolates (P<0.005).",
    "Conclusion": "Relapse rate in PKDL following miltefosine treatment has increased substantially, indicating the need of introducing alternate drugs/ combination therapy with miltefosine."
