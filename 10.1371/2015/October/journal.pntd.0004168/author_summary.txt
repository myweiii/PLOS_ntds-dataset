The roundworms Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati cause a broad spectrum of clinical disease in humans. Children are at particular risk of toxocariasis when they play in areas potentially contaminated with Toxocara eggs, such as playgrounds or sandboxes and ingest embryonated roundworm eggs. Currently, diagnosis for toxocariasis relies on clinical signs, history of exposure to puppies or kittens, laboratory findings (including eosinophilia), and the detection of antibodies to Toxocara antigens. The enzyme immunoassay using T. canis excretory secretory antigens from infective-stage larvae is the most useful diagnostic test for toxocaral visceral larva migrans (VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM) and is the preferred assay used by most laboratories in the U.S. and worldwide. Although the EIA has been robust and reliable, improvement should be made in the specificity of the assay and the availability of a consistent antigen source. The crude TES-Ag shows cross-reactivity with antibodies from other common helminth infections of humans which reduces the usefulness of native, unfractionated TES Ag-based serodiagnosis in regions where poly-parasitism is endemic. To improve the assay performance, target antigenic proteins from T. canis excretory secretory antigens were identified using 2D gel electrophoresis. Three antigenic proteins sequences were found, expressed, and developed into Luminex bead-based assays. The combined use of two recombinant antigens (Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-TES-26) represents an improvement over the existing immunodiagnostic methods that rely on native parasite materials. In the future, additional antigens could be added from other parasites that cause larval migrans to form a single method for detecting larval migrans syndromes.
