Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a chronic arthritis-causing pathogen in humans, for which no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug is currently available. Due to the global spread of its mosquito vectors, CHIKV is now becoming a public health threat worldwide. CHIKV can replicate in both mammalian and mosquito cells, however it does not cause apparent damage to mosquito cells, yet it rapidly kills mammalian cells within a day after infection. In addition, mosquito and mammalian cells have different mechanism of protein glycosylation, which can result in different glycan structures of viral glycoproteins. In this study, we report that mosquito cell-generated CHIKV has lower infectivity in cell culture and causes less severe disease in mice, when compared to mammalian cell-generated CHIKV. We demonstrate that only mammalian cell-generated CHIKV, but not mosquito-cell generated CHIKV, binds to mammalian cell surface glycosaminoglycan receptors. Interestingly, mosquito-cell generated CHIKV can re-acquire glycosaminoglycan receptor binding capability after a single passage in mammalian cells and replicate at similar levels with mammalian cell-generated CHIKV, suggesting that passage of CHIKV in mosquito cells can reduce its infectivity.
