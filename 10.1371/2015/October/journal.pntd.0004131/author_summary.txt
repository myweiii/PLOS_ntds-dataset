Schistosomes are snail-transmitted parasites that continue to infect over 230 million people worldwide and cause the disease schistosomiasis. Currently there is no effective vaccine against the disease. Control programs have relied primarily on use of chemotherapy with praziquantel to eliminate adult worms from infected people. An increasing body of evidence, however, suggests that praziquantel-based control programs are not likely to be sufficient to achieve sustainable transmission control. Snail control achieved by focal use of molluscicides, especially in combination with other methods like chemotherapy, sanitation and health education, offers considerable promise for reduction of disease transmission. Consequently, use of molluscicides in snail control is likely to increase in the coming years. We undertook a microarray study to assess transcriptional responses to niclosamide, the active ingredient in commonly-used molluscicides, in the schistosome-transmitting snail Biomphalaria glabrata. We show that niclosamide activates components in snailsâ€™ pathways known to be involved in biotransformation of xenobiotics and stress responses. We suggest that major alterations in vesicle trafficking and interference with oxygen transport also follow niclosamide exposure. The results contribute to our understanding of molecular impacts of niclosamide exposure on snails, and provide a basis for further studies to define the mode of action of niclosamide and other molluscicides in the future.
