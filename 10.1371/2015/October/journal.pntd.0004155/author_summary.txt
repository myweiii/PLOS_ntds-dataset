Approximately 114 million people in Africa, mostly located in 33 Sub-Saharan African countries, are infected with Mansonella perstans, a filarial nematode. The ability of M. perstans to induce severe clinical features has only recently been considered. Unfortunately, no study has evaluated its burden in febrile patients in Gabon, a tropical African country where febrile and parasitic illnesses are common. There, we developed molecular tools to detect M. perstans and other Mansonella spp., as well as Loa loa, another filarial nematode in blood specimens of febrile and afebrile Gabonese children. Our findings suggest that there is no direct link between M. perstans and fever among the local population (61/1,258 febrile children [4.8%] versus 6/160 afebrile children [3.8%]), whereas Loa loa and another potential new species Mansonella sp. “DEUX” were only found in febrile patients (seven and twelve, respectively). Further study should be performed to characterize Mansonella sp. DEUX and evaluate the clinical significance of mansonellosis in humans.
