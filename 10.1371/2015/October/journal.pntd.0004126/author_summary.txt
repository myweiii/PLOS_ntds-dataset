Tungiasis is a neglected skin disease, frequent in resource-poor communities in the tropics. It is caused by sand fleas (also called jigger fleas) which burrow in the skin of humans and animals. Tungiasis can cause physical disabilities and the associated wounds facilitate entry of pathogens including those causing tetanus. In Brazil, presence of tungiasis in animals increased the risk and severity of the human disease. Until now, no systematic studies on animal tungiasis in Africa have been conducted. Therefore, an epidemiological study was performed in Busoga sub-region, where tungiasis in humans is very common. Tungiasis was detected in pigs, dogs, goats and a cat, respectively, in their order of significance. Animal tungiasis was strongly associated with human tungiasis and the presence of the disease in animals increased the risk of human infection by a factor of six. Our findings confirmed, for the first time, a strong correlation between the presence of tungiasis in animal reservoirs and the human population in Africa. Therefore, control of tungiasis in animals should be integrated in all interventions geared at controlling tungiasis in endemic communities.
