Filarial diseases affect an estimated 200 million people and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) has identified development of macrofilaricidal drugs as a priority. Emodepside, currently used in companion animals, paralyses adult filarial worms and may address this unmet need for human medicine. Its receptor is an evolutionary conserved Ca2+-activated K+ channel, SLO-1. In this paper we address an important knowledge gap in terms of understanding the interaction of emodepside with its target receptor SLO-1 in nematodes in comparison to the human orthologue KCNMA1 and provide the first cross phyla analysis of the interaction of emodepside with slo channels, in nematode, insect and human. Intriguingly, this shows that emodepside modulates slo/BK currents from heterologously expressed channels from all three organisms, however there are discrete differences in the feature of modulation; only the nematode channel exhibits a sustained facilitation by emodepside. This is consistent with the effects of emodepside on C. elegans behaviour and indicates that this differential action of emodepside on the nematode channel likely underlies its potent anthelmintic effects. These data provide an important benchmark for the wider deployment of emodepside as an anthelmintic treatment.
