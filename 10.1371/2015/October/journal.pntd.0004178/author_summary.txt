Globally, leishmaniasis treatment relies on the use of antimonial drugs (i.e. SSG). In an earlier study we showed that skin lesions due to L. major treated by the ThermoMed (TM) device healed at a similar rate and with less associated systemic toxicity than lesions treated with intravenous SSG. The current study compared the immune responses of these two therapeutic groups before, during and after therapy which may be relevant to resistance to reinfection and also in consideration for the development of local (versus systemic) therapy. Antimonials have immune effects on both the host and parasite while heat treatment locally kills the parasite and induces inflammation from a secondary burn. We demonstrated that healing from cutaneous leishmaniasis is a dynamic process associated with a modulation of immune responses independent of treatment modalities.
