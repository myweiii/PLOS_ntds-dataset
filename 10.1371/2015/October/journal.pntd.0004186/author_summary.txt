Although the key aspects of the T. cruzi life cycle were described more than one century ago, the development and interactions of T. cruzi with its vector are poorly characterized. By dissection of different compartments of the triatomine gut (prototype Rhodnius prolixus) (i.e., AM, PM and H) at regular time intervals, we evaluated trypanosome development within the insect using an accurate qPCR assay. qPCR analysis of trypanosomal colonization and clearance dynamics in real-time were confirmed in vivo using both fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging, which revealed massive parasite lysis during the first 24 hours post-feeding (p.f.). After one week, the parasite succeeded in establishing a resident population in each compartment of the gut, albeit at varying levels. From one week after the onset of infection in the AM and PM, some resident forms agglomerated into rosettes, clustering in close association with the vector tissue and constituting potential parasite reservoirs of the bug. For the first time, we have described a methodology to accurately quantify parasites in the insect gut that would be a useful tool for evaluating the impact of RNAi silencing of insect genes during the course of infection by T. cruzi.
