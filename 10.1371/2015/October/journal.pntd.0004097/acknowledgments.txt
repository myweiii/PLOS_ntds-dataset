Sampling for this study was conducted in the framework of M. Garba’s PhD thesis. Mr. Garba was provisionally transferred from the DGPV (Minister of Agriculture, Niger) to Abdou Moumouni University (Niamey, Niger) as a PhD student (2009–2012; decision number 0326/MFP/T). The satellite image of Niamey is part of a Spot Image (CNES 2008, scene number 506 132 308 121 010 151 32 T) that was obtained under license through the ISIS program (file number 553). We are grateful to S. Brémont, A. Landier and F. Zinini from the National Reference Center for Leptospirosis for the molecular typing of VNTR profiles, as well as to A. Dehne-Garcia and H. Vignes for their assistance with MiSeq sequencing and associated bioinformatics analyses. Some aspects of the metabarcoding approach used here benefitted from advice of the ‘PathoID metaprogram’ of the National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA, France). Researches in Niger were conducted in the framework of the scientific partnership agreement (number 301027/00) between IRD and the Republic of Niger. We are grateful to Dr. Pablo Tortosa who provided very helpful comments on our manuscript. We are particularly indebt to all the people in Niamey who allowed us to enter their home or work places for the need of the present study.
