We surveyed rodent-borne Leptospira in rodents from Niamey, the capital town of Niger, using bacterial metabarcoding, RT-PCR, sequencing, VNTR typing and GIS-based geostatistics. Two new serovars of Leptospira kirschneri were identified in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two species that inhabit exclusively urban irrigated gardens. Since no rodent-borne leptospires could be found in the core city, our results point towards the importance of urban agriculture in the maintaining and the circulation of these bacteria in cities from semi-arid regions where they are usually poorly documented and even hardly looked for. Accordingly, this is one of the very rare mentions of these zoonotic agents in Sahel, and the first one in Niger. Keeping in mind the critical role of urban gardening for food security in extensively growing West African cities, we believe that leptospirosis should be more closely scrutinized in Sahelian countries where numerous cases of human fevers are of unknown origin.
