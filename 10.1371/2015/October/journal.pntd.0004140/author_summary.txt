Overall, the number of annual cases of human rabies reported in China has been decreasing since 2007. However, some Western provinces, where few human cases have been reported in recent years, are beginning to see increasing incidence of rabies. Specifically, Ningxia, Qinghai and Gansu began to report human cases respectively from 2011, 2012 and 2013, while Tibet had its first laboratory confirmed dog rabies case in 2012. Consequently, as part of the national rabies surveillance program, we collected specimens from biting dogs or human saliva from suspected rabies cases in these areas, and after sequencing positive samples, performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleoprotein gene complete sequences. Our results indicate that while Ningxia and Gansu rabies strains are very close to the lineage associated with most cases in mainland China, Tibet and Qinghai strains belong to the global Arctic-like-2 clade, which is typically associated with wild life in China and neighboring countries. Thus, it appears that, rabies reemergence in the west of China has two distinct origins, and Tibet and Qinghai rabies cases were isolated events rather than an indication of the ongoing epizootic in China.
