The tropical disease lymphatic filariasis (LF) causes chronic swelling of the leg—lymphedema—in 14 million people worldwide. To stop the spread of LF, a program led by the World Health Organization (WHO) offers annual preventive drug treatment to affected communities. For people who already have lymphedema, WHO recommends simple hygiene-based measures that include skin care and limb movement. Yet only a small proportion of those with LF-related lymphedema have been trained in these measures. To determine the effectiveness of hygiene-based lymphedema management, we reviewed the scientific literature. Twenty-two studies were found that 1) used hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema; 2) measured the effect of these interventions; and 3) were done in an area where LF occurs. Overall, use of hygiene-based measures was associated with 60% lower odds of inflammatory episodes, known as “acute attacks,” in the affected limb. Acute attacks cause severe pain, fever, and disability, and they make lymphedema worse. Hygiene and sanitation are necessary for control of many tropical diseases. Hygiene is also effective for managing LF-related lymphedema and reducing suffering caused by acute attacks. Training people with lymphedema in hygiene-based interventions should be a priority for LF programs everywhere.
