This study would not have been possible without the support received by the village elders and their communities. The support of the health and veterinary services of Herat province is greatly acknowledged in addition to the Dutch Committee of Afghanistan (DCA) which managed all logistics for implementation of the survey within the country and Peter Jolly, Jo McKenzie and Kurian Litty at Massey University for out-of-country support. Staff from DCA and the Health Protection and Research Organisation (HPRO) are thanked for the training, supervision and support provided to the interviewers. Special thanks go to Drs. Fakhri (DCA) and Khalil (Provincial Veterinary Office) for their coordination role in Herat and Drs. Sharifi, Rohullah Zekria and Wahid Bahir for laboratory oversight and technical support. Overall coordination and administrative support provided by Tania Dennison and the team at the Animal Health Development Project in Kabul greatly supported the successful and timely implementation of this study.
