Post smallpox eradication, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) has emerged as the most important human health threat within the Orthopoxvirus genus. Sporadic outbreaks of monkeypox within Africa, concern over the potential of the virus to move outside of its natural range, as well as the increasing proportion of unvaccinated people now susceptible to MPXV (due to cessation of smallpox vaccination), makes it important to understand how the virus is transmitted to humans within Africa. Thus far the natural reservoir(s) of MXPV has eluded identification; however several rodent species including African pouched rats (Cricetomys spp.) have been implicated as possible reservoirs. Cricetomys are often found living in close proximity to humans (and invading homes) and additionally serve as a food source within Africa. Therefore, it is important to utilize laboratory methods to examine the course of MPXV infection in Cricetomys and thus determine this rodent speciesâ€™ competence as a host for the virus. We challenged eight animals with MPXV (4X104 pfu) and assessed clinical symptoms and molecular markers of disease. Our results show Cricetomys can be infected with MPXV and shed high loads of virus via multiple routes, supporting the hypothesis that they may be involved in the maintenance and transmission of the virus within Africa.
