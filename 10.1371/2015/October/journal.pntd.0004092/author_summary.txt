Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a newly identified bunyavirus, has been found to circulate in mainland China, South Korea, and Japan since 2009. This virus is the etiologic agent for an emerging fatal hemorrhagic fever, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) with high fatality. Although ticks have been implicated as the primary host vector indicated by epidemiological surveys, their role in transmitting this virus to the susceptible hosts, including humans, has not been validated. In this study, we conducted experimental and natural infections of goats with SFTSV to explore the role of ticks for this pathogen’s transmission. In the experimental infection study, we have not found any viral transmission within the cohort by close contact between animals. However, in the natural infection study, every member of a naïve goat cohort was observed to get infected sequentially when they were farmed in a SFTSV-endemic site. We detected viral RNA from free-living and parasitic ticks rather than mosquitoes, and from goats after ticks’ infestation. We also observed sero-conversion in all members of the animal cohort subsequently. More importantly, in the natural infection study, two virus strains isolated from one infected goat and its parasitic ticks showed identical S segment sequences of the viral genome. All these findings indicate that ticks, especially the dominant species Haemaphysalis longicornis, probably act as viral vector for this emerging pathogen, SFTSV.
