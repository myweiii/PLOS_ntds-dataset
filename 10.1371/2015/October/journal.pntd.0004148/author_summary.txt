Galectins are a family of endogenous lectins defined by a well-conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that recognizes β-galactoside-related glycans presented by several glycoconjugates. Up to now, fifteen galectins have been identified in a variety of cells and tissues and proposed to be crucial in diverse biological processes. Galectin–1 (Gal–1), a prototype member of the galectin family, plays key roles in pathogen recognition and in the modulation of innate and adaptive host immune responses. Following infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Gal–1 was found to be up-regulated in cardiac tissue from patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. In the present study, we identified a protective role of Gal–1 in T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, highlighting the ability of this parasite to control the glycophenotype of these cells. Our data also disclose the relevance of parasite strain-dependent differences in Gal-1-mediated control of T. cruzi infection in vivo. The findings presented here will contribute to delineate the role of Gal-1-glycan interactions during T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of heart tissue injury, with critical implications in Chagas disease.
