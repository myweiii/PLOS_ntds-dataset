Intracellular pathogens are difficult to kill because their localization inside host cells provides protection against immunity and chemotherapies. Thus, successful treatment of diseases caused by intracellular pathogens may need combination therapies and effective delivery systems. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by intracellular protozoan pathogens of the genus Leishmania. CL is a long established global problem, yet there are no suitable vaccine or chemotherapy options. We found that the well-tolerated cationic polymer PHMB is able to directly kill Leishmania major (L. major) and to enhance host-directed killing by improving the delivery of immunomodulatory nucleic acids. The study exemplifies parallel host- and pathogen-directed killing of an intracellular pathogen in the presence of effective drug delivery platforms. This general strategy holds great promise for therapy of a range of diseases caused by intracellular pathogens.
