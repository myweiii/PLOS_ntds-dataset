Metabolic profiling of biofluids and tissues in disease and healthy individuals is a powerful approach to discover new markers for diagnosis. We have applied these techniques to the protozoan infection human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), otherwise known as sleeping sickness. The form of HAT endemic in East Africa, caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, requires technically demanding direct microscopic diagnosis, as there are no indirect rapid diagnostic tests available. We studied the metabolite profiles in plasma from HAT patients and controls. Clear biochemical differences were discovered between control individuals and patients, including changes in the overall lipid composition and concentration of certain amino acids. These may have been caused by the inflammatory immune response to infection and the uptake of particular molecules by the parasites, although further research will be required for confirmation. We demonstrate that plasma metabolic profiles are characteristic for T. b. rhodesiense infection. While some of these changes are consistent with those observed in an experimental mouse infection model of HAT, many are unique to this clinical study and indicate the necessity of validating experimental animal study data in clinical disease studies. Our results also reveal biochemical changes in patients that will help us understand the development of disease.
