    "Introduction": "Buruli ulcer disease (BUD), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a chronic, necrotizing skin disease which has been reported from more than 30 countries worldwide with a focus in West Africa [1]. BUD predominantly affects impoverished inhabitants of remote rural areas, approximately 50% of the cases are children <15 years [1\u20132]. Initially BUD manifests as painless nodule, plaque, papule, or edema followed by large, painless ulcerations with characteristically undermined edges [1\u20133]. Also cases with osteomyelitis occur [1\u20132, 4\u20135]. Lesions are divided into three categories (I: single lesions, <5 cm diameter; II: single lesions, 5\u201315 cm diameter; III: single lesions, >15 cm diameter, multiple lesions, lesions at critical sites, osteomyelitis) [2]. As a result of scarring and contractures emerging during the healing process, especially patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability [1, 6]. As the mode of transmission of BUD has not been elucidated to date, proven strategies of prevention do not exist [1]. Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore core elements of BUD control which requires strong commitment of health workers at community level, laboratory confirmation of 70% of suspected cases by standardized diagnostic methods (preferably IS2404 PCR), and standardized antimycobacterial treatment (rifampicin [R] in combination with streptomycin [S], alternatively clarithromycin [C] for eight weeks), if necessary complemented by surgery and/or physiotherapy [2, 7\u20139]. The WHO classified BUD as one of the currently five neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in line for the \u201cinnovative and intensified disease management (IDM)\u201d approach, demanding a major scaling up of active case detection, treatment, monitoring and surveillance [10].\nSince the introduction of antimycobacterial combination therapy a number of clinical studies investigated the treatment outcome of BUD patients, in particular healing times, secondary lesions and functional limitations. Whereas several authors observed healing of lesions of more than 90% of patients receiving various antimycobacterial treatment regimens (RS8, RS4/RC4, RS2/RC6) within twelve months [11\u201313], information on the time to healing varies. Nienhuis et al. reported median healing times of category I lesions of 18 weeks, and 30 weeks for category II and III lesions respectively [12]. Sarfo et al. further specified median healing times for nodules of 8 weeks, for ulcers of overall 12 weeks (category I: 12 weeks; category II: 11 weeks; category III: 15.5 weeks), and edema ranging from 2\u201348 weeks [11], Phillips et al. described median healing times of 14 weeks (RS8) and 16 weeks (RS2RC6) [13], and Vincent et al. observed median healing times of 12.6 weeks [5]. Available data from various studies also suggest that healing of up to two thirds of patients occurs within about 25 weeks after onset of treatment [5, 12\u201314].\nWhereas proven recurrences were non-existent [11\u201313] or below 2% [15], paradoxical reactions in terms of deterioration of lesions on antibiotic treatment or the appearance of secondary lesions during or after treatment, were described for individual patients [16\u201318] and for larger patient cohorts. Nienhuis et al. found an increase in lesion size in up to 80%, and secondary lesions in 6% of the patients participating in the BURULICO antimicrobial trial in Ghana [12, 19], O\u2019Brien et al. described paradoxical reactions in 21% of an Australian patient cohort [20], and Phillips et al. reported 9% of paradoxical reactions in a Ghanaian patient cohort participating in a recent antimicrobial trial (RS2/RC6) [13]. Increases in lesion size were commonly observed during the first three months after onset of treatment [19\u201320], but also delayed paradoxical reactions in terms of new lesions occurring up to thirteen months after the end of antibiotic treatment are known [17\u201318].\nFunctional limitations were frequently observed. Data from two cohorts of laboratory confirmed BUD patients from Ghana treated between 2003 and 2005 (surgery with or without concomitant antibiotic treatment), and between 2004 and 2009 (antimycobacterial treatment with or without surgical intervention), suggested functional limitations in 27% and 33.3% of the patients [21\u201322]. A comparison of two patient cohorts from the Democratic Republic of the Congo treated between 2002 and 2004 (surgical treatment only) and 2005\u20132007 (the majority of patients underwent surgery, more than 50% also received antimycobacterial therapy) showed that 23.4% and 19.5% of the patients healed with complications [4]. A recent study from Benin analyzed a cohort of more than 1000 BUD patients treated between 2005 and 2011 with antimycobacterial combination therapy and surgery if required, and reported 22% permanent functional limitations one year after treatment [5].\nSince the early 2000s, several investigators conducted in-depth assessments of functional limitations and identified important risk factors for their development, in particular location on joints and extremities of limbs, lesions >15 cm, and lesions at head and neck [21\u201328]. Beyond that, Vincent et al. recently established a specific profile of risk factors for BUD patients from Benin (edema, osteomyelitis, lesions >15 cm in diameter, multifocal lesions, healing times >107 days) and introduced the operational definition \u201csevere Buruli ulcer\u201d to earmark patients at risk for functional limitations for specific disability prevention measures [5].\nIn Togo, systematic BUD control was initiated in 2007. Whereas case finding, laboratory confirmation and antimycobacterial treatment have been fully implemented [29\u201330], accompanying POD (prevention of disability) measures as outlined by the WHO [6] are not yet sufficiently embedded in routine procedures, and treatment outcome has not been monitored.\nThis study presents the first analysis of treatment outcome of BUD patients in Togo, critically reviews procedures with a possible impact on the occurrence of complications, and provides recommendations for optimization of treatment success.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Ethical considerations\nEthical clearance was obtained through the national Togolese ethics committee (\u2018\u2018Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9thique pour la Recherche en Sant\u00e9\u201d) at the University of Lom\u00e9 (14/2010/CBRS) and the study was approved by the \u2018\u2018Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 de la R\u00e9publique Togolaise\u201d Lom\u00e9, Togo (Ref. No. 0009/2011/MS/DGS/DPLET). Written informed consent (IC) was obtained in French, if necessary translated into local languages, from all study participants and/or their legal representatives if aged below 18 years.\n\n\nManagement of BUD in Togo\nIn Togo, BUD control mainly operates through a network of district based CLTs (\u201cContr\u00f4leurs L\u00e8pre-TB-Buruli\u201d) and community based ASCs (\u201cAgent Sant\u00e9 Communitaire\u201d). CLTs regularly conduct sensitization activities in villages and schools, furthermore perform active case finding supported by ASCs who report patients with suspected BUD lesions to their corresponding CLT. Due to extended coverage of sensitization activities, self-referrals of patients to the nearest health post (\u201cUnit\u00e9 de Soins P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique [USP]\u201d) are on the rise. CLTs as well as USP head nurses (\u201c[ICP] Infirmier Chef Poste\u201d) refer clinically suspected BUD cases to the regional reference hospital (\u201cCentre Hospitalier R\u00e9gionale [CHR] Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9\u201d). At CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 a specifically trained medical assistant (\u201cpoint focal\u201d [PF]) is in charge of further proceedings, such as physical examination, documentation on the WHO recommended BU 01.N and BU 01.R forms in case of suspected recurrences [31], sample collection and initiation of laboratory confirmation at the national hygiene institute (\u201cInstitute Nationale d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne [INH]\u201d) according to standardized procedures [29\u201330]. Whereas most patients with category I (partially also category II) lesions are referred for outpatient treatment to USPs, the majority of patients with severe category II and category III lesions, and children <15 years in general are treated at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9. Antimycobacterial treatment follows WHO recommendations and is complemented by surgical intervention if required [2]. Wound management at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 is performed by nurses, at the USPs by the ICP, in both cases according to instructions of the PF. Patients who, according to the judgment of the PF, require physical therapy are referred to physiotherapists who provide treatment at the reference hospital, the USPs and also the patients homes. Currently 7 state examined physiotherapists are seconded to treatment of BUD patients.\n\n\nStudy population\nEligible for the study were 199 PCR confirmed BUD patients originating from regions \u201cMaritime\u201d, \u201cSavanes\u201d, \u201cPlateaux\u201d and \u201cCentrale\u201d who were treated within the period from September 2007 to November 2013 with more than 6 months elapsed since the end of treatment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1.\nClinical, epidemiological and treatment data were retrospectively compiled from existing databases of previous studies which contained information retrieved from standardized WHO BU 01.N and project specific laboratory data entry forms, and cross-checked with original paper forms [29\u201330].\n\n\nStudy forms\nTo collect standardized data on treatment outcome a study specific form (S1 Form) was employed which consisted of several sections: A-D) clinical/epidemiological baseline and treatment data (taken from existing databases, prefilled prior to follow-up visits); E-F) information on location of suspected secondary lesions (recorded in the field) and clinical samples collected for laboratory diagnosis; G-H) assessment of limitations of movement (LOM) and impairment in daily activities (based on the questionnaire developed by Simonet V [32]; documented in the field); I) recommendations for further medical treatment (issued after data analysis). In addition, for patients with open wounds at follow-up the BU 01.R form and a clinical record form (as used routinely in Togo; S2 Form [30]) were filled in the field. S1 Table summarizes all parameters collected for analysis.\n\n\nAdditional source materials\nFor patients with secondary lesions and functional limitations case histories were retrospectively retrieved from medical records, where available. The distance from the patients\u2019 location of residence to CHR was obtained from logbooks of DAHW-T cars. In addition, documentation on physiotherapy was retrospectively reviewed, as far as accessible (\u201cFiche de bilan des patients atteints de l\u2019ulc\u00e8re de Buruli\u201d and \u201cPr\u00e9vention des incapacit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019UB\u2014formulaire de base\u201d; see S3 and S4 Forms).\n\n\nFollow-up visits\nA total of 25 follow-up visits to 29 USPs (corresponding to the catchment area of 61 villages) were conducted in January-April 2013 (110 patients) and May-June 2014 (19 patients). In advance, patients were grouped according to location of residence and accessibility of the nearest USP and summoned by the responsible ICP upon instructions of the PF at a specific date. A field team (surgeon, physiotherapist, medical assistant and PF) enrolled study participants at the USPs and performed clinical examination and questioning according to the above described study form (S1 Form) if informed consent was provided. For patients unavailable to attend an attempt was made to retrieve them in their villages at a later date.\nPatients whose lesions were healed without complications were discharged. From patients with open wounds at examination (in that context referred to as secondary lesions) lesions were measured and categorized according to WHO guidelines, and clinical samples were collected for microbiological analysis. Patients with anatomical impairment (including excessive scars and open wounds) were subjected to goniometric measurements according to the sagittal, frontal, and transverse rotation method (SFTR) [33] and scars were measured by the surgeon and medical assistant of the field team. Furthermore, these patients were questioned about the functional impairment in daily life according to the questionnaire in part H of the study form (S1 Form). Functional limitations were defined as BUD related anatomical impairment as determined by goniometry and/or measurement of scars and were classified in type I (i.e. anatomical impairment not hampering daily activities) and type II (i.e. anatomical impairment hampering daily activities).\n\n\nMicrobiological analyses\nCollection of swab samples, fine-needle aspirates or 3mm punch biopsies as well as microscopy and IS2404 qPCR followed standardized procedures at the laboratories of the INH, Lom\u00e9 accompanied by external quality assurance conducted at the Department for Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Munich, Germany, as recently described [30]. For regular bacteriological analysis, conducted in the accredited (COFRAC, \u2018\u2018Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais d\u2019Accr\u00e9ditation\u201d according to NF EN ISO/CEI 17025 [version 2005]) bacteriology unit of the INH, swab samples were inoculated on Chapman (mannitol-salt [MSA]) agar, blood agar and nutrient broth (BioRad, Munich, Germany). Colonies indicative for Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from MSA agar, analyzed by Gram staining, catalase and coagulase test, and subjected to susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method (15 antimicrobials) on M\u00fcller-Hinton agar (BioRad) [34].\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe study design was a non-randomized clinical cohort study. Statistical analysis (chi-square test, including Fisher exact test) was carried out by EPIINFO 3.3.2. (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). The results of statistical analyses were presented by P-values. Significant differences were defined as P-values below 0.05.",
    "Results": "Patients enrolled and baseline data\nOut of 199 BUD patients eligible for the study, 129 (64.8%) could be retrieved and enrolled as follow-up patients in the study. Among the 129 follow-up BUD patients, 46.5% were male. At the time of initial diagnosis 90 of 129 follow-up patients (69.8%) were below 15 years of age (range 2\u201368 years, median 10 years, interquartile range [IQ] 7\u201316 years). The patients originated from 6 districts of region \u201cMaritime\u201d. The distance from the place of residence to CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 was known for 120 patients (93.0%) and was 1\u201323 km for 47 patients (39.2%) and 24\u2013135 km for 73 patients (60.8%). The duration of disease before clinical diagnosis was known for 128 patients (99.2%) and was 0\u201342 days for 81 patients (63.3%), and 43\u20133.600 days for 47 (36.7%) patients. Baseline data and details on statistical analyses are provided in S2 Table.\n\n\nDrop-out patients and baseline-data\nOut of 199 BUD patients eligible for the study, 70 patients (35.2%) could not be enrolled (drop-outs). Forty-three patients (61.4%) had moved to an unknown address, 24 (34.3%) were not found and 3 were deceased (4.3%). Among the 70 drop-out patients, 52.9% were male (no significant difference with the follow-up patients). At the time of initial diagnosis 36 of 70 drop-out patients (51.4%) were above 15 years of age (range 2\u201365 years, median 15.5 years, IQ 8.3\u201328 years) and significantly older than the follow-up patients (P<0.01%). The drop-out patients originated from 6 districts of region \u201cMaritime\u201d, 2 districts of region \u201cPlateaux\u201d, 1 district of region \u201cCentrale\u201d and 1 district of region \u201cSavanes\u201d. The distance from the place of residence to CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 was known for 60 drop-out patients (85.7%) and was 1\u201323 km for 34 patients (56.7%) and 24\u2013135 km for 26 patients (43.3%); the drop-out patients lived significantly closer to CHR Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 than the follow-up patients (P = 0.03%). The duration of disease before clinical diagnosis was known for 69 drop-out patients (98.6%) and was 0\u201342 days for 21 patients (30.4%) and 43\u20133.600 days for 48 (69.6%) patients; the drop-out patients had a significantly longer duration of disease than the follow-up patients (P<0.01). Baseline data and details on statistical analyses are provided in S2 Table.\n\n\nCharacteristics of initial lesions\nAt the time of initial diagnosis 73 of the 129 follow-up patients (56.6%) had ulcers and 56 patients (43.4%) had non-ulcerative lesions (nodule, n = 19 [33.9%]; plaque, n = 26 [46.4%]; edema, n = 11 [19.6%], 10 edemas evolved into an ulcer). Fifty-nine patients (45.7%) had category I lesions, 44 patients had category II lesions (34.1%) and 26 patients (20.2%) had category III lesions. Four of the patients with category III lesions had multiple lesions [multiple ulcers, n = 2; ulcer and nodule, n = 1; ulcer and plaque, n = 1]). The localization of lesions was as follows: upper limbs, n = 51 (39.5%); lower limbs, n = 50 (39.8%); trunk/head, n = 28 (21.7%). Lesions of 45 patients (34.9%) involved joints (category I, n = 23 [51.1%]; category II, n = 18 [40.0%]; category III, n = 4 [8.9%]). LOM at time of initial diagnosis were not documented.\n\n\nTreatment and time to healing\nFourty-nine patients (38.0%; category I, n = 13; category II, n = 17; category III, n = 19) received antimycobacterial treatment at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9, 35 of these patients (71.4%) underwent also surgery (excision and grafting, n = 11 [31.4%]; grafting, n = 23 [65.7%]; reconstructive surgery, n = 1 [2.9%]). Out of these 35 patients, 10 had category I lesions, 8 had category II lesions, and 17 had category III lesions. Eighty patients (62.0%) were referred to USPs (category I, n = 46; category II, n = 27; category III, n = 7) for antimycobacterial therapy.\nAmong the 129 follow-up BUD patients, 126 patients completed antibiotic therapy (97.7%), three patients (2.3%) did not (two patients were incompliant and for the third the reason was not known). LOM after the end of treatment were documented for 126 patients (97.7%). Out of them, 17 patients (13.5%; category I, n = 2; category II, n = 6; category III, n = 9) were discharged with LOM.\nThe time to healing was known for 124 patients (96.1%) and ranged from 1\u2013146 days for 63 patients (50.8%; significant correlation with category I lesions [P<0.01]), and 147\u2013784 days for 61 patients (49.2%; significant correlation with category III lesions [P<0.01]). Stratified into categories of lesions, 57 patients (46.0%) with category I lesions had a median healing time of 108 days (IQR: 93.5\u2013149.5), 42 patients (33.9%) with category II lesions had a median healing time of 151 days (IQR: 125.8\u2013208), and 25 patients (20.1%) with category III lesions had a median healing time of 256 days (IQR: 177\u2013314). Among 41 patients with healing times of more than 180 days, we also observed a correlation with functional limitations (P<0.01).\n\n\nPhysiotherapy\nAccording to the BU 01.N forms, 117 out of the 129 follow-up BUD patients (90.7%) received physiotherapy; however for 76 of these patients (65.0%) detailed documentation and physiotherapeutic treatment protocols were not available. Nine follow-up BUD patients (7.0%) did not receive physiotherapy for unknown reasons and for three patients (2.3%) this information was not available. Eighteen patients (23.1%) were treated at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 only, 60 patients (76.9%) at USPs/patients homes and 39 patients (33.3%) at both locations. The number of sessions was documented for 95 patients (81.2%): 24\u201399 sessions, n = 46 (48.4%); 100\u2013520 sessions, n = 49 (51.6%). Detailed physiotherapeutical treatment protocols, however, did not exist.\n\n\nFindings at follow-up\nAmong the 129 follow-up BUD patients, the lesions of 109 patients (84.5%) were completely healed without any complications. Five patients (3.9%) had secondary lesions (2 of them in combination with functional limitations). Whereas M. ulcerans DNA was not detected in any of the lesions, strains of S. aureus were isolated from two patients (one of them revealed a methicillin resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), in four cases the etiology of secondary lesions remained unclear. Fifteen patients (11.6%) had functional limitations (type I, n = 5 [3.9%]; type II, n = 10 [7.8%]; two of them in combination with secondary lesions). From 80 patients (62.0%) scars were measured. Out of them, 22 patients (27.5%) had scars with a diameter of <5cm, 33 (41.3%) had scars with a diameter of 5\u201315cm, and 25 (31.3%) had scars with a diameter of >15cm.\n\n\nRisk factors for functional limitations\nAmong the clinical findings, functional limitations were significantly associated with healing times >180 days (P<0.01), edema (P<0.01), and category III lesions (ulcers >15cm or multiple lesions; P<0.01), and a documented LOM at time of discharge (P<0.01). Treatment related factors significantly associated with functional limitations were surgery (P<0.01) and hospitalization at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 (P<0.01). S2 Table provides detailed risk factor analyses.",
    "Discussion": "This study provides the first analysis of treatment outcome of BUD patients in Togo. The median times to healing as determined for various categories of patients lie within the range of values reported by other authors. Likewise, our data also suggest that the lesions of approximately two third of the patients healed within about 25 weeks as reported by other authors [5, 11\u201314]. The absence of proven recurrences in our study is also in line with the low or non-existing recurrence rate as observed by other investigators [11\u201313, 15]. As previously published, one patient of our study cohort had developed a delayed paradoxical reaction 10 months after the end of antimycobacterial treatment [18]. At the time of follow-up initial and secondary lesions were completely healed, the patient was therefore not included in the group of patients with complications. Five patients had secondary lesions at the time of clinical examination which may be related to delayed type paradoxical reactions\u2014this is however purely speculative as the patients could not precisely indicate time of occurrence and clinical course of the lesions. From the lesions of two of these patients S. aureus strains, one of them MRSA, were isolated. Although this is the first reported case of MRSA from Togo, this finding was to be expected as investigators from the neighboring countries Ghana and Benin have recently shown that a high proportion of BUD lesions are colonized with S. aureus, and MRSA is frequently isolated [35\u201337]. The Togolese MRSA patient was treated with vancomycin and reportedly healed under antibiosis. It became however apparent that follow-up procedures for identification of such complications are lacking, furthermore, a concept for antibiotic management of super-infected BUD lesions does not exist.\nA drawback of this study was that almost 35% of laboratory confirmed patients treated with standardized antimycobacterial treatment could not be retrieved at follow-up visits. According to medical records or BU 01.N forms, 60 of the drop-out patients (85.7%, out of them 58 patients without LOM [96.7%]) were completely healed at discharge. We could however not assess long-term sequelae among the drop-out cohort. To avoid these lost to follow-ups, which are likely to occur in mobile populations such as in Togo, we strongly recommend the introduction of standardized follow-up procedures for BUD patients in Togo.\nAmong the cohort of BUD patients retrieved for follow-up the percentage of functional limitations of 11.6% was lower than in other studies [4\u20135, 21\u201322]. However, we need to mention that, in the absence of formal definitions, we introduced an operational definition of type I and II functional limitations, therefore a direct comparison between our data and other studies may not be possible without restrictions. Our data suggest that edema and category III ulcers, a healing time >180 days as well as LOM at discharge constitute the main risk factors for functional limitations in Togolese BUD patients. The finding that hospitalization and surgical treatment at CHR Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 were also associated with functional limitations can be explained by the fact that 73% of patients with category III lesions were hospitalized at the reference center and 89% of them underwent surgery.\nIn analogy with the operational definition of a \u201csevere Buruli ulcer\u201d as established by Vincent et al. [5], we suggest to introduce criteria for the systematic identification of patients with increased risk for functional limitations also into clinical management of BUD in Togo. We propose to draw special attention to patients initially presenting with edema and category III ulcers, furthermore\u2014although our data did not show a significant correlation\u2014joint involvement as shown by other authors [21\u201323, 25\u201326].\nA recent study emphasized the special importance of wound care for the prevention of BUD related functional limitations [38]. Although according to our data most Togolese patients with \u201csevere Buruli ulcer\u201d have already been hospitalized in CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 and received advanced wound management, we recommend making it a general rule. Optimal wound management should consist of daily cleansing with saline solution (in cases of severe exudation twice a day), removal of necrotic tissue, and use of vaseline dressing for prevention of drying of the wound. In addition, consistent implementation of the POD related essential health interventions as outlined by the WHO are required and necessitate intensified training programs for hospital staff, CLTs, ICPs and physiotherapists [6].\nThis study provided an excellent opportunity to review all BUD related documentation. Clinical, epidemiological and treatment records on BU 01.N forms were for the most part complete. The status of LOM at admission was however not documented, and information on evolution of wounds during treatment was not available. For that reason we were not able to retrospectively analyze the prevalence of early paradoxical reactions in terms of enlargement of wounds. Likewise, extensions of lesions were only known for the time of admission and it was impossible to keep track of lesions expanding over joints subsequent to initial diagnosis, which may explain the absence of a significant correlation between lesions over joints and functional limitations in our study cohort. Concerning surgery, operation reports were not available, and information on indication, type and frequency of surgical interventions was largely retrieved from handwritten notes and oral reports of PF and surgeons.\nFor more than 60% of the patients who allegedly had received physical therapy, written documentation was absent, and treatment protocols indicating the type of exercises performed did not exist. Therefore, conclusions on the impact of physical therapy on prevention and clinical improvement of functional limitations could not be drawn in this study.\nIn view of these findings, optimization of procedures accompanying or following antimycobacterial treatment are highly recommended. Improvement of documentation of surgical and physiotherapeutic interventions is required and shall be facilitated through filing maps.\nFurthermore, to standardize concomitant physiotherapeutic measures, at the time of admission each patient should be seen by a physical therapist to decide on the general requirement of physical therapy and to prepare a treatment schedule, if applicable. Upon completion of antimycobacterial treatment, the PF at CHR-Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 and specially trained CLTs at the USPs respectively, should conduct a standardized assessment for each patient to decide on discharge and/or further therapeutic measures. The individual package of measures for each patient shall be defined in a treatment schedule which is regularly monitored by PF and CLTs. As a general rule, all patients should be followed until complete healing of the wound, afterwards at least once per year for a five year period, thus facilitating timely recognition of two further risk factors for functional limitations, i.e. prolonged healing times and LOM at/after discharge, as well as delayed paradoxical reactions. Regular feedback on fulfillment of treatment measures and results of follow-up visits to the PNLUB-LP (\u201cProgramme National de Lutte contre l\u2019Ulc\u00e8re de Buruli, la L\u00e8pre et le Pian\u201d) is considered mandatory to enhance the transparency of the system and to allow for further evaluation and improvement."
