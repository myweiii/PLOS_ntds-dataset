Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) is a mycobacterial skin disease which leads to large ulcerations and causes disabilities in approximately 25% of the patients. Treatment consists of antimycobacterial drugs, complemented by surgery and physiotherapy if necessary. Available data on treatment outcome of BUD patients suggest that recurrences are rare; paradoxical reactions and functional limitations, however, frequently occur. BUD control in Togo was introduced already in 2007, but treatment outcome has not yet been reviewed. Therefore, a clinical follow-up study assessed a cohort of 129 BUD patients at least six months after the end of treatment. The lesions of 84.5% of the patients were healed without complications, 3.9% had secondary lesions, and 11.6%, a lower proportion than in other studies, had functional limitations. Hereby, edema, category III ulcers, healing times >180 days, and limitation of movement at discharge constituted the main risk factors. Review of all BUD related documentation revealed a number of shortcomings, in particular concerning medical records. In view of these findings, standardization of procedures for creating of therapy plans, patient assessment and follow-up, as well as improved management of medical records are recommended to facilitate implementation of therapeutic measures to optimize treatment outcome and to allow for further evaluation.
