Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes an acute debilitating disease which results in the development of long-term arthralgia in more than 50% of infected individuals, similarly to what has been described with CHIKV. In this study, we evaluated the immune response of individuals with confirmed MAYV infection in a one-year longitudinal study carried out in Loreto, Peru. Here, we report that MAYV infection elicits robust immune responses that result in the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response and the secretion of pro-inflammatory immune mediators. These inflammatory mediators, in some cases, differed to those observed by others for CHIKV. We also observed a strong neutralizing antibody response in all the study subjects; however, this response was not sufficient to prevent the long-term outcomes of MAYV infection. Taken together, this study provides initial immunologic insight that may eventually contribute to the development of prognostic tools and potential therapeutic treatments against this emerging pathogen.
