Chagas disease is a major health problem in Latin America. Its infectious agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted mainly by the feces of insects called triatomines. Although great progress has been made in reducing transmission in the countries in the southern cone of South America, limited progress has been made in the Andean countries, partly because of lack of knowledge and partly because of limited resources and technical capability of control efforts. We report the first entomological survey conducted in southern Ecuador to learn the distribution of triatomines, their habitat and microhabitat preferences, and factors that favor their presence. The results of the study show that 9% of households in 92 rural communities harbor well-established triatomine populations. These rural areas in the southern Andean region are among the poorest in the country; most of the population lives in sub-standard housing, under conditions that favor the presence of Chagas disease vectors. These results, combined with recent reports of widespread triatomine infestation of wild animal nests in sylvatic areas throughout the region and frequent reports of reinfestation after control intervention, indicate the need for effective, monitored, and sustained vector control to reduce the high risk of infection to which approximately 100,000 people living in rural areas of southern Ecuador are exposed.
