Stigma plays an important role in several neglected tropical diseases such as leprosy, Buruli ulcer, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis. It negatively impacts individuals affected, and often also their families, and even communities. There are different ways to address stigma. One promising intervention is called ‘contact’. The principle is that personal contact between persons affected by a stigmatized condition and the public will demystify incorrect information, break the stereotypes and generate empathy. This in turn is believed to reduce stigma. In this paper the authors report a study that investigated the effect of a contact intervention that aimed to reduce leprosy-related public stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia. During this intervention 91 so called ‘contact events’ were organized at a local level, for instance, in schools, villages, halls and mosques. The results show that through education, testimonies (direct contact), videos and comics made by people affected by leprosy (in-direct contact) knowledge about leprosy increased and personal attitudes improved substantially.
