We have developed an innovative approach to production of alphavirus antigens for use in diagnostic assays that results in reduced production complexity as well as improved sensitivity in application. By generating recombinant viruses that contain the structural protein genes of pathogenic alphaviruses and the nonstructural protein genes of an insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus, we have been able to produce insect-restricted viruses that are antigenically identical to their pathogenic counterparts. The insect-specific nature of these chimeric viruses yields an advantageous safety profile and allows for safe handling of the antigen at the bench top. Traditional antigens, produced from wild-type virus, require extensive processing, from growth at biosafety level 3 to concentration and inactivation, followed by lyophilization, which often compromises antigen reactivity and is financially costly. Furthermore, current inactivation methods are imperfect processes that have historically resulted in residual live virus and subsequent breach of containment when used in a diagnostic setting. Other approaches, such as recombinant antigens generated from viral particle subunits, are missing conformational epitopes and their application results in reduced sensitivity. Here we describe the development of a diagnostic assay using this technology for the detection of chikungunya infection in humans.
