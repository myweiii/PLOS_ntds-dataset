Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by many etiological agents, including actinobacteria and true fungi. In Mexico, Nocardia brasiliensis and Actinomadura madurae account for more than 90% of the total cases. This subcutaneous infectious disease can affect skin and subcutaneous tissue; actinomycetomas are particularly osteolytic. The presence of abundant scar tissue, pus, and the intracellular growth of Nocardia make treatment very difficult. Current N. brasiliensis actinomycetoma therapy includes the use of trimethoprim-sulamethozaxole, diamino-diphenyl-sulphone (DDS), amikacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. N. brasiliensis is resistant to many other antimicrobials due in part to its richness in copies of genes related to pharmacoresistance, for instance rpoB, gyrase, beta-lactams, P450 cytochromes, etc. DprE1 inhibitors are new types of compounds that target a completely different gene, dprE1, encoding the decaprenylphosphoryl-d-ribose oxidase. Assays evaluating these experimental or other new drugs are necessary to develop a better therapeutic scheme for actinomycetoma, with more potent, less toxic antimicrobials.
