The clinical and social impact of leprosy, a disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, is due to the deformities and disabilities that are consequences of skin and peripheral nerve inflammation. We believe that leprosy patients who also have an associated viral infection will have a worse outcome. This can be due to alterations in the immune system triggered by the virus co-infection, leading to an increasing inflammation of the skin or peripheral nerves affected by Mycobacterium leprae, or to a depression of the mechanisms that control the infection. We have verified if the presence of specific viral infections in leprosy subjects is associated with a higher risk of developing a worse outcome like nerve inflammation, impairment in the nerve function or relapse. We have screened the patients for human immunodeficiency virus, human T cell lymphotrophic virus type 1, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus. These subjects were followed up during all the period of leprosy treatment (at least 6 months) in order to detect the emergence of any complication. We have found that leprosy patients with viral co-infection are at higher risk to develop nerve inflammation and damage, as well as relapse, compared to subjects without viral co-infection.
