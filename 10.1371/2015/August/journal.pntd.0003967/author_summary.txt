Diagnosis of intestinal helminths and Schistosoma mansoni infections is based on the detection of eggs in feces. There are many techniques available for both detection and quantification of infection. For the quantification of helminth infections, the methods traditionally used are the Kato-Katz (KK) fecal think smear in humans, and the McMaster (MM) counting method in animals. Recently, the MM has been used for assessing the efficacy of benzimidazole drugs for treating soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in humans. In most parts of the world, however, STHs occur simultaneously with other helminth species, and the MM does not detect other helminth eggs. Therefore, in this study we sought to determine if the use of the MM in an area of Brazil were both STHs and S. mansoni are co-endemic, added any value to the current standard of diagnosis using the KK.
