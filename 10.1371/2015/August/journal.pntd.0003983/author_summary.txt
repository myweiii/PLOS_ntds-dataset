In areas where leishmaniasis is endemic, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially incurable AIDS illness in HIV infected people. Co-infection with HIV and any of the Leishmania species that cause VL can result in failure of the CD4 lymphocyte count to rise above 200 cells/mm3 despite sustained, effective suppression of HIV infection, and this failure of CD4 recovery then commonly prevents immune mediated eradication of VL despite aggressive, prolonged anti-Leishmania treatment. The situation is made more challenging by the limited number of agents active against VL and their high rate of adverse effects. We report the first evaluation of liposomal daunorubicin used to treat VL in a patient with HIV and L. infantum co-infection. We selected this drug on the basis of the proven activity of anthracyclines against Leishmania species both in vitro and in animal models and the well tolerated use of daunorubicin in HIV infected patients with Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma. This treatment proved unsuccessful in our patient, probably because resistance of L. infantum to liposomal daunorubicin had been induced by previous treatment with another anti-leishmania drug, miltefosine.
