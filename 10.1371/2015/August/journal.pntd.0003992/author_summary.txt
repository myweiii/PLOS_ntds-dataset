Leishmania causes complex of pathologies called Leishmaniasis and among the several forms visceral leishmaniasis is the precarious one as being fatal, if left untreated. Emergence of resistance against several antileishmanials particularly Sodium Antimony Gluconate (SAG) has severely battered the therapeutic strategy against VL and the resistance mechanism is still vague. Thus, to apprehend the underlying mechanism, previously, a differential proteomics of SAG unresponsive versus SAG sensitive isolates of L.donovani was done wherein overexpression of Cysteine Leucine Rich protein (CLrP), a member of Leucine rich repeat superfamily, was observed. To scrutinize its involvement in the SAG resistance mechanism, which is till date not investigated, the characterization of CLrP was carried out which revealed its post-translational modification along with its dual existence in the nucleus and in the membrane of the parasite. Further investigation using a ChIP assay confirmed its DNA binding potential. Over-expression of CLrP in sensitive isolate of L. donovani significantly decreased its SAG sensitivity. CLrP overexpressed parasites have increased infectivity. These results point out towards the CLrPâ€™s contribution to antimonial resistance in L. donovani by facilitating parasites growth through macrophages. Further studies are required to depict CLrP as a potential drug target to strengthen the present arsenal against L donovani.
