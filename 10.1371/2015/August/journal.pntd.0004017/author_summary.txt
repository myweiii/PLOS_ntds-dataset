In Tunisia, zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) constitutes a significant public health problem. Since 1884, the Gafsa, Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid governorates are the most endemic areas of ZCL. This study used a multi-locus microsatellite typing approach to study the evolution and the population dynamics of Leishmania major in Tunisia. Within the same area, in twenty years, parasite populations evolved by producing a genetically differentiated population, probably better adapted to the ecosystem. In agreement with the reported human cases of ZCL, the genetic data on samples from the three governorates shows that the disease did not spread according to a geographical gradient. Furthermore, L. major flows seem to still occur between governorates and neighboring districts. This study suggests that environmental changes, human activities and reservoir systems have influenced the spread and evolution of L. major populations. Our findings provide important knowledge on the epidemiology of L. major in Tunisia and might help understanding why the disease is still spreading from the south to the center, despite the control measures that have been put into place.
