We would like to thank the physicians, nurses and laboratory technologists working at Gondar Hospital, Debark Hospital and Gondar Health Center. Our appreciation also goes to Mrs. Martha Zewdie for her unlimited support during the optimization process of flow cytometry and ELISPOT techniques at AHRI. Lastly, we greatly appreciate all the study participants without whom the study would have not been possible.
