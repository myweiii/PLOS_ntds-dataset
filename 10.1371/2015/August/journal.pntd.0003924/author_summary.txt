Diarrheal disease is an endemic health threat in underdeveloped nations. One of the major causative agents of diarrheal disease is a group of bacteria collectively known as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). These organisms can cause disease symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to a more severe, cholera-like form. We were interested in characterizing ETEC proteins that can generate a protective immune response as the first step in identifying potential new vaccine candidates. We used proteomics to identify a subset of ETEC proteins and then characterized this subset for their ability to inhibit ETEC binding to cultured intestinal epithelial cells. We then vaccinated mice with the most promising antigen candidates and were able to identify three proteins that protected mice from clinical signs of disease normally caused by ETEC infection. We suggest that future characterization of these proteins may potentially improve our collective efforts to create safe, effective, and broadly protective ETEC vaccines.
