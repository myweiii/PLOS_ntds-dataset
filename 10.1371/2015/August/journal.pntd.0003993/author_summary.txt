The zoonotic parasite Schistosoma japonicum is one of the major pathogens of schistosomiasis and can parasitize a wide range of mammals. Although numerous schistosome transcriptional profiling studies have been performed using laboratory animal models, the differences in the global gene expression profiles of worms from different laboratory animals and natural mammalian hosts have not been characterized. Therefore, we studied the gene expression profiles of adult worms from BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, rabbits and buffaloes using a transcriptomics approach. Our results indicate that, although the expression profiles of adult worms from different mammals are generally similar, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed, which were mainly involved in various signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. Numerous abundantly and stably expressed genes in adults were identified, including some genes that are only found in blood flukes or expanded within the phylum Platyhelminthes and may be important for parasitism. Our data provide a basis for schistosomiasis research in different mammalian hosts at the transcriptional level as well as a valuable resource for the screening of anti-schistosomal intervention targets.
