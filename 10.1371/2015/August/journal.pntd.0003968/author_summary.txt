Snake envenoming is an important health issue in many parts of the world and coagulopathy is one of the commonest manifestations. Russell’s viper envenoming occurs throughout south-east and south Asia and most commonly causes a venom induced consumption coagulopathy which may be complicated by bleeding. There is a limited understanding of the time course of the coagulopathy, including the specific clotting factor deficiencies and their relationship to the time course of venom concentrations. In this study, we measure the venom concentrations and clotting factor concentrations throughout the course of the patient admission. The study confirms that Russell’s viper envenoming causes prolonged clotting times and deficiencies of factors V, X, VIII and fibrinogen which recover over 2 days post-antivenom. In addition, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin times correlated with venom concentrations. Factor VII, VIII and IX levels were very high and may be related to venom activity, although further research is required.
