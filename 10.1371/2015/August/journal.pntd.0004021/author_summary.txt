More attention is now shifting towards elimination of some of the neglected tropical diseases, including schistosomiasis. Efficient diagnostics and surveillance tools are the bedrock of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such disease interventions. We had developed a multiplex immunoassay system for simultaneous detection of several pathogens in a single limited volume of human sample. To include Schistosoma antigen among the panel of pathogen antigens, we assessed the diagnostic value and suitability of selected Schistosoma antigens in multiplex format. S. mansoni serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) and Sm-RP26 showed good diagnostic value with significant reactivity to patient plasma as compared to the control group. However, S. mansoni Filamin, GAPDH, GST, LAP1, LAP2, Sm31, Sm32 and Tropomyosin did not show disease-specific reactivity to plasma from S. mansoni infected patients. While Sm-RP26 was cross-reactive to plasma from S. haematobium patients, Sm-SERPIN showed species-specific reactivity. There was also significant positive correlation between the number of excreted eggs and fluorescence signals from the multiplex immunoassays for the SERPINs. These findings indicate potentials for utilization of SERPINs in the multiplex system.
