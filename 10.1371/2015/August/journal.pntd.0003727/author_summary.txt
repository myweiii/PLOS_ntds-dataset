Sleeping sickness is a serious neglected tropical disease which has been targeted for elimination by 2020. Currently, control relies on mass screening populations at risk and treatment of cases. This strategy is compromised because it is often impossible to reach more than 75% of the population. An alternate method is to kill the tsetse fly which transmits the parasite causing the disease. To determine the value of adding vector control to medical interventions we undertook a vector control programme alongside a screen and treat programme in the Boffa disease focus of Guinea. We divided the focus into two parts (screen and treat in the western part; screen and treat plus vector control in the eastern part). In the vector control area, there was an 80% decrease in tsetse density and a decrease of disease prevalence from three cases per thousand to one case per thousand with almost no new cases being contracted during the control period. In contrast, incidence was 10 times higher in the area without vector control. Combining medical and vector control was decisive in reducing sleeping sickness transmission and could speed up the elimination process. Similar strategies could be applied in other foci.
