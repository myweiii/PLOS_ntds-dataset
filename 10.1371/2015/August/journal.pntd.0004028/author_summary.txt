Schistosomiasis japonica is a parasitic disease caused by the infection of Schistosoma japonicum. Oncomelania hupensis, serving as the unique intermediate host of S. japonicum, has a distribution highly correlated with schistosomiasis epidemic. At present, elimination of O. hupensis is still an important target for disease control in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. In mountainous regions, compared with two other endemic regions, snails are hard to detect due to the complicated environmental conditions and poor transportation systems. In this study, we developed an ecological niche model to predict the potential habitats of O. hupensis using remote sensing data including vegetation index, land surface temperature, elevation, slope and the distance from every village to its nearest stream. Validation of the approach was performed in two counties with similar ecological conditions in Yunnan Province, P.R. China. Results revealed a model with a good consistency rate of 76.67% and 83.33% for the two counties, respectively. The model holds promise for snail surveillance in mountainous regions.
