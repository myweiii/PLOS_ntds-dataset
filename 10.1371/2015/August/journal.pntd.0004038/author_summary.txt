Insect saliva contains many proteins that are injected into the mammalian host during the blood feeding process. Saliva proteins enhance the blood feeding ability of insects, but they can also induce mammalian immune responses that inhibit successful feeding, or modulate the bite site to benefit pathogen transmission. Here we studied saliva from four different tsetse species that belong to two distant species groups. We show that the saliva protein profiles of different species groups vary. Experimental mice subjected to fly bites display varying immunological responses against the abundant saliva proteins and the antigenicity of the shared saliva proteins in different tsetse species differs. We show that one member of the ADGF family with adenosine deaminase motifs, TSGF-2, is non-immunogenic in Glossina morsitans in mice, while the same protein from Glossina fuscipes is highly immunogenic. Such species-specific immune responses could be exploited as biomarkers of host exposures in the field. We also show that short-term exposure of G. morsitans to mice passively immunized by anti-TSGF antibodies leads to slight but not statistically significant negative fitness effects. Thus, future investigations with non-antigenic saliva proteins are warranted as they can lead to novel mammalian vaccine targets to reduce tsetse populations in the field.
