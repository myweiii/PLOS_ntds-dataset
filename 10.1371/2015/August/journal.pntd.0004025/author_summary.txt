The role of prostanoids, products of the arachidonic acid pathway, during Trypanosoma cruzi infection has been studied by inhibiting key enzymes in prostanoid synthesis as cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), with opposed results. Here we analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenases, prostanoid synthases and receptors in the heart of mice susceptible and non-susceptible to T. cruzi infection and found that they were highly increased respect to non-infected mice. We previously identified the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells expressing arginase-1 (Arg-1). Further analysis showed that COX-2 was expressed in Arg-1- myeloid cells in heart tissue, suggesting the existence of different myeloid populations involved in the leukocyte infiltration (COX-2+Arg-1-) and tissue repair (COX-2-Arg-1+). Mice deficient in the expression of COX-2 and the prostaglandin PGE2 receptor EP-2 infected with T. cruzi showed a marked reduction in the cardiac inflammatory infiltration in comparison with infected wild type mice, indicating an adverse effect of COX-2 and PGE2 signaling through EP-2 receptor in the development of myocarditis during acute T. cruzi infection, suggesting the possibility of immune intervention using COX inhibitors.
