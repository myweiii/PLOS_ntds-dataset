Scrub typhus, caused by the pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi, is endemic in Southeast Asia, including Laos, accounting for up to 15% of cases of undifferentiated fever in adult patients. Despite its public health importance, little is known about the genetics of the O. tsutsugamushi population in Laosâ€”this information is important for optimizing diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance. We conducted a 4 year prospective study to examine the genetic diversity of O. tsutsugamushi causing scrub typhus in Lao patients and highlight the geographical differentiation that can occur even within a small country.
