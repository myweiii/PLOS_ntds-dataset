Schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm infection, affects over 240 million people worldwide, especially children in sub-Saharan Africa. It is associated with immune hypo-responsiveness which results in an inability of the immune system to eliminate parasites. Animal models suggest that helminths induce regulatory T cells (Treg) which suppress effector cells and dampen anti-parasite activity as part of the parasites’ own strategy for survival in the human host. However, little is known about the functional capacity of Tregs during human Schistosoma haematobium infection and their interaction with adaptive responses. We designed a longitudinal study addressing the question of how anti-parasite treatment influences effector T cell activity and Treg function in peripheral blood of schoolchildren living in an S. haematobium endemic area in Lambaréné, Gabon. Our findings show that schistosome infection is associated with increased Treg frequency and that Tregs exert a suppressive effect on immune cell function in terms of both proliferation and cytokine production. Although Treg frequency decreases after anti-schistosome treatment, their suppressive capacity remains unaltered for cytokine production but their influence on proliferation weakens with treatment. By understanding how immune system is prevented from killing parasites, we hope to offer a novel route for intervention to achieve an immunological cure.
