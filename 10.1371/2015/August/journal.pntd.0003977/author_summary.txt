Chikungunya is a disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Currently, there is an epidemic of chikungunya in several islands and countries in the Americas. Despite efforts at understanding and predicting spread, there have been no studies assessing the spatio-temporal spread of chikungunya in any of the Caribbean islands, mainly due to a lack of data. Here, we present a spatio-temporal analysis of the spread of chikungunya virus in Dominica, an island in the Western Hemisphere, using geo-referenced case data. The findings in this study suggest that females are at higher risk for chikungunya virus transmission in Dominica. In addition, there is statistically significant clustering of cases in densely populated areas. Lack of data prevented additional analyses on the impact of mosquito population density, environmental factors and housing conditions on the location and timing of the clusters. This study is relevant for chikungunya control in Dominica, and other regions can use similar methods to assess chikungunya risk at the local level.
