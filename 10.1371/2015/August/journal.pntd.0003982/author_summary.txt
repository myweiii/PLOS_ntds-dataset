Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Over the last two decades, the epidemiological profile of VL has changed with epidemics occurring in large urban centers of Brazil with increased HIV/AIDS co-infection and mortality. Understanding the factors that lead to death in these patients is important to improve public health strategies and reduce mortality. We performed a prospective cohort study between August 2011 and August 2013 of 134 adult patients with VL from Campo Grande urban area. Approximately 40% had AIDS and 22% died during the 12-month follow-up. Relapses, bacterial infection, AIDS and edema were strongly associated with death among VL patients in the Brazilian urban centers. All VL patients should be screened for HIV and bacterial infection as well as to prevent VL relapses.
