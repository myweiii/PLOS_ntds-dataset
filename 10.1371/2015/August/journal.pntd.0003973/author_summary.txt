The control of Chagas disease, an infection that affects ca. 8 million people in Latin America, is mostly based on vector control activities. Understanding vector biology and how these insects interact with their environment, hosts and pathogens is crucial to improve vector control strategies. The behavior of triatomines has been largely studied, yet few reports have focused on the behavioral effects of the interaction that these insects endure with their natural parasites. Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli are two protozoan parasites found naturally infecting Rhodnius species. In this study, we showed for the first time that the locomotory activity of Rhodnius prolixus, a relevant vector of Chagas disease, is affected by trypanosome infection. T. cruzi was found to decrease bug locomotory activity during night hours, while T. rangeli promoted a generally increased insect locomotion. In addition, we searched for the R. prolixus orthologue (Rpfor) of a gene associated with the modulation of insect activity (foraging gene) and found that Rpfor expression was also affected by trypanosome infection.
