Tropical rickettsial illnesses, especially scrub typhus and murine typhus, are increasingly recognized as a leading cause of treatable undifferentiated febrile illness in Asia, but remain severely neglected and under appreciated diseases in many areas. In this study we investigated the relationship of markers of neutrophil activation and cell death with disease severity in patients with acute scrub typhus and murine typhus in Laos. These easily measurable circulating markers were associated with a 4 to 5-fold increased risk of developing severe clinical disease manifestations in scrub typhus and represent independent predictors of severe disease, and possibly death. We also found strong correlations between circulating markers of cell death and neutrophil activation in patients with scrub typhus, but not murine typhus, providing indirect evidence that neutrophil extracellular traps could contribute to the vascular damage and pro-coagulant state leading to exacerbation of disease in scrub typhus, thus indicating a detrimental role of neutrophil activation. The data suggest that increased neutrophil activation relates to disease progression and severe complications, and increased plasma levels of nucleosomes and ELA complexes represent independent risk factors for developing severe scrub typhus.
