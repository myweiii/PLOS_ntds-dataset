Dengue poses a threat to everyone worldwide, including the Orang Asli community in Peninsular Malaysia. Social demographic, knowledge and behavioral factors are essential aspects to control and prevent dengue. This study is aimed to examine these factors and their association with dengue prevention practices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 16 randomly selected Orang Asli villages from 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia. Results showed that 1) level of dengue knowledge, 2) perceived barriers to perform dengue prevention, 3) fogging frequency, and 4) perceived susceptibility to dengue fever are significant factors of dengue prevention practices. Findings provide important insights into intervention to increase dengue prevention practices among the Orang Asli community.
