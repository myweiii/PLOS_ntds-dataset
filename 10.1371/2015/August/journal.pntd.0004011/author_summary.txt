Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans can lead to a slow progressing, ulcerative disease of the skin and underlying soft tissue called Buruli ulcer. The disease is most prevalent in rural African communities with limited access to health care facilities. The most efficient means to prevent the disease, a vaccine against Buruli ulcer is not available to date. In the present study we investigated the immunogenicity and protective potential of a single cycle virus system expressing the two M. ulcerans antigens MUL2232 and MUL3720. Immunization of mice with those vesicular stomatitis virus replicon particles led to the induction of humoral as well as cellular immune responses in the immunized animals. Subsequent challenge experiments in a mouse model of M. ulcerans infection demonstrated only a limited reduction of bacterial burden in mice immunized with a prime-boost approach with MUL2232. Most probably, a vaccine formulation with only one antigen will not be able to provide protection against Buruli ulcer in humans.
