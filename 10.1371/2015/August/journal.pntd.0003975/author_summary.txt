Trypanosoma vivax is a single-celled parasite that infects cattle and non-domesticated animals through the bite of the tsetse fly. The parasite causes animal trypanosomiasis, a chronic condition resulting in severe anemia, muscle wastage and ultimately death if untreated. This disease is endemic across sub-Saharan Africa but has also spread to South America and causes considerable losses in animal productivity, impeding economic development in the worldâ€™s poorest nations. To develop new ways of preventing and treating animal trypanosomiasis, we need an accurate understanding of how the parasite causes disease. In this study, we present an analysis of gene expression throughout the T. vivax life cycle that compares the abundance of gene transcripts (mRNA) and proteins in the mammalian and insect hosts. We have identified genes that are preferentially expressed in each life stage, including many that are unique to T. vivax and probably expressed on its cell surface. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how gene expression is regulated in T. vivax and further refine a pool of T. vivax-specific genes that could be exploited to prevent and treat animal trypanosomiasis.
