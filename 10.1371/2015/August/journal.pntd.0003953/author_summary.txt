Oral rabies vaccination [ORV] is the pre-eminent example of successful vaccination of wildlife populations which has resulted in virtual elimination of fox-mediated rabies from large parts of Western and Central Europe. This achievement is unprecedented in history. Attractive species-specific baits, efficient vaccination strategy, and highly potent and safe oral rabies vaccines have been instrumental for the success. Numerous oral rabies vaccines for wildlife have been developed over the past four decades. However, information on the use of those vaccines in operational ORV programs in Europe that exists has until now not been fully publicly accessible. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of the spatio-temporal use of oral rabies vaccines over the entire period of ORV [1978–2014]. Although ‘first generation’ vaccine virus strains derived from the SAD rabies isolate are the most widely used, the results do not support significant differences in efficacy of these strains under field conditions nor can success of ORV be attributed solely to one vaccine type. In contrast, vaccination strategy is of major importance. Our analyses could help in the development of adequate rabies control strategies by documenting the importance of vaccination strategy, in which oral rabies vaccines are only one contributing component among other parameters.
