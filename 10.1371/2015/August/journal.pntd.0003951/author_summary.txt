Visceral leishmaniasis in America is caused by an unicellular organism, Leishmania infantum (syn. chagasi) that is transmitted by insects belonging to Diptera:Phlebotominae, Lutzomyia longipalpis being the principal vector in urban areas. Therefore, the prevention and control of this vector is a sound objective, so as to reduce the probability of contact human-vector and reducing the probability of infection. Therefore, knowing the variables that have an impact and the spatial scale at which these act will allow us to approach an understanding of the dynamic population of the vector and allow us to develop more appropriate strategies of control. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess a modeling approach to Lu. longipalpis distribution in an urban scenario, discriminating micro-scale landscape variables at microhabitat and macrohabitat scales. For this, we worked in Santo Tom√©, Corrientes, Argentina. We observed that the presence of Lu. longipalpis is defined only by the macrohabitat variables tested, but the abundance is defined by variables of both scales, microhabitat and macrohabitat.
