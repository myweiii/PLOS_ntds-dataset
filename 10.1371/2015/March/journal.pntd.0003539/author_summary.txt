Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major global public health problem, with nearly 2.5 billion people at risk for infection and approximately 132–391 million clinical infections annually. It has a wide geographical range, with a high disease burden in Asia, Central and South America, the Middle East, Oceania, and East Africa. Advances in sequencing technology and sample processing have made it possible to characterize the genetic diversity of P. vivax populations. This genetic variation provides a means to identify parasites by unique genetic signatures, or “barcodes.” We developed such a genetic barcode for P. vivax, composed of 42 robust and informative variants. Here we report its development and validation based on 87 clinical samples identified by microscopy to contain P. vivax from geographically diverse parasite populations from South America (Brazil, French Guiana), Africa (Ethiopia) and Asia (Sri Lanka). We show that the SNP barcode provides a genotyping tool that can be performed at low cost, providing a means to uniquely identify parasite infections and distinguish geographic origins, and that barcode data may offer new insights into P. vivax population structure and diversity.
