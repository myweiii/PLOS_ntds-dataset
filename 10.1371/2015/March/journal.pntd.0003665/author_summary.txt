Genetic recombination allows transfer of harmful traits between different strains of the same pathogen and enables the emergence of genetically novel pathogen strains that the host population has not previously encountered. This can be particularly important when a pathogen acquires a virulence trait that allows it to spread beyond its normal host population. Here we show that this happens among the single-celled parasites—trypanosomes—that cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness carried by the tsetse fly. Genetic recombination readily occurs between the human and animal parasites when they are co-transmitted by the tsetse fly, creating new pathogen genotypes or strains. There is a single gene that confers human infectivity and each of the genotypes that inherits this gene is potentially capable of infecting humans. In this way new strains of the human pathogen can be generated by recombination between the human-infective and animal-infective trypanosomes. Such novel recombinants present a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.
