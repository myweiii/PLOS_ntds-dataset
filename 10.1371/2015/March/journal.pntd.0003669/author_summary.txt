Lymphatic filariasis was highly endemic in Zanzibar when MDA commenced in 2001 to eliminate the disease. In 2006, Zanzibar, in the United Republic of Tanzania, was the first territory in Africa to complete five rounds of annual treatment using a combination of albendazole and ivermectin at 100% geographic coverage and achieving effective treatment coverage of over 65% during each round. MDA was stopped in 2006 after sentinel site surveys revealed parasite infection rates of zero in both humans and mosquito populations. In 2012, when new tools became available to verify the absence of transmission, we asked the question if transmission was truly interrupted when MDA was stopped in 2006. In January 2012, we performed the WHO recommended transmission assessment surveys (TAS) on the main islands of Unguja and Pemba to verify the absence of LF transmission in line with ongoing efforts to shrink the LF risk map. Altogether, 3275 children were tested on both islands and 89 were found to be CFA positive; 70 in Pemba and 19 in Unguja. The distribution of schools with positive children was heterogeneous with pronounced spatial variation on both islands. Based on the calculated TAS cut-offs of 18 and 20 CFA positive children for Pemba and Unguja respectively, we demonstrated that transmission was still ongoing in Pemba where the cut-off value was exceeded. We also presented evidence from previous entomological studies that LF transmission was active on Unguja shortly after stopping MDA in 2006. Based on these findings we concluded that LF transmission was still active in Zanzibar, and one million people at risk of acquiring LF, and recommended the resumption of MDA on both islands to eliminate the disease. In 2013, the government of Zanzibar decided to resume MDA with ivermectin plus albendazole on both islands.
