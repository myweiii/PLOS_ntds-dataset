New mode-of-action insecticides are required to control arthropod vectors of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Rational drug design approaches offer attractive methods to identify new insecticidal chemistries that are potent and selective for molecular targets of arthropod vectors. Previously identified antagonists of a D1-like dopamine receptor (DAR) from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti were toxic to the larvae of this species and are candidate novel insecticide leads. Building on this work, here we evaluated the molecular and pharmacological characteristics of an orthologous DAR from Culex quinquefasciatus, the vector of lymphatic filariasis and West Nile virus. We show that orthologous mosquito DARs have similar pharmacological profiles in vitro and that Ae. aegypti-active DAR antagonists are toxic to C. quinquefasciatus larvae in vivo. Sequence similarity between orthologous targets can be indicative of DAR target potential for discovery of potent, selective inhibitors. These findings justify expansion of insecticide discovery efforts to orthologous DARs from additional dipteran vectors of NTDs and provide support for DAR antagonists as a new class of chemistries for taxon-selective insecticides for vector control.
