Snake envenomation is a serious medical problem in various tropical developing countries. Though antivenoms are the main and rational treatment, they are often of low potency, expensive and/or not available. Moreover, most antivenoms are specific for the treatment of one single snake species and thus necessitate catching the culprit snake so the correct antivenom can be administered. Studies currently are being conducted with the aim of eliminating these shortcomings and to produce polyspecific antivenom capable of neutralizing multiple snake venoms. Production of snake antivenoms involves immunization of an animal, usually horses, with snake venom(s). The serum or plasma is then fractionated to yield antivenom antibodies. While the fractionation processes have been well established, the immunization protocol for the preparation of high potency antisera has rarely been reported in detail. This report describes an effective immunization protocol for the production of potent polyspecific horse antisera against all 3 medically important viper venoms of Thailand (Russellâ€™s viper, Malayan pit viper and green pit viper). The antivenom prepared from the antisera should be useful for the treatment of these viper bites. The immunization protocol should be useful in the production of other potent polyspecific antisera as well as equine antisera against other diseases.
