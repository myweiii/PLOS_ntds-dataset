Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS, caused by hantavirus) is a zoonotic infectious disease reservoired in rodent populations worldwide, but with 90% of the total cases occurring in China. Xi’an is one of the most endemic areas in China, with a total of 7,748 confirmed HFRS cases from 2005 to 2012. HFRS came to the attention of the public when two larger outbreaks occurred in Xi’an in 2010 and 2011, with 1,366 and 1,067 cases being reported, respectively. By using 8 years of surveillance data (2005–2012) on HFRS dynamics, including data on the main rodent host reservoir, human cases, and weather conditions, we show how the epidemic dynamics of HFRS were associated with seasonality, rodent abundance, rainfall, and temperature. We find that the two larger HFRS outbreaks coincided with the abrupt increase of rodent abundance and/or rainfall. We present a statistical model revealing strong effects of seasonality and autocorrelation and additional effects of rodent density and rainfall on HFRS incidence that gives robust prediction; this approach could be a very practical tool in Xi’an.
