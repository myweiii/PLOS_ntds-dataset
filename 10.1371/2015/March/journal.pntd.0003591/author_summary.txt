The approach proposed in this study can provide a valuable contribution to strengthen the efforts to reduce rabies incidence, a relevant public health problem worldwide. In Brazil during the period from 2001â€“2012, 129 human cases of rabies were notified, with 128 deaths. It is imperative to decrease rabies virus circulation both in domestic and wildlife species, which has been reinforced by many studies demonstrating that rabies incidence is often much higher than the official reports. This study used a dataset of 10,112 rabies diagnoses in animals provided by the Brazilian passive surveillance and applied spatial analysis in addition to many indicators to highlight high positivity rate areas and accurately identify silent areas and regions where underreporting occurs. This type of approach is vital to establish priorities for epidemiologic surveillance strategically and to precisely focus actions in the required regions. These spatial analysis techniques combined with other sources of information can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of passive surveillance for rabies and improve the strategies already adopted by government programs to control and prevent the disease. We consider our results an important achievement in envisioning effectiveness in the process to eliminate rabies worldwide.
