Mycobacterium leprae is the causative organism of the disease so called leprosy. It posses global health challenge due to the emergence of drug resistant M. leprae bacilli. In search for new drug targeting strategies, study of bacterial energy metabolism is significant. Reports claim that M. leprae generates ATP, an important energy metabolite, which is very much required for its own biochemical activities and unlike other organisms, it neednâ€™t require host species as a source of ATP. The growth and survival of these pathogenic bacteria in infected hosts are supported by an immunodominant antigenic membrane protein called HSP18. Hereby we report for the first time evidences of HSP18 and ATP interaction in vitro and quantified the same. We also identified the Walker-B ATP binding motif in M. leprae HSP18. Our study reveals that HSP18 when interacts with ATP, undergoes an enhancement in its anti-aggregation property. We demonstrate here a novel report on ability of HSP18 to prevent thermal inactivation of enzymes which is also enhanced in presence of ATP. Our study provides new insights into the effect of ATP on the structure and chaperone function of M. leprae HSP18 which may be critical for survival of M. leprae bacilli. This may provide a new basis for the development of new drug targeting strategy such as ATP competitive antibiotics/inhibitors in context of effective treatment of leprosy.
