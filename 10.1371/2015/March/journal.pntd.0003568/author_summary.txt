Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in many low-income countries. However, their role in diarrheal diseases is still under discussion. Many epidemiological studies focus on individuals with diarrheal symptoms only, ignoring the fact that infections may progress asymptomatically as well. In order to identify infectious agents associated with diarrhea it is imperative to consider cases without symptoms as a control group. We conducted a case-control study, including 548 children with diarrhea and 651 children without gastrointestinal symptoms in order to untangle the role of gastrointestinal infections in diarrheal disease. As shown in other studies infections with rotavirus, Shigella spp./EIEC and norovirus are responsible for the main diarrhea burden. Co-infections are frequently observed in our study group and some organisms occur more frequently in the presence of a second one. Especially Giardia lamblia, which is not associated with diarrhea, is more often observed along with Campylobacter jejuni and norovirus, which are responsible for a high number of diarrheal episodes. This may be of particular interest since G. lamblia is, with a frequency of 40% within the study group, the most prevalent organism observed. Furthermore, the high number of co-infections challenged the identification of causative pathogens since diagnosing a particular isolate may not rule out the effect of another potentially infectious agent in diarrheal disease. We observed a strong effect of age on the course of an infection, which may guide clinicians when diagnosing causes of diarrhea.
