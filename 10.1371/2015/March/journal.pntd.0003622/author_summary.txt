In people living with HIV infection, simultaneous infections can adversely affect HIV disease. This has been seen with bacterial (tuberculosis), viral (cytomegalovirus), and parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis). Lymphatic filariasis is caused by a thin thread-like parasite that lives in the lymph vessels of infected people. It can cause significant disability. This infection is found in much of the same areas that high levels of HIV infection. We were interested in knowing if lymphatic filariasis changed the course of HIV infection in people with both diseases. In this study, the authors enrolled people in India who were living with HIV who either had or didnâ€™t have filarial infection. All patients were treated for filariasis with 2 drugs, and then were followed for 1 year to see how their HIV disease progressed. No difference in HIV disease progression was found between the groups that did or did not have filariasis before treatment. The patients with HIV did well with the medicine for filariasis.
