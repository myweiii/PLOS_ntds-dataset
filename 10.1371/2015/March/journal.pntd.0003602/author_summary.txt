G6PD deficiency affects over 400 million people worldwide. This enormously diverse disorder causes acute hemolytic anemia upon exposure to oxidizing chemicals, e.g., naphthalene, some sulfa drugs, and certain antimalarials, including primaquine. The primary public health concern with G6PD deficiency involves that latter drug, the only one available for the radical cure of vivax and ovale malarias. Absent primaquine therapy, patients will suffer multiple recurrent attacks called relapses in the two years following the primary attack. Primaquine in G6PD-deficient patients triggers a mild to severe acute hemolytic anemia, depending upon dose administered and the specific variant involved. Relatively high therapeutic doses in severely deficient variants will threaten life. Malaria therapeutic policy and practice regarding primaquine may hinge upon the prevalence and severity of G6PD deficiency weighed against the therapeutic benefit of averting risk of relapse and attendant morbidity, mortality and onward transmission. In the current study we aimed to inform that weighing by characterizing the frequency and type of G6PD deficiency occurring in populations enduring endemic vivax malaria transmission on a single island in eastern Indonesia. The findings infer risk of serious harm caused by primaquine administered to residents of unknown G6PD status.
