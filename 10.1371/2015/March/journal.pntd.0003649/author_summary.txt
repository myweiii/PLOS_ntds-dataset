Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic disease affecting children in Africa, with impacts on health, growth and cognitive development. Recently, the World Health Organization has recommended inclusion of preschool-aged children (≤5 years) in schistosome control programmes. However, so far the performance of available morbidity diagnostic tools has not been thoroughly evaluated in this age group. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a study in preschool children comparing the utility of currently available point-of-care tools for diagnosing Schistosoma haematobium-related morbidity, namely: questionnaire-reported haematuria and dysuria, clinical examination, dipstick urinalysis, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). We also investigated the performance of these tools in older children (6–10 years). Our study identified UACR as the most reliable tool for detecting schistosome-related morbidity in terms of the morbidity attributable to schistosome infection, followed by dipsticks, visual urine inspection, questionnaires, and lastly clinical examination The study further showed that the tools currently used in school-aged children for diagnosing schistosome-related morbidity can be extended to preschool children, allowing easier integration of this age group into treatment and monitoring programmes.
