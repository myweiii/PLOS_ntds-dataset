The emergence of infectious diseases can have devastating public health and economic consequences. Being able to identify such events at early stages could significantly mitigate some of these outcomes. In many resource poor regions of the world, current surveillance methods are hindered by the costs associated with collecting, storing and shipping clinical specimens. Herein we present a novel surveillance approach termed xenosurveillance that addresses some of these hurdles. Specifically, we leverage the feeding behavior of mosquitoes to sample human blood, which is then preserved on filter cards. Our laboratory studies demonstrated that such an approach can be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes at clinically relevant concentrations. Subsequently, we tested the feasibility of xenosurveillance in West Africa and found the presence of two vertebrate viral pathogens, Epstein Barr virus and canine distemper virus. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and suggest that it could be used to detect and predict pathogen outbreaks at earlier, more actionable stages of emergence.
