Understanding how immune responses are generated is critical for vaccine development. There are comparatively few studies on the interface between the innate and adaptive immune system in generating protective immune responses. Infections with helminth parasites, a cause of neglected tropical diseases, have a huge collective impact on public health in affected developing countries. Helminths are associated with a complex type 2 immune response mediated by cytokines characteristically produced by adaptive T helper 2 cells (TH2). However in recent years a newly described type of innate immune cells has been shown to produce TH2 cytokines. This cell type was subsequently called ‘Group 2 innate lymphoid cells’ (ILC2s). The importance of these cells has been demonstrated in experimental models of helminth infection as well as in allergic diseases. The present study describes changes in human ILC2s during the human helminth infection schistosomiasisas (bilharzia). Our study shows that the proportions of ILC2s, were lower in young, but not older infected children when compared to uninfected participants, suggesting a role for ILC2s before the establishment of helminth protective acquired immunity. Furthermore ILC2s were restored after curative treatment of the helminth infection. Human mechanistic studies will determine if the association between ILC2s and schistosome infection is causal or a marker of resistance to infection.
