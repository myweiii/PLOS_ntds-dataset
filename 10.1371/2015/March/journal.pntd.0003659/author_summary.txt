Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the main clinical manifestation of Chagas disease (CD), a neglected illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. More than hundred years after its discovery, CD continues to be a public health problem and millions of chronically infected people wait for an effective treatment. Chagasic cardiomyopathy is associated with CD8+ T-cell-enriched myocarditis, fibrosis and cardiac electrical and structural abnormalities, frequently progressing to heart failure. Presently, the available therapies only mitigate symptoms of CCC. Abnormalities in CD8+ T-cell compartment are present in CCC patients. Recently, we described the importance of CD8+ T-cells in the pathogenesis of CCC. Therefore, our proposal was to interfere with abnormalities of CD8+ T-cells glimpsing a better prognosis for CCC. Using PTX, an affordable drug with immunomodulatory properties on T-cells and cardioprotective effects in non-infections disease, we bring a therapeutic candidate for treating CCC. PTX therapy downmodulated detrimental CD8+ T-cells and promoted T. cruzi-specific interferon-gamma-producing T-cells. Importantly, chronic chagasic electrical and echocardiographic alterations were reversed by PTX therapy. Future studies may test the use of PTX combined with trypanocidal drug or as a vaccine adjuvant to improve the quality of life of chronic CD patients.
