Salmonella enterica is a diverse species, isolates of which can colonise or infect many different animals, including humans and can cause different disease syndromes. S. enterica can be sub-typed using serology into serovars. Isolates from some serovars, known as generalists, can infect multiple hosts (e.g. S. Typhimurium) and usually cause gastroenteritis. However, other serovars exhibit host adaptation or even restriction. Host-adapted serovars such as S. Dublin show preference for a particular host but can also infect other hosts, while host-restricted serovars are capable of infecting only a single host (e.g. S. Typhi in humans) and frequently cause febrile systemic disease (typhoid). In this study, we use genotypic and phenotypic methods to investigate clinical isolates representative of populations of two recently emerged S. Typhimurium lineages of type ST313 associated with invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results identify potential characteristics in these isolates that may be associated with adaptation to invasive disease in humans with a compromised immunity.
