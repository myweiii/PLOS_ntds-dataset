The underlying risk factors that lead to severe human Rift Valley Fever disease are unknown, but are likely multi-factorial. Host factors, such as innate immune genetic makeup, are likely important determinants of disease phenotype. This study investigated the association of 46 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding innate immune receptors, signaling pathways or mediators with RVF disease phenotype. Of the 46 SNPs tested, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, MyD88, TRIF, MAVS, and RIG-I were repeatedly associated with severe RVF symptomatology, suggesting that these genes may have a robust association with RVFV-associated clinical outcomes.
