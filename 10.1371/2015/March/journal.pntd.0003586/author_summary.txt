Melioidosis is an infection caused by the soil bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei; patients usually present with pneumonia, blood-stream infection and/or skin or internal organ abscesses. Melioidosis occurs most commonly in northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It has a high mortality rate and, with standard treatment, a relapse rate greater than 5%; patients who relapse often represent severely unwell. Treatment comprises an intensive (intravenous antibiotic) phase, followed by a prolonged eradication (oral antibiotic) phase. Previous studies have found that the intensive phase is important to prevent mortality, and the eradication phase is important to prevent relapse. However, these studies have not been designed to detect an effect of intensive therapy on relapse rate. We know that adherence to eradication therapy is poor, and many of our patients live remotely making follow-up difficult. In order to address this, we have developed a new treatment guideline which stipulates a longer intensive phase for most patients. We show that adherence to this guideline is associated with very low relapse rates despite poor adherence to eradication therapy. It is possible that for many patients the eradication phase could be shortened or avoided when this intensive phase guideline is followed; this requires further research.
