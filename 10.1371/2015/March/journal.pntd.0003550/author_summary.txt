Although livestock vaccination is effective in preventing Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks, there are concerns about safety and effectiveness of the only commercially available vaccine for the disease. Here, we conducted a field trial in Kenya to evaluate the safety and ability to induce protection for a new RVF vaccine, referred to as Clone 13, that was recently registered in South Africa. A total of 404 animals, consisting of cattle, sheep, and goats, were divided two groups and one group was vaccinated with Clone 13 vaccine while the other group was not vaccinated. The animals were followed for one year and analyzed for RVF antibody levels at days 14, 28, 56, 183, and 365 after vaccination. Between 91% and 97% of vaccinated sheep and goats develop antibodies to the vaccine, whereas only 67% of the vaccinated cattle developed antibodies. These finding indicate that the Clone 13 vaccine induces high levels of protective antibodies in sheep and goats and moderate levels in cattle. The vaccine was safe since none of vaccinated animals developed evidence of RVF disease including deformities in newborns, and only 1 out of 120 pregnant animals had an abortion that was not associated with the RVF disease.
