Tungiasis is the condition caused by jigger infestation. It is common in tropical countries where it has caused high morbidity among economically disadvantaged communities. It is a neglected tropical disease to an extent that enough research has not been done in this area. More over the infested hardly seek medical treatment due to stigma. Consequently, the pathological and immunological characteristic of this ectoparasite are not well understood. Hence effective therapy is not yet found. Some traditional methods to combat tungiasis such as extraction of embedded fleas could lead to spread of HIV through sharing of contaminated sharp objects especially in schools. This call for more appropriate strategies to fight the menace, including the ones based on immunological characteristic of the parasite. This study therefore is an initial deliberate endeavor to achieve this goal. Result of this study shows that T. penetrans isolates possess three important immuno-dominant antigens. These antigens results in immunological responses experienced by the victims such as inflammation. Further analysis of these results could give in-depth information on immunological characteristics of the parasite and its pathological effects on victims. This could make fertile grounds for designing of effective and preventive strategies against the parasite or its pathological effects.
