Urban transmission of schistosomiasis is becoming more recognized as rural disease is becoming less common and urbanization increases. Characteristics of infection of the immigrant population to cities and genetic characteristics of the parasite population itself indicate local transmission is the most important factor for the presence of the parasite rather than arrival of infected immigrants. While there is 70% coverage of adequate sanitation, this was insufficient to interrupt transmission. If eliminated, this focus is unlikely to readily reappear due to immigration.
