Clonorchiasis, caused by Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection, is a kind of neglected tropical disease. There are still few effective measures to prevent clonorchiasis. As in other helminthes, hexokinase (HK) has been well characterized as a target for vaccine and drug development. In the current study, we identified differences in spatial structure between CsHK and HKs from the definitive C. sinensis hosts, humans and rats. We also characterized the substrate specificity and allosteric regulation of rCsHK in detail. The distribution of CsHK in the worm and in the liver tissue and serum from C. sinensis infected rats were confirmed. Furthermore, a high-level specific antibody in rat was induced by immunization with rCsHK. The enzymatic activity of CsHK was suppressed by the antibody in vitro. Additionally, the survival of C. sinensis was inhibited by the antibody in vivo and in vitro. Our study shows that CsHK has vaccine potential and is a promising drug target for Clonorchiasis.
