Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a skin infection caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania major (L. major). The only available treatment option is chemotherapy, which is toxic and expensive. Currently, there is no vaccine. Although inoculation of virulent L. major (leishmanization) that provides effective protection in humans was widely applied, it was discontinued due to safety concerns. To improve the safety of leishmanization, we applied agonists of Toll-like receptor in the leishmanization to induce parasite-specific immune responses. In particular, we show here that inoculation with live L. major plus a TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 in both resistant (C57BL/6) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains completely prevents the development of lesion and decreases parasite burden. The improved pathology is associated with enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-12 from dermal dendritic cells and macrophages. Both Th1 and Th17 responses are enhanced in C57BL/6 mice. Although only the Th1 response was enhanced in BALB/c mice in the presence of Pam3CSK4, there is an enhanced and sustained neutrophil influx at sites of infection. Overall, our study reveals the clinical significance of TLR2 agonist in treating cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, the protective mechanism may be quite different depending upon the genetic background of the host.
