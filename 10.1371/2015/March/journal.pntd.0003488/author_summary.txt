This study was an attempt to discover new safe therapeutic modalities of natural origin for the treatment eumycetoma. The methanolic extracts of seven selected local plants were screened for their antifungal activity. All seven plant extracts were able to inhibit Madurella mycetomatis growth at a concentration of 50 μg/ml or less. Three plant species out of the seven managed to inhibit the growth of Madurella mycetomatis at a concentration as low as 781 μg/ml; these were: Boswellia papyrifera, Acacia nubica and Nigella sativa. Further analysis of B. Papyrifera, using Gas-Liquid-Chromatography hybrid Mass-Spectrophotometer (GC-MS); showed the occurrence of four phytoconstituents, triterpenoid in nature and these were Beta-amyrin, Beta-amyrone, Beta-Sitosterol and Stigmatriene. Stigmatriene was the best to show anti-mycetoma activity at an MIC equal to 32 μg/ml. This MIC is much higher than the MIC of the whole extract (8 μg/ml), indicating that other compounds or a combination of compounds has a better ability to inhibit M. mycetomatis growth. These results are promising and further detailed studies are highly recommended.
