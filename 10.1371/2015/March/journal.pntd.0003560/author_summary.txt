In Zimbabwe, we treated cattle with spray or pour-on formulations of deltamethrin, as recommended by the manufacturers for control of tsetse flies. We then gauged the degree of dung contamination, using field bioassays involving adult beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). In the first 16 days after whole-body spraying, beetle mortality was up to 18%, as against 76% for pour-on applied to the back or flanks. Specialised treatments involved the application of reduced doses of deltamethrin to only the shoulder or anal area, oral administration and use of a collared animal that could not lick its flank. It seemed that dung was contaminated by contact with insecticide near the anus as the cattle defecated, and by ingestion of insecticide as the cattle licked themselves. Spraying only the legs of cattle produced negligible deaths of beetles when treatment intervals were five or 25 days, but daily treatment caused mortality to rise to ~70% after three weeks. Treating only certain parts of the body surface of cattle reduces the threats to dung fauna and improves the economy and convenience of controlling tsetse.
