Toxocariasis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution caused by dog (Toxocara canis) or cat (T. catis) roundworm that can be fully asymptomatic or may cause significant disease such as a the systemic syndrome called visceral larva migrans as well as neurological or eye manifestations. Toxocariasis prevails in tropical areas, but information about this disease in travelers and migrants is scarce. In this study, we describe in detail a case series of 28 international travelers, mostly adults, diagnosed with toxocariasis from 2000 to 2013 at the reference travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp, Belgium. We found this infection in all types of travelers returning from any part of the world. Clinical symptoms, when present, varied widely and an increase of the blood eosinophil count was almost always present. Morbidity was substantial and 2 patients had severe neurological complications. Diagnosis was difficult in travelers because the illness often resembled other tropical infections. Recovery was, however, complete, either spontaneously or with anti-parasitic drugs, except in both cases with neurological involvement. Toxocariasis is one of the numerous parasitic infections to consider in travelers returning from the tropics with any type of symptoms or with an increased blood eosinophil count.
