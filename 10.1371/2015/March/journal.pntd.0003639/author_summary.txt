In Taiwan, around 1,500 cases of dengue fever are reported annually. Surveillance and outbreak preparedness are important activities aimed at reducing the burden of dengue fever worldwide. A national web-based Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NDSS) for dengue fever has been established since 1997 in Taiwan to monitor trends, and support case and outbreak management. We evaluated this surveillance system based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and operational staff interviews to ascertain the extent to which stated objectives are being achieved. The results indicate that the NDSS for dengue fever surveillance works well, is easy to use, and can be used to accurately identify cases. The findings have informed recommendations to improve surveillance and its use in outbreak response, including efforts to improve data completeness. Comprehensive surveillance exemplified by the NDSS for dengue fever in Taiwan is necessary for establishing a clear picture of the local burden and distribution of dengue fever to effectively support public health response.
