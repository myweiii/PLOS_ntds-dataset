In this report, we evaluated individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic dengue virus (DENV) infections during a 2013 DENV outbreak in Southern China, as well as performed post-outbreak serological testing for DENV IgG antibodies, to better understand DENV transmission. These findings suggest a high rate of asymptomatic cases, which has important implications for future dengue control.
