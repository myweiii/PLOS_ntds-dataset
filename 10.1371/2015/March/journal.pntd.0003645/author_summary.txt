Laos is a land-locked rabies-endemic country in Southeast Asia that is surrounded by five rabies-endemic countries. Thus, there is increasing concern that the epidemiology of rabies in Laos is influenced by infrastructure development and economic activities, including international transport of dogs for meat consumption. Studies on the epidemiology of rabies are limited in this country. Therefore, to gain further information about the epidemiology and the genetic characteristics of circulating rabies viruses, this study was conducted using samples submitted to the rabies Lao Ministry of Agriculture and Forestryâ€™s National Animal Health Centre rabies laboratory. Out of 18 provinces, samples were submitted mainly from the capital Vientiane and Champasak province. Data from the period 2004 through 2011 showed a gradual increase in rabies-positive samples. Dogs were the main viral reservoir, and genetic analyses of samples collected from February 2011 through March 2012 showed that three viral lineages are currently circulating in the country. These rabies viruses are related to those of neighboring countries, indicating shared ancestry but no recent viral invasion.
