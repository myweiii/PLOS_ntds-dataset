Echinococcus granulosus is a causative agent of hydatidosis, a parasitic disease that affects humans and livestock with significant economic and public health impact worldwide. Antigen B (EgAgB), an abundant product of E. granulosus larvae, is a lipoprotein that carries a wide variety of lipids, including fatty acids and cholesterol. As E. granulosus is unable to synthesize these lipids, EgAgB likely plays an important role in parasite metabolism, participating in both the acquisition of host lipids and their distribution between parasite tissues. The protein component of EgAgB consists of 8 kDa subunits encoded by separate genes. However, the biochemical properties of EgAgB subunits, particularly their ability to bind and transfer lipids, are poorly known. Herein, using in vitro assays, we found that EgAgB subunits were capable of oligomerizing in the absence of lipids and to bind fatty acids, but not cholesterol. Moreover, EgAgB subunits showed the ability to transfer fatty acids to artificial phospholipid membranes. These results indicate new points of attack at which the parasite might be vulnerable to drugs.
