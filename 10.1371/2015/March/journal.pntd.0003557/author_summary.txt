Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most fatal form of leishmaniasis disease in Indian subcontinent. Through proteomic approaches, NAD-dependent Silent information regulator-2 was identified as one of the potent immunostimulatory proteins. Herein, it was first reported the cloning, expression, purification and immunobiochemical characterization of a NAD+-dependent protein from Leishmania donovani. The gene encodes a monomeric protein (LdSir2RP) of approximately 45 kDa and showed NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity. LdSir2RP was immunodetected in whole cell lysate of L. donovani and further it immunolocalized in cytoplasm of the Leishmania parasite. Recombinant protein rLdSir2RP shown immunogenicity in PBMCs of cured Leishmania patients and hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). rLdSir2RP stimulated the production of IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α but not IL-4 and IL-10. This was further supported by remarkable increase in IgG2 antibody level.
It was further demonstrated that rLdSir2RP was able to provide considerable protection to hamsters against L. donovani challenge. These results supported by the increased iNOS mRNA transcript and the specific Th1-type cytokines—IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α and down-regulation of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β. Hence, it is inferred that rLdSir2RP confer significant protection against experimental VL and considered as potential vaccine targets against visceral leishmaniasis.
