Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an important cause of neurologic infections in Asia, resulting in substantial disability and deaths. Although believed to be endemic in the Philippines, little is known of the epidemiology and geographic distribution of this disease in the country. We reviewed data from clinical studies, prevalence surveys and animal studies since the 1950s. Based on this review, JEV is an important cause of encephalitis and febrile illness in all three major island groups of the country. The majority of cases were seen in children younger than 15 years and males were more often affected than females. The national laboratory initiated testing of referred cases in 2009 and surveillance for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with laboratory confirmation of a subset of cases was established in 2011. From 2011 to 2014, there were 1,032 cases of suspected JE. Of 497 cases with specimens tested, 73 (15%) had laboratory-confirmed JE. Our findings confirm that JE has an extensive geographic distribution in the Philippines. These findings support the introduction of JE vaccine into the countryâ€™s routine immunization program.
