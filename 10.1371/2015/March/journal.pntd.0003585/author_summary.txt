Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection, is one of the common febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for up to 20% of febrile hospital admissions in rural areas of southern Asia. It has been estimated that one billion people are at risk and one million cases occur annually in the Asian-Pacific region. Despite continuous efforts to develop a vaccine against scrub typhus during the last several decades, all approaches have failed to induce effective immunity. The main issue for the development of a scrub typhus vaccine is the selection of proper antigens that cover a broad range of antigenic strains and induce long-lasting immunity. Here, we examined the potential use of ScaA protein as a vaccine antigen. Our findings demonstrate that ScaA protein functions as a bacterial adhesion factor and an antibody against ScaA significantly inhibits bacterial infection into host cells. In addition, ScaA vaccination provides protective immunity against lethal challenges of the homologous strain, and also confers better protection against heterologous strains when combined with TSA56, the major outer membrane protein that was previously used as a potential vaccine antigen. These results indicate that ScaA proteins could be used as a novel vaccine target for scrub typhus.
