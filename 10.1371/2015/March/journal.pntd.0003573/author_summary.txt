Nontyphoidal Salmonellae (NTS) are an emerging major cause of invasive bacterial disease in African children aged less than 5 years and immunocompromised adults, with an estimated case fatality rate of 20â€“25%. NTS also cause diarrhoea, a killer of about 1.5 million young children annually, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. No vaccine against NTS is available, but improved understanding of the Salmonella bacteria that cause disease in Africa would help the development of new vaccines. The authors characterized a collection of 192 Kenyan NTS strains (114 S. Typhimurium and 78 S. Enteritidis) from blood and stool specimens. All strains could be killed to differing extents by antibodies present in the blood of healthy HIV-uninfected African adults, supporting the development of a vaccine that will induce protective antibodies when given to African children. Differences in killing by antibody were partly related to the amount of O-antigen on the bacterial surface. There were no clear distinction between stains causing invasive disease and diarrhoea, suggesting that the same strains may be capable of causing both forms of disease. Clarification of this will require genomic analysis.
