Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is an endemic protozoan disease affecting many African countries, predominantly in rural areas where the tsetse fly vector is present. HAT diagnosis currently relies on conventional microscopy techniques, which provide relatively low sensitivity and are often unable to distinguish between the two different HAT-causing subspecies, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. A delay in HAT diagnosis can result in disease progression from an early stage (hemolymphatic) to a late stage (meningoencephalitic); therefore, a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test is crucial to its successful treatment. In this study, we developed a simple and highly sensitive molecular technique for HAT diagnosis. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a method that rapidly amplifies DNA with high sensitivity under isothermal conditions. We optimized and modified the technique by stabilizing the reagents and simplifying the sample preparation for the diagnosis of HAT. The whole protocol is so simple that local staff can perform it without the need for costly equipment and expertise.
