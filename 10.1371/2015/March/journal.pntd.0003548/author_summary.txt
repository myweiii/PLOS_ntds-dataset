Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes serious disease in both animals and humans. Large-scale outbreaks result in devastating economic losses and create many urgent public health concerns. Among humans, the symptoms of RVF are variable, having a broad spectrum of disease that ranges from mild to severe fever symptoms, and can include ocular complications, encephalitis, and sometimes hemorrhagic disease. In this study, 1082 at-risk Kenyan subjects were serum antibody-tested for evidence of prior RVFV infection and their demographic, health, and exposure data were collated. Seroprevalence was moderately high across the study area (15%) but did not differ significantly among villages across the study region. Age, gender, and herding occupation were all significantly associated with being RVFV seropositive. Older age, village and certain animal husbandry activities were associated with more severe disease. Poor visual acuity was more likely in the seropositive group. This better definition of risk factors and associated symptom complexes should prove helpful for RVF screening during future outbreaks in high-risk rural settings.
