Dengue is a viral illness acquired through the bite of an infected mosquito. This flu-like illness, which in rare instances can be fatal, threatens more than half of the world’s population. Both in vitro and clinical studies looking at how the virus operates have consistently found that the interferon response is modulated by the virus during infection. We looked at the ability of dengue virus (DENV) strains to inhibit phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT1) after IFN-β stimulation and observed that contrary to earlier published reports; all DENVs are capable of inhibiting IFN-α/β signaling. Strains from the DENV-2 sylvatic genotype, which mainly infect non-human primates (NHP), displayed an increased ability to inhibit pSTAT1 compared to the Asian strain 16681. To our surprise, DENVs were only capable of inhibiting pSTAT1 in human cell lines, but not in NHP cell lines. Inhibition of pSTAT1 is observed in both human and NHP primary dendritic cells. These results have important implications in the use of NHP cell lines for studies of IFN-α/β inhibition by DENV in vitro and may be a relevant consideration when using NHPs for DENV pre-clinical studies.
