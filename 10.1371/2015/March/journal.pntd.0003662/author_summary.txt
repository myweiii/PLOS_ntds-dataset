The study of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum) proteins that mediate adhesion to host tissue components is pivotal to understand how the syphilis agent establishes infection and is able to invade virtually every organ system following dissemination from the site of entry. This study focuses on T. pallidum TP0136, a known plasma fibronectin (Fn) and super Fn binding protein that is heterogeneous in sequence among T. pallidum isolates. This study shows that TP0136 also mediates attachment to human cellular Fn, that TP0136 conserved NH2-terminus is primarily responsible for binding to plasma Fn, but that cellular Fn binding sites appears to be scattered throughout the molecule. Message quantification experiments reveal that tp0136 transcription is high during experimental syphilis and increases at the time of bacterial immune clearance, suggesting a role for this antigen in counteracting the host defenses during infection, as reported for other Fn binding proteins in other pathogens. Our data deepen the current knowledge of the function of T. pallidum TP0136 and further support a role for this virulence factor in syphilis pathogenesis.
