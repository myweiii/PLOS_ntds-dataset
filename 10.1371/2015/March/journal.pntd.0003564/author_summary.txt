The four serotypes of the mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) cause an estimated 390 million human infections per annum. Symptomatic infection can manifest itself as a self-limiting febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), or as more severe and potentially life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Severe disease development is usually associated with the presence of pre-existing Abs that enhance DENV infection rather than neutralize it. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection is believed to contribute to high viral loads that prelude the development of severe disease. Indeed, Abs binding to the DENV surface glycoproteins E and prM are known to enhance infection. Here, we studied the role of prM Abs and prM-containing immature virions in the pathogenesis of severe disease. We analyzed the ability of acute sera of DF, DHF and DSS patients to bind, neutralize and/or enhance immature DENV infection. We found that a significant fraction of Abs bind to prM protein of DENV2; however, there was no difference between the disease severity groups. Moreover, we did not observed any specific correlation between the neutralizing/enhancing activity towards immature DENV2 and disease presentation. Based on these data we inferred that prM Abs and immature virions are not a discriminating factor in dengue pathogenesis. These findings are important for the understanding of dengue pathogenesis and the development of new vaccines.
