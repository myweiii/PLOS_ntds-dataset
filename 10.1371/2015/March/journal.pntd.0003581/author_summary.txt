Infantile thiamine deficiency (beriberi), is rarely seen today after decades of strong public health attention. Infantile beriberi occurs mainly in infants breastfed by mothers with inadequate intake of thiamine. There is evidence of the persistence of infantile thiamine deficiency in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, but insufficient data from outside Vientiane to justify a policy recommendation. We describe possible and probable cases of infantile thiamine deficiency in northern Laos using retrospective and prospective hospital data. In addition we conducted a cross sectional survey in 22 villages where the infants originated. Infantile thiamine deficiency was quite common in retrospective and prospective (hospitals: 54, villages: 17) and cross-sectional surveys (hospital: 4, villages: 10). A second peak of infantile mortality was observed before 6 months and was associated with a high infant mortality in the villages, 106 per 1000 live births (95%CI: 86â€“128). A total of 60 pregnant mothers and 70 lactating women showed signs of thiamine deficiency. This situation requires urgent attention in Laos.
