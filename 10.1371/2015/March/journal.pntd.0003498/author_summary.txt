Scabies is a neglected tropical skin disease caused by the tiny parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is common in developing countries, and scabies outbreaks also occur in institutional settings worldwide. Scabies often underlies secondary bacterial skin infection and resulting complications, and is thus associated with considerable morbidity. Crusted scabies is a an extremely severe and debilitating clinical form of the disease, but host immune responses leading to the development of crusted or ordinary scabies are poorly understood. This is largely due to limited access to clinical samples, and the difficulty in monitoring the progression of infestation in human patients. We have overcome this challenge by using a pig model of scabies infestation, since pigs and humans with scabies display clinical and immunological similarities. In this study, we undertook longitudinal analysis of clinical, histological and molecular immunological changes in pigs experimentally infected with scabies. We confirmed that disease severity was associated with a pronounced allergic, Th2 immune response, as previously reported. In a novel finding, we showed that the Th17 associated cytokines interleukin-17 and interleukin-23 were also associated with the development of crusted scabies. This may lead to new immunotherapeutic strategies to protect vulnerable subjects from contracting recurrent crusted scabies.
