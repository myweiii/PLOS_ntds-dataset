Information on the geographical distribution, dispersal mechanisms and dispersion route of insect-borne diseases can help to identify ongoing transmission areas, new risk areas and guide surveillance and control activities. Lutzomyia longipalpis, the principal vector of American visceral leishmaniasis disease in the Americas, is a group of closely related species that can be separated according to the type of pheromone produced by male individuals. It is still unclear how many members there are in this complex, how they are related and if some are more important vectors than others. In the present study, we show that the expansion of human visceral leishmaniasis in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, has followed the same dispersion route of only one of the two related species of L. longipalpis found in the state. The maps that we produced in the present study will allow us to determine risk areas for the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis, and reinforces our hypothesis that within São Paulo state these chemotype populations could have different biological capacities to act as a vector.
