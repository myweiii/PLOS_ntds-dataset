Understanding of the impact of weather variables on HFMD transmission remains limited due to various local climatic conditions, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics in different regions. This study provides quantitative evidence that the incidence of HFMD cases was significantly associated with temperature in Shanxi Province, North China. The delayed effects of weather variables on HFMD dictate different public health responses in 4 major cities in Shanxi Province. The results may provide a direction for local community and health authorities to perform public health actions, and the SARIMA models are helpful in the prediction of epidemics, determination of high-risk areas and susceptible populations, allocation of health resources, and the formulation of relevant prevention strategies. In order to reduce future risks of climatic variations on HFMD epidemics, similar studies in other geographical areas are needed, together with a longer study period to enable trend analysis which takes into consideration local weather conditions and demographic characteristics.
