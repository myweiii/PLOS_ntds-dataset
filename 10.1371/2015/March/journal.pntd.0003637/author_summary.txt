The success of any disease eradication campaign depends on considering possible non-human reservoirs of the disease. Although the first report of T. pallidum infection in baboons was published in the 1970â€™s and the zoonotic potential was demonstrated by inoculation of a West African simian strain into humans, nonhuman primates have not yet been considered as a possible reservoir for re-emerging yaws in Africa. Simian strains are genetically most closely related to the strains that cause yaws in humans. The identification of baboons as a reservoir for human infection in Africa would be revolutionary and aid important aspects to yaws eradication programs. Reliable serological tests and a useful standardized test algorithm for the screening of wild baboon populations are essential for studying potential transmission events between monkeys and humans.
