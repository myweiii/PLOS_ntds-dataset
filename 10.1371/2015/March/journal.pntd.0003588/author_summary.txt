Visceral leishmaniasis is the second most lethal parasitic infection after malaria. Other forms of leishmaniasis also cause significant morbidity. However, there are few treatments available, and many cause severe side effects or are associated with the development of resistance. A key difference between mammalian cells and Leishmania parasites is the type of sterol in their membranes: while mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol, Leishmania parasites use ergosterol. There has therefore been considerable interest in developing inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis pathways to target Leishmania parasites. Sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) is one of the enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, and the target of significant drug development research in Leishmania. Here we use a double approach to determine whether this gene is essential in Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. We demonstrate via gene knockout and drug targeting approaches that loss or inhibition of CYP51 inhibits L. donovani growth. These results validate CYP51 as a drug target in L. donovani and support further work to develop CYP51-directed therapies for visceral leishmaniasis.
