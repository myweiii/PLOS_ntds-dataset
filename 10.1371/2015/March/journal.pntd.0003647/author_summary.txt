Collectin Kidney 1 (CL-K1) was discovered in 2006. It is a pattern-recognition molecule (PRR) of the lectin complement pathway and is mainly expressed in the kidneys. We investigated a possible functional role of CL-K1 during urinary schistosomiasis on the basis of the rationale: i). Schistosome teguments are fucosylated and CL-K1 has high binding affinity to fucose ii). As CL-K1 is structurally similar to MBL, we hypothesize the involvement of CL-K1 in immune modulation during urinary schistosomiasis. We investigated the circulating CL-K1 serum levels in our study group. We initially screened the entire promoter and the exons of the COLEC11 gene for population specific variants. We validated four promoter variants and one non-synonymous substitution in exon8 for possible associations with urinary schistosomiasis and circulating CL-K1 serum levels. The study was conducted in Nigeria where the largest number of registered cases of schistosomiasis (29 million) for any sub-Saharan African country has been documented. Our findings support the observation that CL-K1 and functional variants are host factors that may be associated with protection in schistosomiasis and may be a useful marker for further investigations.
