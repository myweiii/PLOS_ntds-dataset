Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infections in humans can cause a deadly hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rates. Most humans are infected by ticks or by contact with blood. No vaccine prophylaxis or therapeutic interventions are available. Ticks of the genus Hyalomma function as vector of CCHFV. Domestic ruminants play a crucial role in the transmission and amplification of the virus. Since infected ruminants do not develop clinical signs, CCHFV infections can in most cases only be detected by serology. There are only few assays available for the detection of CCHFV-specific antibodies in animals. In general, the real distribution of CCHFV is fairly unknown. Here we present a novel, highly sensitive and specific ELISA, and the adaptations for two commercially available assays for the detection of CCHFV-specific antibodies in cattle. With these assays, we detected CCHFV-specific antibodies in cattle in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This is the first indication of an active circulation of CCHFV in this country. This knowledge will assist decision makers and public health authorities in deciding on effective countermeasures and can help to prevent outbreaks.
