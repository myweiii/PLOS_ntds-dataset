Since the promulgation of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and the posterior creation of the WHO’s Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases five years later; encouraging progress in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these infectious diseases has been made. However, millions of people are still affected. Efforts to control NTD should come from different instances: from the high policy-decision makers to the young health-care and science professionals. Countries should consider to evaluate the quality of the medical training in order to develop and sustain efficient control programs of NTD, under the assumption that adequate education and knowledge from health-care providers are key starting points, especially in endemic areas. Having said that, universities—uniquely positioned to provide biomedical, epidemiological and clinical expertise- play an important role. Therefore, this study provides an initial approach in measuring NTD knowledge in medical students and should encourage the development of further surveys that may help to evaluate existing NTD education programs, especially because current global health problems could benefit from students’ awareness at early stages of medical training.
