Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal disease without treatment, is caused by a parasite (Leishmania) transmitted to humans through sandflies. Its epidemiology and the vectors involved in its transmission differ importantly between endemic zones. Preventive measures aim at reducing the parasite reservoirs and at limiting human exposure to sandflies. In Sudan, there is a lack of knowledge on VL risk and protective factors, limiting the possibility of development of control strategies. We conducted a study in a VL endemic area, Gedaref State (Sudan), to identify individual and household level determinants of clinical VL. We compared several characteristics of VL patients and inhabitants free of VL. We found that having a household member sick with VL in the previous year was the strongest VL risk factor. VL risk also seemed to be influenced by the household size, sleep location, evening outdoor activities, use of some repellents, and proximity to dogs at night. VL risk also appeared to decrease with a buffer distance between adjacent house yard and with the proximity to animals other than dogs at night. Our findings provide useful suggestions for guiding further intervention studies on VL preventive measures.
