Onchocerciasis is a public health problem in Nigeria, especially among the poor living in endemic communities. There is a dearth of evidence on the burden of onchocerciasis and studies suggest poor knowledge of the cause of onchocerciasis. This information could facilitate evidence-informed decisions on resource allocation towards the control of this neglected tropical disease. A cross-sectional survey was used to assess the knowledge of disease causation among patients, costs incurred for seeking treatment and productivity losses. About 43% had no knowledge of what caused their symptoms. The average monthly treatment cost per respondent was US$ 14.0. Drug cost (US$10) made up 72% of total treatment cost. The per capita productivity loss among patients was $16 and it was higher among the least poor (Q1) (US$20) and the poor SES (Q3) (US$21). The average cost of lost productivity among caregivers was US $3.5. These findings suggest that onchocerciasis still constitutes considerable economic burden on patients due to the high cost of treatment and lost productivity. This survey provided a measure of patient treatment cost in a setting with paucity of information. It also shows that targeted health education campaigns remain a fundamental policy option.
