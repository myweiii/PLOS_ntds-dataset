We are indebted to all community health workers and auxiliary nurses who, with their silent and continuous commitment to the health of their communities, made possible, among other impressive achievements, the high coverage of ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis and, as a consequence, the impact of MDA on the prevalence of strongyloidiasis.
This paper is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Juan Martin Moreira, the former Director of CECOMET-Esmeraldas, and a co-Author of this article, who died prematurely one year ago. Juan was an inspirer and coordinator of many, essential health actions in Esmeraldas Province and also nationwide. An irreplaceable friend and colleague, Juanâ€™s original and innovative thoughts, jointly with his personal, generous commitment to the health of the poorest, will be never lost.
