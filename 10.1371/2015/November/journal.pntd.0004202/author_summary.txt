Loiasis is a filarial infection of humans that, in addition to causing severe direct clinical effects, is of concern to the global communityâ€™s efforts to eliminate the important filarial diseases, onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, through causing interruption to mass drug distribution activities. Hyper-microfilariaemia has been seen to be the characteristic parameter in patients suffering from post ivermectin encephalopathy, a condition which sometimes leads to death. Understanding and developing appropriate approaches to the treatment and prevention of these severe adverse reactions has been difficult due to the lack of suitable models. As primates can be infected with human L. loa, and can develop hyper-microfilariaemia, it is likely that they therefore can serve as suitable models for the investigation of this syndrome in humans. This current study shows that following splenectomy the circulating microfilarial loads are similar to those seen in humans, and that the clinical pathology profile following infection also appears to be similar. The consistent ability to induce microfilariae levels of above 30,000 mf/ml in more than 70% of the tested animals suggests that this is indeed a practical model for investigating the adverse events occurring in hyper-loiasis.
