The serological diagnosis of dengue is severely complicated by cross-reactivity between antibodies against different flaviviruses. Currently available tests cannot rule out false positive results due to infections or vaccinations with related pathogens such as West Nile virus or Yellow Fever virus. Most cross-reactive antibodies target the conserved fusion loop (FL) domain in the E protein (the major component of the viral envelope). Therefore, we generated insect-cell derived E proteins of DENV from the four different serotypes with mutations in the FL and set up an ELISA-based platform. Using these antigens we were able to detect DENV-infections with high sensitivity. In addition, cross-reactivity with a variety of heterologous flavivirus-infections was eliminated. The results have strong indications for the development of simple and sensitive serological DENV-tests with greatly improved specificity.
