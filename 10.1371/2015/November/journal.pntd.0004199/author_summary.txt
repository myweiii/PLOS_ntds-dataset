Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) recently emerged in the Americas and caused a major epidemic of chikungunya fever (CHIKF). While not usually life threatening, CHIKF is a debilitating and often chronic illness resulting in major morbidity and economic losses. It is difficult to distinguish CHIKF from other viral illnesses that cause acute fevers including dengue fever (DF), an important consideration since DF can be life-threatening and early identification and treatment of cases is key to reducing mortality. In this study we investigated individuals presenting to a major hospital in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) with suspected DF or CHIKF, and identified signs and symptoms that distinguish these two illnesses. We also recovered complete genome sequences for CHIKV and show that the etiologic strain in T&T is a closely related descendent of the strain first isolated from the British Virgin Islands at the beginning of the outbreak in the Americas.
