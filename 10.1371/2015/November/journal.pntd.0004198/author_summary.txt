Mycobacterial pathogens that cause tuberculosis and leprosy can be detected in wild animal populations using non-invasive cheek swab samples and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays that target specific portions of mycobacterial genomes. A preliminary study in armadillos confirms that using multiple assays in tandem is optimal for surveying infection in animals, and a case study identifies some mycobacterial infection in wild marmosets from Brazil. These validated methods can be used to advance our understanding of the distribution and impact of zoonotic pathogens on wild animal populations.
