There is a growing concern about animal use for scientific purposes. In order to maximize impact of results obtained and avoid unnecessary experiment repetition, certain strategies have been implemented such as publication of guidelines to encourage detailed reporting of animal studies. We contrasted information reported in publications assessing new compounds for Chagas disease in animal models with the suggestions contained in the ARRIVE guidelines. A significant lack of compliance with the guidelines was observed even years after ARRIVE publication, including lack of minimally expected information. These results illustrate the importance of promoting inclusion of detailed information on animal use, in Chagas disease research in particular, but also in all research reporting in general.
