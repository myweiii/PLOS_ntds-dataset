Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) mainly occurs in remote rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, affects skin and soft tissue, and may lead to severe disabilities. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment with antimycobacterial therapy are essential whereby the WHO recommends laboratory confirmation of 70% of the cases. As the current diagnostic gold standard (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) is restricted to third-level laboratories, development of confirmatory point-of-care (POC) tests for BUD applicable at primary health care level has become a research priority to bring diagnosis closer to where the patients are. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been selected by the WHO as one of the promising candidate technologies for POC tests. The aim of this study was to establish and validate a LAMP assay applying lyophilized reagents which are stable at ambient temperature, thus avoiding the need for cold-chains. The results from this study suggest that the assay provides a valuable alternative to other PCR tests as currently used for laboratory confirmation of BUD.
