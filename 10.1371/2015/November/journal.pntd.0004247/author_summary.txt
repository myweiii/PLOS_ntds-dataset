Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, known as Buruli ulcer, is a disease that affects the skin and underlying tissues. The organism responsible for the infection produces a potent toxin called mycolactone that causes extensive skin damage. Easy to perform and cheaper techniques are needed for diagnostic confirmation. We have evaluated fluorescent thin layer chromatography (fTLC) for detection of mycolactone in skin samples from patients with Buruli ulcer comparing them with samples from similar non-Buruli ulcer lesions that gave a negative result in the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for M. ulcerans. Fluorescent TLC had sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity of 85.7% when compared with PCR whether the skin sample was a swab, a biopsy or a fine needle aspirate. This study shows that mycolactone can be detected reliably from M. ulcerans infected skin tissue by the simple, low cost technique of fluorescent thin layer chromatography that could be developed for point of care use. It requires further evaluation in countries where Buruli ulcer disease is endemic.
