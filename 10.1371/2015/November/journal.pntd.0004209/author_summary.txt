Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a widespread zoonosis caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus (E.granulosus). CE is a complex disease, and several aspects of its immunophatogenesis are still not clearly defined. An important question is how the parasite influences the quality of the hostâ€™s immune response. A peculiar feature of chronic CE is the coexistence of Th1 and Th2 responses, and Th1 cytokines are related to disease resistance, whereas Th2 cytokines are related to disease susceptibility and chronicity. In the last few years, polyfunctional T-cells have been intensively studied in viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases to better understand if they represent a marker of protective immunity or disease activity. In the present study it is shown that the polyfunctional T-cell subsets producing Th2 cytokines associate with the active stages of CE. These results suggest that the cells characterized by a superior functional capacity are linked to an increased biological cyst activity rather than to a protective role. These results may contribute to increase the knowledge of CE immunophatogenesis and the disease outcome in terms of control or persistence.
