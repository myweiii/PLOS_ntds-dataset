Mycobacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infect humans and animals since pre-history and are a serious health problem worldwide. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics generate information on the evolution and molecular basis of pathogenicity and transmissibility. However, while genomic information is increasingly available for the main human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, little is known about closely related bacteria, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae. These mycobacteria infect humans causing zoonotic tuberculosis and are the main causative agents of animal tuberculosis. Although human-to-human transmission of zoonotic tuberculosis is limited, the infection often causes extra-pulmonary disease in humans and is still a major public health concern in developing countries, causing not only human disease but also severe effects on livelihoods. In this study, whole-genome sequences and targeted comparative genomics of three Mycobacterium bovis and one Mycobacterium caprae field isolates generated new information on the evolution and phenotypic variation of these mycobacteria. The results identified new genetic markers and candidate vaccine antigens that warrant further study to develop tools to evaluate risks for tuberculosis caused by M. bovis/M.caprae and for disease control in humans and animals.
