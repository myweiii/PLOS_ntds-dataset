We are very grateful to our two dedicated field assistants, Annah Maragreth Magagule and Grace Tintswalo Ndhlovu, for their assistance with data collection. We would also like to thank the Animal Health Technicians of the Mpumalanga Veterinary Services, the Environmental Monitors of the Mnisi Community Programme, and the veterinary students of the University of Pretoria and Utrecht University who have rendered support for the study. Finally, we extend our deepest gratitude to the Mnisi Traditional Authority and the people of the Mnisi community for their continued support.
