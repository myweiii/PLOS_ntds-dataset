T. solium neurocysticercosis is considered the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system in humans; it is estimated to be responsible for at least one third of acquired epilepsies in developing countries. In Ecuador, the relationship between acquired epilepsy and neurocysticercosis remains unclear due to different factors such as, the lack of specialized health care personnel, appropriate diagnostic techniques and the fact that acquired epilepsy is characteristic of many other infectious and non-infectious diseases in the endemic zones of the country. In this study, spatio-temporal information and potential socio-economic indicators were studied for the number of hospitalized neurocysticercosis and epileptic cases in the country in order to locate and characterize important clusters in space and time. This study identified traditional endemic clusters in the highlands for both conditions as well as new clusters appearing in recent years in other zones not considered endemic. Also the incidence of hospitalized cases of epilepsy and neurocysticercosis were significantly higher in urban zones, probably due to a better access to health facilities. The presence of systems for excrement disposal was significantly associated with a reduction in the incident cases for both epilepsy and neurocysticercosis. More studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence of neurocysticercosis associated epilepsy in humans and cysticercosis in pigs around the country in order to better implement and manage control campaigns.
