The lack of either licensed vaccine or antiviral drug has resulted in approximately 400 million dengue infections annually. A possible rapid approach to a specific therapeutic for dengue is to use a licensed inhibitor of a host factor critically required by dengue virus (DENV) to complete its life cycle. One such set of factors is in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Despite the availability of licensed proteasome inhibitors, these studies have not led to any clinical translation, because the mechanism of action of this pathway on the virus life cycle is uncertain. We demonstrate that the UPP is critical for DENV egress after replication in human target cells. Intriguingly, treatment with the licensed proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, inhibited the overall pathological changes in wild-type mice. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the role a functional UPP plays in DENV infection and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy against dengue by repurposing a licensed drug.
