Most countries with endemic soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections have started implementing deworming programmes in recent years. However, the achievable impact on the prevalence and intensity of infections will depend on the socioeconomic and environmental context in which the programme is implemented. We use a previously developed framework that considers the epidemiology of STH transmission, capacity to deliver treatment, operational and financial feasibility, to investigate reasons for the observed within-country variation of deworming programme impact based on data from the national school based deworming programme in Kenya. The study demonstrates that programme impact varied markedly within the country and that reductions in STH infection were associated with levels of access to water, sanitation and hygiene (at schools or within communities). The described framework can help to identify areas where lower programme impact can be expected, and also to determine which additional interventions should be implemented in support of the deworming efforts.
