River blindness (onchocerciasis) is a parasitic disease transmitted by blackflies. Symptoms include severe itching, skin lesions, and vision impairment including blindness. More than 99% of all cases are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. Fortunately, vector control and community-directed treatment with ivermectin have significantly decreased morbidity, and the treatment goal is shifting from control to elimination in Africa. To inform policymakers’ and donors’ decisions, we estimated financial resources and societal opportunity costs associated with alternative treatment goals—control, elimination, and eradication. We found that rapid scale-up of ivermectin treatment for elimination and eradication would result in substantial cost-savings in the long term as compared to staying in a control mode, because regular active surveillance would allow treatments to end earlier, thereby saving the economic costs of community volunteers and donated ivermectin. To realize cost-savings, policymakers should keep empowering community volunteers, and pharmaceutical companies would need to continue drug donation. To sustain high surveillance costs required for elimination and eradication, endemic countries would need to enhance their domestic funding capacity. Societal and political will would be critical to sustaining all of these efforts.
