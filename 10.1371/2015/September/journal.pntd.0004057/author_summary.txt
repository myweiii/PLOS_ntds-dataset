Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) infect millions of children worldwide. To fight STH, large-scale de-worming programs are implemented in which anthelmintic drugs (either albendazole (ABZ) or mebendazole (MEB)) are administered. However, there is a wide range of other brands, which are even more accessible, but for which the efficacy and quality remain poorly explored. We evaluated efficacy against STHs and quality of two ABZ brands commonly available on the local markets in Ethiopia (Bendex and Ovis). Both brands showed high efficacy against roundworm infections and poor efficacy against whipworms. However, for hookworm infections, Bendex was significantly less efficacious than Ovis. In terms of drug quality, a significant difference was observed in the dissolution profile, with Bendex having a significantly slower dissolution rate than Ovis. Since dissolution behavior is critical for a drug to be appropriately absorbed into the helminth (through host-blood and/or parasite-cuticle) and produce therapeutic efficacy, the poor dissolution of Bendex compared to Ovis can explain the observed difference in efficacy against hookworms. Our results emphasize the importance of periodically assessing of drug quality to ensure appropriate therapeutic efficacy and to exclude poor drug quality as a potential factor of reduced drug efficacy other than drug resistance.
