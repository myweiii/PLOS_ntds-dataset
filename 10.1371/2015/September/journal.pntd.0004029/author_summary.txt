An adequate supply of iron is essential for both human hosts and their infecting pathogens. Hepcidin is the human hormone that controls the quantity and distribution of iron throughout the body. During infections, hepcidin activity may redistribute iron away from serum and into macrophages, potentially affecting pathogen replication, depending on the niche of the invading microbe. However, the involvement of hepcidin in human bacterial infections remains poorly investigated. Similarly, the pathogenesis of typhoid fever, caused by infection with Salmonella Typhi is also poorly understood. We therefore investigated the behaviour of hepcidin and other iron/inflammation-related parameters during the course of typhoid fever in human volunteers challenged experimentally with Salmonella Typhi. Hepcidin concentrations rose rapidly during acute typhoid infection, in parallel with fever. Hepcidin induction was accompanied by a rapid decline in serum iron concentrations, likely reflecting iron sequestration in macrophages (a preferred replication site of Salmonella Typhi). The extent of hepcidin upregulation associated with the extent of serum iron starvation. We hypothesize that hepcidin activity during acute typhoid infection in humans may elevate iron levels in the niche used by the pathogen for replication. Targeting macrophage iron retention should be evaluated as a potential strategy for limiting typhoid fever.
