We examined if and how social inequality in the United States influences seropositivity to Cryptosporidium parvum. By using nationwide data on parasite seropositivity, demographics, and household metrics of socioeconomic status provided through the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, we quantified how measures of social inequality affect the odds of parasite infection. After adjusting for the complex sampling design of NHANES and potential confounding by individual demographics and household conditions, we found household food inadequacy was associated with greater parasite seropositivity. Additionally, we found that individuals of non-white races and ethnicities and those born outside of the United States have significantly greater odds of seropositivity than white, domestic-born counterparts. Furthermore, our study suggests evidence for direct effects of family wealth on cryptosporidiosis risk, in that persons in low-income households have elevated odds of parasite seropositivity relative to those in high-income families. These results refute the claim that cryptosporidiosis in the United States in independent of poverty and social marginalization and carry implications for targeted public health interventions for this parasitic infection in resource-poor groups.
