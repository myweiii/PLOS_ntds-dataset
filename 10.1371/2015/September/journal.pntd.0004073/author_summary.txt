Physicians attending travelers with particular symptoms often neglect those infections that are transmitted by arthropods like ticks and mosquitoes (arboviruses) or donâ€™t test for the appropriate arboviruses. This is because arboviruses cause symptoms that are similar to more common infections and because there is a geographical overlap in the arbovirus infections that people have a large chance of being infected with. We compared the amount of times that Dutch physicians had patients tested for arboviral infections with the likelihood that Dutch travelers would be exposed to particular arboviruses. Whereas research and diagnostics generally focus on only one virus, our study was uniquely comprehensive and systematic in that it analyzed multiple viruses simultaneously on the basis of a unique national database. The research shows that the current viruses travelers are tested for is incomplete and likely many more people carry these kinds of diseases than are diagnosed. As these diseases pose potential public health threats, physicians should be more aware of the diseases that travelers could be infected with, and protocols are needed regarding what infectious diseases physicians should check for when patients present with particular symptoms.
