Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is characterized by a variety of clinical forms, ranging from simple skin lesions to more severe lesions with mucosal destruction. The mechanisms by which some patients develop a severe form of the disease remain unclear. It is already known that the immune statuses of the host and parasite species are key factors influencing the clinical outcome of the disease, but is not known which are the factors that influence the parasiteâ€™s tropism to the mucosal regions. Recently, a virus found infecting Leishmania, Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1), has also been reported as one important factor contributing to the disease severity. The present article reports, among 147 investigated patients from the Brazilian Western Amazon, a higher frequency of LRV1 among patients with mucosal lesions compared to patients with cutaneous lesions, statistically demonstrating that the virus is related to the worsening of the disease, increasing the risk of developing mucosal injury by almost 3 times.
