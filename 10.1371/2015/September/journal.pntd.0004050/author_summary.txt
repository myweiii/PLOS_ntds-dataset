Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which can carry to skin lesions and affect peripheral nerves, which cause physical and motor injuries on the patients. Moreover, leprosy, may be classified in two major groups, based on clinical manifestations in Paucibacillary (PB) or Multibacillary (MB), and these phenotype may be influenced by host immune response; that can be controlled by genetics factors that can be useful like future panel of biomarkers to leprosy, and itâ€™s related with the different genetic background of population studied. Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate seven INDEL polymorphisms in seven genes involved in modulation of the host immune response, and consequently can modulated o phenotype showed through the disease, to identify possible susceptibility markers of leprosy. However this analysis can be spurious on presence of population structure, common in admixture population like the Brazilian, thus we evaluate like the influence of genetic ancestry can modulated the disease risk.
