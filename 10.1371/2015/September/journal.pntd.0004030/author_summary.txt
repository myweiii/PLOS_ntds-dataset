Mycobacterium leprae is a clinical relevant pathogen that can lead to leprosy upon infection. This chronic infectious disease is characterized by the appearance of skin and peripheral nerve lesions. Normally, a healthy immune system is able to control the infection and impede the generation of lesions. However, immunosuppressive conditions may reduce the fitness of hostâ€™s immune system, with consequences of disease progression and pathogen spreading. HIV is the major cause of pathogen-associated immunodeficiency, and during the past decades, an epidemiological overlay of M. leprae and HIV infections spectra has been observed. Thus, the increase of co-infection cases raised the interest of the scientific community in this subject. Accordingly, our group has previously shown that co-infected patients presented a shift in the type of cellular immune response. Nevertheless, in the past few years a new group of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) was shown to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of effective immune responses. Here we describe for the first time the circulating ILCs subsets in leprosy, HIV and M. leprae/HIV co-infected patients. Additionally, we found that the co-infection scenario leads to a shift in different ILCs population, concordant with those observed previously for T lymphocytes and innate immunity cells.
