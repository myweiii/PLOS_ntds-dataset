Schistosomiasis (or bilharzia), a major helminth disease, affects more than 260 million people worldwide. While the adult worms survive for years within veins of the gastrointestinal system, symptoms are due to inflammatory reactions to their eggs in several organs. Hepatic fibrosis may develop in chronic cases of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and lead to portal hypertension with potentially lethal complications. In this study, we aimed at establishing a non-invasive quantitative and readily available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to monitor in vivo the development of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension in Schistosoma mansoni infected mice. We evaluated the transverse relaxation time T2, an easily measurable MRI parameter, as an early and quantitative imaging biomarker for hepatic fibrogenesis and validated it with histological techniques for fibrosis detection and quantification. In addition, we confirmed that this mouse model of schistosomiasis replicates the human pathology closely. The quantitative imaging biomarkers validated in this study will aid in the preclinical and clinical evaluation of new therapeutic strategies against hepatic fibrogenesis.
