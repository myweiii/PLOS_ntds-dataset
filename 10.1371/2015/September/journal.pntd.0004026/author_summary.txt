Due to pandemic drug resistance in the treatment of parasitic infections, there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets and their associated drug compounds. Although “drug repurposing”, i.e. the application of known drugs and compounds to new indications such as infectious diseases, provides a cost effective approach in the development of novel therapeutics, selectivity is one of the major obstacles to overcome in getting such compounds into clinical trials as anti-parasitic drugs. Using the lysine deacetylases (KDACs) as an example, we explored the activities of a panel of known inhibitors against the KDAC targets in a range of parasitic organisms. The computational study of their binding modes to the targets (by docking the compounds to the homology models within different organisms in comparison with the human proteins) helps to rationalize the different activities observed and provide insight on the optimization of lead compounds to improve selectivity. Our work provides support of “drug repurposing” in the treatment of parasitic diseases, and demonstrates the necessity of optimizing these leads for the ultimate goal of preparing them for clinical use.
