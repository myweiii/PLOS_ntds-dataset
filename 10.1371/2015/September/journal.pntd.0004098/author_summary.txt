In acute infectious diarrhea, the active secretion of Cl- ions contributes to the secondary loss of Na+ and water from the intestine. Apical Cl- secretion from intestinal epithelial cells is dependent upon cyclic nucleotide- and Ca2+-dependent intracellular signals and requires the concomitant transport of K+ through basolateral K+ channels for maintenance of an electroneutral state. Hence, when efflux of K+ in enterocytes is blocked, Cl- secretion necessarily shuts down. The FDA-approved antifungal drug clotrimazole has been demonstrated to be a potent blocker of basolateral cAMP- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels in enterocytes, and therefore likely has therapeutic efficacy for secretory diarrheas. One important concern that could compromise its clinical applicability as a novel anti-diarrheal drug, however, is that clotrimazole might affect intestinal Na+-coupled glucose absorption, which constitutes the physiological basis of oral rehydration therapies and is thus critical for the efficacy of the current golden standard treatment for acute infectious diarrheal diseases. In this work, we demonstrate that clotrimazole effectively blocks Cl- secretion in mouse intestine after stimulation with secretory stimuli, without affecting the capacity to take up Na+ and glucose. These results pave the way towards further clinical development of clotrimazole as a new pharmacologic strategy for acute diarrheal disease.
