The price of vaccine and the costs of its delivery are two important economic measures considered by governments and various international organizations in their decisions on the use of a new vaccine. However, the costs to the vaccine recipients resulting from their travel, time and wage loss are hardly considered and rarely documented. Even if the vaccine is provided for free, the costs borne by vaccine recipients could be sufficient enough to be a hurdle for taking vaccine. We elucidate this less explored angle of “vaccine recipient cost” in the context of oral cholera vaccine mass campaign in Odisha, India. Our research shows that the potential loss of income for individuals for receiving oral cholera vaccine ranged from 25% to 38% of overall vaccine delivery costs. We believe our findings have global implications on future decisions and policy making on vaccine introduction in balancing programmatic delivery costs with private household costs to receive vaccines.
