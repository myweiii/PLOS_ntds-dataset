Leishmaniasis results from an infection by Leishmania parasites that are transmitted through the bites of infected sand flies. This disease affects millions of people worldwide. Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is widespread in Central Tunisia and constitutes an actual public health problem. Leishmania major, the etiological agent, is transmitted by the sand fly vector Phlebotomus papatasi. Saliva of sand flies contains several pharmacologically active components that play a key role in the acquisition of the blood meal and the establishment of the parasites, thus enhancing the infection. Some of these molecules are able to elicit the production of specific antibodies, which can be used as markers of exposure to the vectorâ€™s bite. Herein, using a large cohort of individuals, we have validated the use of P. papatasi recombinant salivary protein PpSP32 (rPpSP32) as an alternative method to standard entomological studies for testing exposure to the bite of this sand fly in humans. rPpSP32 represents a promising epidemiological tool to monitor the spatial distribution of P. papatasi, direct control measures against zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, evaluate the efficiency of vector control interventions and potentially assess the risk of contracting the disease.
