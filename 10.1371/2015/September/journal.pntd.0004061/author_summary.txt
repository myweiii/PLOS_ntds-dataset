Madurella mycetomatis mycetoma is a chronic fungal infection, resulting frequently in mutilating lesions. The causative agents are found in soil, however, many people are exposed but most do not develop mycetoma. Characteristic for mycetoma is that the fungus organizes itself in a grain once inside the body. Here we showed that this grain contains chitin. The immune system of the host will try to eliminate the grains by producing cytokines and enzymes, including the chitin-degrading chitinases. We showed that both human chitinases AMCase and chitotriosidase bind to fungal chitin in the grain. We also investigated 4 polymorphisms in the genes for these chitinases, and we found that a polymorphism in the gene for chitotriosidase, resulting in enzyme inactivity, was associated with increased risk for mycetoma. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that chitotriosidase is important in the pathogen-eliminating immune response, resulting in clearance of the infection. We assumed that absence of chitotriosidase results in increased AMCase production and thus in grain formation. In this study we identified a risk factor for the development of M. mycetomatis mycetoma, however the disease is multifactorial and other factors also play a role.
