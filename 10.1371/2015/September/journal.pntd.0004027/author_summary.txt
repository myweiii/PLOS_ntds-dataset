In children, malaria is a predisposing factor for invasive bacterial infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars, a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Since development of vaccines against NTS has been proposed as a strategy to protect African children against disseminated NTS infection, we interrogated the effect of malaria on vaccine-induced memory responses to NTS. Our results from a mouse infection model show that infection with malaria parasites temporarily suspends protective immunity conferred by a live, attenuated vaccine and suppresses adaptive immune responses to NTS that are mediated by T cells. These results suggest that in the setting of acute malaria, live attenuated NTS vaccines may lose their effectiveness.
