Dengue viruses cause debilitating and potentially life-threatening acute disease throughout the tropical world. While drug development efforts are underway, there are concerns that drug-resistant strains will emerge rapidly. Indeed, many antiviral drugs for other RNA viruses lose efficacy over time as the virus mutates. Here, we sought to determine if there are regions in the dengue virus genome that are constrained in their ability to mutate and could therefore serve as better targets for antiviral drugs. Deep sequencing of the dengue virus 1 genome directly from the blood of twelve dengue patients and from mosquitoes given this blood showed consistent and distinct mutation patterns during infection. Importantly, we identified regions within the viral genome that are resistant to mutation during human and mosquito infection. Collectively, these findings provide fresh insights into potential antiviral targets and could serve as an approach to defining better regions for therapeutic targeting in other RNA viruses.
