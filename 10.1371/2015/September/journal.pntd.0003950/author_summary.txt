Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis and is a rare but life-threatening disease. Albendazole is the most frequently used anti-parasitic drugs in patients infected with AE. However, ABZ has only limited water solubility, and small differences in drug solubility may have a major influence on their absorption and resultant pharmacokinetic behavior. Chitosan microspheres as a new carrier increased ABZ absorption and bioavailability. The anti-parasitic efficacy of albendazole–chitosan microspheres (ABZ-CS-MPs) in mice infected with Echinococcus multilocularis was assessed. ABZ-loaded CS-MPs exhibited improved absorption and increased bioavailability in the treatment of E. multilocularis infections in mice compared with those treated with liposome–albendazole and albendazole tablet. ABZ-CS-MPs are in solid form that can be manufactured in capsules or tablets, which can be easily delivered to those in need, particularly those who are nomadic. Therefore, given the merits of low cost, portability, and simple manufacturing, ABZ-CS-MPs are a promising drug to treat alveolar echinococcosis.
