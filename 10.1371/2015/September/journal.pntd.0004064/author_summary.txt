Since 1937, the vaccine against yellow fever has been produced in chicken embryos without any critical modification. Despite this highly available and effective vaccine, yellow fever remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions of Africa and South America, mainly by maintaining the sylvatic cycle (in which mosquitoes transmit the virus from non-human primates to people who visit or work in the jungle). To our knowledge, the present study offers the first clear elucidation of cells and tissues associated with the biosynthesis of the17DD yellow fever virus in chicken embryos. We detected that the virus causes only mild lesions in the embryos, but affects different cells and tissues, including muscles, cells in the heart muscles and in the nervous system, certain tissues in the kidneys and lungs, and collagen-producing cells that exist in connective tissues in the cartilage and skin. Identifying these cells may help scientists develop a cell-culture-based vaccine with lower chick protein content. This understanding is important because recent data indicate that the YF virus 17DD may serve as a platform to produce other new recombinant vaccines.
