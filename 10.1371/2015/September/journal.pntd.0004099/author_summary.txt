Chagas' disease affects millions of people worldwide and is caused by a microorganism called Trypanosoma cruzi. Treatment options for patients with Chagas' disease is still limited to a small number of drugs, all of them very toxic with important side effects that can be debilitating for the health of patients. Understanding the molecular details of how T. cruzi infects humans is an important step toward the development of new drugs for this disease. As part of its life cycle, T. cruzi has to invade cells in order to replicate and produce new parasites. This is a complex event, which involves different proteins produced by both the parasite and the human host cells. Among them, there is a large family of highly polymorphic T. cruzi proteins important to guide the parasite to the target cells. Here we show that notwithstanding their differences, all members of this family share a small region comprised of nine amino acids that is important for cell recognition and infection by the parasite. Exploring these findings may provide researchers with new insights on how to prevent T. cruzi cell invasion and lead to novel therapeutic alternative for this debilitating disease.
