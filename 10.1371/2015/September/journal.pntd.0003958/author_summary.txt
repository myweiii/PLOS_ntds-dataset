Among the flavivirus family, dengue virus (DENV) represents the most important public health issue, affecting a large area of the world. The incidence rate of DENV infections is increasing every year. In lieu of the uncontrolled mosquito vector and the lack of specific treatments for DENV disease, an effective dengue vaccine is required. Several dengue vaccines have been developed but none of them are licensed yet. Here, we reported a novel dengue nanovaccine (DNV), composed of UV-inactivated DENV (UVI-DENV) immunogen loaded on BCG adjuvanted chitosan nanoparticle (BCG-CS-NPs). DNV particles were of spherical shape with a diameter of 372 nm and cationic surface properties. The immunogenic properties of DNV have been demonstrated. BCG-CS-NPs could improve the uptake of UVI-DENV by THP1 cells. DNV could also stimulate iDCs maturation, an important step in antigen processing and presentation to T cells and up-regulation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression. In addition, the DNV was capable of increasing the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines in iDCs. These immunogenic properties point to the potential use of DNV as an effective dengue vaccine.
