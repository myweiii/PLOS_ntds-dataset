Chikungunya fever is a reemerging, mosquito-borne viral disease that causes severe, debilitating, and often chronic arthralgia. The virus reemerged from Africa in 2004 and has since caused disease in millions of persons, including in over one million in the Americas since it arrived for the first time in modern scientific history in late 2013. An effective vaccine is critically needed to protect against this medically and economically devastating disease as well as to interrupt the human-mosquito transmission cycle. To further test a new, live-attenuated vaccine candidate for chikungunya fever, we conducted extensive preclinical safety evaluations using another vaccine candidate tested in humans, 181/clone 25, as a benchmark. The new vaccine candidate, CHIKV/IRES, replicated to lower levels in a mouse model and generated lesser signs of disease. Furthermore, it was more stably attenuated following mouse passages. These results support the further development of the new CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidate toward clinical testing in humans.
