Snakebite envenoming (SBE) is a major problem in rural West Africa (WA). However, despite the high incidence of SBE in this region, government funding for the prevention or treatment of SBE is generally limited. In this analysis, we attempted to estimate how the public health burden of SBE compares to other more widely recognized Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD). To this end, we estimated the impact of SBE mortality and morbidity based on the methodology outlined in the global burden of disease and reported our results in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for 16 countries in WA. We calculated the total burden of SBE in WA at 320,000 DALYs (95% CI: 248,000â€“403,000 DALYs) per year with the least and highest burdens in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria accounting for 0.5% and 43%, respectively. The vast majority of the public health burden (91%) is attributed to early mortality. We conclude that the public health burden of SBE in WA is substantial and similar to, and in some cases even exceeds, other more widely recognized NTDs such as Buruli ulcer, Echinococcosis, Intestinal Nematode Infections, Leishmaniasis, Onchocerchiasis, Trachoma and Trypanosomiasis. Efforts and funding commensurate with its public health burden should be made available for the control of snakebite.
