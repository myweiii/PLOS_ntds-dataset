Sporotrichosis is a neglected tropical fungal disease. The subcutaneous form occurs following traumatic inoculation of organic matter contaminated with the fungus through the skin. Between 1938 and 1947, the Witwatersrand gold mines in South Africa were the site of the largest outbreak of sporotrichosis worldwide. Contamination of untreated timber by the fungus was thought to be associated with the outbreak though this epidemiologic link was never made definitively. For the first time in this setting, we conducted a detailed outbreak investigation to identify factors associated with sporotrichosis. The investigation identified 17 cases of sporotrichosis at a reopened South African gold mine. Approximately one in five miners had probable or confirmed sporotrichosis. Although genetically distinct species were isolated from clinical and environmental sources, it is highly likely that the source was contaminated soil and untreated wood underground. No cases occurred following recommendations to close sections of the mine, treat timber and encourage consistent use of personal protective equipment. The investigation uncovered a re-emerging disease in mines where traditional, rather than heavily mechanized, ore extraction techniques are used. Surveillance should be instituted at sentinel mining locations.
