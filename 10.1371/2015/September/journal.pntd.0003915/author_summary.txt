Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections with A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and hookworms are endemic in all 80 provinces of the Philippines, but the spatial variation in the prevalence of these infections has not been previously described. This analysis revealed that while A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections were widespread and highly endemic, hookworm infections were more circumscribed to smaller foci in the Visayas and Mindanao. The results also suggest that it may be necessary to place greater emphasis on improving the provision of water, sanitation and the promotion of behavioral change for improved hygiene for the control and prevention of STH infections, particularly for hookworm.
