Fishing communities in East Africa have a very high prevalence of HIV, and also high rates of other endemic infections such as malaria and the fluke Schistosoma mansoni. Genital infections are known to increase HIV susceptibility through the recruitment and activation of mucosal CD4 T cells to the site of HIV sexual exposure. These activated CD4 T cells are necessary for an effective host immune response but are also preferentially infected by HIV. We hypothesized that S. mansoni infection in the gut mucosa might increase recruitment and activation of HIV target cells at other mucosal sites, and thereby contribute to high HIV rates in fishing communities. We enrolled men from a fishing community in Uganda and examined the frequency of highly HIV-susceptible cell types in their blood and foreskin tissue (a main site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men). We found that men with S. mansoni infection had a greater frequency of HIV target cells in their blood, but not their foreskin tissue, perhaps because foreskin cells did not express mucosal homing markers. It is possible that HIV target cells observed in the blood of S. mansoni-infected individuals may traffic to other mucosae, such as the vagina or gut, and so the possibility that S. mansoni infection increases risk at these sites should be explored.
