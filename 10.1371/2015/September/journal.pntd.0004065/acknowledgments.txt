We wish to thank the patients at each centre and the staff who volunteered the time to collect the data. The ENLIST Group was formed in 2012 following a meeting of physicians and scientists working in leprosy[13] and we would like to acknowledge those who have been involved with the ENLIST project.
The membership of the ENLIST Group also includes: Medhi Alinda, C. Ruth Butlin, David Khan, Yulianto Listiawan. Pitchaimani.
The organisations which operate the leprosy clinics where the data were collected provided facilities for free and allowed their staff to undertake the work.
