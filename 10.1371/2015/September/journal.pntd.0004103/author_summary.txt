Chagas disease is a neglected disease which, when left untreated, leads to severe cardiac and or digestive problems in 40% of the affected individuals. Globally, less than 1% of affected people have access to care. While mainly documented in Latin America, Chagas disease is not limited to this region due to population movements; however, awareness and provision of care are poor globally. Because of the relatively high levels of Chagas disease reported in Italy and the lack of information on programmatic management of the disease outside of Latin America, we aimed to analyse the outcome of an integrated program of health education, free universal screening, and free access to care, managed in collaboration between the NGOs MÃ©decins Sans Frontieres and OIKOS, and the Centre of Tropical Diseases of Negrar Hospital in Verona province, with the active participation and empowerment of the local communities. Our results show that the prevalence of Chagas disease among people of Latin American origin in Bergamo province was high and that, despite an increased access to diagnosis and treatment in the program, many people did not complete the full course of treatment. More efforts should be done by the Italian authorities to facilitate access to care.
