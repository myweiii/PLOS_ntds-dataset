Dengue fever transmission in Western Australia ceased in the 1940s and there are currently no known dengue vector species present. Despite this, a locally acquired of dengue fever was reported in 2013 with the most likely location of exposure the township of Point Samson in Pilbara region in the north-west of the State. A comprehensive follow-up investigation was undertaken and while the dengue case was confirmed, no other cases were identified and not exotic dengue vector mosquitoes were detected around the location of exposure. The exact mechanism for the locally acquired infection could not be determined but the most likely explanation is that a dengue infected mosquito was transported into the region, fed on the patient, but did not survive to lay eggs and establish a local breeding population. This case highlights the potential risk of the re-emergence of dengue fever in regions of Australia outside where ongoing transmission is currently limited to in northern Queensland, particularly given the large number of imported dengue cases that occur among travellers returning from dengue endemic regions.
