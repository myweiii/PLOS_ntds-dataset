Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is an infectious disease caused by the worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted between humans through the bites of blackflies and causes deforming skin disease, itch, and vision loss. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) aims to control morbidity due to onchocerciasis by implementing mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin in endemic areas, targeting the whole population except for children under five and pregnant women. Aside from its effect on onchocerciasis, ivermectin also affects other parasitic infections such as lymphatic filariasis, intestinal worm infections, and scabies, which are all significantly co-endemic in areas covered by APOC. In this paper, the researchers roughly estimate the health impact of ivermectin MDA on off-target infections based on the number of dispensed treatments up to 2010, published estimates of the disease burden of off-target infections, and the expected effect of ivermectin treatment on the burden of these infections (based on literature review). This off-target health impact of APOC constitutes about 500 thousand years worth of healthy years of life (an additional 5.5% on top of the impact of APOC on the burden of onchocerciasis) and indicates that the cost-effectiveness of APOC is even higher than previously estimated.
