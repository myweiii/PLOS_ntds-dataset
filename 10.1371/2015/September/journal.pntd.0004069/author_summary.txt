Lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic nematodes that invade and occupy the host lymphatic system. The extent of lymphatic filariasis is staggering, with over 120 million people infected in 73 endemic countries and an estimated 40 million people suffering from a range of disfiguring and debilitating clinical manifestations of this disease. The mechanisms by which these medically important parasites navigate the host immune response to establish infection are not yet fully understood. In this study, we identify exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) that are abundantly released from infective stage L3 Brugia malayi, an etiological agent of human lymphatic filariasis. We show that these vesicles have a narrow size distribution and morphology consistent with classical exosomes, and that they contain common exosomal protein markers, putative effector proteins, as well as small regulatory RNAs. We show that ELVs are enriched with microRNAs that are perfectly conserved between parasite and host, suggesting a potentially novel mechanism by which filarial worms can actively manipulate host gene expression. We demonstrate that parasite ELVs are internalized by macrophages and elicit a classically activated phenotype in these host cells. The discovery of exosome-like vesicle release by human nematode parasites newly enlightens the roadmap to understanding the pathology of LF and related helminthiases. These vesicles also present promising new targets for intervention and diagnostics.
