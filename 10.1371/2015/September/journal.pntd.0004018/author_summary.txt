Leishmaniasis is a critical public health problem worldwide. The clinical outcome of leishmaniasis depends on the infecting parasite species, host genetics and immune response and insect species. Leishmania braziliensis is a major etiological agent of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in Brazil. Fewer than 10% of L. braziliensis-infected patients with CL develop the mucosal form (a severe clinical manifestation). The small number of parasites in the mucosae increases the difficulty of obtaining clinical isolates, and parasite samples are frequently derived from individuals with different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, clinical isolates from cutaneous and mucosal sites from the same patient represent unique tools to understand parasite factors that contribute to disease outcome and pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated parasite factors involved in disease progression using two pairs of L. (V.) braziliensis isolates from mucosal (LbrM) and cutaneous (LbrC) sites of the same patient. In conclusion, the murine infection and proteome and metabolome data suggest that the differences between the cutaneous and mucosal isolates are mainly related to inflammation and chemotaxis. Our data also suggest that the LbrPGF2S protein plays a role in parasite virulence in the mammalian host.
