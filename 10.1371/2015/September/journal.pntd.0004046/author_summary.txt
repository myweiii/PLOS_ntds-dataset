Buruli ulcer, caused by subcutaneous infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a highly disfiguring flesh-eating skin disease with significant morbidity. Besides surgical intervention, 8-week combination antibiotics is the standard of care. However, problems with resistance and toxicity warrant their replacement with efficacious vaccines. Several attempts to generate a vaccine have met with limited success and, to date, BCG remains the only vaccine capable of conferring transient protection. Here we demonstrate that a recombinant BCG-based vaccine expressing the immunodominant M. ulcerans Ag85A is capable of significantly enhancing protection in experimental Buruli ulcer compared to standard BCG, with a decrease in bacterial burden, pathology, and increase in survival. These results support further Buruli ulcer vaccine development using the highly safe and well-established BCG vehicle.
