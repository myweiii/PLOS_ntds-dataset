The rapid spread of dengue in the last decade has brought this disease higher in the public health agenda worldwide. Dengue is transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes and typically presents with sudden fever and flu-like symptoms. In a proportion of cases, severe disease can ensue which if not promptly treated can be lethal. In Venezuela, the frequency of dengue epidemics and severe disease is on the increase. Delay in care-seeking has been related to the development of serious disease complications. In this study, we describe the health-related behaviour intentions people have when they face a dengue infection, to find ways to promote prompt medical care attendance. Few studies of this kind exist in the Americas. We found that in case of fever alone, people would mostly prefer to first treat the disease at home while in the case of suspected dengue they would choose to promptly visit a doctor. These intentions are encouraging. However, since people often do not realize they have dengue, they may not perform their planned behaviour. Moreover, we found several factors that made people choose to visit promptly a doctor: being an adult (as opposed to caring for a child as a parent/guardian), place of residence, feeling at risk and not having had a previous dengue infection. Therefore, we suggest that raising risk perception and the knowledge on dengue symptoms and transmission route could improve earlier health centre attendance lowering the risk of clinical complications leading to severe dengue and death.
