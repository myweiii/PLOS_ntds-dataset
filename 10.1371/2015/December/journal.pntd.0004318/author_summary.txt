Schistosomes infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, with devastating effects on human health and economic development. One of the major challenges in treatment and control of these diseases is the accurate diagnosis of infection and monitoring of transmission dynamics. Current parasitological and serological diagnostic tests often lack sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability; more sensitive and specific molecular methods require infrastructure typically unavailable in resource-limited settings. Here, we have detected cell-free parasitic helminth DNA in serum and plasma from schistosome-infected mice using LAMP, an isothermal amplification technique, in a simple, hand-held, custom-made, field-ready microfluidic device we have developed. Schistosome DNA is detectable as early as one week following infection, long before the worms have matured and begun producing eggs. The device is small, entirely self-contained and disposable, and is readily adaptable to rapid and simple point-of-contact (POC) detection of infection. The entire process from sample collection to diagnosis can be carried out on-site, without any laboratory equipment.
