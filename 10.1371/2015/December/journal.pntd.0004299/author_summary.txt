The mode of action of a new class of boron-containing chemicals (the oxaboroles), currently under development for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis, is unknown. Here we identify a number of potential candidate proteins that could be involved either in the mode of action of these compounds or in the mechanism of resistance. This information could prove critical in protecting the compounds against resistance emerging in the field as well as opening up new avenues for drug discovery.
