Buruli Ulcer (BU) is a devastating skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. BU usually starts off as a non-ulcerative lesion, but if lesions are left untreated they can evolve into ulcers or may even affect the bone. Nevertheless, spontaneous healing of active lesions has been reported in some patients, although little is known about this process. In this study, the authors performed a time-lapsed study on a resistant animal model of M. ulcerans infectionâ€“the guinea pig. Subcutaneous infection of the guinea pig led to the development of ulcerative lesions that eventually healed over the course of infection and, interestingly, this healing was associated with a decrease in M. ulcerans viability and with an ongoing reparative process of the infected tissue. Given that similar observations have been made in BU patients that spontaneously resolved M. ulcerans infection, the guinea pig model has the potential to disclose the protective immune mechanisms underlying resistance to BU.
