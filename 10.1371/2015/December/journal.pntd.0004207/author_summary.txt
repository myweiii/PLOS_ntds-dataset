The cystic larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium may affect the human brain causing neurocysticercosis (NCC), a very frequent cause of neurological symptoms in developing countries. The clinical expression and response to treatment of human NCC are related to the location of cysticerci inside (intraparenchymal) or outside the brain parenchyma (extraparenchymal NCC). We used a naturally infected pig model to assess the characteristics of inflammation around brain cysticerci of parenchymal, meningeal and mixed locations. There were no major differences in inflammation without treatment. After antiparasitic treatment with praziquantel, inflammation around parenchymal brain cysticerci increased in comparison to meningeal located cysticerci. Cysticerci partially surrounded by both brain parenchyma and meninges showed increased inflammation in relation to the extent of the cysticercus in the brain parenchyma. The location of cysticerci within the brain is a factor that determines the extent and degree of the immune response following anticysticidal treatment. Similar changes may occur in treated human infections. Our work could contribute to explain the differences in response to antiparasitic treatment in different forms of human neurocysticercosis.
