Schistosomes, infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, causing schistosomiasis, a disease with devastating effects on human health and economic development. Despite the prevalence of this disease, there is only a single drug, praziquantel, available for treatment and control. Praziquantel is effective, but has limitations, and reports of drug resistance lend increased urgency to development of new treatments. Ion channels are critical components of animal neuromuscular systems, and have proven to be excellent targets for drugs against parasitic worm infections. TRP ion channels, which play important roles in sensory functions, have received little attention in parasitic helminths. One class of TRP channels, TRPV, is activated by capsaicin. However, schistosomes do not appear to contain any TRPV channels. Nonetheless, we find that they are highly sensitive to capsaicin and similar compounds, responding by dramatically increasing their motor activity. Unexpectedly, suppressing expression of a different schistosome TRP channel, TRPA1, which in mammals is not sensitive to capsaicin, almost completely eliminates this response. Thus, it appears that the pharmacology of schistosome TRP channels differs from that of host mammalian channels, a characteristic that might be exploitable for development of new antischistosomal drugs.
