Typhoid fever, a serious bloodstream infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, is commonly associated with direct, person-to-person transmission as a result of improper hygiene and unsafe food/water handling practices. Recent evidence, however, suggests that individuals may be indirectly exposed to typhoid through contact with fecal contamination in their immediate environment. In this study we investigated the role of environmental sources in the transmission of typhoid fever across an urban slum in Kenya by mapping the occurrence of cases in both children and adults. We tested the hypothesis that cases (relative to non-cases) cluster in low elevation areas as a result of the downstream flow and accumulation of fecal waste. We found that cases of typhoid fever among children tended to be concentrated in the downstream area. In adolescents and adults, on the other hand, there was little evidence of a geographic pattern in the risk of typhoid fever. These results provide evidence that environmental transmission of typhoid fever contributes to the risk of disease in children but not adults and adolescents, an observation most likely attributed to the fact that children are more likely to be exposed to fecal contamination through outside play. Interventions to improve local sanitation may therefore provide particular benefit to children who are at most risk of exposure to and acquisition of typhoid fever from environmental sources.
