Leprosy is an infectious disease that affects the peripheral nerves, leading to nerve thickening, asymmetry and dysfunction; therefore, early detection of leprosy neuropathy is important for preventing deformities and disabilities. We examined peripheral nerve involvement using ultrasonography (US) in 96 leprosy patients prior to treatment, aiming to better understand differences in neuropathy patterns between leprosy classification groups and between patients with and without leprosy reactions. Patients underwent bilateral US of the ulnar (at the cubital tunnel and proximal to the tunnel), median and common fibular nerves to measure thickening and asymmetry. We found that nerve thickening was more severe in patients with a high bacillary load (multibacillary) and in those with previous reactions. Nerve asymmetry measurements were greater in the patients with previous reactions. Asymmetry did not differ significantly between the paucibacillary and multibacillary patients, demonstrating that asymmetry is a characteristic of leprosy neuropathy regardless of its classification.
