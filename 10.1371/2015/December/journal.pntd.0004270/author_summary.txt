Surgical management of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) is recommended by the WHO as a cost-effective strategy to mitigate blinding trachoma. However, a large surgical backlog exists and many individuals suffering with TT remain unknown to the health system. To identify TT cases, we designed a standard set of screening questions, a card, and simple training for Community Treatment Assistants (CTAs) to identify trichiasis during community-wide Mass Drug Administrations (MDA). To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of this approach, we conducted a community randomized trial in 36 communities in trachoma-endemic Kongwa District, Tanzania. Additional training and the use of a TT screening card increased the sensitivity of TT identification and resulted in more cases identified compared to the usual training of CTAs. The positive predictive value was low, indicating a need for further verification of TT cases identified by the enhanced screening. MDA appears to be a good opportunity for TT screening by CTAs, but further training to improve screening sensitivity is suggested.
