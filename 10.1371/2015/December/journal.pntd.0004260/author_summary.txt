Despite recognition that resource constraints contributed to the difficulty in controlling West Africa’s ongoing Ebola outbreak, no previous study has been conducted to quantify the impact of poverty on transmission. In particular, the extent to which within country heterogeneity in socioeconomic status (SES) could be driving geographic spread or sustaining Ebola hotspots has important implications for control policies. In Liberia’s capital city Monrovia, approximately 68% of the population occupies slum neighborhoods characterized by overcrowding and lacking sanitation—conditions conducive to outbreaks of infectious disease. The researchers find that infected individuals residing in these most impoverished settings are associated with three times more Ebola transmission, as well as greater dissemination of disease between communities of different socioeconomic levels. Cases from low and middle SES areas reported significantly more contacts during their symptomatic and therefore infectious periods than cases from high SES areas. Overcrowding and lack of education on how the disease is transmitted could explain the observed differences in number of secondary cases. The findings support the need for targeted response measures that account for differential risk arising from socioeconomic heterogeneity within West African countries.
