The IA, IH, and SMIH immucillins are known to impair the replication of promastigotes of L. (L.) infantum chagasi and L. (L.) amazonensis imucillins in vitro and impair the replication of intracellular amastigotes of L. (L.) infantum chagasi in vitro with no toxicity for macrophages. IA and IH also inhibit the enzymatic activity of Leishmania (L.) donovani nucleoside hydrolase (NH36) one of the purine salvage enzymes in these purine auxotrophs. In this work, we compared the efficacies of IA, IH and SMIH to the standard drug Glucantime in the therapy of L. (L.) infantum chagasi infection of mice and hamsters. IA and IH, at low concentrations, cured mice and hamsters from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Unlike treatment with Glucantime, immucillin therapy showed no toxicity. We demonstrate that treatment of IA and IH also affects the induction of the immune system, a factor that might also contribute to VL therapy. This study shows significant promise in the development of safer drugs for leishmaniasis therapy.
