India represents ~50% of the global population estimated to be at risk of dengue. Severe dengue, which is potentially fatal, correlates with very high virus load, reduction in platelet counts and haemorrhage. Antiviral therapy to reduce high virus load may be beneficial in attenuating disease severity. We have explored Indian traditional medicine, Ayurveda, to identify plants that could be a source of dengue inhibitory activity. We show that an alcoholic extract prepared from Cissampelos pareira Linn inhibited the replication of dengue viruses in living cells in culture and protected mice against dengue infection. It also showed antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Importantly, this extract did not show any toxic effects in rats and did not affect platelets and red blood cells. This observation is critical as dengue fever is commonly treated with antipyretics. In a dengue-endemic resource-poor country as India, the C. pareira plant may serve as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation against dengue.
