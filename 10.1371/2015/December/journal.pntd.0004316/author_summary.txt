Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, is an important pathogen as it is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in developing countries. The parasite was eliminated from most developed countries decades ago due to improvement in sanitary conditions but it remains a common infection across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Identification of genetic variants within T. solium will enable to study the genetic epidemiology, distribution and movement of this parasite within endemic communities, which will ultimately facilitate the design of control strategies to reduce the health and economic burden of disease.
Microsatellites have been used in other parasites to identify genetic variants. In this study, we partially sequenced the genome of T. solium and identified microsatellites widely distributed in the genome using bioinformatics tools. We evaluated the distribution of these microsatellites collected from 20 tapeworms from the north and 20 tapeworms from the south of Peru. We identified seven polymorphic microsatellites, and evaluated their capacity to differentiate genetic variants of T. solium. Interestingly, tapeworms from the North and South of Peru showed different genotypes, suggesting its use as a potential marker to differentiate geographic origin.
