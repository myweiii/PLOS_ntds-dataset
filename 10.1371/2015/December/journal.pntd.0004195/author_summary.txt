Plasmodium malariae is a relatively rare, but widely distributed, cause of malaria. It can persist in the human host for years, often without causing significant symptoms. As a result, P. malariae will be a very difficult species to eradicate. Our study used data from a routine hospital-based surveillance system in southern Papua, Indonesia to describe the clinical epidemiology of P. malariae infections. Over a 10-year period there were 5,097 patient presentations to Mitra Masyarakat Hospital associated with P. malariae infection constituting 2.6% of all malaria cases. Patients with P. malariae malaria had a significantly older age distribution than those with P. vivax infections. They also had lower mean hemoglobin concentrations than patients infected with P. falciparum, P. vivax or mixed Plasmodium species. We speculate that this may be due to chronic hemolysis of parasitized and non-parasitized red cells as a result of persistent infection. One in 200 children under the age of 5 years with P. malariae infection were recorded as having nephrotic syndrome, a well-known but to date unquantified complication. Overall, 0.3% of patients with P. malariae malaria died. These findings emphasize the need to consider this parasite when designing comprehensive malaria elimination strategies.
