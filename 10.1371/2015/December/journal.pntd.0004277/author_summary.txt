Dengue is an emerging mosquito-borne disease present in an extensive area of the globe with an estimated risk exposure of half of the worldâ€™s population. Unfortunately, no specific treatment or vaccine is available to control this disease, which leads to approximately 20,000 casualties annually. The protective immune response against this pathogen consists of an important goal for the development of anti-dengue strategies. For years, the presence of neutralizing antibodies was believed to represent the major response for protection against dengue. However, a recent clinical trial showed that despite the induction of a balanced antibody response against all serotypes, vaccination had only a partial efficacy. In the present work, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of the cellular and humoral responses elicited by a DNA vaccine candidate encoding the non-structural 1 protein (NS1) from dengue virus. We observed that antibody as well as T cell responses are important for protection against dengue in a cooperative way. Our results demonstrated that an effective defense against virus was not achieved with antibodies or T cells alone, but rather with the combination of both responses. Therefore, we suggest that an ideal vaccine against dengue should induce both arms of the immune system.
