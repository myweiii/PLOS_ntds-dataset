Leishmania killicki (syn. L. tropica) was discovered in 1986. Few studies have been conducted on this parasite exclusively described in Maghreb. Consequently, many elements on its epidemiology, transmission, population structure and dynamics remain unknown.
To better understand the evolution of this parasite, its population structure has been compared with that of L. tropica populations from Morocco using Multilocus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE) and MultiLocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) typing. MLMT data support the hypothesis that L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) belongs to the L. tropica complex despite the strong genetic differentiation between them. Despite the probable recent divergence between L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) and L. tropica, they seem to evolve differently. Indeed, L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) appears slightly polymorphic and highly structured in space and time, while L. tropica was genetically heterogeneous, slightly structured geographically and temporally. The different population structures revealed distinct genetic organizations, reflecting different epidemiological cycles. Several parameters could explain these opposite epidemiological and genetic patterns such as ecosystems, vectors and reservoirs.
