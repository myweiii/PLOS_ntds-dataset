Constant use of pyrethroid insecticides has driven mosquito populations to develop resistance. In Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue, yellow Fever, and chikungunya viruses, pyrethroid resistance is primarily associated with mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel protein. One mutation occurs in codon 1,016 and involves a replacement of valine with isoleucine (Ile1, 016), and a second located in subunit 6 of domain III in codon 1,534, replaces phenylalanine with cysteine (Cys1,534). In Mexico, we found that Cys1,534 was present in the same mosquito collections that were previously analyzed for Ile1,016. In this study, we performed a linkage disequilibrium analysis on both Ile1,016 and Cys1,534 in Mexican collections from 2000â€“2012. Our analysis suggests that pyrethroid resistance requires the sequential evolution of the two mutations and that Cys1,534 must occur first and appears to enable the Ile1,016 mutation to survive.
