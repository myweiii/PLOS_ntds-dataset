Dengue fever is the most important viral arthropod-borne disease worldwide and its geographical expansion during the past decades has been of growing concern for scientists and public health authorities because of its heavy sanitary burden and economic impacts. In the absence of an effective vaccine, control is currently limited to vector-control measures. In this context, understanding the sociologic, entomologic and environmental factors underlying dengue dynamics is essential and can provide public health authorities with sound information about control measures to be implemented. In this study, we analyse socio-economic, climatic and epidemiological data to understand the impact of the studied factors on the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemic years in New Caledonia, a French island located in the South Pacific. We identify at risk areas, and find that temperature and peopleâ€™s way of life are key factors determining the level of viral circulation in New Caledonia. Hence, communication campaigns fostering individual protection measures against mosquito bites could help reduce dengue burden in New Caledonia. Using projections of temperature under different scenarios of climate change, we find that dengue incidence rates during epidemics could double by the end of the century, with areas at low risk of dengue fever being highly affected in the future.
