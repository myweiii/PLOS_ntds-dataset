Schistosomiasis is a public health problem caused by parasites of the genus Schistosoma, of which S. mansoni is the primary causative agent. The parasite has a complex life cycle; their sexual reproductive stage is dependent on female and male adult worms mating inside the mesenteric circulation of the human host, with the female releasing hundreds of eggs daily. This phase of the life cycle is responsible for the development of pathology, which is proportional to the number of eggs accumulating in the liver and intestine of the human host. Genome and transcriptome sequencing of this parasite represent important advances in schistosome research, but there is still a need for integrated analyses to better understand the biology of this parasite. In this study, we describe the first large-scale transcriptomes of eggs, and female and male adult worms, the parasite forms that are mainly responsible for the pathology of schistosomiasis. We were able to cross-reference the gene transcription regions with promoter regions, thus improving the gene annotations. Moreover, we identified the expression of novel protein-coding genes not yet described in the current genome annotation, advancing the biological knowledge regarding this parasite.
