Human landing collections, which are the current standard for collecting the black fly vectors of Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of river blindness, are inefficient and pose certain ethical issues. As entomological methods are among the primary techniques recommended by the international community for verifying the elimination of onchocerciasis, there is a need to develop alternative methods to collect these vectors. Recent studies have demonstrated that traps baited with CO2 and dirty clothing have the potential to replace human landing collections for this purpose. However, for these traps to be widely applied, it will be necessary to develop a consistent bait formulation. To this end, volatile compounds from human sweat that attract the principal black fly vectors of O. volvulus in Africa and the Americas have been identified and used to optimize traps that specifically collect these insects. To achieve this milestone, we report the use of electroantennography and behavioral assays to identify human compounds that are neurostimulatory to these vectors, and demonstrate that these compounds are attractive to the vectors in field studies using previously developed trap platforms. The development of such a defined bait formulation will permit the widespread use of these traps by onchocerciasis elimination programs in Africa and the Americas.
