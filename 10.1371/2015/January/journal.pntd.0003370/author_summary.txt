Tuberculosis remains one of the main global public health problems. Human tuberculosis is caused by bacteria known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The MTBC includes a variant called Mycobacterium africanum, which causes up to half of all tuberculosis cases in West Africa. For reasons unknown, M. africanum does not occur in other parts of the world. To explore the possible reasons for this geographic restriction of M. africanum, we analysed a large collection of bacterial strains isolated from tuberculosis patients in Ghana. We genetically characterized these bacterial isolates and collected relevant socio-demographic and epidemiological data. We found tuberculosis patients infected with M. africanum were more likely to belong to the Ewe ethnic group, compared to patients carrying other MTBC bacteria. The Ewes are indigenous inhabitants of coastal regions in West Africa that have previously been shown to harbour a high prevalence of M. africanum. Our findings support the hypothesis that different variants of MTBC have adapted to different human populations, and offer a possible explanation for the geographical restriction of M. africanum to West Africa.
