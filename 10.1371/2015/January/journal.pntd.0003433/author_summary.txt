Chagas disease is transmitted by triatomine bugs that actively disperse by walking and flying. The control of this vector-borne disease focuses on reducing or eliminating the insect vector populations. Most transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, involves insects living within or very close to households and feeding mostly on domestic animals. As animal hosts can be removed due to migration, slaughter, or death, it is important to understand how host availability can modify transmission risk to humans and to characterize the dispersal of triatomine vectors on a very fine scale. We used a semi-field system to characterize the dispersal of Triatoma infestans, and compare the behavior of vector populations in the constant presence of hosts and after the removal of the hosts. The emigration rate – net insect population decline in original refuges – following host removal was on average 19.7% of insects per 10 days compared to 10.2% in constant host populations. Activity of insects was significantly increased when hosts were removed. The removal of domestic animals in infested areas increases vector dispersal, possibly towards nearby human sleeping spaces.
