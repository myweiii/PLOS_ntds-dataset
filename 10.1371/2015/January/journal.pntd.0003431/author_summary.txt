Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a common complication of leprosy and an important cause of nerve damage and disability. In most cases, ENL causes chronic or recurrent episodes of ill-health over many years. In this study, we show that having a family member affected by ENL places considerable financial burden on households in rural India. Household costs resulted predominantly from the impact of ENL on the productivity (ability to earn money) of household members. Out of pocket expenditure on treatment-seeking in the private sector accounted for the remaining costs. Leprosy affects poor and marginalised communities in low- and middle-income countries across the world; households affected by ENL are at risk of being pushed further into poverty. The findings of this study support the need to better understand ENL and develop improved strategies for the prevention and management of ENL.
