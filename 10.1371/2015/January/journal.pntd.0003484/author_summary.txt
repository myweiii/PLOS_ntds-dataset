Schistosomiasis, one of the worldâ€™s greatest human neglected tropical diseases, is caused by a parasitic flatworm trematode of the genus Schistosoma. Among human parasitic diseases, schistosomiasis ranks second behind malaria in terms of socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and subtropical areas. More than 200 million people are currently infected in 77 countries, 85% of whom live in sub-Saharian Africa. To date no vaccine is available against schistosomiasis. As chemotherapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, many initiatives have been promoted aiming to search for novel anti-schistosomal drugs that can represent a valid alternative to the current treatment or could be used in case of emerging resistance. Quantitative, objective and validated methods for compound collections screening are needed for the discovery of novel anti-schistosomal drugs. Here, we report the development and validation of a medium-throughput, luminescence-based assay for assessing viability at the schistosomulum stage of the human parasite S. mansoni. Our methodology enables a simple, reproducible, highly sensitive and objective quantitation of parasite viability. It is also automation compatible and enables the screening of compound collections thus hopefully contributing to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies against schistosomiasis.
