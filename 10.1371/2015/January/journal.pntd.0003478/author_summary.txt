Bats, with over 1000 recognized species, represent about 20% of all classified mammalian species worldwide. These mammals have a wide range of ecologies and life-history traits, and are now widely recognized as important reservoirs of many pathogens. Bartonella species have been found distributed in a wide range of mammalian species, including bats. About half of recognized Bartonella species, including one bat-associated species, have been associated with human illness. Previous studies have shown that Bartonella species are extremely diverse, with or without evident specificity to their mammalian hosts. Possessing many unique aspects, bartonellae can serve as a useful biological marker to study how microorganisms have evolved and diversified along with their animal hosts in evolutionary history. In this study, we applied multi-locus sequence typing, or MLST, to study the genetic differences of straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum)-associated Bartonella species. Our studies suggest Bartonella species have both exchanged genetic materials among species through recombination events and lost genes that are perhaps superfluous to their life cycles, which includes an intracellular stage in mammals.
