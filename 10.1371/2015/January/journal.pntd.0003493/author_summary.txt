Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Endemic to Central and South America, it affects over 10 million people and many more live in risk transmission areas. Although mostly asymptomatic at its initial acute stage in humans, damages can occur over the years in many tissues such as T. cruzi-hosting heart and digestive track. For over 40 years the chemotherapy of Chagas disease has relied on the use of two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, though both are known to lead to severe side effects which often prompt to the discontinuation of the treatments. Despite having good efficacy against the acute stage of infection, its efficacy against the chronic stage is under question. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need of new anti-T. cruzi drugs. Several efforts have been made in the last years to establish reliable high throughput cell based in vitro assays to be used for drug discovery against Chagas. With the aim to contribute to this field here we describe the development of a new automated image-based assay to identify new compounds against T. cruzi that has been set up using the myoblastic rat cell line H9c2 as cell-cycling amastigotes hosting cells.
