Leishmaniasis is a disease that is common in most tropical countries. In Brazil, the cutaneous form of the disease is highly prevalent, with approximately 28,000 new cases reported annually. L. (Viannia) braziliensis is the main causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, vaccine studies against protozoans of the subgenus Viannia have been largely neglected, mainly due to the high resistance of most mouse strains to the infection. Here, the authors used the golden hamster, which is highly susceptible to dermotropic Leishmania spp infection. It was previously shown that oral and intranasal vaccination with whole L. (Leishmania) amazonensis antigens (LaAg) protected mice against L. amazonensis infection. In the present study, the authors investigated whether the protective effect of intranasal immunisation with LaAg can be extended to L. braziliensis infection using the golden hamster model. The results showed that intranasal immunisation with LaAg significantly reduced lesion growth and parasitic load as well as IgG and IgG2 serum levels. At the endpoint of the experiment, intranasally immunised hamsters that were considered protected expressed IFN-Î³ and IL10 mRNA at levels similar to those in uninfected skin. These data show that the use of a proper animal model and/or different vaccination strategies may facilitate the development of an effective vaccine against L. braziliensis.
