The full activation and differentiation of T cells into Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells requires costimulatory molecules and cytokines. ICOS has also been implicated in chronic inflammation and is critical for Th17 cell development. CD4+ IL-17-secreting T cells have been shown to contribute to pathology in some models of liver fibrosis. However, neither the significance nor the immunopathogenesis of this pathway have been elucidated in schistosomiasis fibrosis. The present study used the ICOSL KO mice to assess the role of the ICOSL/ICOS interaction in the mediation of the Th17 response in host granulomatous inflammation, particularly in liver fibrosis during S.japonicum infection. This study further clarifies the immune regulatory mechanism of fibrosis and sheds light on the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of Schistosoma-induced fibrosis. It might reveal new therapeutic targets that interfere with Th17 cell migration or differentiation in granulomas and the subsequent fibrosis following infection with S. japonicum.
