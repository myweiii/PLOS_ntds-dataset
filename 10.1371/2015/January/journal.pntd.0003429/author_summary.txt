Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form among leishmaniasis, being a neglected disease caused by a protozoan parasite. Its transmission through phlebotominae bites, between dogs and humans, classifies it as a zoonotic disease. It is caused by the specie Leishmania infantum ( = L. chagasi) and represents 20% of the world's human visceral leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis is a serious public health issue, fatal if untreated, and its incidence is increasing in urban areas of the tropics. In Brazil, one of the control measures is the identification and elimination of infected dogs, which act as reservoirs for Leishmania parasites. Diagnostic methods used to identify infection in these animals are still not accurate enough, which may compromise the effectiveness of this control measure. Thus, to contribute to the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis, we aimed to develop and test two new antigens that could be applied in early detection of infected dogs.
