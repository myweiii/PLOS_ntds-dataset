Schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern and is one of the major causes of morbidity among school-aged children in Sudan. To control schistosomiasis in White Nile State of Sudan, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) implemented an integrated control program including mass chemotherapy with praziquantel and health education to school children and village residents, and construction of a drinking water supply facility at Al Hidaib village from 2009 to 2011. As a result of this project, the overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by >50% in comparison with the baseline rates (95% CI = 0.331–0.462). The infection reduction rates were higher among girls, those with moderate infection status (around 20%), and residents of rural areas; than for those of boys, subjects with high infection status (>40%) and residents of urban areas. A supply of clean water at Al Hidaib village contributed significantly to the reduction in the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in comparison to Khour Ajwal village, which is similar natural environment and lifestyle of Al Hidaib village. However, the prevalence of S. mansoni infection did not significantly change. Also, the awareness of knowledge about schistosomiasis and health improvement was apparently improved by the results of questionnaires survey. Through this project, approximately 200,000 individuals benefited from either drug treatment, health education, or a clean water supply. To consolidate the achievements of the project, sustainable integrated control activities should be implemented in the near future.
