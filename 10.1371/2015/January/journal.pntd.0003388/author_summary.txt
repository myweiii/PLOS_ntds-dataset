Rift Valley fever is a common vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes huge economic losses in Africa and the Middle East. The transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen are affected by many factors, such as climatic, hydrologic and geographic influences, along with impacts from human activities and different forms of virus transmission via different vectors. In this work, we focus on identifying the potential risks that lead to disease outbreaks in Egypt along the Nile, from the South to the Nile Delta, by mathematically and numerically analyzing a patch model with temporal periodicity. We discover that human activities during the Eid al Adha feast, as well as climatic and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease. Interestingly, periodic co-occurrence of the religious festival and the onset of peaks in mosquito abundance, each with a different periodicity, is predicted to lead to periodic large scale disease outbreaks.
