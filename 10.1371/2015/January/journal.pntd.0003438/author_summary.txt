Leishmaniasis is endemic in southeastern Mexico, where Leishmania (L.) mexicana is the principle parasite species causing disease in humans. Previous studies using methodology for inferring potential biotic interactions between species had shown a high prevalence of bat species as potential hosts for Leishmania, yet bats have not been identified as hosts in Mexico. Motivated by these predictions, we currently analyze whether bats are infected with Leishmania (L.) mexicana and to what extent they serve as hosts for this parasite. We analyzed 420 bats from six states, and through PCR analysis of skin, heart, liver and/or spleen we found that 41 bats (9.77%) of 13 different bat species were infected. Most of the infected bats were netted in an eco-region characterized by plantations grown beneath shade-providing fruit trees that favors breeding conditions for the sand fly vectors and brings them in close proximity with frugivorous, insectivorous or nectarivorous bats. None of the infected bat tissues showed macroscopic lesions. Through artificial infections, we were also able to show that Leishmania (L.) mexicana remains viable and infective after passage through one species of bat. We conclude that various species of bats belonging to the family Phyllostomidae are possible reservoir hosts of Leishmania (L.) mexicana.
