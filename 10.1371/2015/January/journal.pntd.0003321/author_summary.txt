Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal, vector-borne tropical disease that affects the poorest sections of the society. The currently available drugs are toxic, expensive and have severe side effects. The problem is further compounded by emergence of VL-HIV co-infection and occurence of PKDL after apparent cure. Thus, alternate therapeutic interventions are needed in the absence of vaccines and mounting drug resistance. VL is also characterized by severe depression of cell-mediated immunity that complicates the efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoration of the dampened immune system coupled with antileishmanial effect would be a rational approach in the quest for antileishmanial drugs. Plant derived secondary metabolites have been recommended for the containment of antiparasitic disease including leishmaniasis that synergistically aid in lifting the immune suppression. We previously reported in vitro antileishmanial activity of n-hexane fractions of Artemisia annua leaves (AAL) and seeds (AAS) that was mediated by apoptosis. In this study, we found significant reduction in liver and spleen parasite burden of Leishmania donovani infected BALB/c mice upon oral administration of AAL and AAS with concomitant immunostimulation and induction of immunological memory. The immunotherapeutic potentiation by AAL and AAS with no adverse toxic effects validates their use for treatment of this debilitating disease.
