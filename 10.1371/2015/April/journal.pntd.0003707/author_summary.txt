The single-cell parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, one of the major neglected tropical infections. Throughout Latin America, this disease is an important cause of premature death due to heart failure, and it is currently an emerging public health problem in the US, Europe and across the world. There are only two drugs available to treat the infection, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both have significant side effects and resistance/treatment failures are increasing. The T. cruzi vitamin-C dependent peroxidase (TcAPx) is an anti-oxidant enzyme which is absent from the mammalian host, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. Using genetic manipulation, we have deleted the genes for this enzyme from T. cruzi. The resulting null mutants were hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide but displayed normal sensitivity to benznidazole. Using a bioluminescent model of infection, we could demonstrate that the null mutants were able to establish a similar infection to that of wild type parasites. Our results show that TcAPx should not be pursued as a target for drug design.
