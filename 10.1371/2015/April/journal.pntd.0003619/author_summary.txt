The highest disease burden of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) is seen in children under five years of age in endemic areas. We investigated both mucosal and systemic immune responses in S. Typhi bacteremic young children (aged, 1 to 5 years) by measuring S. Typhi membrane preparation (MP) specific IgA response in lymphocyte culture secretion and plasma IgA, IgG and IgM responses using ELISA. We also measured T cell proliferation responses using 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. We compared the responses to S. Typhi bacteremic older children (6 to 17 years) and adults (18 to 59 years) and with age-matched healthy controls (HC). Younger children, older children and adults show comparable responses in lymphocyte secretions after onset of illness. Plasma antibody responses to MP vary between young children and other age groups. T cell proliferative responses increased in all age cohorts by late convalescence. Clinical characteristics were similar in all age cohorts. Emergence of MDR S. Typhi strains is seen in young children which does not impact on the clinical symptoms or the immune responses. The results of this study show that natural infections do induce immune response in young children as well as in adults.
