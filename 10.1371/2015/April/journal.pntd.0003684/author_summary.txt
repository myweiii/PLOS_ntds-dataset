Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by mosquitos and causes high fever and severe joint pain in humans. It is expected to spread in the future to Europe and has recently reached the USA due to vector switch and climate change. There is no specific treatment or vaccination against CHIKV infections. However, vaccination should be an efficient way to control its spread. The CHIKV envelope glycoprotein E2 enables attachment of the virus to target cells and a humoral immune response against E2 should protect from CHIKV infections. We aimed to identify small antigens of the CHIKV E2 protein that are able to induce neutralizing antibodies. These antigens should enable the production of cost effective, safe and efficient vaccines. The surface-exposed parts of the E2 domain A (sA) fused to domain B and a part of the Î²-ribbon that joins domain A with B (sAB+) induced most effectively neutralizing antibodies and mice vaccinated with this protein were partially protected from a CHIKV challenge infection. The protein sAB+ was identified as a useful antigen for developing a vaccine when formulated with an appropriate adjuvant.
