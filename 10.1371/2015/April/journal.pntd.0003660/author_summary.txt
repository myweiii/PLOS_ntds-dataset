Parasitic infectious agents rarely occur in isolation and multiparasitism is a norm specifically in children living in endemic areas of Tanzania. We studied the pattern and predictors of Plasmodium and STH co-infections in rural Bagamoyo district, coastal region of Tanzania. Parents/guardians of healthy children aged 2 months to 9 years who were willing to participate in the study were invited from the community. Stool, urine and blood were examined for helminth and Plasmodium parasites. We found that children aged above five years and those who are not schooling had the greatest burden of co-infection with Plasmodium and helminth parasites. The risk of being co-infected with Plasmodium increased with age with all the common types of STH isolated (E. vermicularis, hookworm and S. stercoralis). Younger children had a significantly higher risk of having Plasmodium when co-infected with S. stercoralis. Integrated control approaches including health education, environmental sanitation and hygiene, novel chemoprophylaxis as well as long lasting Impregnated Nets (LLINs) distributions should be implemented considering the pattern and types of infections within the area in order to interrupt transmission of both parasites among young and school-aged children.
