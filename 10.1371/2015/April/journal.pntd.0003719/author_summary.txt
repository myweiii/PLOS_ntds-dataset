With an estimated 390 million infections each year, dengue imposes a significant global public health burden. Yet estimates of the intensity of dengue transmission in different settings are still sparse, making it difficult to plan efficient control programs. Since many dengue infections have no symptoms, cases reported through hospitals are only a small proportion of true cases. The authors used seroprevalence surveys which can detect all past infections to estimate dengue transmission intensity in 22 countries. Estimates derived from data collected using cheaper diagnostic tests were comparable to those making use of more expensive tests, an important conclusion for surveillance in resource constrained countries. We found dengue transmission intensity varied up to 4-fold in endemic settings, with estimates showing some sensitivity to how many dengue infections were assumed to confer complete immunity.
