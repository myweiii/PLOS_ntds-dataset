Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused either by fungi or aerobic actinomycetes. It predominantly affects poor people in remote communities, where access to health care is very limited and people usually rely on traditional treatment. The incidence of mycetoma in the Lao PDR is not known, although the first case of mycetoma from the northern part of the country was published only recently. The present case report is the second case from the Lao PDR and the first published case of actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia aobensis. Data from the literature and the present case suggest that far shorter courses of antibiotics than those usually recommended might be sufficient to treat actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia spp., although these observations need to be confirmed by further studies. Shorter treatment courses would reduce drug side effects and the financial burden on patients. The latter is particularly important for low-income countries like the Lao PDR with very limited resources for health care.
