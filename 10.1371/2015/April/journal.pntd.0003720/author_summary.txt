VNSSTIs have increased significantly over the last two decades, with cases now regularly reported globally. Despite advancing antibiotic and infection control practices, these infections are still highly lethal and disabling diseases. They usually predispose patients to septic shock and then evolve to liver dysfunction and MODS, thus resulting in high mortality in humans. However, clinicians do not have a valid prediction model to provide a reliable estimate of case-fatality rate when caring for these acutely and critically ill patients. MELD scoring system was originally developed to assess the short-term prognosis of cirrhotic patients undergoing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. By using the MEGX test, the strong negative association between the scores and the residual liver function has been confirmed. Therefore, it has been validated and applied to a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios in recent years. In this work, we studied the predictive value of the MELD scoring system for case-fatality in patients suffering VNSSTIs. We have found that the MELD scoring system is an effective risk stratification indicator at the time of admission, and also an excellent condition monitor during hospitalization for medical care of acutely and critically ill patients with VNSSTIs.
