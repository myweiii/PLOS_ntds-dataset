We investigated changes in dynamics of schistosomiasis transmission over space and time in Anhui Province of East China. Parasitological data were obtained through repeated cross-sectional surveys that were carried out during 1997â€“2010. A multivariate autoregressive model, combined with principal oscillation pattern (POP) analysis, was used to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of schistosomiasis risk. The schistosomiasis risk changed temporally as a damped oscillatory mode with a fluctuation, indicating that the disease risk declined periodically but with a temporal ascent during the study period. This change might result from national control strategies on schistosomiasis. The POP analysis also demonstrated a shifting spatial pattern of schistosomiasis along the Yangtze River. The POP method is commonly used in geosciences but not in epidemiology. Our analysis based on the approach provided new insights into the research of schistosomiasis transmission. The utility of such methods for addressing epidemiological problems will grow as more large-scale datasets become readily available.
