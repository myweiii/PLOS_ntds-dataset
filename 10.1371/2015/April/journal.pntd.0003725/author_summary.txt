Sirtuins are a family of deacetylases, evolutionary conserved from bacteria to mammals. They participate in the regulation of a wide range of nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial pathways, and are considered pro-life enzymes. In the last years the search for sirtuin inhibitors was a very active field of research, with potential applications in a large number of pathologies, including parasitic diseases. We are interested in the study of the two sirtuins present in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, being our objective to understand their function. First, we determined the localization of these enzymes in the parasite: TcSIR2RP1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme and TcSIR2RP3 localizes in the mitochondrion. When we overexpress cytoplasmic TcSIR2RP1, the transgenic parasites differentiate to metacyclic trypomastigotes and infect mammalian cells more efficiently. In contrast, the overexpression of mitochondrial TcSIR2RP3 does not affect metacyclogenesis but modifies epimastigotes growth and slightly increases the proliferation of the parasite in the intracellular stage. We also used these transgenic lines to test their sensibility to previously described sirtuin inhibitors.
