Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis that affects all mammals worldwide. It emerged more than 10,000 years ago from a Bacillus cereus precursor. In the past decade, B. cereus bacteria were isolated in the USA from anthrax-like pneumonia cases. They harbour one virulence plasmid very similar to the toxinâ€“encoding plasmid of B. anthracis. Recently, an anthrax-like disease in great apes in Africa was caused by emerging B. cereus strains, named B. cereus biovar anthracis. These strains are atypical as they possess both plasmids coding for toxin and capsule similar to those so far found only in B. anthracis. These unusual pathogenic B. cereus are currently neglected. We explored the virulence of these pathogens and their colonisation and dissemination capacity within the murine host. We found that these toxinogenic strains harbour two capsules, the classical B. anthracis capsule and an additional polysaccharidic capsule. This latter capsule confers virulence alone or in combination with toxins. Both capsules are concomitantly expressed, under the control of a common global regulator and host signals. Our results show that acquisition of new genetic information by these B. cereus clearly gives them a selective advantage, favouring their dissemination within infected hosts and the environment.
