We would like to thank Thora Kjærulff (Copenhagen University) and Nicolas Takken for their assistance with mosquito collections. The following students from the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana assisted with mosquito collections and mosquito identification; Rosa Flores, Louis Funes, Julio Garcia, and Lucia Ríos. Gabriela Vásquez La Torre also provided general logistical support for this project.
