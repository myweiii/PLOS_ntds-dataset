The principal strategy for the control of HAT is based on early detection and prompt treatment of identified cases. A range of taboos are associated with HAT treatment in DRC. The origin of these taboos is not well understood. These taboos constitute major issues for patients and their families, lead to huge social pressure from the community on HAT patients and add in themselves to the burden caused by the disease itself. The aim of this study is to document the origin of these taboos and other cultural factors that are associated with HAT treatment, since an improved understanding of these factors and their implications may lead to strategies for improved community adherence to HAT screening and treatment. We found that the taboos are associated with the melarsoprol toxicity and have been established empirically following past interactions between healthcare providers and communities. The prohibitions started as simple instructions provided by healthcare providers about the management of HAT cases, but over time evolved into the community-based taboos we observe now. Use of less toxic treatment alternatives for HAT, dissemination of correct information regarding HAT treatment regimens, possible occurrence of adverse events and their cause would be beneficial to HAT control.
