Most triatomines are found in forested environments. However, environmental imbalances can influence the decline of sylvatic vertebrate populations and promote food shortages for triatomines. As a survival strategy, these bugs tend to disperse to houses near forest remnants. We studied the spatial distribution, natural infections by Trypanosoma cruzi and feeding patterns of triatomines in a suburban area of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil between 2007 and 2011. Triatoma tibiamaculata was collected in sylvatic, peridomestic and domestic habitats, and a high T. cruzi infection rate was established for triatomines that fed on blood from birds, marsupials, ruminants and rodents. The frequent invasion of dwellings by infected triatomines can present a risk for oral and vectorial transmission of T. cruzi to humans. We recommend that residents of triatomine-prone areas perform the following procedures: (i) avoid leaving artificial lights on overnight; (ii) periodically clean palm trees near their homes; and (iii) install net screens on windows. Moreover, education campaigns should promote community awareness of the risks of T. cruzi infection and provide alternatives to prevent human contact with vectors. Finally, we highlight the importance of continuous epidemiological surveillance in areas where domestic transmission is controlled but enzootic transmission persists.
