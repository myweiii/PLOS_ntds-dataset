The spread of enterovirus-induced HFMD could be controlled through a robust vaccination program. Formalin-inactivated EV71 (FI-EV71) vaccines have been evaluated in human clinical trials in China, Taiwan and Singapore and were found to be safe and to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses against EV71, which is currently circulating in Asia. However, the results from recent three phase III clinical trials performed in young children indicate that the lack of efficacy against CVA16 infections is a major challenge to the current EV71 vaccine and future HFMD vaccine development. In this study, we developed an adenovirus-based vaccine, Ad-EVVLP with the EV71 P1 and 3CD genes to express VLPs. Ad-EVVLP immunization induced EV71-specific neutralizing antibodies and Th1/Th2-balanced cellular responses in mice. Ad-EVVLP provided protection against both EV71 and CVA16 challenges in the hSCARB2-Tg mice model, whereas FI-EV71 vaccine activated only Th2-mediated EV71 neutralizing antibody responses to protect against EV71 challenge. Because Ad-EVVLP vaccination-induced antibodies had no virus neutralizing activities against CVA16, the cross-protective immunity against CVA16 was mediated by conserved 3CD-specific cellular immunity activation. These results indicate that Ad-EVVLP meets a medical need as a universal HFMD vaccine against both EV71 and CV infections.
