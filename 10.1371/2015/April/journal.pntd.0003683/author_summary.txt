Interaction of Trypanosoma cruzi with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is an essential step in the invasion of mammalian cells. However, the nature of the signaling triggered in the parasite is poorly understood. Herein the key role of nitric oxide in T. cruzi signaling is described, using an ECM preparation, in the absence of host cells. Inhibition of NOS activity, with the expected decrease in •NO production, as well as decrease in cGMP concentration were observed by the incubation of T. cruzi trypomastigotes with ECM. Additionally, lower levels of protein S-nitrosylation and nitration were detected. These post-translational modifications have been analyzed by biotin-switch and protein immunoprecipitation approaches coupled to mass spectrometry. The presence of both modifications was confirmed for specific proteins, as mucin II (S-nitrosylation), histones, enolase and tubulins. To our knowledge, decrease in the •NO signaling pathway upon T. cruzi trypomastigotes adhesion to ECM, affecting both the canonical pathway (•NO-soluble guanylyl cyclase-cGMP) and protein S-nitrosylation and nitration is described for the first time in this parasite.
