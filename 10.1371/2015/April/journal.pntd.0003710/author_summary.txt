Chagas disease, caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in most Latin American countries and it is considered a neglected tropical disease (NTD). T. cruzi transmission is feasible in vector-free world regions. The main non-vectorial routes are congenital transmission, blood transfusion, and solid organ transplant. According to WHO, in Spain, which is the second country in the world receiving migrant population from endemic countries, there are up to 40.000 persons at risk of developing symptomatic Chagas disease. Since 2005, serological screening for at-risk blood and solid organ donors is mandatory. Lately, some regulations regarding screening of pregnant women from Latin American endemic countries have also been implemented, but only in some autonomous regions. Up to date, there is no surveillance system in place. Thus, the Chagas disease burden remains unknown. In this paper we use hospitalized Chagas disease discharge data, in order to describe Chagas disease’s geographical and temporal trends before and after the implementation of control measures in Spain from 1997 to 2011. We also assess patients’ main clinical characteristics by organ affectation.
