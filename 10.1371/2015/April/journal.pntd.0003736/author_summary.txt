Lassa fever (LF) is an acute viral infection which is often associated with hemorrhagic manifestations and multi-organ failure in humans. The etiological agent responsible for LF is Lassa virus (LASV), a rodent-borne Arenavirus which is endemic in several West African countries. Up to 500,000 cases of LF are diagnosed annually, primarily in Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The high incidence rate combined with the significant morbidity and mortality associated with LASV infection highlights the need for an effective prophylactic vaccine for LF. Importantly, an ideal LASV vaccine should provide protection against genetically and geographical divergent viral strains. Previously a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based LF vaccine using the glycoproteins of LASV strain Josiah as the immunogen, was shown to completely protect non-human primates against a homologous (LASV strain Josiah) challenge. Here, we have expanded the original studies and tested the VSV-LASV vaccine against challenge with LASV isolates from Mali, Liberia and Nigeria in the strain 13 guinea pig and cynomolgus macaque disease models. Our results suggest that the VSV-based LF vaccine affords complete protection against geographically and genetically distinct viral isolates.
