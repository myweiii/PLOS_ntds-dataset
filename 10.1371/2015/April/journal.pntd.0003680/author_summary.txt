Liver flukes of the family Opisthorchiidae cause diseases of the hepatobiliary system, known as opisthorchiasis/clonorchiasis. The chronic forms of these diseases greatly increase the risk of cancer developing in the biliary ducts. Much has been elucidated regarding the developmental biology of opisthorchiid flukes and the molecular pathological effects on the definitive host; however, the role of microRNAs (short non-coding RNAs) capable of influencing the pathogenic process and host-parasite interactions have not yet been comprehensively studied. The aim of the present work was to identify the miRNA genes of the liver flukes and provide a basis for further investigating the roles of these miRNAs in the complex opisthorchiidae life cycle and the pathogenesis of disease.
