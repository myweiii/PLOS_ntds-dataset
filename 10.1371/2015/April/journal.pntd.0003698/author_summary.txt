Soil-transmitted helminths are parasitic worms (hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm) that affect hundreds of millions of people. Kato-Katz is the most widely used technique for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infection. It requires the collection, processing, and microscopic examination of stool samples within the same day. In remote areas, laboratories are often far away from where stool samples are being collected, which makes it difficult to examine the samples on the same day. Mini-FLOTAC is an alternative to Kato-Katz technique that allows analysis of fixed stool samples several days after collection. We assessed the accuracy of the Mini-FLOTAC with fixed stool samples. The study was carried out in late 2013 on Pemba Island and 41 children participated. Fresh stool samples were first examined by Kato-Katz and then fixed in formalin and examined by Mini-FLOTAC (12 examinations within one month). We found that for a qualitative diagnosis (presence or absence of infection) stool samples can be fixed for 31 days. However, for an accurate quantitative diagnosis of hookworm eggs, stool samples should not be stored for more than 15 days, as egg counts decline. Our results have implications for integrating soil-transmitted helminth surveys with other neglected tropical diseases.
