Leishmania parasites are transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by infected Phlebotomine sand flies during the blood meal of the flies. During the Leishmania transmission, the saliva is inoculated together with parasites and exhibit several pharmacological compounds that facilitate blood feeding, interfering on homeostasis and avoiding inflammation. Thus, these compounds allow the establishment of pathogen infection. We recently identified adenosine (ADO) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as major immunomodulatory compounds present within the Old World sand fly species Phlebotomus papatasii, which protected mice from extreme inflammatory insults. ADO limits the magnitude of immune response by displaying a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Here, we demonstrated that ADO and AMP present in Phlebotomus papatasi saliva are involved in the establishment of parasite infection. Such nucleosides act through adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), inducing a tolerogenic profile on dendritic cells (tDC) that may generate regulatory T cells differentiation, thus leading to suppression of the immune response and parasite survival. The identification of the active salivary constituents could serve as a strategy for the development of new vaccines to control pathogen transmission.
