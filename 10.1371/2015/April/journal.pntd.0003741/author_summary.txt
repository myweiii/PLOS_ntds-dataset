Both dengue and diabetes have reached epidemic dimensions and pose a joint threat to a large proportion of populations in low- and middle-income countries. Dengue is no longer a disease primarily affecting children. Therefore the influence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, which are increasingly prevalent in adults, on the clinical presentation of a dengue episode becomes a public health priority. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the available evidence on the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the clinical presentation of dengue. The meta-analysis of published evidence combined with supporting biological evidence point to an increased risk for potentially life threatening symptoms of dengue among patients with diabetes. The current evidence is limited by statistical power and other study limitations and does not allow conclusions about a causal effect of diabetes. Yet, based on the currently available evidence, diabetes patients with fever and living in a dengue endemic region should seek confirmation of dengue infection as early as possible. Diabetes should be considered in the triage of patients for close observation and early intervention, which are challenges, particularly during dengue outbreaks. Timeliness of intervention is the most important factor averting serious complications and death in patients with acute dengue.
