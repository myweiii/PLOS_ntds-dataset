African trypanosomiasis continues to be a major threat to human health and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite intense studies, the immunopathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. Understanding the factors that regulate disease pathogenesis would be important in designing effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we demonstrate that the B cell adaptor molecule, Bam32, contributes to optimum resistance to experimental T. congolense infection in mice because its deficiency negatively impacts optimal B cell responses including germinal centre formation and parasite-specific IgG responses in vivo. In addition, Bam32 deficiency significantly enhances proinflammatory cytokine production by splenic cells, suggesting that Bam32 may act as a negative regulator of cytokine gene expression following T. congolense infection. Collectively, these findings identify Bam32 as an indispensable molecule for optimal germinal centre formation, anti-trypanosome IgG antibody response and suppression of disease-promoting proinflammatory cytokines and its deficiency leads to inability to control T. congolense infection in mice.
