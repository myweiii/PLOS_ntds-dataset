River blindness (onchocerciasis) is transmitted by blackflies and causes severe itching, skin lesions, and vision impairment including blindness. More than 99% of all current cases are found in sub-Saharan Africa where the disease has historically hindered socioeconomic development in endemic areas. The treatment goal is shifting from control to elimination in Africa as morbidity has significantly decreased through vector control and community-directed treatment with ivermectin. Studies in Mali and Senegal proved that elimination is feasible with ivermectin administration. Given limited resources, national and global policymakers need a rigorous analysis of investment options from epidemiological, economic, and societal aspects. For this, we developed control, elimination, and eradication scenarios and compared treatment timelines and drug needs over the next 30 years. We found that the elimination and eradication scenarios would require a shorter treatment phase and a smaller amount of ivermectin than the control scenario, mainly because community-directed treatment with ivermectin could be ended earlier thanks to regular active surveillance.
