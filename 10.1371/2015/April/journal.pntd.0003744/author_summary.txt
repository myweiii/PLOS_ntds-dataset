The myenteric neuronal activity on colon carcinogenesis is a matter of debate. Chagas disease (a trypanosomiasis-related chronic infection) induces megacolon damaging myenteric neurons. Puzzling, tumors have been rarely reported in chagasic megacolon patients. We reveal here hyperplasia-related high-proliferation occurs in chagasic megacolon, although the risk for colon cancer is reduced. Having carcinogen-exposed rats infected with Trypanosoma cruzi reduced the numbers of myenteric neurons and colon preneoplastic lesions. An experimental model for chemical myenteric denervation was applied in carcinogen-exposed rats revealing that myenteric neurons promote the development of colon preneoplastic lesions. Yet, activity of the fecal content had to be secluded from the myenteric neuronal activity on colon carcinogenesis. Hartmannâ€™s surgical procedure enabled that. This was applied together with carcinogenic exposure and myenteric neuronal denervation ensuring that the neuronal activity is associated with enhanced development of colon carcinogenesis. Taken together, we believe colon tumors are not found within the chagasic megacolon region because the myenteric neuronal density is impaired. These observations shed lights on novel potential cell to cell interactions promoting the colon cancer development.
