Chagas disease, is an illness caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in southern parts of the American continent. We tested the protective efficacy of a DNA-prime/T. rangeli-boost (TcVac4) vaccine in a dog (Canis familiaris) model. Dogs were immunized with two-doses of DNA vaccine followed by two doses of inactivated T. rangeli epimastigotes (TrIE) and challenged with a highly pathogenic strain of T. cruzi. TcVac4 induced a protective antibody response in comparison with dogs from the control groups. Blood parasite burden, parasite transmission to triatomines and electrocardiographic abnormalities were significantly lower in TcVac4-vaccinated dogs than was observed in dogs given TrIE or empty plasmid DNA only. Macroscopic and microscopic alterations were significantly decreased in the myocardium of TcVac4-vaccinated dogs. We conclude that TcVac4 induced immunity was beneficial in providing resistance to T. cruzi infection, evidenced by control of chronic heart damage and preservation of cardiac function in dogs. Additionally, TcVac4 vaccination decreased the transmission of parasites from vaccinated/infected animals to triatomines.
