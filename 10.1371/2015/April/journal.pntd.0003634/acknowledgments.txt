We are grateful to the study participants, their parents and guardians without whom the study would not have been possible. We are also grateful to all staff at the participating health centres and at the PNG Institute of Medical Research involved in the sample collection including N. Senn, B. Kiniboro and J. Nale. We thank L. Schultz, J. Wapling and P. Ntsuke for generating microsatellite data for P. falciparum and C. Barnadas for helpful discussions.
