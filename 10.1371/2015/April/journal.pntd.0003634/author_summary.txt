The neglected human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is responsible for a large proportion of the global malaria burden. Efforts to control malaria have revealed that P. vivax is more resilient than the other major human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. This study utilised population genetics to compare patterns of P. vivax and P. falciparum transmission in Papua New Guinea, a region where infection rates of the two species are similar. The results demonstrated that P. vivax populations are more genetically diverse than those of P. falciparum suggestive of a parasite population that is more resilient to environmental challenges, undergoing higher levels of interbreeding locally and between distant parasite populations. Unique characteristics of P. vivax such as relapse, which allows different strains from past infections to produce subsequent infections, may provide more opportunities for the exchange and dissemination of genetic material. The contrasting patterns observed for the two species may be the result of a differential impact of past elimination attempts and indicate that more rigorous interventions will be needed in efforts to control and eventually eliminate P. vivax.
