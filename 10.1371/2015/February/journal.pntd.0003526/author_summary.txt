Amphimerus sp. is a fluke that infects the bile ducts of its definitive hosts. Recently, it has been shown that an indigenous Amerindian group, the Chachi, living in a rural and remote tropical area of Ecuador, are infected with this parasite. The epidemiology and life cycle of this parasite remains elusive, and research is needed to understand the mode of transmission and zoonotic potential of the parasite. It was hypothesized that the domestic animals of the Chachi households may act as definitive and reservoir hosts for Amphimerus infection. Hence, the presence and prevalence of infection in these animals residing in communities endemic for human amphimeriasis was investigated. Some 45 animal stool samples were examined microscopically for the presence of Amphimerus eggs. The results showed an infection rate of 71.4% in cats and 38.7% in dogs. The data provided evidence that these domestic animals act as both definitive and reservoir hosts for the parasite and that amphimeriasis is a zoonotic disease. The implementation of a mass treatment/control program must target both humans and animals in order to minimize the transmission of this liver fluke.
