Syphilis is an infection that is spread both sexually and from mother-to-child. Worldwide, it affects an estimated 11 million people each year. Treatment is available, but relies heavily on penicillin and may not be as effective where the infection involves the brain or nervous system. Clinical trials are needed to assess new treatments, but proving that people are cured with current tests can take months. We developed a new test to measure the success of treatment for the early stage of syphilis. We then used it in four patients and found that the syphilis bacteria were cleared from the blood and ulcer samples collected by 56 hours. All four patients were followed up with normal tests and found to have been cured. Our new test is the first to show the speed of bacterial clearance after treatment and we plan to use it in clinical trials of new treatments. Our data may also mean that patients with syphilis are unable to pass on the infection three days after treatment, but this also needs proving on a larger scale.
