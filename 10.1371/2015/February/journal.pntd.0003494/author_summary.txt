Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) are major causes of disease in both domestic animals and humans. Strategic treatments with anthelmintic drugs have been used to control livestock parasites for several decades resulting in widespread drug resistance. Drug treatments have, until recently, been applied at a relatively low level to control human parasites. However, in recent years community wide treatment programs have been massively increased for the 1â€“2 billion people infected with roundworms. Hence, for both human and animal health, there is an urgent need to understand how resistance emerges and spreads and how we can detect resistance mutations in this important group of pathogens. In this study, we investigated how drug resistance mutations appear and spread in the two livestock parasites for which resistance is most widespread. We have found that resistance appears repeatedly and frequently in parasite populations, and propose a model to explain the high capacity of these pathogens to develop drug resistance. Our work suggests that anthelmintic resistance is likely to occur when repeated drug treatment is relied upon to control this group of pathogens. Our results also suggest that resistance mutations should be detectable when modern genome-wide approaches are used to scan the genomes of resistant parasites.
