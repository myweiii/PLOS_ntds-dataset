Our previous studies have revealed that the saliva of the savannah tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans) and the main constituting Tsal proteins are sensitive immunological probes to detect contact with tsetse flies. A nanobody (Nb) library was generated against tsetse salivary gland proteins and used to select Nbs against the highly immunogenic Tsal proteins by a procedure of phage display and selection for binding onto the recombinant Tsal proteins. One Nb family was identified with the appropriate characteristics for the development of a competitive assay to detect Tsal-specific antibodies raised by the mammalian host when exposed to tsetse fly bites. In this immunoassay, exposure was detected by the inhibition of Nb binding by tsetse fly saliva induced antibodies in plasma. Evaluation of the competitive ELISA test using a set of porcine plasmas revealed an improved accuracy as compared to previously described tests. Moreover, the advantage of this assay is that it does not require adaptation to the sampled host species. We propose the Nb-based competitive ELISA as an additional tool to the indirect ELISA to serologically detect tsetse bite exposure and to monitor the impact of vector control programs and to detect re-invasion of cleared areas by tsetse flies on the African continent. In addition, the concept of using Nbs for the development of competitive antibody detection tests is innovative and broadens the scope of medical diagnostic applications of Nbs.
