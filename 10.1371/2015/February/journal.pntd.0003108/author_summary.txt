Schistosomiasis japonica, a zoonosis of over 40 different mammalian species, is endemic to China, the Philippines and Indonesia. In China, water buffaloes have been shown to be major reservoir hosts, while in the Philippines, the smaller sub species (carabao) has been been considered unimportant in transmission, possibly due to the lack of sensitive copro-parasitological techniques employed. We used an exhaustive microscopic technique, the FEA-SD, and a sensitive qPCR assay on a cohort of bovines to assess their potential role in transmission in the Philippines. Both cattle and carabao were highly infected with Schistosoma japonicum and Fasciola gigantic and co-infection was common. The high prevalence and intensity of bovine infection with S. japonicum suggest their heavy involvement in human transmission and that future control programs should target these reservoirs to reduce human infection.
