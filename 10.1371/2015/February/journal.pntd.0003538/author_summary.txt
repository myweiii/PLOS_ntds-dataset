Tropheryma whipplei is a common bacterium carried in feces of young children. Here, using specific PCR, we estimated the prevalence of T. whipplei in 113 feces from 106 children in Vientiane, the Lao PDR (Laos). T. whipplei was detected in 48% (51/106) of children. Eight genotypes were detected, including 7 specific to Laos. Genotype 2, previously detected in Europe, was circulating (21% of positive children) in 2 kindergartens (Chompet and Akad). Genotypes 136 and 138 were specific to Chompet (21% and 15.8%, respectively), whereas genotype 139 was specific to Akad (10.55%). Long regarded as a rare bacterium, now we can affirm that T. whipplei is a widely distributed bacterium, highly prevalent in feces including those from children in Vientiane.
