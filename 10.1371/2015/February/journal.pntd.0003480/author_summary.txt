Screening for gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is traditionally based on detection of trypanosome specific antibodies in blood. Whereas the card agglutination test is particularly suited for mass screening, individual rapid serodiagnostic tests (RDTs) are rather adapted for use in peripheral health-care centres. Two RDTs have been commercialized recently, and we assessed their diagnostic accuracy on stored plasma samples from West Africa. Immune trypanolysis was performed as a laboratory reference test for antibody presence. Although sensitivity for serodiagnosis of HAT in West Africa was high for both RDTs, their specificity was only 88%. Taking into account the high number of false positive test results, combined seropositivity in both RDTs was considered, raising specificity to 93%. Serial application of two RDTs should therefore be considered as an option for passive case finding, especially in settings with low HAT prevalence. A combination of one or two RDTs with immune trypanolysis further improved specificity for HAT to 99%, while maintaining sensitivity at 99% and seems promising for HAT surveillance.
