Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite T. cruzi is a neglected tropical disease widespread in Latin America, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis constitutes a prominent health concern with increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes worldwide. Parasitic infection induced marked metabolic changes, improved insulin resistance, but it increased the triglycerides and cholesterol plasma levels. Our findings demonstrate for the first time a synergic effect between the hepatic damage caused during the steatohepatitis process (generated by a medium fat diet) and the exacerbated inflammation triggered by the chronic parasitic infection, revealing an intense cross-talk between the liver, a metabolically active tissue, and the immune system. We propose that T. cruzi infection must be considered as an additional risk factor for this metabolic disorder. These findings may provide new insight for the American Trypanosomiasis associated with the steatohepatitis.
