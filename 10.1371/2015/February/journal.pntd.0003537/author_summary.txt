The development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis together with chemotherapy would have a great impact in the disease control and elimination. Sm29 and Sm22.6 are two promising antigens that have been associated with resistance to infection/reinfection in humans and also successfully induce protection in trials using C57BL/6 naïve mice. Despite the great results observed in C57BL/6 naïve mice, rSm29 and rSm22.6 ability to induce protection has never been assessed in mice previously exposed to the parasite antigens. In the case of schistosomiasis, this is an important assessment to be done, since the residents of endemic areas, the population mostly affected by the disease, are exposed to several infections through life. Here we evaluated these antigens in immunization trials using mice that had been submitted to a previous infection and treatment with Praziquantel. Both antigens induced a robust immune response triggering both cellular and humoral responses, but only rSm29 was able to induce a significant reduction on parasite burden and increased percentage of CD4+ memory cells. Our date reinforce Sm29 potential to compose an anti-schistosomiasis vaccine.
