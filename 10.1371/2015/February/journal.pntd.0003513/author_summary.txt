Mosquitoes are important vectors in the transmission of many human diseases. Their life cycle requires a blood meal to be completed. Ingested blood contains bioactive molecules belonging to the innate immune defense mechanisms against microbes, like the complement system, that can damage foreign cells. We have identified in this study a mechanism whereby mosquitoes can escape the damaging activity of the complement system in the ingested human blood. The mosquito midgut epithelial cell surface captured factor H, a natural regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, from the ingested blood. Consequently, the deposition of C3b, a key complement component, on the epithelial cell surface was impaired and cell death was avoided. Interfering with the complement regulatory activity of factor H by monoclonal antibodies, carried to the midgut via blood feeding, increased mosquito mortality and reduced fecundity. The putative Anopheles mosquito factor H binding proteins could be transmission blocking vaccine candidates targeting the malaria parasite carrying vectors.
