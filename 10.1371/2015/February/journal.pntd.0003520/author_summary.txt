Dengue is a disease affecting approximately 400 million people annually, especially in tropical and subtropical areas of the globe. The immune response against the dengue virus is still under investigation and it is important to understand why the disease can be fatal in a small proportion of cases. In this work, we explored how an important cell type of the immune system, namely the CD8+ T cell, reacts during dengue infection. Using a method known as flow cytometry, we demonstrated that these cells expand and become highly activated, during the days following the onset of dengue fever symptoms. This expansion is associated with a decreased dengue virus load in the patientsâ€™ blood, suggesting that CD8+ T cells play an important role in viral control. Interestingly, we found that a subset of CD8+ T cells, called effector memory, is greatly expanded during dengue infection. Our results are important because they might contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms during dengue infection and may help in the development of a novel vaccine against dengue.
