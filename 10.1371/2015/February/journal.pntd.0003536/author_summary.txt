Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a disease of animals and people that is caused by the RVF virus. During epidemics, humans get RVF through direct contact with animals or through mosquito bites. In East Africa, epidemics occur every 5â€“15 years following unusually high rainfall. In between epidemics, the transmission of RVF might occur at low level. In an epidemic-free period, we measured whether people in the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania had evidence of past and recent RVF infection in their blood sample, and studied risk factors. Three per cent of people had been infected recently, and 12% had evidence of past infection, with increased risk with age, among milkers and among people eating raw meat. Some people with past or recent infection reported they had not had contact with animals. Households keeping livestock had more members with evidence of past infection. The findings show that people get infected with RVF in between epidemics, and that various types of contact with livestock are important risk factors. There is also evidence that some people get infected with RVFV by mosquitoes in the epidemic free period. Clinicians in the Kilombero Valley should consider RVF in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever.
