Toxoplasmosis is a common parasitic infection and affects one-third of the global population. The burden this figure represents clearly signifies the public health relevance of toxoplasmosis. Epilepsy, another chronic condition, is often caused by a variety of infections that affect numerous low- and middle-income tropical countriesâ€”including toxoplasmosis. Earlier meta-analysis found only three studies and reported a 4.8-fold greater risk of epilepsy. This had many limitations, as discussed in this paper, our estimate is rather more robust, based on a higher number of studies, and corrects deficiencies that were present previously.
