Treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness) suffers from a shortage of medicines that are both effective, especially against the second (late) stage of the disease, and safe for patients. The development of new HAT medicines also has been significantly influenced by the perceived need for easily administered oral medicines to reduce the need for hospitalization of patients in resource-poor settings where HAT typically occurs. However, the clinical status of second stage patients is likely to dictate the need for their hospitalization, thus both oral and parenterally administered medicines would be utilised effectively. Therefore, in an effort to develop new medicines that meet efficacy and safety requirements, we evaluated a novel injectable diamidine 2,5-bis(5-amidino-2-pyridyl)furan (DB829; CPD-0802) and its oral prodrug formulation 2,5-bis[5-(N-methoxyamidino)-2-pyridyl]furan (DB868) in the vervet monkey model of second stage HAT. Treatment with either compound was initiated 28 days post-infection of monkeys with T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 2537. DB829 was dosed at 5 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, 5 mg/kg/day every other day for 5 doses or 2.5 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days intramuscularly (IM) while DB868 was administered at 20, 10 or 3 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days orally. Clinical and parasitological monitoring was carried out for at least 300 days before the monkeys were declared cured. All IM DB829 and oral DB868 dose regimens were well tolerated. In addition, all monkeys (5/5) treated with IM DB829 were confirmed cured. In contrast, oral DB868 cured only 1/4 monkeys at either 10 or 20 mg/kg and did not cure any monkey when dosed at 3 mg/kg. These results indicate that IM DB829 is a suitable compound for further development as treatment for second stage HAT.
