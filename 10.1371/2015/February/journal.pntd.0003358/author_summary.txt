Rhodnius prolixus is an important vector of Chagas disease. The development of insecticide resistance in triatomines has raised the need for new control methods. We propose, as a proof-of-concept, the use of symbiotic bacteria expressing dsRNA in a paratransgenic approach to control vector-borne disease. We first show that ingestion of E. coli, producing long dsRNA specific for R. prolixus genes, can produce systemic RNAi in this insect. By targeting genes with antioxidant function (RHBP and catalase), we show that RNAi effects on nymphs and adult females are systemic and temporal, affecting development and fecundity. Finally, we show that the natural vector symbiont, R. rhodnii, also can be modified to induce systemic RNA interference. The E. coli system can serve to screen potential targets for development of a symbiont-based vector control product that then can be transferred to R. rhodnii.
