Visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. The disease is fatal if not treated and there is no vaccine available for human use. In the search for potential antigens, the protective ability of conserved parasite protein families such as L. infantum histones (HIS) and acidic ribosomal (LiP0) antigens were successfully tested in the mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here, we evaluate HIS and LiP0 antigens using two different immunization strategies in the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis. Hamsters are highly susceptible to L. infantum infection and we demonstrate that immunization with LiP0, but not HIS, protects against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis. Immunization with LiP0 was able to induce an increased expression of IFN-γ in detriment of IL-10 and TGF-β in the draining lymph node before infection creating an inhospitable environment for parasite growth. Following challenge, a reduced parasite load in the lymph node, spleen and liver of LiP0 immunized hamsters was detected five months after challenge. These findings suggest that LiP0 used in a DNA formulation could be considered a potential component in a vaccine formulation against visceral leishmaniasis.
