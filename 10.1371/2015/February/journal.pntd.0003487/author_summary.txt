Rickettsial diagnosis is challenging in routine laboratory. Serology offers only retrospective diagnosis. We aimed to introduce molecular methods in routine diagnosis of these infections. The lack of standardized methods led us to compare real time PCR assays previously reported in order to implement a clear strategies for diagnosis of these infections in our laboratory. Real time PCR proposed by Renvois√© et al includes two PCRs, one to detect spotted fever group and another to detect typhus group Rickettsiae. The real time PCR proposed by Giullieri et al includes a first PCR detecting 16rDNA of all Rickettsiae and if it is positive a second PCR detecting R. typhi should be performed. This second Real time PCR was shown to offer a slight higher sensitivity with a lower cost in our study. Skin biopsy specimens were more likely to show positive results than whole blood samples. Finally, positivity rates were higher among patients presenting at the first stage of the disease, essentially with negative serology.
