Schistosomiasis japonica is one of the most serious parasitic diseases in China. It is estimated that more than 50 million people are still at risk, especially those living in the lake and marshland areas along the Yangtze River Basin. The Chinese government has made great efforts to implement schistosomiasis control programs since 1950s. The latest, major two programs are the 10-year World Bank Loan Project (WBLP) terminated in 2001, which was based on large-scale chemotherapy, and the national integrated control strategy implemented since 2005, which was aimed at reducing the roles of bovines and humans as infection sources. Based on spatio-temporal analyses of the S. japonicum infection prevalence data during 2000â€“2010 in Anhui Province, we found schistosomiasis prevalence remained at a low level but the spatial distribution of the disease became widely scattered at the later stage of the study period, suggesting that the integrated program could not fully effectively reduce the spatial extent of schistosomiasis risk. To achieve an effective and sustainable control strategy, we emphasize the need to control snail habitats within areas of high schistosomiasis risk.
