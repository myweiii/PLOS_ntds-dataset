The colonization and dispersal of disease vectors in new and expanding urban areas pose important health risks. The population and demographic dynamics of these vectors are often unclear, and their temporal and spatial associations with urbanization are unknown. Here, we use molecular markers to describe the genetic structure of populations of T. infestans, an important vector of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, in an expanding urban environment. Samples were obtained along a transect in Arequipa, Peru, that includes old, well-developed communities and new communities characterized by rudimentarily constructed houses. We assessed the clustering of subpopulations and the effect of distance, sampling year, and city block on genetic distance among pairs of insects. Our analyses show that streets represent an important barrier to the colonization and dispersion of T. infestans in Arequipa. The genetic data describe a T. infestans infestation history characterized by persistent local dispersal and occasional long-distance migration events that partially parallels the history of urban development.
