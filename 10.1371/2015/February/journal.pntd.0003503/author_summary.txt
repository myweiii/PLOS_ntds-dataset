Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin and subcutaneous tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and is the third most common mycobacterial infection, behind tuberculosis and leprosy, world-wide. In recent years, the World Health Organisation has modified its guidelines for M. ulcerans treatment, moving from predominantly surgical to predominantly medical based management. It now recommends the combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin for a period of eight weeks as first-line therapy, with surgery as adjunctive therapy if necessary. The Barwon Health experience from south-eastern Australia has demonstrated that the entirely oral combination of rifampicin with either ciprofloxacin or clarithromycin for eight weeks can be an effective treatment option. However, these antibiotics are often toxic leading to early cessation, especially in the elderly. In addition, clinicians have been using a shorter duration of therapy for smaller lesions that have also been surgically managed. This study reviews our experience treating M. ulcerans with antibiotic durations of less than 8 weeks and demonstrates that successful outcomes can be achieved in selected patients, with success rates influenced by the duration of treatment and the use of surgical excision. This finding needs confirmation in further studies, but could have significant benefits in terms of reducing toxicity and improving adherence associated with Buruli ulcer antibiotic treatment.
