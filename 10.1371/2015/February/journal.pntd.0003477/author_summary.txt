According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the clinical diagnosis of BU should be reconfirmed by at least two laboratory techniques. However, out of the four currently available tests, three (PCR, histopathology and cultivation of M. ulcerans) can only be performed at centralized reference laboratories; the fourth (microscopic detection of acid fast bacilli) lacks the required sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, a simple tool for early diagnosis of the disease, which can be implemented in rural health care facilities of the endemic countries, is of urgent need. In this study we aimed at the identification of M. ulcerans proteins as potential targets for the development of a simple and rapid diagnostic antigen detection assay. Among 36 proteins, MUL_3720 best met the predefined criteria of being highly expressed by M. ulcerans and not having orthologs in other pathogenic mycobacterial species prevalent in the endemic regions. Here we generated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against this protein and carried out pilot studies for the development of an antigen capture-based diagnostic test.
