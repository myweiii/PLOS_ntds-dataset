Paracoccidioidomycosis is one of the most prevalent systemic mycoses in Latin America, and still poses a significant threat to the health of human hosts, especially those with an impaired immune system. Early and accurate diagnosis is mandatory for the implementation of effective treatment. Currently, most of the diagnostic tests are not simple to implement in areas where laboratory infrastructure or trained personnel are not available. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple and inexpensive assay for use in latex agglutination tests based on the P. brasiliensis-specific antigen gp43 or monoclonal antibody (mAb17c) anti-gp43 coupled to latex particles in order to detect both circulating antigens and antibodies in sera, cerebrospinal fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Our results show that PCM can be diagnosed with high sensitivity and specificity in less than 10 min using these tools. In addition, the latex test demonstrated its applicability in the follow-up of PCM patients during antimycotic therapy. The diagnostic accuracy, low cost, and simplicity of this fast test makes it an attractive serological assay that can be implemented in endemic areas with remote access, in laboratories with limited infrastructure, and/or to the community health agents trained to use it in rural areas.
