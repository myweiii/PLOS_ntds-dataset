Leishmania are protozoan parasites that infect humans and replicate intracellularly in macrophages, cells normally engaged in protecting the host from pathogens. These parasites have several strategies to survive inside the hostile environment of the host macrophage, and one of these strategies involves heme acquisition. Heme is an iron-containing molecule that is essential for many cellular functions. Unlike mammalian cells, Leishmania parasites cannot synthesize heme, so must acquire it from the host cell. In earlier work we found that the parasites express a surface protein, LHR1, which transports heme into the parasites. In this study we identified specific amino acids in LHR1 that are required for heme transport. When expressed in yeast cells, LHR1 carrying these mutations had defects in heme transport that were equivalent to the inhibition in virulence observed when these proteins were expressed in Leishmania and tested in macrophage and mouse infection assays. These critical amino acids do not exist in the human heme transporter, indicating that LHR1 is a promising target for the development of specific drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis and possibly other serious parasitic diseases, such as Chagasâ€™ disease and sleeping sickness.
