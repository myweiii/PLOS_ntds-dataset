There is an urgent need for new interventions and novel insecticides to control mosquito vectors of human disease agents. Nanoparticle-based strategies have been explored extensively as means to deliver a molecule of interest for medical applications (e.g., antigens, drugs, nucleic acids, etc.) to particular tissues and cells in mammalian systems. Our particular application of interest is to use nanoparticles as a platform to deliver nucleic-acid based mosquitocidal molecules. As a first step to developing nanoparticle delivery for molecular vector control, we investigated the physicochemical properties of PRINT hydrogel nanoparticles with respect to their biodistribution, persistence and safety in Anopheles gambiae mosquito larvae and in cell culture. This technology could be applied to studies of pathobiology and physiology in any vector species, with the benefit that the particles can be tailored to move to and target specific delivery of a cargo to a particular organ system and even sub-cellular location. Therefore, this technology and specific information about where the particles go and with what affinity sets the stage of describing a platform that has tremendous potential use in vector control and disease transmission intervention.
