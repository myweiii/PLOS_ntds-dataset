Anopheles gambiae eggs were kindly provided by the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4) (http://www.mr4.org). We would like to thank Drs. Bryan Bellaire, Michael J Wannemuehler and Balaji Narasimhan for providing access to confocal microscope and in vivo imager at Iowa State University. Technical assistance in mosquito husbandry from Heather Adolfs, Kinsey Edmunds, Emily Howard, Michael Nazarchyck and Meghan Muscato was critical to this work.
