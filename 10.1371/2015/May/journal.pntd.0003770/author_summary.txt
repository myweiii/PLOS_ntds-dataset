Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects more than 10 million people in Latin America. In the chronic phase, a lethal complication may develop: Chronic Chagasic Cardiomyopathy. In this condition the vascular lining, the endothelium, is involved and participates in disease progression. Benznidazole is the current treatment for Chagas disease. However, other useful drugs could be added to Chagas disease chemotherapy to improve associated processes such as endothelial dysfunction, thus decreasing length and adverse events of the conventional therapy. Simvastatin, a drug that decreases blood cholesterol, also has anti-inflammatory effects and improves endothelial function. Thus, we studied the effect of simvastatin and benznidazole on endothelial cells and their relation with the production 15-epi-lipoxin A4, an anti-inflammatory molecule. We found that simvastatin and benznidazole decreased endothelial activation since they reduced the adhesion of inflammatory cells. Simvastatin and benznidazole inhibited NFÎºB pathway, which is pro-inflammatory and in the case of simvastatin, this effect was mediated by the production of 15-epi-lipoxin A4. Thus, we provide the bases that support the future use of simvastatin in the treatment of cardiac Chagas disease.
