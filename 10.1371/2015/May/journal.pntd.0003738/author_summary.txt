The introduction of RDTs is one of the major advancements in leishmaniasis control programs. While the variability in performance from one endemic region to the other is well recognized, the utilization of these RDTs in the routine clinical setting has not been evaluated to date. In this study, we showed that the RDT use in routine practice setting has large deviations from the guidelines. Clinical suspicion of VL should be based on the full criteria of case definition as is recommended in the guidelines and the presence of the criteria should be checked by clinicians before requesting the RDT. Not respecting these clinical criteria can lead to low pretest probability of the disease and eventually low positive predictive value of the test used. Additionally, introducing regular monitoring activities with training and quality assurance system for leishmania RDTs is very important.
