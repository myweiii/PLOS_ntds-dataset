Chagas disease causes significant morbidity and mortality throughout Central and South America. The epidemiology and control of this disease is subject to unique regional particularities, including the behavior and ecology of the local insect vector species. Significant resources have been allocated towards research and control efforts in southern Peru, yet very little is known about the prevalence and epidemiology of Trypanosoma cruzi in northern Peru. Our study highlights significant T. cruzi infection in northern Peru and is one of the first to document substantial transmission by the insect Panstrongylus lignarius. Our results illustrate major gaps in knowledge and the need for public health interventions targeted at Chagas disease in the region of Cutervo Province of northern Peru.
