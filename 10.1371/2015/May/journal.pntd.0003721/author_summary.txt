Parasitic infections are extremely common worldwide and children are especially vulnerable to these infections during critical periods of growth and development. There is a paucity of information about how frequently very young children (under the age of five years) are infected with parasites and the effects of parasitic infections on their growth and development. The findings from this study reveal that not only does infection occur early in life; it is associated with decreases in physical growth, even with low overall prevalence for some parasites. Decreases in growth of weight, length and head circumference during the first 36 months of life were associated with hookworm, Ascaris, E. histolytica, malaria and Schistosoma infection. In a subset analysis of 180 children who followed up at every visit through 24 months, infection with any parasite was associated with decelerations in weight, length and head circumference growth velocity. Multiple infections were associated with greater impairment of linear growth. It seems worthwhile to pursue a better understanding of prevalence and effects of parasitic infection in this vulnerable group to effectively target therapeutic interventions. And finally, if parasite transmission is to be significantly disrupted, control programs targeting these young, usually asymptomatic, age groups may be critical.
