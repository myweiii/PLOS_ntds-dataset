Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne pathogen for which the majority of infections have been considered to result in febrile illness. We sought to characterize the proportion of subclinical and symptomatic CHIKV infections in a prospective cohort of subjects ≥6 months old who underwent active surveillance for acute febrile illness from 2012–13 in Cebu City, Philippines. Symptomatic CHIKV infections were detected by PCR and/or ELISA in acute/convalescent blood samples. Subclinical infections were identified by neutralizing antibody seroconversion between enrollment and 12-month visits without symptomatic infection. Among 853 subjects who completed all study activities at 12 months, 19 symptomatic and 87 subclinical infections occurred (2.19 and 10.03 per 100 person-years, respectively). A positive baseline CHIKV PRNT titer was associated with 100% (95%CI: 46.1, 100.0) protection from symptomatic infection. Phylogenetic analysis showed Asian genotype closely related to strains from the recent Caribbean epidemic. These findings can help to assess disease burden, understand virus transmission, and support vaccine development.
