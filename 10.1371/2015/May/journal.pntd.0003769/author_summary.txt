The geographical distribution of helminth infections, which are highly prevalent in many areas, overlaps considerably with regions of high HIV sero-prevalence. The highest burden of infection is found in resource-poor settings, making it unattractive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest. Limited available treatment options and drug-resistance are increasing problems for soil-transmitted helminths, whereas for some other helminth infections, such as for the blood-dwelling microfilariae, effective and safe treatment options are still far from being optimal. Limited evidence suggests antihelminthic effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. We aimed to investigate whether ART or cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CTX-P) reduces prevalence of helminth infection in HIV-infected individuals attending a primary HIV clinic in a semi-rural area in Gabon. The most important finding of our study was that the use of CTX-P was associated with a reduced prevalence of Loa loa microfilaremia. ART use was not associated with a reduced prevalence of helminth infections. Additional studies are needed to assess the effects of CTX on helminth infections, as this might be a promising safe and effective drug adding to the limited repertoire of anthelminthic drugs.
