    "Introduction": "Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a complex zoonosis, transmitted by more than 130 triatomine species and sustained by over 70 genera of mammalian reservoir hosts. T. cruzi has a broad endemic range that extends from the Southern United States to Argentinean Patagonia. The human infection, which may lead to Chagas disease, is the most important parasitic infection in Latin America with serious consequences for public health and national economies.\nThe diversity of the T. cruzi genome is well recognized [1\u20133]. Designation of ecologically and epidemiologically relevant groups for T. cruzi has oscillated between a few discrete groups [4] and many [5]. Currently, six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) are defined [2]. In 2009, these DTUs were renamed by consensus as TcI\u2013TcVI [6]. Several reviews already describe how these DTUs correspond with former nomenclatures and with prospective biological and host associations [6\u20138]. All six DTUs are known to be infective to humans and to cause Chagas disease. Further, in patients infected with DTU mixtures, different tissue distribution has been detected [9\u201311]. Recently a new genotype associated with anthropogenic bats (TcBat) has been detected in Brazil, Panama and Colombia and awaits further characterization for definitive DTU assignment [12\u201314].\nThe standardized nomenclature for T. cruzi DTUs should improve scientific communication and guide future research on comparative epidemiology and pathology. However, a straightforward and reproducible DTU genotyping strategy is still required. Numerous approaches have been proposed to characterize the biochemical and genetic diversity of T. cruzi isolates [15\u201323] with variable levels of complexity, selectivity and analytical sensitivity. Due to sensitivity constraints, most of these strategies have been applied only to cultured stocks and not directly to biological or clinical samples. Thus, their results may have underestimated parasite diversity due to possible strain selection during culture expansion [24\u201325]. Some methods require multiple sequential conventional PCR reactions, PCR-RFLP, hybridization or post-PCR sequencing steps; these tests are cumbersome and time-consuming, and their results are often difficult to interpret. Accordingly, we aimed to develop a novel multiplex Real-Time PCR method using TaqMan probes, allowing distinction of the six DTUs in a few steps not only from cultured stocks but also from a high proportion of biological and clinical samples.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Biological Samples\nReference strains: Genomic DNA from a panel of reference stocks representative of the 6 T. cruzi DTUs, Trypanosoma rangeli and Leishmania spp. was used for analytical validation of the assay (Table 1).\nClinical specimens: A total of 132 clinical samples were included in the study: one tissue sample and 131 peripheral blood samples obtained from acute T. cruzi infected patients (AI, n = 13), asymptomatic (ACD, n = 64) and symptomatic (SCD, n = 27, 19 cardiac, 5 digestive and 3 mixed disease patients) chronic Chagas disease patients, congenitally infected children (CI, n = 16), and from adult patients with clinical reactivation in the context of immunosuppression (RCD, n = 11) (S1 Table).\nTriatomine samples: A total of 104 triatomine derived samples were included in the study: 16 culture isolates and 88 direct samples (38 abdomen/midgut samples and 50 feces/urine samples collected on filter paper) from infected bugs (S2 Table).\nMammalian reservoir samples: A total of 71 samples obtained from T. cruzi reservoirs were included in the study: 27 culture isolates and 44 direct samples (38 peripheral blood samples and 6 heart explants) from mammalian reservoirs (S3 Table).\n\n\nEthics Statement\nThe study with human samples was approved by the ethical committees of the participating institutions (Comit\u00e9 de Bioseguridad del INLASA, Ministerio de Salud de Bolivia; Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica en Investigaci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Granada; Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica de Investigaci\u00f3n del Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica de M\u00e9xico; Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica del Hospital Italiano; Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9tica del Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Favaloro; Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9tica del Instituto de Medicina Regional de la Universidad Nacional del Nordeste; Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9tica de la provincia de Jujuy), following the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consents were obtained from the adult patients and from parents/guardians on behalf of all children participants.\n\n\nDNA Extraction\nPreparation of DNA from biological specimens was done according to the type of sample and the operating procedures followed by the laboratories from which DNA aliquots were obtained (S1\u2013S3 Tables). At our laboratory, peripheral blood and tissue samples were processed using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Germany) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Triatomine feces impregnated on filter paper and abdomen samples were processed as reported [42].\n\n\nConventional PCR Based Discrete Typing Unit Genotyping\nIdentification of T. cruzi DTUs was assessed using a conventional PCR algorithm for DTU genotyping, based on the amplification of three nuclear loci, the spliced leader intergenic region (SL-IR), the 24S\u03b1-ribosomal DNA (24S\u03b1-rDNA) and the A10 fragment, as reported [11,17]. Analytical sensitivity for these methods was described in Burgos et al. (2007) [17]: SL-IRac PCR: 1 pg, SL-IR I PCR: 5 pg, SL-IR II PCR: 5 pg, 24S\u03b1-rDNA PCR: 100 fg, and A10 PCR: 1\u201310 pg DNA per reaction tube.\n\n\nTaqMan Probes and Primer Design\nMultiple sequence alignments of the T. cruzi SL-IR, cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII), 18S ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA) and 24S\u03b1-rDNA genes were performed using the ClustalW algorithm in MEGA 5.2 software [43]. Reference sequences were retrieved from the GenBank database. The PrimerQuest and OligoAnalyzer tools (provided online at the website http://www.idtdna.com) were used for the final design of specific primers and probes (Table 2). To minimize nonspecific detection, the oligonucleotides were compared with all relevant sequences using the BLAST database search program (provided online from the National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]).\n\n\nMultiplex Real-Time PCR Assays\nA Real-Time PCR flowchart for identification of T. cruzi DTUs in biological samples using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR) is shown in Fig 1. Oligonucleotide concentration and sequence information is detailed in Table 2. TaqMan probes were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (USA). SL-IR and 18S-COII MTq-PCR assays were carried out using 1X QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit (QIAGEN, USA), while the 24S\u03b1-III/IV MTq-PCR used 1X FastStart Universal Probe Master (Roche, Germany). All PCR reactions were carried out with 2 \u03bcL of resuspended DNA in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. Optimal cycling conditions for the SL-IR and 18S-COII MTq-PCR assays were initially 15 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min in an Applied Biosystems (ABI 7500, USA) device. In turn, optimal cycling condition for the 24S\u03b1-III/IV reaction was an initial cycle of 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec and 57\u00b0C for 1 min in a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett, UK) device.\nSL-IR, spliced leader intergenic region; 18S, 18S-ribosomal ADN; COII, cytochrome oxidase II; 24S\u03b1, 24S\u03b1-ribosomal DNA; MTq, multiplex TaqMan Real-Time PCR.\n\n\nAnalytical Performance of the Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays\nIn order to characterize the performance of the MTq-PCR, several analytical parameters were determined [40].\nThe inclusivity of the assays was evaluated using 0.05\u20135 ng/\u03bcL of genomic DNA obtained from a panel of 39 T. cruzi stocks belonging to the six DTUs from different geographic origins (Table 1). On the other hand, 1\u20135 ng/\u03bcL of genomic DNA obtained from T. rangeli, L. major, L. amazonensis, L. brasiliensis and L. mexicana, was used to assess the specificity of the assays. Specificity was also tested using human DNA from a seronegative patient as template.\nAnalytical sensitivity and reaction efficiency were evaluated using 2-fold, 10-fold and 100-fold serial dilutions spanning 1 \u03bcg to 1 fg of genomic DNA per reaction tube obtained from T. cruzi stocks belonging to different DTUs, depending on the assay. Moreover, in the case of TcI, four stocks representing TcIa, TcIb, TcId and TcIe genotypes based on the polymorphism of the SL-IR gene were analyzed [30]. In addition, in the case of TcIV, DNA from strains representing populations from South America (TcIV-SA) and North America (TcIV-NA) were used [46]. Each concentration was tested in duplicate.",
    "Results": "Analytical Performance of the Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays\nFig 1 illustrates the MTq-PCR flowchart designed to distinguish among the six T. cruzi DTUs.\nInclusivity and specificity results are shown in Table 3. T. cruzi I, including stocks representing SL-IR genotypes TcIa, TcIb, TcId and TcIe, were detected by the FAM fluorescence signal in the SL-IR MTq-PCR assay and did not amplify in the downstream reactions of the flowchart. The TcII/V/VI group was detected with the HEX-labeled probe in the SL-IR MTq-PCR. The 18S-COII MTq-PCR assay distinguished TcII (FAM + Cy5 signals) from TcV (HEX signal) and TcVI (FAM signal only). There were two groups of TcIII strains, one group reacted only with the SL-IR TcIII-Quasar670 probe, and the other one composed by three strains (from Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina), reacted with both TcIII-Quasar670 and TcIV-CAL Fluor Red610 SL-IR probes. Thus, the latter group of strains was identified as TcIII after a second round of amplification using the 24S\u03b1-FAM probe. CAL Fluor Red610 and HEX fluorescence signals were detected when the assay contained DNA from TcIV-SA and TcIV-NA strains in the SL-IR and the 24S\u03b1-III/IV MTq-PCR assays, respectively.\nTcV was amplified and detected with the FAM probe in the 24S\u03b1-III/IV MTq-PCR assay. Besides, TcIII and TcIV were also detected with the 18S-HEX probe in the 18S-COII MTq-PCR. Specificity of the MTq-PCR was not affected since all these DTUs are confirmed in a previous stage.\nOn the other hand, MTq-PCR was tested with purified DNA from T. rangeli, L. amazonensis, L. major and L. mexicana stocks and from a seronegative patient. No detectable fluorescence signals were obtained for any of them, indicating the specificity of the assays (Table 3).\nAnalytical sensitivity and reaction efficiency were estimated separately for each of the three MTq-PCR reactions using genomic DNA from reference stocks representing the six T. cruzi DTUs: TcIa (K98), TcIb (Cas16), TcId (G), TcIe (PALV1 cl1), TcII (Tu18), TcIII (M5631), TcIV-SA (CanIII), TcIV-NA (Griffin), TcV (PAH265) and TcVI (CL-Brener). The SL-IR MTq-PCR yielded a positive result starting from 1 fg DNA/reaction tube of TcI reference strains with an efficiency (Eff) of 108% (TcIa), 104% (TcIb), 99% (TcId) and 98% (TcIe). Similar sensitivity was obtained for strains representing TcII (Eff: 90%) and TcIII (Eff: 97%). In the cases of TcIV-SA, TcV and TcVI, sensitivity was lower (1 pg DNA/reaction tube) with Eff of 80%, 88% and 86%, respectively (Fig 2). The 18S-COII MTq-PCR reaction rendered a sensitivity of 100 fg DNA/reaction tube for strains representing TcV (Eff: 82%) and TcVI (Eff: 83%) and 1 pg DNA/reaction tube for TcII (Eff: 77% and 70% using the 18S-FAM and the COII-Cy5, respectively) (Fig 3A). The 24S\u03b1-III/IV MTq-PCR method was capable of detecting 100 fg DNA/reaction tube of the TcIII (Eff: 92%) and TcIV-SA (Eff: 81%) stocks, whereas TcIV-NA was detected at concentrations \u2265 1 ng/reaction tube (Eff: 78%) (Fig 3B).\nX-axis represents serial dilutions of whole genomic DNA from each stock and Y-axis represents the obtained Ct value.

From one RCD patient, more than one sample (blood and skin biopsy samples) was available for analysis. The AI group included 10 peripheral blood samples from people who acquired the infection in oral outbreaks in the Amazon region of Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia and French Guiana; one sample from a vector-transmitted acute patient from Chiapas, Mexico; and two samples from patients who acquired T. cruzi infection due to organ transplantation. The MTq-PCR was able to characterize DTUs in all AI samples, in total agreement with the conventional techniques, confirming 5 TcI and 6 TcIV cases (Table 4 and S1 Table). In two samples, conventional PCR was not able to discriminate between pure TcV infections or a mixture of TcV plus TcVI. However, the MTq-PCR confirmed TcV, allowing exclusion of TcVI (Table 4 and S1 Table).\nThe DTUs present in 10 out of 16 (62.5%) peripheral blood samples analyzed from CI children could be identified by the MTq-PCR. Results were clearly consistent with those obtained by the conventional strategies, confirming 1 TcI and 4 TcV infections (Table 4 and S1 Table). In 4 samples, conventional PCR was not able to discriminate between pure TcV infections or a mixture of TcV plus TcVI. However, the MTq-PCR confirmed TcV in two cases, classified one as an indeterminate TcII/V/VI sample, and classified the remaining one as a mixed infection of TcV plus TcVI. Furthermore, one sample that was classified as indeterminate TcII/V/VI using the conventional PCR algorithm was classified as TcVI using the MTq-PCR (Table 4 and S1 Table).\nEleven peripheral blood samples and one skin biopsy sample from RCD patients were analyzed and six (50%) could be genotyped by MTq-PCR, confirming three as infected with TcI populations (Table 4 and S1 Table). In one sample, conventional PCR was not able to discriminate between pure TcV or a mixture of TcV plus TcVI. However, MTq-PCR confirmed TcV and excluded TcVI. Additionally, the skin biopsy sample was classified as doubtful TcII/VI by the conventional PCR, but MTq-PCR confirmed the presence of TcII DNA. On the other hand, T. cruzi populations in the peripheral blood sample of the above mentioned patient were confirmed as belonging to TcII by the conventional method and classified as indeterminate TcII/VI by MTq-PCR (Table 4 and S1 Table).\nA low proportion of chronic Chagas disease patients\u2019 samples (32.8% ACD and 22.2% SCD) could be characterized by the MTq-PCR, and most of them were typed as TcI (n = 25), in full accordance with conventional typing (Table 4 and S1 Table). In one sample, conventional PCR was not able to discriminate between pure TcV infection or a mixture of TcV plus TcVI. However, TaqMan PCR confirmed TcV and eliminated TcVI. On the other hand, another sample was confirmed as TcVI by the conventional PCR method and classified as indeterminate TcII/VI by the MTq-PCR (Table 4 and S1 Table).\n\nTriatomine samples.A total of 104 samples (88 direct samples and 16 culture isolates) obtained from urine, feces and tissue (midgut/abdomen) specimens from triatomines were processed. The MTq-PCR gave positive results in 80.7% and 93.8% of direct samples and isolated cultures, respectively, confirming 54 TcI, 1 TcII, 2 TcIII and 8 TcIV (Tables 4 and S2). Overall typed vector samples, two indeterminate TcIII (or TcIII plus TcI) and one TcV (or TcV plus TcVI) specimens by the conventional methods were confirmed as TcIII, TcI and TcV, respectively, by the MTq-PCR (Tables 4 and S2).\n\nReservoir samples.The study included 71 samples (44 direct samples and 27 culture isolates) obtained from peripheral blood and tissue specimens from mammal reservoirs of T. cruzi, most of which were successfully typified by MTq-PCR (100% of culture isolates and 93.2% of direct samples), confirming 28 TcI, 16 TcIII and 1 TcIV (Tables 4 and S3). Six TcVI samples obtained from peripheral blood of Canis familiaris were classified as indeterminate TcII/VI by MTq-PCR (Tables 4 and S3).\n\nAnalysis of mixed infections.In clinical samples, a mixed infection by TcI plus TcII/V/VI found in a SCD patient gave no amplification after SL-IR MTq-PCR, probably because of its very low parasitic load [47].\nDetection of DTU-mixed infections in vector samples revealed a complex situation, in which MTq-PCR succeeded in resolving six out of 16 mixtures previously characterized by the conventional PCR tests; nine were characterized as single infections and one gave negative results (Tables 4 and S2). On the other hand, three samples that were classified as inconclusive TcIII (or TcIII plus TcI) using conventional PCR were classified as mixed infections using MTq-PCR (2 TcIII plus TcIV and 1 TcI plus TcIII/IV) (Tables 4 and S2).\nIn the case of reservoir samples, MTq-PCR confirmed one case of TcI plus TcII mixed infection but failed to resolve 17 other mixed infections previously characterized in Didelphis virginiana, Macaca fascicularis, Canis familiaris and Felis catus by conventional PCR (Tables 4 and S3).",
    "Discussion": "As a consequence of the standardized nomenclature for the six T. cruzi DTUs having been ratified by a committee of experts [6], it became imperative to develop a reliable genotyping strategy that could be adopted by the research community [8]. Throughout the past years, several typing schemes have been developed. A PCR assay system based on the amplification of particular regions of the SL gene and 24S\u03b1-rDNA [44] and 18S rDNA [48] was first proposed [15] in which the size polymorphisms of the amplification products were suitable for T. cruzi assignment into each of the six DTUs. A multilocus PCR-RFLP analysis of genetic polymorphism of 12 loci also was proposed for DTU genotyping [16]. Additionally, a three-marker sequential typing strategy was proposed consisting of PCR amplification of the 24S\u03b1-rDNA and PCR-RFLP of the heat shock protein 60 and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase loci [18]. Yeo et al. (2011) and Lauthier et al. (2012) designed Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) schemes in which sequence information of 4 to 10 single copy housekeeping genes allowed the resolution of the six DTUs [21\u201322]. A recent assay that uses a single copy gene (TcSC5D) followed by two RFLP reactions has been reported [23]. However, most of the above mentioned assays are complex to perform and have been applied only to cultured parasites. Another scheme using nested-hot-start PCR assays allows direct DTU typing in biological [25, 49] and clinical [11, 17] samples but requires between 3 and 9 sequential PCR reactions.\nTo overcome these difficulties we developed a novel MTq-PCR approach that identifies the six T. cruzi DTUs in a single or two sequential reactions with adequate sensitivity to analyze different types of biological samples, such as those derived from triatomine vectors and different type of wildlife, livestock, pets and human tissues. The Real-Time format reduces PCR associated contamination and is amenable to quantification, automation and kit production. A first round allows distinction of TcI strains from those belonging to TcIII/IV or TcII/V/VI groups, which are discriminated after a second MTq-PCR round. The method was inclusive for a panel of 39 T. cruzi stocks. In particular, the TcI primer/probe set was inclusive for all TcI SL-IR genotypes [30], and the TcIV primer/probe set was inclusive for TcIV strains from South and North America [46]. Besides, the test did not recognize human, T. rangeli and Leishmania spp. DNAs.\nMTq-PCR methods showed an analytical sensitivity ranging from 1 fg to 1 pg DNA per reaction tube depending on the DTU being analyzed. As an exception, TcIV-NA was detected at concentrations \u2265 1 ng/reaction tube by the 24S\u03b1-III/IV MTq-PCR. The analytical sensitivity for the conventional PCR scheme used in this study was reported in Burgos et al. (2007) [17] and ranged from 100 fg to 10 pg DNA per reaction tube depending on the reaction and the DTU under analysis. Thus, both PCR algorithms used in the present study showed similar ranges of sensitivity when compared at analytical levels.Out of 210 biological samples that could be typed by both algorithms, 24 (11.4%) gave inconclusive TcII/V/VI, TcII/VI, TcV (or TcV plus TcVI) and TcIII (or TcIII plus TcI) results by either conventional or MTq-PCR. In nine samples, conventional PCR was not able to discriminate between single TcV infection and a mixture of TcV plus TcVI. However, MTq-PCR confirmed TcV in seven of these samples thanks to specific detection of the 18S-HEX probe. One sample, typed as TcII/V/VI by conventional PCR, could be resolved as TcII/VI by MTq-PCR. Furthermore, an indeterminate TcII/VI and 2 TcIII (or TcIII plus TcI) samples were confirmed as TcII, TcI and TcIII, respectively, by MTq-PCR (S1\u2013S3 Tables). On the other hand, 7 TcVI and one TcII samples typed by the conventional PCR algorithm were classified as indeterminate TcII/VI by the MTq-PCR (S1\u2013S3 Tables).\nFinally, both algorithms confirmed mixed infections in one patient from Jujuy, Argentina (TcV plus TcVI), in one cat from Mexico (TcI plus TcII) and in several sylvatic vector species, such as TcI plus TcIII, TcI plus TcIV and TcIII plus TcIV (S1\u2013S3 Tables). In general the MTq-PCR detected mixed infections in a lesser extent than the conventional PCR scheme. Oligonucleotide interactions, competition for reagents, different amplification efficiency of the targets, and accumulation of amplicons of the predominant target that inhibit Taq polymerase are factors that might be involved.\nThe MTq-PCR test was less sensitive than conventional PCR algorithm for direct typing of peripheral blood samples of a proportion of chronic Chagas disease patients harboring low parasite loads. We have evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the assay using mixtures of T. cruzi DNA with DNA extracted from human blood from non-infected subjects and no differences in analytical sensitivity were found (S1 Fig). This suggests that the lower clinical sensitivity of the assay in blood samples would not be due to inhibitory substances present in the samples. In some human cases tested in this study, we can not discard some DNA degradation with respect to the period where the extracts were analyzed using conventional PCR algorithm [50].\nThe findings herein obtained, promote MTq-PCR as a valuable laboratory tool for distinction of T. cruzi DTUs. It appears adequate in surveillance and identification of outbreaks sources [51] or to follow-up acute infections of seronegative recipients that receive infected organs from seropositive donors [52]."
