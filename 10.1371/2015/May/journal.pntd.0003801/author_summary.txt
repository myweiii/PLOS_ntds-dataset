Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting 200 million people in the poorest areas of the world. To date no vaccine exists against this parasitosis, and the only possible cure relies on the use of the one available drug, praziquantel. Praziquantel is a safe and effective drug active against adult worms in a single dose administration. However the increasing threat of emerging resistance makes the search for novel drugs a compelling priority. S. mansoni possesses a quite large and complex genome so new in silico strategies to select genes which might represent potential novel drug target candidates are an important approach to drug development. Here, we report application of RNA interference, which knocks down gene function, to validate a number of putative drug targets for schistosomiasis. Some of these genes were selected because they had been shown to be essential for life in another worm species, C. elegans, and others because they were potential targets of compounds shown to be active against schistosomes in vitro. Although none of the identified genes looked promising as drug targets, our results showed important roles for some of the genes in schistosome development.
