Ixodes ricinus transmits Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in Europe. Tick-borne pathogens ingested with a blood meal persist in the tick gut and, during the next feeding stage, disseminate through the haemolymph to pass into a vertebrate host via the salivary glands. Invertebrate immunity is initiated when tick pathogen recognition molecules trigger serum or cellular signalling cascades. We aimed to identify haemocyte transcripts from semi-engorged female I. ricinus ticks by deep sequencing a haemocyte cDNA library and by annotating immune-related transcripts based on their abundance in haemocytes and their sequence divergence when compared to their arthropod homo(ortho)logues. 15,716 extracted coding sequences (CDS) were generated in total, and 327 transcripts were significantly overexpressed in haemocytes. These included those coding for scavenger receptors, antimicrobial peptides, pathogen recognition proteins, proteases, and protease inhibitors. Transcriptional enrichment of vitellogenin and lipid metabolism effectors suggests that body fat components mediate tick innate immunity. Annotation of ubiquitously distributed transcripts associated with immune function and their phylogenetic analysis provide insights into the evolution of major protein families involved in tick innate immunity.
