Leishmaniases are a wide spectrum of parasite diseases caused by the infection of different species of Leishmania genus in several mammalian hosts, such as humans and dogs, among others. The induction of antibody responses against some parasite intracellular proteins implicated in different structural and functional cellular roles has been associated with parasite survival, infection progression, down-regulation of the cellular immune responses against the parasites and the development of pathology. The data presented in this work show the antigenic nature of the three members of the Leishmania infantum Poly (A) Binding Protein (LiPABP) family in different forms of natural and experimental leishmaniasis. Using a susceptible model of progressive leishmaniasis (BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major), it was shown that the administration of a LiPABPs based combined genetic vaccine was able to induce a partial protection against the disease. Redirection of the IL-10 mediated responses elicited by the parasite LiPABPs after L. major infection towards an IFN-Î³ specific production by vaccination was related to protection. The inclusion of the LiPABPs in a protective vaccine formulation against leishmaniasis is discussed.
