Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people globally. An anti-schistosome vaccine is not currently available. Schistosome eggs play a critical role in host pathology and the transmission of schistosomiasis; thus a vaccine targeting parasite fecundity and/or egg viability represents a realistic strategy for blocking transmission, promoting disease control in endemic areas. Based on our previous studies on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of Schistosoma japonicum, as potential vaccine candidates, we have now further investigated the impact of insulin signaling on the growth, development, sexual maturation and egg production of adult schistosomes. Protein binding assays and RNAi strongly support our hypothesis that the insulin pathway in schistosomes is activated by the binding between host insulin and the parasite IRs, regulating the transcription of downstream genes integrally involved in glucose uptake and fecundity in these parasites. This feature was reflected in the striking decreased glucose levels of worms when the SjIRs were knocked down. Furthermore, the importance of the SjIRs in the growth and fecundity of adult S. japonicum was further demonstrated in murine vaccine trials using a low dose cercarial challenge which resulted in depressed female growth and faecal egg production in mice vaccinated with the recombinant L1 subdomains of SjIR1 and SjIR2.
