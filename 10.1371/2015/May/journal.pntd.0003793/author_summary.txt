A proficiency test panel for molecular diagnostic of Lassa virus provides objective evidence of testing quality of International diagnostic laboratories. Since there are no commercial assays available, it is very important to assess the quality of diagnostic test used as well as evaluate detection sensitivity and specificity performance. Participating laboratories have received samples containing different inactivated Lassa virus strains as well as two negative controls. Participants were asked to provide information on diagnostic test procedure and protocols used for analysis of samples of Lassa virus External Quality Assessment (EQA). Based on received information we were able to compare and evaluate the quality of diagnostic profile and facilitate further improvement. Participating laboratories may use results of Lassa virus EQA to become accredited for Lassa virus molecular diagnostic. Since different Lassa virus strains are not available for most of the laboratories, participants achieved very advanced training for diagnostic of rare and imported viruses.
