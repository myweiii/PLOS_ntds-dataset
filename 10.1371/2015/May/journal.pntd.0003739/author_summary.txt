The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is a growing public health burden across the globe. Largely overshadowed by the more fatal P. falciparum parasite, increasing reports of anti-malarial drug resistance and life-threatening disease complications demand concerted efforts to eliminate P. vivax. Outside of Africa, P. vivax usually co-exists with P. falciparum. In these regions, malaria interventions have demonstrated greater success against falciparum. The authors genotyped P. vivax and P. falciparum parasites from 4 co-endemic sites in Indonesia, and used the data to gauge how frequently and how focally parasites were transmitted, and how much they spread between sites. Their results indicated that whilst the P. falciparum populations displayed evidence of low and unstable transmission, the P. vivax populations were more diverse and exhibited more stable transmission patterns, requiring different intervention approaches. Relative to P. falciparum, the P. vivax parasites demonstrated evidence of greater spread between populations, possibly facilitated by the dormant liver stage which enables P. vivax to be carried asymptomatically in patients for long periods of time. These findings highlight the need to reconcile the intervention requirements for non-falciparum malaria species in co-endemic regions, and the general utility of parasite genotyping to facilitate surveillance.
