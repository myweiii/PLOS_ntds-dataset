The DNA within the genome of an organism encodes all the information, firstly for reproduction and secondly for translation into proteins—the workhorses of a biological cell. Proteins carry out a host of essential biological activities within the cell. A full understanding of a protein now requires determination of a wide range of its properties in solution in the cell and in vitro in solution, but in addition, its 3D structure usually determined by X-ray crystallography. Leishmania species are a family of protozoan parasites of humans and the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a major health concern in the developing world. Selective inhibition of key enzymes in these parasites is a key route for combating these diseases. We have focused our work on thymidine kinase, an important enzyme from Leishmania major, and a potential target for the development of new drugs. We have carried out kinetic studies of the enzyme’s activity in solution and determined its 3D crystal structure, enabling rational drug design.
