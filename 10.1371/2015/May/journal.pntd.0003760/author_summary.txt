Schistosomiasis is a major disease of humans caused by schistosome blood flukes. One of the primary sites of pathology is the liver of the infected host, and it is caused by the deposition of parasite eggs leading to an immune-fibrotic response. We have used an animal tissue model for this disease, where slices of liver of uniform thickness are used in culturing experiments with the addition of parasite egg protein from the species Schistosoma japonicum. We found over the 48 hours tissue was exposed to egg proteins, gene associated with important immunological responses including inflammation and antigen processing were up-regulated. Similarly, responses in tissue remodeling and the modulation of genes involved in fibrosis were also indicated. In this study we were able to characterise the initial responses of host liver tissue when exposed to parasite protein released by dying eggs, representing one of the early phases of hepatic schistosomiasis in an ex vivo model.
