Intestinal schistosomiasis is a parasitic water borne neglected tropical disease of considerable public health relevance in the tropics and subtropics. In Uganda, approximately 20 million people are at risk of being infected with S. mansoni, which causes intestinal schistosomiasis, and 4 million individuals are estimated to be infected. Currently, schistosomiasis control using PZQ chemotherapy is mainly focusing on school-age children (age 6–19 years) and to those adults considered to have the highest risk of infection. So far preschool-age children are not targeted in schistosomiasis preventive chemotherapy campaigns due to the limited documentation on the safety of PZQ in this age group. However, a number of studies have revealed that children less than 6 years of age get infected with S. mansoni usually through bathing, playing or swimming in schistosome-infested waters and are at higher risk of infection than previously thought. This study compared efficacy of PZQ treatment in terms of CRs and ERRs using a single and double dose among children aged 1–5 years, living along Lake Victoria in eastern Uganda. The effect of the two different regimes on S. mansoni re-infection 8 months post treatment was also assessed.
