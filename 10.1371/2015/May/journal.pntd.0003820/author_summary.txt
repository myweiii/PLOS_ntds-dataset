Host determinants of the response to infection have increasingly been recognized as therapeutically relevant targets. Despite the pathogenesis of dermal leishmaniasis being mediated by the immune and inflammatory response, in vitro anti-leishmanial drug screening has been based on antimicrobial effect without consideration of effects on the host response. The results of this study show that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients allow an integrated evaluation of both antimicrobial efficacy and host response to drugs, immunomodulatory agents, and their combinations. This integrated approach to defining treatment strategies based on host and parasite responses opens the way for the optimization and tailoring of treatment to different clinical circumstances.
