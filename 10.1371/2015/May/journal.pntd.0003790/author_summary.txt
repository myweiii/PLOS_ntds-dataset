Deworming is recognised as a cost-effective way to increase the educational attainment and health of school-age children who experience high prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and bear the majority of the disease burden. STH transmission is driven by a number of factors including the environment, water availability and lack of sanitation. Previous government surveys in India revealed small geographic areas have extremely heterogeneous prevalence, generating interest in exploring what explains this heterogeneity. Having recently implemented a large deworming progamme, the government of Bihar State was keen to utilise the deworming campaign to undertake complementary activities to reduce transmission and establish an integrated approach to STH control. This paper presents the results of the prevalence and intensity cross-sectional survey and takes an exploratory look at the contribution of key risk factors to transmission. Maternal literacy, caste, open defecation (a common practice) and absence of handwashing stations at schools were associated with increased risk of hookworm or ascariasis. Using this information it is possible to hypothesise about potential key areas of focus during the deworming campaign and interventions that could complement deworming programmes, as well as to develop some key messages to accompany the next deworming programme in Bihar.
