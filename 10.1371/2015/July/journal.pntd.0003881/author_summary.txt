Cholera is a severely dehydrating diarrheal disease that remains an important global public health problem especially in developing countries. Globally, almost all cases of cholera are caused by V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae O1 organisms can be classified into two serotypes, Ogawa and Inaba, based on the presence or absence of a methyl group on the upstream terminal moiety of OSP. Immunity against cholera is serogroup-specific and serogroup specificity is determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Previous infection with Ogawa provides protection against subsequent Ogawa infection, while previous infection with Inaba provides more complete protection against subsequent Inaba and Ogawa infection. We have previously reported development of an Ogawa cholera conjugate vaccine. Here we report development of an Inaba OSP:rTTHc cholera conjugate vaccine and assessment of a range of doses, molar ratios of polysaccharide to carrier, immunization routes, and presence or absence of adjuvant.
