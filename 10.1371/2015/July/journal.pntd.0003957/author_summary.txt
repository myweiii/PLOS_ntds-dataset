Timing and spatial-extent of diseases such as dengue and malaria that result from transmission between humans and mosquitoes are regulated by weather in complicated ways. For Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of dengue, slight changes in different components of weather have important effects on population dynamics, lifespan, biting-frequency, virus incubation period and capacity to transmit the virus, thus inducing changes in transmission probability. These complicated dynamics produce a weather-disease connection that is not well-defined for different ecological settings. Understanding this connection is important to critical elements of policy development and operational control of dengue such as predicting risk, developing human-vector transmission models, and planning surveillance-intervention strategies locally and globally. The empirical profile of the weather-disease connection for dengue developed in this study provides a needed understanding of how temperature and humidity work together in regulating human-mosquito transmission. The observed likelihood of low to epidemic-level transmission was highly sensitive to local seasonal duration in limited areas of this two-dimensional weather-space. Data presented represent a resource for estimating where and when transmission-potential supports epidemics of varying magnitude. This high-resolution weather-disease profile for dengue reveals systematic relationships that are informative for mosquito-borne diseases in general and discussions of consequences of global warming.
