For a disease of large global health importance, schistosomiasis has a disproportionally small treatment tool box- only praziquantel is used to treat all 3 major forms of the disease. While drug discovery can be a long, laborious and expensive process, especially for an under-funded neglected disease such as schistosomiasis, drug recycling (also termed repositioning or repurposing) can bypass some of the development processes and offset the costs. We conducted a drug screening project of 1600 FDA-approved compounds from a very diverse set of indications against Schistosoma mansoni. The full 1600 compounds were first screened in vitro against the larval stage of the worm, of which 121 drugs were identified as active. These hits were then screened on the adult stages of the worm in vitro where 36 of these hits were also found to be active on the adult stage. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of hit compounds were then compared to their in vitro activity and 11 compounds were chosen for studies in mice. Of these, clofazimine and doramectin were found to be moderately active, and present new antischistosomal scaffolds with which further investigations can be pursued. Our findings are placed in context with results obtained from previous in vitro and in silico chemogenomics work and agreements and disagreements discussed.
