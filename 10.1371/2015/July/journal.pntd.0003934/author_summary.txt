Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The parasite life cycle is shared between a definitive and an intermediate host with humans as accidental hosts. The dog is a main definitive host while sheep is a major intermediate host. The incidence of E. granulosus infection detected in humans at surgery is a commonly used parameter to evaluate the incidence rate of the disease in Palestine. However, this parameter of Echinococcus detection leads to under-reporting of the infection. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of E. granulosus infection in domestic dogs as a potential source of infection to human using molecular methods. Medical archives in nine major hospitals in Palestine were reviewed for E. granulosus infection detected during surgery. Faecal samples were collected from 93 domestic dogs in areas with the highest levels of E. granulosus infection detected in humans at surgery in southern Palestine, including Al-Khalil, and northern Palestine, including Tubas and Jenin districts. The overall incidence rate of E. granulosus infection detected in humans during surgery was 0.9 per 100,000. Around 18% (17/93) of the dogs were infected. Results that E. granulosus was the causative agent were confirmed by sequencing and BLAST search of five positive samples. Genotyping of one sample showed that infection was caused by E. granulosus sensu stricto. The age and sex of dogs were identified as risk factors for contracting infection.
