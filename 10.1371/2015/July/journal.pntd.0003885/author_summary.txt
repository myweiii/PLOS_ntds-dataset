Dengue fever is one of the most important mosquito-borne viral infectious diseases in the world. Its etiological agent is naturally transmitted via blood feeding by Aedes mosquitoes. An ingested virus can replicate and be disseminated within and between tissues in mosquitoes. In this study, we found that infection of DENV in C6/36 mosquito cells can stimulate the up-regulation of tetraspanin C189, which usually co-localizes but does not directly interact to form C189-containing membrane-bound vacuoles (C189-VCs). Our results also showed that the virus can be delivered to a neighboring cell along with C189-VCs, frequently through cell contact with filopodia extended by the donor cell that touch the recipient cell. Knockdown of C189 can reduce the efficiency of virus delivery, indicating its crucial role in cell-to-cell transmission of DENV in C6/36 cells. Cell-to-cell transmission may thus be an alternative route for the efficient intercellular spread of progeny viruses within tissues of the mosquito.
