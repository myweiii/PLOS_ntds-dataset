After the rediscovery of Neorickettsia sennetsu as a possible fish-borne cause of fever in 2009, it remained unclear to what extent this pathogen was responsible for disease in Laos and South-East Asia. The original reports from the 1960s proposed an epidemiological link between eating raw fish and sennetsu. Dishes prepared with raw or fermented fish are very commonly eaten in rural South-East Asia and the resulting burden of intestinal parasites is high. As laboratory and research capacity is limited in Laos we hypothesized that sennetsu may have been missed as a common cause of fever in the country. Therefore, our work focused on the establishment of a simple typing method for this and related organisms. We describe the screening of ~1,600 patients from urban and rural Laos, finding N. sennetsu in diverse regions of the country. We identified surprisingly small numbers by PCR in comparison to the previously described high seroprevalence. This underlines the importance for continued research into the diagnosis, pathophysiology and natural history of this unusual pathogen.
