Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by the appearance of ulcerative lesions on the skin, and results from infection with trypanosomatid parasites such as Leishmania major. Current treatments for CL are expensive and have a wide range of toxic side effects of variable severity. Miltefosine, a recently introduced treatment option, is the first oral drug for leishmaniasis treatment. Although widespread clinical resistance has not yet been established, miltefosine-resistant parasite populations are easily created in a laboratory environment. Through step-wise selection, we have created populations of L. major resistant to miltefosine. These resistant parasites grow at a similar rate to miltefosine-sensitive parasites and exhibit similar stress responses. Accordingly, miltefosine-resistant parasites display a decrease in tolerance when selective pressure of MIL is withdrawn from the population. There is no conferred resistance to treatment with other antileishmanial agents, though increased sensitivity to alternative treatments is observed in some instances. Leishmania undergoes a complex life cycle including the differentiation to highly infective forms, in a process termed metacyclogenesis. Experimental resistance to miltefosine increases metacyclogenesis in L. major, however resistant parasites display a lower fitness than their sensitive counterparts, as judged by their attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo.
