Mycetoma is a chronic subcutaneous infectious disease affecting different parts of the body but commonly seen in the foot. It can be caused by bacteria and fungi. Especially for fungi, the treatment options are meagre and therapeutic failures are common. In order to develop better therapeutic strategies for this disease, models are needed which mimic the state of the causative agent inside the patient. Unlike other fungal pathogens, mycetoma causative agents produce a protective structure surrounding the hyphae. The hyphae embedded in this protective material are called a grain. This grain cannot be produced in vitro. A mammalian host is needed. In search for alternatives for animal use, larvae of the greater wax moth are often used as model systems for various infectious diseases. We therefore determined if these larvae were able to produce mycetoma grains. In this paper we describe the development of a Madurella mycetomatis grain model in Galleria mellonella larvae. We compare the grains formed in the larvae with those obtained from human patients and a previously developed mouse model.
