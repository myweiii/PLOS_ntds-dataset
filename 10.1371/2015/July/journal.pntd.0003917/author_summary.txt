Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Burkolderia pseudomallei that poses a major public health problem in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. This bacterium is difficult to treat due to its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, poor diagnosis, and the lack of a licensed vaccine. Vaccine safety is a prime concern, therefore recombinant protein subunit and/or peptide vaccine components, may represent safer alternatives. In this context, we targeted one of the main subunit vaccine candidates tested to date, flagellin from B. pseudomallei (FliCBp) that comprises the flagellar filament that mediates bacterial motility. Based on the knowledge that activation of both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated responses must be addressed in a melioidosis vaccine, we identified B and T cell immunoreactive peptides from FliCBp, using both sequence-based and structure-based computational prediction programs, for further in vitro immunological testing. Our data confirm the accuracy of sequence-based epitope prediction tools, and two structure-based methods applied to the FliCBp crystal structure (here-described), in predicting both T- and B-cell epitopes. Moreover, we identified two epitope peptides with significant joint T-cell and B-cell activities for further development as melioidosis vaccine components.
