Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease due to M. ulcerans, an environmental mycobacteria. Modes of transmission to human remain unclear and water bugs and mosquitoes had been incriminated with more or less experimental laboratory evidences and filed studies. In this context, we have investigated the presence of M. ulcerans DNA in mosquitoes and other flying insect in a highly endemic area of Buruli ulcer in Benin. No trace of the bacteria was found in mosquitoes and other flying insects, while 8,7% of aquatic insects, including water bugs, caught in the same area and in the same period were found positive to M. ulcerans DNA. Our results support the hypothesis that mosquitoes donâ€™t play a major role in ecology of M. ulcerans in our research area and is in favor of a transmission from the aquatic environment.
