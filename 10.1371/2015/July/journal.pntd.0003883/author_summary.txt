In Canada, Echinococcus spp. tapeworms cycle primarily among wildlife hosts. People are infected with this parasite when they accidentally consume microscopic eggs spread by canids (e.g. dogs, wolves, coyotes, and foxes), and develop larval cysts, often in the liver or lungs. Echinococcosis can be a life-threatening medical condition with long-term health consequences and can be an economic burden for infected individuals and for the public health system. We analysed national health records to measure echinococcosis incidence and risk factors in Canada, and then used this information to determine if a program that facilitated dog deworming to prevent human infection might be economically feasible. Our model suggested that treating infected individuals is currently less expensive than preventing infection, even in the highest risk regions of Canada. However, deworming dogs might be feasible in small rural communities where at least one case was identified. Furthermore, the prevention program has many add-on benefits that contribute to overall community health, but are not measured by our model.
