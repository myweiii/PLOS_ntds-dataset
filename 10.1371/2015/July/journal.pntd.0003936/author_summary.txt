Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease of the skin caused by obligate intra-macrophage protozoa of the genus Leishmania which usually presents as ulcerative lesions at the site of infection. Traditionally, histopathological and diagnostic studies on CL have employed samples collected from the border of the ulcer since this area is believed to contain the highest amount of parasites. However, no formal demonstration of the distribution of Leishmania parasites in the ulcer has been provided yet. Focusing on human skin lesions of recent onset (â‰¤3 months) caused by L. (Viannia) species, we estimated the parasite loads among different skin lesion sites by means of quantitative real-time PCR targeting the parasite kinetoplast DNA. Paired lesion samples collected by use of different sampling methods were analyzed. We found that the ulcerated zone of the lesion contained a higher parasite load than the ulcer border, and that scraping and cytology brush specimens presented higher parasite loads as compared to the more invasive biopsy. Our results have implications for bedside collection of diagnostic and post-therapeutic follow-up specimens from CL patients.
