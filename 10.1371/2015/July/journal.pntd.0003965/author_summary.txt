Schistosomiasis japonica remains a public health problem in Southeast Asia. In China, the number of infected individuals has been reduced considerably due to long-term control efforts over the past 50 years, but still 60 million people are at the risk of the disease. Development of novel tools for early diagnosis and surveillance of schistosomiasis are urgently needed. Circulating microRNAs are increasingly regarded as promising targets for the next generation of diagnostic biomarkers. This study systematically compared both host- and schistosome parasite-derived circulating miRNAs associated with Schistosoma japonicum infection in two murine models. For the first time, we revealed that host circulating miRNAs dysregulated after S. japonicum infection, are mouse strain-dependent, along with different pathological responses. Three host circulating miRNAs, miR-122, miR-21 and miR-34a, may, as a panel, serve as indicative biomarkers for hepatopathology progressions. We also confirmed previous reports of the value of parasite-specific miRNAs (sja-miR-277 and sja-miR-3479-3p) in serum as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica. This study establishes a basis for using miRNAs as supplemental biomarkers for the early and cell free diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
