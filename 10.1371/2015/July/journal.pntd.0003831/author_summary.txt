Historical data indicates Namibia, particularly northern Namibia, as endemic for geohelminths and schistosomiasis, albeit to a lower extent than other areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. The National Ministry of Health and Social Services, with extensive backing from other governmental and non-governmental organizations, investigated the extent of the problem in preparation for deployment of a control programme. Using a cost-effective strategy, a new generation protocol was developed for mapping these important neglected tropical diseases, bolstering field-standard microscopy results with those from commercially available rapid diagnostic tests. The protocol used increased the mapping coverage (one in every four schools mapped) with minimal added cost. Results from our surveys, which included 17 896 school-going children (3â€“19 years of age), identified hotspots of transmission for schistosomiasis and geohelminths, particularly hookworm infection, and allowed the recommendation of constituency- and region- specific treatment regimens, as well as improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene. Furthermore, we identified high levels of intestinal morbidity, believed to be associated with hookworm and Hymenolepis nana infections, and lower levels of urogenital pathology, associated with Schistosoma haematobium infection. A cost-effectiveness analysis is also presented in addition to reporting the diagnostic accuracy of the rapid diagnostic tests employed.
