In the developing world, over 207 million people are infected with parasitic Schistosoma worms. Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most widespread species, and its routine diagnosis is based on microscopic detection of parasite eggs in stool samples. This technique is, however, highly observer-dependent and has suboptimal sensitivity. We compared the performance of stool microscopy with the highly specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we recently described for the detection and quantification of parasiteâ€“specific DNA. We tested stool samples collected at two different epidemiological settings: a Senegalese population (n = 197) from a high transmission area where S. mansoni and S. haematobium are co-endemic and a Kenyan school population (n = 760) selected from zones with comparatively low S. mansoni transmission. Microscopy mostly missed low intensity infections that PCR was able to detect. Consequently, the PCR may be very useful for the detection of S. mansoni in areas with low levels of infection. Furthermore, being a highly standardized diagnostic procedure, the PCR may improve schistosomiasis control programs, epidemiological research, and quality control of microscopy. Also it can be easily combined with other PCRs to detect a wider range of helminth infections in a single stool sample.
