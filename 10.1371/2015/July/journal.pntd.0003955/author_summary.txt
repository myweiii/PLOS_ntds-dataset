Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease. A massive global effort has been undertaken to eliminate this disease by 2020 using annual mass drug administration (MDA). However the MDA excludes pregnant women and children below two years of age, which are the two critical periods thought to be playing a major role in determining the disease susceptibility in older age. We have been working on the impact of filarial infection at the time of pregnancy on neonates since 2009 in India. We have assessed the impact of maternal infection among a group of children from the time of their birth till they attain early childhood. We have observed that children born to mothers having filarial infection at the time of pregnancy were more prone to infection at early childhood than born to infection free mother in an area having very low infection rate after MDA. Our finding reveals that infection in mother at the time of pregnancy plays a crucial role in acquiring infection in children. Hence to achieve the goal of elimination of filariasis the women of child bearing age should be treated with antifilarials through MDA under supervision.
