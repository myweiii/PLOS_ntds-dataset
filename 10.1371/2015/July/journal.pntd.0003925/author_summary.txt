Rhesus macaques can self-cure from a schistosome infection. Antibody is crucial to drive this process and adult worm elimination is preceded by cessation of blood feeding. Recently we have shown that the schistosome esophagus plays a central role in blood processing. We first confirm the self-cure process in rhesus macaques infected with Schistosoma japonicum and provide evidence that the self-cure mechanism involves blocking the worm esophagus function with antibody. In the anterior region, secretion of light vesicles is disrupted hence their contents are not released into the lumen to interact with blood components to fulfil their tasks. The plates in the posterior lining stick together whilst the lumen is occluded, hampering blood processing. Furthermore, rhesus IgG binds strongly to the worm esophageal lumen and co-localizes completely with five esophageal secreted proteins, SjMEGs 4.1, 8.2, 9, 11 and VAL-7. Our results indicate that rhesus macaques eliminate their adult worms by disrupting esophageal function making blood difficult to ingest; feeding stops eventually causing their demise because nutrient uptake across the body surface cannot fully compensate.
