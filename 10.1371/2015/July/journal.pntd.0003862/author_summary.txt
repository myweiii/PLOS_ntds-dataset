Burkholderia species such as B. pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, and the model organism B. thailandensis are extremely resistant to antibiotics, including cyclic peptide antibiotics such as polymyxin B. Treatment for Burkholderia infections is impeded by this resistance, and new approaches are needed. We hypothesized that the cathelicidin NA-CATH from the Chinese cobra, Naja atra, and smaller derivative peptides (ATRA peptides) may have antimicrobial activity against Burkholderia. We therefore tested the bactericidal effects of the cathelicidin and its derivative peptides. We also wanted to determine whether the antimicrobial peptides exert anti-biofilm activity, although the role of biofilm as a critical virulence factor of Burkholderia has not yet been established. We found that the peptide ATRA-1A, as well as the stereo-isomer D-ATRA-1A, were able to kill B. thailandensis, and the full-length snake cathelicidin NA-CATH was able to both kill B. thailandensis and inhibit its biofilm formation, unlike the human-alpha defensin peptides HNP-1 and HNP-2, and the small peptide derived from hBD3. These results show that the NA-CATH antimicrobial peptide possess bactericidal and anti-biofilm activity against B. thailandensis, and suggest that these compounds should be tested for their effect against the more virulent strains of Burkholderia.
