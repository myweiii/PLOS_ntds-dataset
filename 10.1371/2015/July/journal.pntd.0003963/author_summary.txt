Human schistosomiasis is a disease caused by several species of parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma that is affecting 200 million people, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Most people are infected with Schistosoma haematobium, the species that causes urogenital schistosomiasis and also bladder cancer in many chronic infections. The definitive diagnostic test is based on microscopic examination of urine samples to detect parasite eggs. This method has low sensitivity, high day-to-day variability and cannot be carried out in the acute phase of the disease since the parasite has not started yet to lay eggs. New high-throughput diagnostic tools would be desirable, permitting early treatment and preventing the pathology associated with chronic infections. An interesting approach is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique because of its simplicity in operation and potential use in clinical diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases. In this study, we developed and evaluated a LAMP assay for detection of S. haematobium DNA in patientsÂ´ urine samples using heated pellets with no complicated requirement procedure for DNA extraction, namely the Rapid-Heat LAMPellet method. This is a new, easy, rapid and cost-effective LAMP method that should prove useful for mass screening in limited-resource settings in urogenital schistosomiasis-endemic areas.
