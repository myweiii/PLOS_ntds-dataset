Schistosomiasis is one of the most devastating tropical diseases worldwide caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosomiasis results from immune-mediated granulomatous responses against Schistosoma eggs trapped in tissues, causing serious local and systemic pathological effects because of granuloma formation and fibrosis. Treatment and control of schistosomiasis relies almost entirely on the single drug praziquantel (PZQ). This drug kills adult Schistosoma worms, but has poor activity against immature worms, thus leading to low cure rates in schistosomiasis-endemic areas that could reflect infections through PZQ-refractory juvenile worms due to high rates of transmission. At present, there is a lack of an efficient prophylactic treatment for schistosomiasis that could be critical for highly endemic areas, as well as for travelers to these regions. Here, we have found that a prophylactic combination treatment of PZQ with the ether lipid edelfosine, which is able to kill schistosomula, promotes a significant decrease in granuloma development and in the inflammatory response underlying granuloma formation, thus leading to a promising prophylactic treatment of schistosomiasis. In addition, a high decrease in IL-10 and IL-17 levels following the combined prophylactic treatment of PZQ and edelfosine might potentiate inhibition of granuloma formation and resistance to S. mansoni re-infection.
