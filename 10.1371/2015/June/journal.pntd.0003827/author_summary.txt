Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a major global health problem caused by the schistosome flatworm which lives in the bloodstream. Treatment and control of the disease relies on a single drug, and should resistance emerge, there would be increased pressure to discover new drug targets. Proteolytic enzymes are fundamental to the survival of parasites, and, hence, are attractive targets for drug intervention. Oligopeptidases from the S9 family are known virulence factors for protozoan trypanosomatids but have yet to be studied in parasitic flukes. We, therefore, investigated prolyl oligopeptidase in Schistosoma mansoni (SmPOP) and found that it is expressed in those developmental stages that infect humans. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the peptidase’s expression, localization and functional biochemical properties. Interestingly, SmPOP, which is found in the tegument and parenchyma of the parasite, can cleave blood peptides involved in vasoregulation and we discuss how this ability may aid the parasite’s survival. Finally, we designed potent inhibitors of SmPOP that cause deleterious changes in cultured parasites. We conclude that SmPOP is important for parasite survival and may be a potential target for the development of anti-schistosomal drugs.
