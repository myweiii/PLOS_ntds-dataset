Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and HIV are both major public health problems worldwide and where they co-exist have the potential to interact. The main strategy for LF elimination is annual mass drug administration (MDA). A particular concern is whether HIV, through its impact on the immune system, will interfere with the effectiveness of this approach to control and eliminate LF. We report findings from cross-sectional studies in two separate populations in northern Malawi where both HIV and LF are common. One group (1,851 individuals) were studied at enrolment into a trial of anti-LF treatments, whilst the other study used samples stored from adult participants in a whole population HIV survey (7,863 individuals). Between 5â€“10% of the study participants were HIV-positive and 24% were LF-infected. We found no evidence that LF infection was more or less common in HIV-positive adults in either population. However, we identified robust evidence that antiretroviral therapy use was associated with lower LF prevalence rates. We have no evidence to suggest HIV will have a detrimental effect on LF control. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that antiretroviral therapy may have beneficial effects and merits further careful evaluation of the anti-filarial properties of these compounds.
