Dengue is complicated. There are four serotypes of the dengue virus, and dengue infection occurs in almost all age groups. Infection with one serotype provides life-long immunity to that specific serotype but does not protect against the other three serotypes. Unlike other diseases which already have preventable vaccines developed, currently there are no commercially available vaccines for dengue fever. Even if the first vaccine becomes available, it is expected that there will be a limited number of vaccine doses available in the first few years. Due to the increase in dengue fever cases, there is already huge public and private interest in potential dengue vaccines. This study reports the household willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical dengue vaccine in three dengue endemic countries. We found that household demand is strongly related to price and income. It was also observed that more than half of the study populations are willing to pay for vaccines when price is lower than the median estimates reported here. This study may contribute to a more effective decision on dengue vaccine introduction.
