We studied the relationship between a neglected tropical disease, Buruli Ulcer (BU), and landscape disturbance. We hypothesized that the increased presence of BU was related to landscape disturbance, especially alluvial mining, in endemic areas of the disease. We characterized recent cases of BU in southwestern Ghana and characterized six types of land cover classes at different spatial extents at the village level. We illustrated that mining and water areas were prevalent in BU clustered areas and may potentially play an interactive role in BU occurrence, a finding that should be explored further. No previous study has quantified the relationship between mining and BU at the village level. In addition, we found that people â‰¥ 60 years old had a higher prevalence than other age groups, when data was weighted by the population age structure. To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported in Ghana before and might provide new insight in BU disease intervention and control. While it is unclear how people come in contact with the bacterial source, our study shows that the importance of where people live (specifically, what land activities are occurring in the area) seems to play a large role in determining disease risk.
