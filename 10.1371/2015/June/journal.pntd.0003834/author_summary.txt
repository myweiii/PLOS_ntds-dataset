Cases of melioidosis, an emerging disease, are usually clustered after rains or typhoons. In Taiwan, the endemic area includes rural cropped fields contaminated with B. pseudomallei in the northwest and a densely populated district in the southeast, where melioidosis-cluster is distributed. We hypothesized that contaminated cropped fields generated aerosols contaminated with B. pseudomallei, which were carried by a northwesterly wind and enveloped the southeastern densely populated district. In a prospective study, aerosols that contained B. pseudomallei-specific DNA were well distributed in the densely populated districts but were rarely found in their surrounding areas. The concentration of specific DNA in aerosols correlated with the melioidosis incidence and the northwesterly wind in this endemic area. The isolation rate in the superficial layers of the contaminated cropped field in the northwest correlated with the PCR positivity of aerosols collected from the southeastern district over a 2-year period. We used genetic typing to identify a molecular association among the soil, aerosols and human isolates. We suggest that melioidosis is airborne and is transmitted from the contaminated soils to aerosols and/or to humans in this area.
