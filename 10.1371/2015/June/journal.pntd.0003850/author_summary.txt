Human Monkeypox is a zoonotic neglected tropical disease, and the majority of human infections occur in the poor rural areas of central Africa. Human Monkeypox was discovered when the Smallpox vaccination campaign stopped, exposing the immunologically unprotected population to the risk of Monkeypoxvirus infection. Currently, no safe and efficacious vaccines for prevention of Monkeypox are available for an epidemic setting, and further studies are needed for the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine. In this study, safety and protection of three recombinant Bovine Herpesvirus 4-based vectors, each delivering a Monkeypox glycoprotein, was evaluated in a suitable mouse model. All three recombinants appeared safe, and one of them, delivering a single dose of Monkeypox M1R glycoprotein, protected 60% of mice against a lethal dose of Monkeypoxvirus; when given as a prime/boost, it afforded 100% protection. Although further investigation into other Monkeypox models, including non-human primate, is needed to assess bovine herpesvirus 4-based vector delivering M1R safety and protection, the findings of this work pave the way for the potential use of Bovine Herpesvirus 4-based vectors for other category A agents.
