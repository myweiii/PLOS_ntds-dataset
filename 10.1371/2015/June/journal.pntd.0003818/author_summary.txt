Leprosy and HIV infections, separately, are serious modern public health problems. Many studies have been conducted on these diseases, but knowledge gaps remain. This article provides the first account of important clinical information on a significant sample of patients with leprosy, as well as patients with both leprosy and HIV, who were followed over a period of 24 months. We compared the clinical outcome of both groups, observed the occurrence of reactional episodes, and examined the characteristics of these episodes. The sample consisted of 40 co-infected patients (Group 1) and 107 patients with leprosy only (Group 2). Group 1 was characterized by high levels of paucibacillary leprosy cases (70%) and the borderline tuberculoid clinical form (45%), while Group 2 predominantly exhibited multibacillary leprosy (86%) and the borderline clinical form (40.2%). The Type I reaction was present in 13 and 34 patients of Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The Amazon region, where the study was conducted, is an endemic region for both diseases, which can be useful for conducting studies such as these owing to the generalizability of the results. This study seeks to contribute to the knowledge of the natural history of HIV and leprosy comorbidity.
