Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by different species of protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The disease is endemic in 61 countries, and in many of them it poses a serious public health issue. As visceral leishmaniasis is fatal if left untreated, early diagnosis is essential for treatment and control of the disease. Current available diagnostic tests are either difficult to carry out under field conditions or insufficiently accurate. In this study we developed a new diagnostic test which detects a circulation parasite-derived antigen in serum or blood samples of patients with visceral leishmaniasis. We found that our test performed better than most other tests based on the detection of parasite-specific antibodies. In addition, as our test is a device for the detection of an acute infection, it will be useful to validate treatment and in the diagnosis of the disease in patients with deficient antibody production (as in AIDS patients).
