Typhoid fever continues to be a public health problem and novel more effective vaccines are needed. One of the limitations in the development of new vaccines is an incomplete understanding of the host-pathogen interactions. To gain new insights into these interactions a new human oral challenge model with wild-type Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) was recently developed. In this model, 65% of the challenged subjects developed typhoid fever (referred here as typhoid diagnosis-TD-). Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are part of the innate immune system and one of the first lines of defense against pathogens. The changes induced in these cells by S. Typhi infection were studied in a subset of volunteers (5 TD and 3 who did not develop TD despite the same oral challenge-NoTD-). Monocytes and DCs showed upregulation of different activation molecules between TD and NoTD volunteers. Furthermore, monocytes from NoTD volunteers showed enhanced S. Typhi binding and activation of signaling pathways associated with the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) TLR4, one day after challenge. In contrast, monocytes from TD volunteers had a moderate increase in S. Typhi binding and different signaling profiles. Therefore, multiple differences in monocytes and DCs from TD and NoTD volunteers following wild type S. Typhi challenge were identified.
