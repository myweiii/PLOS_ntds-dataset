Our studies show the utility of combining DNA vaccination with the goose platform for the development of polyclonal avian antibodies for use as candidate medical countermeasures. We demonstrate that these antibodies have potent anti-viral neutralizing activity in cell culture and are efficacious in preventing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Syrian hamsters when administered as a post-exposure prophylactic. The polyclonal anti-Andes virus antibodies were not effective if administered late in the disease course indicating that the effective use of an avian polyclonal antibody-based approach to preventing hantavirus disease will require rapid diagnosis and treatment of persons presenting signs of hantavirus disease.
