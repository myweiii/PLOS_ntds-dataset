Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei are the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. In addition to the recent rise in cases of glanders and the endemicity of melioidosis worldwide, these pathogens have gained attention as potential bioweapons. Further, these pathogens have huge potential for aerosol delivery and often produce fatal infection amongst untreated individuals. Both pathogens are difficult to treat, and even with antibiotic intervention, patients relapse or get re-infected. A big challenge for vaccine development against these pathogens includes identification of broadly protective antigens and a better understanding of the correlates of protection from both acute and chronic infections. Our study is the first to demonstrate significant protection against a lethal challenge with both Burkholderia species. Because TMM001 persists in immunized mice, we propose that this attenuated organism is a promising backbone-based strain from which a legitimate vaccine candidate can be generated.
