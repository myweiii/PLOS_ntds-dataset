A deadly form of non-typhoidal Salmonella has emerged as a major cause of invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Initial genomic profiling of this novel Salmonella sequence type, ST313, indicated that although it is technically classified as S. Typhimurium (a serovar characterized by a broad host range), it may be evolving towards becoming a more human-specific, ‘typhoid-like’ pathogen. However, it was recently demonstrated that ST313 strains were indeed able to establish an invasive and damaging infection in chickens. Despite these important findings, it remains unclear whether ST313 is able to cause lethal disease in a non-human host, since no study has yet followed the entire natural course of disease progression. As such, there are no data available concerning the median lethal dose (LD50) of any ST313 strain. This is an important metric, as the LD50 value will serve as a benchmark for mechanistic studies focused on understanding the relationship between virulence and the phenotypic and molecular genetic attributes associated with ST313 infections. Here we report that D23580 causes lethal disease in BALB/c mice and determined the LD50 following peroral challenge. Phenotypic characterization revealed distinct differences in tissue distribution, acid stress resistance, and biochemical utilization between D23580 and the ‘classic’ Typhimurium strain SL1344.
