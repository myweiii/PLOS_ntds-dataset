Leptospirosis is a human disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira. It is often acquired through contact with water/soil contaminated with leptospires shed in the urine of rats, the most important reservoirs in urban environment. We evaluated how location, sex, age and other rat characteristics can influence the amount of leptospires shed into the environment. We found that rats from different locations were able to shed different concentrations of leptospires. Rat populations were able to shed more than one billion leptospires per day. The findings of this study provide information linking rat population and the risk of human leptospirosis.
