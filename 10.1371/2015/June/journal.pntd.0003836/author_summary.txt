The epidemiology of dengue disease in the tropical regions is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases, and in some Asian countries, a shift in the age range predominance from children toward adults. This has important implications for health services, resources, and training, provision of treatment and care and ultimately clinical outcome of dengue. There is no literature on the impact of this shift in the epidemiological pattern of dengue on healthcare delivery and the clinical outcome of adult dengue patients. Before 2004, each of the 6 general medical wards in a university hospital took turns daily to admit and manage patients with dengue. Despite regular in-house training, the implementation of the WHO 1997 dengue case management guidelines by the multiple teams was piecemeal with high variability in clinical practice. In 2004 all dengue patients were admitted to one ward under the care of the infectious disease unit. In this pre (2003) and post-intervention (2005â€“6) retrospective study we demonstrated that cohorting dengue patients under a specific team enhances the experiential knowledge of clinicians in managing dengue patients from the perspective of clinical evaluation and detection of increased vascular permeability and the ensuing hypovolemic shock with improvement in clinical outcomes.
