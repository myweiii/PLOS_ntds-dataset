Ebola virus disease (EVD) is highly virulent and transmissible. The transmission is mostly by direct contact with an infected person or indirectly through contact with material contaminated with the secretions or body fluids of an infected person. Currently there is no vaccine or drug for EVD. Maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene remains the only control strategy, and its implementation was a challenge in West Africa countries. Ebola virus vaccine (EVV) is being developed and may soon be deployed; thus a need to evaluate factors that can improve or discourage the uptake of the vaccine when it becomes approved for public administration. This study highlights the acceptability and willingness-to-pay for EVV. Majority of the respondents were willing to accept the vaccine and pay for it if it is not publicly funded. Of interest was that among those that accepted to be vaccinated, most would only accept to do so after they had observed the outcome on others that had received the vaccine. There is need for early dissemination of correct information and education on EVV to the populace so as to prevent any misinformation and misperception about the vaccine. This will improve universal coverage with the vaccine when deployed.
