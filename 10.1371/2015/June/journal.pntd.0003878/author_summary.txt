Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is endemic to Latin America but is increasingly found in North America and Europe, primarily through immigration, and the spread of this disease is bringing new attention to the need for novel, safe, and effective therapeutics to treat T. cruzi infection. We have used data from a phenotypic screen to build Bayesian models to predict anti-parasitic activity against T. cruzi in vitro. These models were used to score various small libraries of molecules. We selected less than 100 compounds for testing and found in vitro actives, some of which were tested in an in vivo efficacy model. We identified the antimalarial pyronaridine as having in vivo efficacy and provides us with a new starting point for further investigation and optimization.
