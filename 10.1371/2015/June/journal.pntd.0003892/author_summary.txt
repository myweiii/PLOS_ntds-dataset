Burkholderia is a widespread genus of bacteria that contains over 60 species. The species within Burkholderia range from environmentally important, such as isolates that breakdown pollutants, to human pathogens. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is endemic to Northern Australia and is a major public health concern in that region. We characterized 152 unknown environmental isolates using recA sequencing to identify the presence of Burkholderia bacteria in the region. The majority of bacteria identified in this study belonged to the B. ubonensis species and various species were found to inhabit the same environmental sample as the human pathogen, B. pseudomallei. The role of B. ubonensis and other Burkholderia species identified in this endemic region and how they interact with B. pseudomallei are important questions to address in order to understand the evolution of this important human pathogen. While they are occupying a similar geographic range, they must be exist in different niche in order to remain distinct species.
