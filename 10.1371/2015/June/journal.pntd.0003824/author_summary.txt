Plasmodium infections during pregnancy represent a substantial health burden for mothers and their neonates leading to underweight babies, preterm deliveries, abortions, stillbirths, and even maternal mortality. The placenta, in its role as a bridge between mother and foetus, will either suffer or mediate the injuries which eventually lead to these adverse outcomes. Plasmodium infections during pregnancy can affect the metabolism of the placenta, its functions and even its architecture. These changes are well described in Sub-Saharan Africa, where P. falciparum infections predominate, but little is known in areas where P. vivax is predominant. The state of Acre in Brazil is one such area. We have recently shown that malaria in pregnancy is associated with placental pathology in this region. In the present study we sought to find out the association between the placental and peripheral levels of angiogenic factors, which are known and important players in the formation and function of the placenta, and the occurrence of placental pathology in Plasmodium-infected women. We found that, lower levels of Angiopoietin-1 in women who experienced malaria during pregnancy were associated with specific modifications occurring in the placenta. This provides a possible pathway through which these pathological changes occur.
