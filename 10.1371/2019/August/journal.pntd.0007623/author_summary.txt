The importance of CD4 T cell activation for HIV susceptibility has been emphasized in several studies focusing on HIV transmission and prevention. Particularly, activated HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells may play a major role in HIV susceptibility. In this analysis we describe systemic activation of CD4 T cells in individuals infected with W. bancrofti the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis. This helminth disease leads to debilitating pathology in some of the individuals; however, the majority of infected persons remain asymptomatic. We recently described an increased HIV incidence in subjects infected with W. bancrofti compared to uninfected individuals from the same area. To decipher underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we measured immune activation parameters in CD4 and CD8 T cells. The increased percentage of HLADR positive and HLADR/CD38 positive CD4 T cells and also effector memory CD4 T cells that we describe here could be a possible mechanism to explain our previous findings of increased HIV incidence in individuals infected with this filarial nematode.
