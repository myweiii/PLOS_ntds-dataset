For rainforest-enshrouded rural villages of Madagascar, soil-transmitted helminthiases are more the rule than the exception. However, the microscopy equipment and lab technicians needed for diagnosis are a distance of several daysâ€™ hike away. We piloted a solution for these communities by leveraging resources the villages already had: a traveling team of local health care workers, and their personal Android smartphones. We demonstrated that an inexpensive, commercially available microscope attachment for smartphones could rival the sensitivity and specificity of a regular microscope using standard field fecal sample processing techniques. We also developed an artificial neural network-based object detection Android application, called Kankanet, based on open-source programming libraries. Kankanet was used to detect eggs of the three most common soil-transmitted helminths: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm. We found Kankanet to be moderately sensitive and highly specific for both standard microscope images and low-quality smartphone microscope images. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the diagnostic capabilities of artificial neural network-based object detection systems. Since the programming frameworks used were all open-source and user-friendly even for computer science laymen, artificial neural network-based object detection shows strong potential for development of low-cost, high-impact diagnostic aids essential to health care and field research in resource-limited communities.
