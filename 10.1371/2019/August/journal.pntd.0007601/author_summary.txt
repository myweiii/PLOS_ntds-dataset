Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE) in humans and reproductive disorders in pigs. JEV is phylogenetically classified into five genotypes. JEV genotype III (GIII) was historically dominant throughout most of Asia, but has been replaced by genotype I (GI) over the last 20 years in many Asian countries. Amino acid variations in JEV envelope protein play major roles in determination of antigenicity. Elicitation of cross-neutralizing antibodies for GI and GIII strains has been reported, showing an antigenic difference between the two genotypes. These amino acid differences in JEV envelope proteins raise a concern about the protective efficacy of JE vaccines against the emerged GI strain infection, because all currently licensed JE vaccines are derived from GIII strains. We evaluated the protective efficacy of JE vaccines against the heterologous genotype strain using a mouse challenge model and found a partial cross-protection between GI- or GIII-derived vaccines against the challenge of the heterologous genotype. This partial cross-protective efficacy suggested a potential need for a new JE vaccine, one solution may be a bivalent vaccine, to control infection with either genotype. However, more comprehensive studies should be conducted to address the partial cross-protective efficacy of JE vaccines against the heterologous genotype strains using JEV natural hosts such as pigs.
