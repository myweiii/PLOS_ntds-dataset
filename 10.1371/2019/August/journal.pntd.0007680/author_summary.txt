Babesiosis has long been recognized as an economically important disease of cattle, but only in the last 40 years has Babesia been recognized as an important pathogen in humans. Babesiosis in humans is caused by one of several species (B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani and B. venatorum). The complete Babesia lifecycle requires two hosts, the ixodid ticks and a vertebrate host. It is the parasite's ability to first recognize and then invade host erythrocytes that is central to the pathogenesis of babesiosis. Once inside the cell, the parasite begins a cycle of maturation and growth, resulting in merozoites that egress from the red blood cells (RBCs) and seek new, uninfected RBCs to invade, perpetuating the infection. To better understand this asexual lifecycle, the authors focused on the parasite genome and transcriptome of the asexual erythrocytic forms of B. divergens. Through this functional and comparative genomic approach, the authors have identified genes putatively involved in invasion, gliding motility, moving junction formation and egress, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of these processes necessary for B. divergens to survive and propagate during its life cycle.
