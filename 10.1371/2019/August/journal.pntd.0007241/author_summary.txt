Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted nematode that causes the disease strongyloidiasis. Due to the autoinfective nature of this parasite, it can re-infect a host causing chronic infection. If not diagnosed and treated it can be highly detrimental to human health and has a high mortality rate. Strongyloidiasis is common in remote communities in the north of Australia and has been an issue for decades. Despite various successful intervention programs to treat human strongyloidiasis, the disease remains endemic in those communities. Here for the first time we looked at the Australian dogsâ€™ potential to infect humans and found that they carry two genetically distinct strains of Strongyloides spp., one of which also infects humans. This supports the hypothesis that dogs are a potential source for human strongyloidiasis. We also found that dogs in Australia might be carrying unique haplotypes. Whether these new haplotypes are also human infective is to be confirmed by further research.
