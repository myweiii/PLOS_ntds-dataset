According to WHO, it is estimated that at least 206 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2016 and of those at least 90% live in Africa. Moreover, school-age children are most affected by this worm. In Kenya, despite preventive measures against schistosomiasis such as mass drug administration (MDA) in primary schools, it remains a major public health problem, especially along the shores of Lake Victoria. Our study revealed that the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was high among pupils despite their knowledge about schistosomiasis transmission. This can be attributed to lack of safe water supply and latrines. A comprehensive approach which harmonises central and local governments and other stakeholders, as well as community is needed to prevent schistosomiasis. For example, the combination of health education (in which schools play as focal point) with provision of water infrastructure, encouragement to use and construct toilets in both schools and community/households, snail control, and MDA with monitoring can be employed to control and prevent schistosomiasis. From the school health viewpoint, it is necessary to develop health education contents and teaching methods that reflect the social and cultural context of the community in order to improve their behaviour and change the social norm.
