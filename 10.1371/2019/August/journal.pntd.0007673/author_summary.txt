Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a potentially fatal disease caused by intracellular parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. VL is a serious public health problem in rural India, causing high morbidity and mortality, as well as major costs to local and national health budgets. Amphotericin B provides improved therapy for VL with single dose liposomal-encapsulated Ambisome, now affordable through WHO-negotiated price reductions, providing the best cure rates. The VL elimination program aims to reduce the incidence rate in the Indian subcontinent to <1/10,000 population/year. By assessing immune responses to parasites in people infected with L. donovani, but with different clinical status, we can determine the requirements for immune cell development and predict which asymptomatic individuals, for example healthy individuals with high anti-leishmanial antibody levels, will progress to clinical VL. This will help in monitoring disease outbreaks. In this study we looked at global gene expression patterns in whole blood to try to understand more about asymptomatic infection, active VL, and the progress to cure in cases treated with single or multi-dose amphotericin B. The signatures of gene expression identified aid in our understanding of disease pathogenesis and provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention in the future.
