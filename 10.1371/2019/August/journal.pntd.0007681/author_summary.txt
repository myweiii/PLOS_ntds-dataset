Zika virus (ZIKV) is a human threat with a global health burden. As many as 86 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika infection, and there is no effective means of control. Recently, several studies have identified FDA-approved drugs exerting anti-ZIKV activity in mammalian cells. Here, we have screened such drugs for the ability to reduce mosquito viability or suppress ZIKV infection of mosquito cells. We identified three drugs that significantly increased mosquito mortality and six that significantly suppressed ZIKV infection in mosquito midguts. Altogether, our study provides a list of candidate agents for potential use to block ZIKV transmission in mosquitoes by chemical inhibition.
