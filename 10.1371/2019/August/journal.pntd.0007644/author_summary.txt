Anthrax and plague are ancient infectious diseases that continue to affect people living in poor, endemic regions and to threaten industrialized nations due to their potential use in biowarfare. Candidate vaccines need improvement to minimize non-desirable effects and increase their efficacy. The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a single subunit vaccine capable of conferring protection against Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. To this end, specific regions from their genome or key protective protein sequences from both microorganisms were combined to obtain either recombinant plasmids or recombinant proteins and tested as vaccine candidates in mice. The recombinant protein MaF2 induced specific antibody responses and afforded full and partial protection against Y. pestis and B. anthracis, respectively. Meanwhile, the DNA vaccine equivalent to MaF2 conferred only partial protection against Y. pestis, which increased when combined with an MaF2 protein boost. MaF2 emerged as a promising dual pathogen recombinant vaccine that warrants further investigation.
