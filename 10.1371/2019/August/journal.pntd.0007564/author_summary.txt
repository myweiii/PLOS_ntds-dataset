Dog-mediated rabies has declined to only a few cases in Latin America over the last decade. Brazil has the largest human and dog population of Latin America. Despite the decline of canine rabies, the countryâ€™s public health system still spends millions of dollars annually on half a million patients seeking health care for dog bites. In this study, we analysed a decade of national surveillance data on dog bites. These data suggest that health workers report dog rabies in many states where the disease is likely to be absent, with false positive cases frequently reported into the surveillance system. In addition, only half of patients appear to receive the appropriate rabies post-exposure prophylaxis as recommended by the Ministry of Health. We estimated that Brazil could save up to USD 6 million per annum on vaccine by reducing the number of doses administered during prophylaxis and adopting the intradermal vaccine delivery technique following the latest WHO recommendations. Our study highlights an urgent need for updating health care workers on canine rabies knowledge, prophylaxis and assessment of dog bites to improve prophylaxis provision and surveillance of dog rabies.
