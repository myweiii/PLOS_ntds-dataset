Human African trypanosomiasis is a fatal disease (if untreated) spread by bloodsucking tsetse flies. These protozoan parasites first enter the lymph and blood to invade many organ systems (early stage sleeping sickness). Weeks to months later, the parasites invade the brain causing a wide variety of neurological symptoms (late stage sleeping sickness). In rural clinical settings, diagnosis still relies on the detection of these microbes in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by microscopy. LAMP, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA, is a technique that can specifically detect very small amounts of DNA from an organism. We previously showed that by simply adding detergent during sample preparation, the analytical sensitivity of LAMP targeting many gene copies is greatly improved, presumably because DNA is released from the pathogen cells and dispersed through the sample. We demonstrated proof of principle using pathogenic trypanosomes in different human body fluids (CSF or blood) and showed that this simple modification should be applicable for diagnosis of other microbial infections where cells are sensitive to detergent lysis. After completion of the above published study, we tested a collection of clinical CSF samples from African patients diagnosed with early or late stage sleeping sickness based on current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. For proof-of-concept we tested only a single microliter of detergent-treated CSF to test for late stage disease. We predicted that a significant number of the late stage samples would be LAMP positive, while the early stage CSFs would yield predominantly negative results. Instead, our study detected trypanosome DNA in patient CSF independent of African sleeping sickness stage, results that may be consistent with early brain entry and other scenarios that identify critical knowledge gaps for future studies.
