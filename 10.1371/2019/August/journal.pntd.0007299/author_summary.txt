Most flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus (YFV), are transmitted between hosts by mosquito bites. The yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D) is one of the safest and most effective live virus vaccine ever developed. It is also used as a platform for engineering vaccines against other health-threatening flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, dengue and Zika viruses. We studied here the replication and dissemination of YFV-17D in mosquitoes. Our data showing that YFV-17D is unable to disseminate to secondary organs, as compared to a YFV clinical isolate, agree with previous studies. We have expanded on this knowledge by quantifying viral RNA production, viral protein expression, viral distribution and infectivity of YFV-17D in the vector midguts. We show that the midgut is a powerful barrier that inhibits YFV-17D dissemination in mosquitoes. Our study contributes to our basic understanding of the interactions between viruses and their vectors, which is key for conceiving new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission and designing non-transmissible live virus vaccines.
