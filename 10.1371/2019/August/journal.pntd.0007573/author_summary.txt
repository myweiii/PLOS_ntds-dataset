The liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis is a flatworm parasite dwelling in the bile duct, which can induce serious pathological inflammatory changes, and chronic infection is associated with bile duct cancer. In order to gain access to its habitat, C. sinensis larva follows chemical cues from the liver, a phenomenon called chemotaxis. Bile, including its component cholic acid, is essential for the juvenile flukeâ€™s migration toward the intrahepatic bile duct from the host intestine. Here, we report that the chemotaxis to cholic acid is controlled through dopaminergic neurons and neuropeptides. This observation can be utilized to develop a preventive intervention against infection by C. sinensis.
