Babesia, a family of tick-borne parasites, causes babesiosis, a disease that is very similar to malaria. Babesia species are globally ubiquitous yet understudied in humans outside of a few areas of the world, most notably in the United States. There is very little, published information on Babesia in humans in Africa. We conducted a study of two rural communities in Tanzania where earlier findings had suggested Babesia was present. Dedicated study teams visited households in the two communities to collect information about the residents’ health as well as factors that could pose risk of exposure to ticks and other infectious diseases. The residents of the two communities also had samples collected for Babesia evaluation. The test results revealed that a few of the residents had likely been exposed to Babesia in the past but were not actively infected at time of the assessment. The findings provide additional support for Babesia’s presence in human populations in Africa. This is important as Babesia infection can mimic other infections, notably malaria.
