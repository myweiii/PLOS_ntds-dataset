Numerous outbreaks of infectious diseases such as dengue, zika, and chikungunya in tropical countries have occurred where the mosquito Aedes aegypti is the transmitting vector. In Brazil, these infections are responsible for deaths and severe sequelae. Thus, many efforts have been made by governmental and research groups to control these outbreaks. However, complete success in this control has so far remained unachieved. Parallel to the need to develop new technologies that contribute to the control of insects that transmit diseases, there is a growing societal awareness regarding the risks associated with the use of synthetic insecticides, which has led to a search for natural alternatives such as essential oils from plants. Thus, our group conducted experiments to evaluate the application of nanotechnology in obtaining an efficient prolonged release system to combat Ae. aegypti larvae using the essential oil of a plant native to the Cerrado and Amazonian forests. These results demonstrate that using a simple and easily scalable encapsulation technique; it is possible to keep the low toxicity against non-target organism and prolong the activity of an essential oil in water and maintain larval mortality at a significant level for more than a week with a single application.
