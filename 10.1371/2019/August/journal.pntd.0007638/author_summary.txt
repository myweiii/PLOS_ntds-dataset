Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide and is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. The natural history of trachoma is not completely understood however. We conducted a four-year longitudinal study in a trachoma-endemic area of northern Tanzania with detailed follow up every three months. In the four-year study period, nearly one quarter of children developed progression of conjunctival scarring, despite three rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma control. Disease progression was strongly associated with increasing proportion of episodes with conjunctival papillary inflammation (TP), and only weakly associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection and trachomatous inflammationâ€“follicular (TF). Analysis revealed that associations between infection and TF with scarring progression were mediated through TP, and that other factors causing individual differences in TP were also contributing to scarring progression. These data have significant implications for trachoma control. We hypothesise that in individuals who have previously experienced ocular C. trachomatis infection, TP is the primary driver of scarring progression. The addition of TP to trachoma surveillance programs would provide an indicator for active disease progression in the community and a more accurate guide to the need for future trichiasis interventions.
