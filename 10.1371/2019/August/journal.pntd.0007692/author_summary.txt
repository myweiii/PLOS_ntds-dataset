Histoplasmosis is a worldwide neglected disease with a high mortality rate associated with HIV/AIDS patients, killing more than tuberculosis in some endemic countries in Latin America. Part of this elevated mortality rate is due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Here we present two novel methods, one based on Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and another on nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (nPCR), for fast, sensitive and specific diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Tests of blood samples spiked with Histoplasma capsulatum suggest the possibility of direct application of the LAMP assay proposed herein to clinical specimens without the need for previous DNA extraction and with the added advantage of naked-eye evaluation of the reaction results. Once the assay has been validated in different clinical specimens, it may be a promising tool for fast histoplasmosis screening.
