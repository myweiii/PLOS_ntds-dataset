Enteric fevers are acute illnesses caused mainly by the Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi (ST), Paratyphi A (PA) and Paratyphi B (PB). The incidence of enteric fevers is very low in industrialized countries, with most infections occurring in military personnel and individuals traveling to endemic areas. Nevertheless, worldwide, more than 20.6 million cases of enteric fever occur annually in low- and middle-income countries and are associated with approximately 129,000–223,000 deaths. ST, PA, and PB exhibit very similar clinical symptoms but distinct epidemiologies, geographical distributions, and susceptibilities to antimicrobial treatment. However, the mechanisms by which the host recognizes pathogens with high levels of homology, such as these bacterial serovars, remain poorly understood. Using an in vitro model of the human intestinal mucosa, we found that the crosstalk among leukocytes—lymphocytes, Mϕ, and PMN- and epithelial cells is cytokine/chemokine-dependent, and bacterial-serotype specific and plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the functional efficiency of the innate cells and migratory characteristics of the leukocytes.
