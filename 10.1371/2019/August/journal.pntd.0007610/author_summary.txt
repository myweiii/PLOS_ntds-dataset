This study revealed the differences in susceptibility of various human, mammalian and mosquito cell lines to CHIKV infection. CHIKV infection was found to be cell-type dependent and virus-strain specific. Additionally, two human muscle cell lines, SJCRH30 (rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) and HSMM (human skeletal muscle myoblasts), were shown to be highly susceptible to infection by different CHIKV strains. Pre-infection treatment of SJCRH30 and HSMM with a macropinocytosis inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) showed a dose-dependent inhibition. Additionally, knockdown of a protein involved in macropinocytosis formation, SNX9, revealed that CHIKV infection of SJCRH30 cells relies on macropinocytosis. Results were confirmed with a FITC-dextran assay, which showed colocalisation between CHIKV particles and macropinosomes during viral entry. Overall, this study may contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions using specific inhibitors that target the entry of CHIKV into muscle cells.
