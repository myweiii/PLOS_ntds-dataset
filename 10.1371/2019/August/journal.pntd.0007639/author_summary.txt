The dispersion of visceral leishmaniasis is an enigma. The State of Paraná, in southern Brazil, borders the states of São Paulo and Mato Grosso, which have experienced LV epidemics over the past 20 years. Therefore, we expected that the disease would enter this state through the contiguity of epidemics from other regions following by "ghost shadows". However, in 2012, the vectors of the parasite were reported in the western region (Foz do Iguaçu) of Paraná state, far from the epidemic regions. In the cross-sectional study, 23.8% of the dogs were infected, which is more than the eyes can see, showing an unexpected scenario where the disease was already widespread in the city. Now the question was: where does the life cycle element came from? In this study, we used genetic markers to understand the dispersion of Leishmania infantum throughout central-southern Brazil. Our results showed two possible agent inputs in the Paraná state, one coming from Paraguay and, another from Santa Catarina state. When we verify our results we perceived the monitoring importance of the distribution of these agents by diverse hypotheses, not only those that the scientific literature presents. Another relevant factor is always to be attentive to the environmental and socioeconomic events that can provide this dispersion.
