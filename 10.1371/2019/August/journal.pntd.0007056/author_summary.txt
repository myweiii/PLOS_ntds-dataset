In mycetoma endemic regions, the medical and health settings are commonly suboptimal, and only a few diagnostic tests and techniques are available. That had badly affected the patientsâ€™ proper diagnosis and management and thus the late presentation of patients with advanced disease. In this retrospective study, the experience of the MRC on the common in use diagnostic tests in the period between 1991 and 2018 is presented. In this study, the sensitivity, specificity rates and diagnostic accuracy of grain culture, surgical biopsy histopathological examination and FNAC to identify the mycetoma causative organisms were determined. The histopathological examination appeared to have better sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the grain culture identification needs high experience, it is the tedious procedure, and cross-contamination is common hence misdiagnosis is frequent. It can be concluded that histopathological examination and FNAC are more practical techniques for rapid species identification than grain culture in many endemic regions with poor diagnostic setting.
