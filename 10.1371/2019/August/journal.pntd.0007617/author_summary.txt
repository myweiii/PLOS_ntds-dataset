Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease in sub-Saharan Africa that has remained intractable despite efforts to eliminate it through mass drug administration. The transmission cycle is perpetuated when sanitation infrastructure does not adequately capture infected urine or feces and local water bodies, with snail vectors, are contaminated. Schistosomiasis has been linked with stunting and cognitive deficits and there is particular concern for the most vulnerable age group under five years old who are undergoing critical intestinal development but are ineligible to receive drug treatment. Efforts to reduce the disease have focused on children and young adolescents in endemic areas, near water bodies where transmission is known to be high. In Uganda, where fresh water bodies are abundant and intestinal schistosomiasis is endemic, very little is understood about the disease prevalence at a national level. We conducted a large, nationally representative survey and found a national prevalence of 25.6% where the 2–4 year old children had the highest prevalence for schistosomiasis with 36.1% infected. The most significant risk-factor for the disease was an individual’s open defecation behaviors in surface waters. This emphasizes the need to include water and sanitation investments alongside drug treatment and behavior change to control schistosomiasis in Uganda.
