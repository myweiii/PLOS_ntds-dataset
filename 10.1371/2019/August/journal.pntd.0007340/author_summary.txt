We investigated the association of symbiotic Spiroplasma with the tsetse fly host Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (Gff) to assess if Spiroplasma infections are correlated with Gff genetic background, geography, or season and its interaction with trypanosome parasites. We analyzed distribution and prevalence of Spiroplasma infections across different Gff sampling sites in northern and western Uganda, and found that the symbiont is unevenly distributed and infections have not reached fixation within these sampling sites. We tested for associations with geographic origin of the collections, seasonal environmental conditions at the time of collection, Gff host genetic background and sex, plus trypanosome co-infections. Spiroplasma prevalence was strongly correlated with geographic origin and seasonal environmental conditions. Our parasite infection data suggested a negative correlation of Spiroplasma with trypanosome infection, with only 5 out of 243 flies harboring trypanosome co-infections. We further investigated the influence of Spiroplasma on trypanosome parasite infections in the laboratory. We found that trypanosomes were less likely to establish an infection in Gff individuals that carried Spiroplasma infections. Our results provide new information on host-endosymbiont dynamics in an important human disease vector, and provide evidence that Spiroplasma may confer partial resistance to Gff trypanosome infections. These findings provide preliminary evidence that a symbiont-based control method could be successful in combating tsetse trypanosome transmission to humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa.
