Plasmodium vivax preferentially invades young red blood cells called reticulocytes. Successful parasite invasion relies on the interaction between parasite ligands with human red blood cell receptors. The P. vivax reticulocyte binding protein family (PvRBP) plays a role in the invasion process. The role of PvRBP in the natural acquisition of immunity to P. vivax, especially in low transmission settings, is poorly understood. Using samples from longitudinal cohort studies from regions of low P. vivax endemicity in Brazil and Thailand, we showed that antibody responses to PvRBP1a, PvRBP2b, and PvRBP2cNB increased with age and were boosted during infection. In addition, higher antibody levels to PvRBP2b were strongly associated with a lower risk of clinical episodes of P. vivax. Based on these observations, we propose that PvRBP2b warrants further preclinical development as a blood-stage vaccine candidate against P. vivax.
