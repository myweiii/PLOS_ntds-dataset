We are grateful to prof. Dr. Guy Caljon, Dr. Sarah Hendrickx and Rik Hendrickx from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Parasitology and Hygiene (University of Antwerp, Belgium) for their advice and positive controls. Our special thanks goes out to the village head and field workers of Ochollo, who made the sample collection possible. Also, we want to thank Glauco Camenish, from the University of Zurich (Switzerland), for guidance in the identification of the hyrax specimens.
