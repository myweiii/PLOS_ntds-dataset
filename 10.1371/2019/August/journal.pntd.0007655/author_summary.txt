Hantaviruses cause disease in people, mainly following transmission from wild rodents to people through contact with infected excreta. Wild rodents use different habitats, and many survive even in anthropogenically changed environments, but to an unknown extent. The objective of our study was to understand how these rodents respond to habitat change in the landscape, to biodiversity and to climate. We measured the proportion of pathogenic hantavirus hosts in the rodent community. We then investigated the spatial correspondence between this proportion and a vulnerability to pathogenic hantavirus infection index in humans within the Atlantic Forest. We found 12 well represented species of rodents that can carry at least one hantavirus genotype. Despite high variation in the host proportion data, the peaks of human vulnerability to disease occurs at higher levels of habitat diversity in the landscape, intermediate levels of rainfall, and areas with less than 15 species in the local small mammal community. Our results suggest hantavirus surveillance and prevention measures are needed in the south and south-east regions of Brazil where highest host proportions and levels of vulnerability spatially match.
