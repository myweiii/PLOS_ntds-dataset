Though some work has been done on the genetics of trypanosome infections in animals, relatively little is known about the genetics of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) infections. To test whether any variants are associated with reduced or increased risk of trypanosomiasis, 96 variants in 17 genes were genotyped in patients diagnosed with T. b. rhodesiense HAT and individuals without the disease in this study. From the 96 variants, only one variant G2 in the APOL1 gene was found to be strongly associated with protection from trypanosomiasis. The results reported here will contribute to the knowledge of the role of human genetics in disease progression, which could offer opportunities for development of much needed new diagnostics and intervention strategies.
