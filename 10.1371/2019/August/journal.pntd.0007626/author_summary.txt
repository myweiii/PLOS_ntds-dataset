Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease transmited by a sand fly vector. VL is an important public health issue in Brazil occurring in all its regions with increasing incidences in big urban centers. In the State of Bahia, VL has spread to new hotspots in the last decade reaching the coastal area to the north of Bahia State capital, Salvador. This region underwent several environmental changes due to a rapid urbanization and construction of touristic and vacation complexes. Our investigation represents the first entomological study conducted in Camaçari. We evaluated the prevalence of the parasite infection in the sand fly population in two periods, between December 2011 and November 2012 and between August 2014 and July 2015. Our findings indicate that VL transmission occurs during the whole year and support the idea that the vector is not sensible to bioclimatic variations in Camaçari. Additionally, the maintenance of the parasite infection in the vector regardless of the season, indicates that the disease is well stablished in Camaçari, especially in the coastal area. These results emphasizes the urgency for a rigorous entomological and epidemiological survey aiming to guide control strategies to decrease VL cases.
