Cholera, which can be a severe watery diarrheal illness caused by the non-invasive bacterium Vibrio cholerae, remains a global public health concern for many developing countries. Immune responses targeting the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae are involved in mediating protection against cholera. Evidence suggests that inactivated whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV) that includes killed V. cholerae O1 and O139 organisms provides protection against cholera caused by V. cholerae O1, but the immune correlates of this protection are not fully defined. In this study, we specifically assessed induction of immune responses targeting V. cholerae O1 OSP following vaccination with the OCV in adults in a cholera endemic area, Bangladesh. Our results show that OCV induces serum, mucosal and memory anti-OSP responses, and that these responses are maximal following the first dose of vaccination, without evident boosting with the second dose. This result calls into question the day 0 and day 14 two dose regimen currently used among adults in a cholera-endemic zone.
