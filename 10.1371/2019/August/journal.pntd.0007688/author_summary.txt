China has the largest number of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases in the world. With the acceleration of China’s urbanization process, especially in the process of rapid transition of China’s agriculture-related landscapes to urban landscapes, the dual role of climate change and environmental change has led to a leap in the epidemic area range of HFRS. Exploring or clarifying the relationship between HFRS epidemic and those environmental factors may help to grasp the spread and epidemic pattern of HFRS and then the pattern could serve as the partial basis of accurate HFRS incidence prediction and the corresponding allocation of public health resources. The present systematic review first described the heterogeneity of geographical scale, data aggregation unit and study period chosen in the ecological studies that seeking the correlation between air temperature indexes and incidence of HFRS in mainland China during the period from January 2014 to February 2019. Raising the awareness of the appropriate adoption of geographical scale, data aggregation unit, the length of lag period and the length of incidence collection period is of great importance when exploring the relationship between HFRS incidence and meteorological factors such as air temperature.
