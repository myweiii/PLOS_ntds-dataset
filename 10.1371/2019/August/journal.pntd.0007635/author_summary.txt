Scabies is a parasitic infection that leads to significant morbidity worldwide. Mapping of scabies prevalence would improve the understanding of the true burden of disease and the need for control programs in specific countries and regions. The diagnosis of scabies in low resource settings, where the disease is most prevalent, is reliant on clinical examination. A task shifting approach, utilizing local health staff, could substantially increase the feasibility to undertake mapping surveys in low-resource settings. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical assessment of local health workers following brief training. Our study found that these non-expert health workers could diagnose scabies with moderate accuracy and diagnose more severe disease with high accuracy. Further work is needed to develop standardized training packages to ensure a high level of diagnostic accuracy by non-expert health workers.
