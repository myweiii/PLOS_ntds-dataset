Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods that salivate while they puncture host skin in their search of blood. Tick saliva contains hundreds of compounds that have anti-coagulant, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory functions. While helping the vector to feed, tick saliva also modifies the site where pathogens are injected and in many cases facilitates the infection process. For this reason, tick salivary proteins can be targets to control tick and tick-borne diseases. Serpins are thought to control the tick’s evasion of the host’s serine protease-mediated defense pathways such as inflammation and blood coagulation. In this study, we report that Amblyomma americanum ticks secrete an anti-inflammatory serpin into the host during feeding. This work emphasizes the importance of understanding the functional roles of tick saliva proteins to tick feeding physiology to identify new targets in development of novel strategies for tick and tick-borne diseases control and also to search and find new potentially pharmacological active compounds.
