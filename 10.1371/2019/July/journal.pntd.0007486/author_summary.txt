Snake envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes death and severe effects in the rural tropics. Acute kidney injury is a major cause of morbidity in snake envenoming, but continues to be poorly recognised and early diagnosis is difficult. We aimed to investigate the time course of renal biomarkers in acute kidney injury, following Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) envenoming. In a group of 65 definite Russell’s viper bites in Sri Lanka, acute kidney injury was common and sometimes severe. The severity of the acute kidney injury was associated with the blood venom concentrations. Three novel biomarkers, serum cystatin C, urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and urine clusterin became abnormal before serum creatinine, the current standard biomarker for kidney injury. These three novel biomarkers will be useful to diagnose snake envenoming and acute kidney injury. They provide insight into the time course of snakebite associated acute kidney injury.
