TGF-β is a key molecule in many physiological processes as well as pathologies. We have previously described the role of TGF-β in Chagas disease, caused by the eukaryotic protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Besides the high disease burden in many countries, one of the severe aspects of Chagas disease is the chronic heart condition developed by patients, for which there is no specific treatment. In search for a better treatment, we have investigated the potential of the TGF-β signaling blocker, GW788388, on disease hallmarks in a mouse model of chronic Chagas’ heart disease. Oral administration of GW788388 produces a global reversion of cardiac damage, and, remarkably, reduces fibrosis, one of the most important death-associated features in chronic Chagas’ heart disease.
