There are increasing reports of typhoid fever epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa frequently affecting young adults and children aged between 5 and 16 years. In Asia where typhoid is hyperendemic, children aged 0 to 4 years also have a high burden of typhoid fever. Diagnosis of typhoid in young children is particularly a challenge because collection of adequate blood sample for testing is not always possible and the Salmonella bacterial load is low. Established methods of diagnosis such as blood culture and serology have low sensitivity. This study has used a combination of blood culture and pre-enrichment culture followed by PCR to improve ascertainment of the burden of both nontyphoidal Salmonella disease and typhoid fever in Malawian children, aged 0 to 4 years. We found that diagnosis with blood culture and pre-enrichment culture followed by PCR together added 94% more of nontyphoidal Salmonella and 62% more of Salmonella Typhi than blood culture alone. Where blood culture was negative but Salmonella-specific PCR was positive we have validated our results using Haemolysin (STY1498)-based serology. There are ongoing typhoid vaccine efficacy trials in Africa and Asia. The findings from this study will inform future estimates of vaccine effectiveness.
