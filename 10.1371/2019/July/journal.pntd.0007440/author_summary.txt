Scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis are diagnosed as acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Diagnostic tests for these diseases depend on antibody detection. However, antibody detection is still limited by its tendency to return negative results during the early phase of aforementioned diseases. In this study, a novel multiplex PCR has been developed for detecting Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi, and Leptospira interrogans that are simultaneously amplified in a single tube. The results have shown that multiplex PCR could be used as a diagnostic tool for detecting bacteria during the early phase of scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis, allowing for administration of appropriate treatment.
