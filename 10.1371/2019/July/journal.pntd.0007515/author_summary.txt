Giardia is a leading cause of gut infection worldwide, with wide variation in acute symptoms. Giardia infection in non-endemic regions has also been associated with debilitating chronic intestinal and extra-intestinal sequelae, such as irritable bowel syndrome, often occurring weeks or months after exposure and after the parasite has cleared. Mechanisms underlying how Giardia results in an increased risk of chronic intestinal and extra-intestinal sequelae are not currently well understood. However, an emerging body of research suggests that intestinal microbial exposures may have long term influences on inflammatory cytokine production from innate immune cells, and that this process may help explain persistent inflammatory responses following pathogen infection. We therefore hypothesized that Giardia infection could alter innate immune system cells to be more pro-inflammatory. In this work we demonstrate that Giardia exposure in a murine model changes the inflammatory profile of bone marrow derived innate immune cells in in a diet dependent manner and in response to bacterial stimuli. These data suggest that Giardia infection might alter the responsiveness of innate immune cells to other infectious agents or natural products of the host microbiota such as endotoxin. This work may therefore provide better understanding of potential immune mechanisms underlying gut dysfunction following travelerâ€™s diarrhea, as well as variation in disease severity in endemic regions.
