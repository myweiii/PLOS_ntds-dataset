Melioidosis is a frequently fatal disease caused by a soil bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei, that is widespread in the rural tropics. Because staff are often not familiar with it and because it may be hidden if it is outgrown by other bacteria, special culture media can help laboratories diagnose the disease. However, this costs more money so it is not always done even in areas where the disease is known to be present. We have looked at the results of a yearâ€™s bacterial cultures in two different laboratories in southeast Asia to identify how many patients were only identified using these special culture techniques, how much it cost, and whether the investment was considered worthwhile in terms of the gain in healthy life years in these patients who might otherwise have died had the disease not been diagnosed. Even though the laboratories adopted very different strategies for using the special media and served very different populations, in both places the use of the special techniques was very cost effective in terms not just of lives saved, but on purely financial grounds when compared with the GDP of each country.
