Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite, is one of the most common diarrheal pathogens in young children living in developing countries. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea in under-five children in The Gambia using data from the Global Enteric Study (GEMS), conducted in seven developing countries in Asia and Africa (2008–2012). We enrolled 1938 diarrhea cases and 2969 matched controls. We found that 12.0% of diarrhea cases and 4.8% controls were positive for Cryptosporidium. Most (85.7%) Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases were aged 6–23 months, and most (81.4%) occurred during the rainy season. Cryptosporidium hominis was the predominant species (82.6%). We found that consumption of stored drinking water and animals (cow, cat, rodents) living in the compound are potential risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea. Improved drinking water storage may reduce the burden of Cryptosporidium diarrhea in a resource poor hygienic and sanitation setting.
