Techniques from population genetics have been widely applied to assess problems in evolutionary biology, computational biology, wildlife conservation, animal breeding, etc. In this study, we used population genetics approaches to elucidate the genetic population structure of the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, an important vector of the Trypanosoma parasite. Our aim was to identify the optimal range of areas in which to implement effective tsetse fly control programs. We focused on five areas of active human African trypanosomiasis foci in Zambia and Malawi and used both mitochondrial and nuclear markers for population genetics analyses. High levels of genetic differentiation were observed between G. m. morsitans in Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, and those at the other locations included in this study. Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve lies on the eastern side of the escarpment of the Great Rift Valley at an altitude that is at the biological limit of G. m. morsitans, thereby functioning as a geographical barrier restricting gene flow from the G. m. morsitans on the western side of the escarpment. The western side of the escarpment is part of a historically-known tsetse belt that resides within the Luangwa river basin. We have demonstrated that a previously undescribed population of G. m. morsitans in Kasungu National Park, Malawi, should be included in this historical tsetse belt.
