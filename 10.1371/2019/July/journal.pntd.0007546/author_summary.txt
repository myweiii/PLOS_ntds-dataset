Bovine tuberculosis is a widespread infectious disease affecting both domestic and wild animals, as well as humans. In addition to being of public health concern, the disease, caused mainly by Mycobacterium bovis, has a significant economic impact on the farming industry due to the costs of eradication efforts. In Sicily, the largest of the Italian islands, bovine tuberculosis in livestock is of great concern, and targeted control strategies are needed. Molecular epidemiology is an essential tool for determining the distribution of a disease, so as to control it and minimize its threat to the population. We typed M. bovis isolates isolated from cattle and pigs reared in a limited area of Sicily. An in-depth comparison of the genetic makeup of these isolates allowed us a better understanding of the genetic diversity and distribution of the pathogen in our population of animals. We found that the disease is widespread in the area and caused by a large variety of M. bovis strains, which are in several cases common to different species of livestock. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings in light of the environmental and ecological setting, and of farming practices in the area. The results are expected to contribute to the improvement of surveillance and control programs of bovine tuberculosis in the region.
