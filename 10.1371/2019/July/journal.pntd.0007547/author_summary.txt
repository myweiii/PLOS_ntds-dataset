Using a high-throughput immunopeptidomics analysis from human cells infected with a vaccine candidate and humanized mice models, the first twelve natural HLA ligands and epitopes from Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging pathogen, have been identified. The results reported reveal that the immunoprevalence of helper but not cytolytic immune response against CHIKV was greater than the virus vector. This has implications for immune response studies and for the analysis of the exacerbated helper response linked to chronic disorders in CHIKV patients.
