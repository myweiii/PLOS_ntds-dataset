Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is the major clinical forms of tegumentary leishmaniasis. More than 1 million of people develop cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide and Leishmania braziliensis is the main causal agent of the disease in Latin American. Wild and domestic animals play an important role in the maintenance of the parasites that are transmitted to humans by infected sandflies. There is no vaccine for leishmaniasis and control measures are not effective in part because it is not known the reservoirs of L. braziliensis. Here, we show that dogs, living in houses in an area of L. braziliensis transmission presented cutaneous and mucosal ulcers similar to the one presented by humans. In all the houses with canine CL there were active or past history of cases of human CL, and L. braziliensis isolated from dogs were genetically similar to the one from humans. These data are in favor of the participation of dogs in the transmission of L. braziliensis and may have a great importance in the control of the expansion of L. braziliensis infection.
