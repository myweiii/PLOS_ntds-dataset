Soil-transmitted helminth infections frequently affect children and impoverished individuals in low-resource settings and are associated with negative health effects. We attempted to measure morbidity in school-age children from Pemba Island, Tanzania who are infected with soil-transmitted helminths but with relatively low risk for other infections known to cause chronic morbidity, such as malaria and schistosomiasis. We used a composite of clinical history, physical examination, and hemoglobin measurements. Our study was embedded into a randomized controlled trial, and by design, all individuals were infected with whipworms (Trichuris trichiura). A detailed clinical evaluation for morbidity in school-age children was not associated with an infection of roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), hookworm, or threadworms (Strongyloides stercoralis) but demonstrated the utility of the clinical examination to detect anemia. Indeed, anemia slightly trended toward resolution after deworming. While many metrics for soil-transmitted helminth infection-related morbidity may have been masked by ongoing deworming campaigns, simple physical exam findings for anemia can be useful to highlight individuals that require further evaluation.
