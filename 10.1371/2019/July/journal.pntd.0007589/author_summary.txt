The initial interaction between a microbial pathogen and the host immune response can determine the outcome of an infection. In order to elucidate the initial events of infection by Mycobacterium leprae, we measured the host transcriptome of M. leprae infected human macrophages at different time points. We detected a host gene signature 24–48 hours after infection characterized by specific innate immune pathways involving the cell fate mechanisms autophagy and apoptosis. Further analysis identified NUPR1 as the most expressed top upstream regulator in the M. leprae-induced gene signature. Our experimental data showed that NUPR1 gene expression was dependent on the production of the type I interferon, IFN-β. Moreover, we also observed that NUPR1 was upregulated in the skin lesions from patients with the multibacillary form of leprosy. Together, our data suggests an association between the induction of NUPR1 by M. leprae and a cell fate program that contributes to progressive mycobacterial infection in humans.
