Among all mammals carrying trypanosomatids, bats are considered some of the most ancient hosts, and due to their good adaptation to different landscape features, they may play an important role in parasite dispersion. To assess whether the diversity of trypanosomatid species in bats is affected by the level of environmental disturbance, we collected blood from bats in two localities of Rio Janeiro state in Brazil: one with high and another with low human interference (more preserved). The collected blood was subjected to fresh blood tests and hemoculture. Using the 18S RNA gene as a molecular target, we identified 24 bats (13%) infected by trypanosomatids, mostly by T. dionisii, a trypanosome species commonly found in all Brazilian biomes and highly associated with bats. Three subpopulations (DTUs I, III and IV) of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, were also found to infect bats. In addition, we detected for the first time a putative insect-associated parasite, Crithidia mellificae, in a mammal host in the Americas. Our work reveals the high diversity of trypanosomatids infecting bats of the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, reinforcing their importance as potential reservoirs of trypanosomatids.
