Onchocerciasis or river blindness is historically one of the most important causes of blindness and skin disease in the developing world. It is caused by infection with the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus. The finding that ivermectin was an effective and safe treatment for onchocerciasis and the decision by its manufacturer to donate it to treat this infection spawned the development of programs to eliminate river blindness through mass drug administration of ivermectin to the afflicted populations. This has dramatically reduced the prevalence of onchocerciasis worldwide and has resulted in its near elimination in the Americas. But ivermectin alone will not eliminate river blindness in much of Africa; additional interventions are necessary. Here we report the optimization of a simple trap for the black fly vector of O. volvulus and show that these traps can dramatically reduce vector biting in some settings. Together with other recently developed community directed methods of vector control, these traps may augment the effect of the ivermectin distribution programs, bringing the goal of elimination within reach in much of Africa.
