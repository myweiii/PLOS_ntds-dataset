Burkholderia pseudomallei is a pathogenic soil bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, which occurs in many tropical regions globally and in recent years has emerged in non-tropical regions. Melioidosis has been predicted to affect 165,000 people every year resulting in an estimated 89,000 deaths. Person to person transmission is rare with most cases linked to exposure to the bacterium from the environment. The genetic background of B. pseudomallei has been well studied and variably present genes have been linked to distinct melioidosis disease states and geographic regions, however we still need a stronger understanding of the association of genes with geography. Three lipopolysaccharide types exist in B. pseudomallei and the prevalence of the lipopolysaccharide genes vary between melioidosis endemic regions, but it is unknown if the lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers in a single melioidosis-endemic region. In this study, we used a combination of whole-genome sequencing, statistics and geographical mapping to elucidate if the three lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers within the Northern Territory, Australia. We show that the three LPS types have distinct but overlapping geographical footprints within a single melioidosis region and can be used as geographic markers alongside a number of other important variably present B. pseudomallei genes.
