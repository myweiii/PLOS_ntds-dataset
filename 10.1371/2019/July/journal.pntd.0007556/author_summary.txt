Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The only drug currently used for the treatment of this disease and reduction of transmission is ivermectin. However, this drug kills only the microfilarial stage of the parasite, and not the adult worm, and cases of parasite resistance to the drug have been recorded. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an efficacious macrofilaricidal drug that targets the adult worms. To identify an effective macrofilaricide, suitable small laboratory animal models are needed for routine drug screening and/or validation in vivo. To develop such a model, we implanted Mongolian gerbils with adult O. ochengi male worms; O. ochengi is the closest filarial relative of O. volvulus. Gerbils appeared to be permissive to O. ochengi male worms and when treated with flubendazole, a known macrofilaricidal drug, the drug significantly decreased worm burden, motility and viability when compared to vehicle-treated animals. This model was also used to test the efficacy of oxfendazole, a drug belonging to same class as flubendazole, and it also showed potent activity on O. ochengi male worms. The gerbil O. ochengi male worm model is now available to screen new candidate macrofilaricides.
