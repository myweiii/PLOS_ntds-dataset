Chemokine receptors and cell adhesion molecules are essential for T lymphocytes migration into infected tissues. Previously, our group demonstrated that CXCR3 receptor was highly expressed on specific CD8+ T-cells surface after immunization and infection by T. cruzi. Also, recirculation of specific CD8+ T-cells was more important than proliferation to control the infection by T cruzi. As CD8+ T lymphocytes are responsible for controlling T. cruzi infection by releasing IFN-Î³ or by direct cytotoxicity against infected target cells, our aim was to analyze the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in the migration of specific CD8+ T-cells towards infected tissues. Our results revealed that intervention on CXCR3 by administration of a blocking anti-CXCR3 antibody decreased CD8+ T-cell migration, hampering the access of parasite-specific effector cell into the heart tissue of mice infected by T. cruzi. Therefore, to induce the appropriate migration footmarks is crucial for drive the pathogen-specific effector to sites of infection and, therefore, to clarify this requirement is a crucial strategy for vaccine development.
