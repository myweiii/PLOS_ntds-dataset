Lymphatic filariasis is a debilitating parasitic disease that affects over 65 million people globally. To eliminate this disease the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating entire communities with drug combinations that include ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine. Ideally, the amount of drug administered is determined by weight; however, obtaining accurate weight measurements in remote, resource limited areas is oftentimes not feasible. The alternatives currently recommended by the WHO based on height (ivermectin) and age (diethylcarbamazine) have maximal doses below that recommended by weight-based dosing. In this study we use statistical models, based on data from a large (5-country, >26,000 individuals) lymphatic filariasis clinical trial, to develop model-based dosing poles and compare dosing based on our dosing models to WHO recommendations. Our results showed that the WHO methods would have resulted in 32% (diethylcarbamazine) and 27% (ivermectin) of individuals in the clinical trial dataset to receive below the recommended weight-based dosage. Dosing poles based on our statistical models showed that our dosing pole would markedly reduce underdosing with 2% and 6% receiving below the recommended dosage for diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin, respectively. The dosing pole we propose has the potential to dramatically improve dosing and facilitate the elimination of lymphatic filariasis globally.
