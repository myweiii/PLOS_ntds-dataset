Infections with Leishmania infantum occurring in humans can become clinically manifest as active visceral leishmaniasis [VL], more frequently so in individuals with compromised immune systems and the disease can be fatal if left untreated. However, many individuals living in endemic areas who are infected through of a bite of the insect vector remain asymptomatic. Currently, other forms of transmission are being discussed, such as through blood transfusions and organ donations from asymptomatic individuals. Parallel to this knowledge, we know that dogs are reservoirs for L. infantum, but the role of asymptomatic humans as alternative reservoirs of VL is still is debated. A bone marrow aspirate is the best test to diagnose active VL in humans, but is too invasive to use in all people living in endemic areas. Therefore, less invasive tests are needed that use blood samples to detect infected persons who have not developed disease. In this regard, we evaluated different tests in order to find out which is the most effective to diagnose asymptomatic infections.
