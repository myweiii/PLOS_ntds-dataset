Primate T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (PTLV-1) are complex retroviruses infecting both human (HTLV-1) and simian (STLV-1) hosts. It has been shown that the persistence and pathogenesis of these viruses depend on the expression of small, accessory proteins.
A bonnet macaque (a monkey present in India) was found infected with STLV-1. The genome was sequenced and found quite divergent from the other STLV-1 genomes previously described. Intriguingly, this virus does not encode accessory proteins. Analysis of other available sequences found that most strains lack at least one accessory gene. Thus the importance and the role of these proteins in the PTLV-1 biology should be revisited.
