Antigenic variation of the TprK antigen has been acknowledged to explain the persistence of Treponema pallidum in the host, however, the profile of variations in tprK during the development of human syphilis infection has not been well characterized. Here, we performed next-generation sequencing to compare the variations in tprK between primary and secondary syphilis samples. The profiles of tprK in the samples at different stages showed differences. A higher amount of pool variants within seven V regions was found in the secondary syphilis samples, and the frequencies of their predominant sequences generally decreased with increases in the number of minor variants with frequencies in the range of 10 to 49.9%. However, the length of variable sequences within the V regions of tprK in the secondary syphilis samples also presented a 3-bp changing pattern. Notably, the amino acid sequences IASDGGAIKH and IASEDGSAGNLKH in V1 not only presented a high proportion of interstrain sharing but also were found at a relatively high frequency (above 80%) in the populations. The sequences in V6 of the samples demonstrated substantial variability at the intra- and interstrain levels. These findings could provide insights into the potential syphilis vaccine components and the role of TprK in immune evasion.
