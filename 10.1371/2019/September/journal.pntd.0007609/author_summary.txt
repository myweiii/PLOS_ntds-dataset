Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the human infective worms (nematodes) Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni fuelleborni and Strongyloides fuelleborni kellyi. Little is known about the genetic diversity of these nematodes and the possibility of geographically isolated genetic types is a particularly interesting research question, given the unique life cycle of these worms which includes both sexual and asexual stages. We extracted DNA from human, dog and primate feces containing Strongyloides, collected from several countries representing all inhabited continents. Using next-generation sequencing, we analyzed three Strongyloides DNA fragments from these specimens; two fragments of the 18S gene and one from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. Using this approach, we discovered some unique S. stercoralis and S. fuelleborni genotypes, and identified a previously unknown S. fuelleborni infecting humans within Australia. We compared our data to all 18S and cox1 sequences of S. fuelleborni and S. stercoralis available in public databases and identified several patterns relating to the global distribution of certain genotypes. This knowledge could allow us to infer the origin of human Strongyloides infections in the future, and assess the role certain animals (non-human primates and dogs) might play in the transmission of Strongyloides to humans.
