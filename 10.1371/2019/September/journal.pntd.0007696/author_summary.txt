Leprosy is a neglected disease with the highest worldwide prevalence, and remains a public health problem in Brazil. The innate immune mechanisms are determinants in the management of leprosy and its different clinical manifestations. Accordingly, genetic association study provides information about the contribution of host genetic factors and the environment in which the individual lives on the development of leprosy. The individuals considered most affected and associated with a major risk for developing leprosy are household contacts with an intimate relation to patients living in crowded households. For this reason, we chose the contacts as one of our control groups, since they are more exposed to infection compared to the general population. We investigated the influence of KIR and HLA genes on the susceptibility to multibacillary leprosy. Our results reinforce the importance of host genetic background in the susceptibility to leprosy demonstrating that, independent from the control group (contacts or healthy subjects) the KIR and HLA act as risk factors in the development of lepromatous and borderline leprosy.
