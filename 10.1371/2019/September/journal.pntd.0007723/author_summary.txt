Schistosomiasis control efforts rely on rapid diagnostic tests to generate maps of disease prevalence. This is so that high-risk areas can be identified and provided with treatments. A range of tests are available, yet it is unclear how their differing results can inform disease mitigation. This study compared the results of diagnostic methods for uncovering areas at risk of Schistosoma mansoni infection in Rwanda. A national survey of Rwandan schoolchildren used two detection methods: a test detecting a schistosome antigen in urine (CCA) and a test to detect parasite eggs in stool (KK). We divided the CCA test into two datasets, as there is large uncertainty when interpreting its reading. We found that these three datasets all tell different stories about the distribution of S. mansoni in Rwanda. While all tests found similar high-risk areas where prevalence reaches 50%, such as Northern and Western regions, their overall messages are mixed. Some urine tests find areas that are high-risk, while stool tests in the same area may consider it low-risk. This makes it difficult to design budgets for treatment programs, as it is unclear where resources should go. More research and analyses are needed to determine how these tests can be used as tools for schistosomiasis risk mapping. Furthermore, the interpretations of mapping outcomes will also likely rest on national decisions regarding programmatic goals.
