Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most important schistosome species causing the neglected tropical disease human intestinal schistosomiasis. By focusing on S. mansoni in vivo with its broadly distributed sub-Saharan African snail intermediate host, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, we uncover new insights and basic knowledge of this host-parasite relationship that are critical for understanding schistosomiasis transmission. We show that in vivo studies, particularly emphasizing field-derived specimens, provides a distinct view from the transcriptional responses previously seen from in vitro or ex vivo studies of S. mansoni larval stages. With the growing consensus that we need to supplement chemotherapy with other control methods, understanding how S. mansoni interacts with its obligatory snail host becomes integral for future planning of control programs. The data provided within provides specific analysis on how schistosomes successfully protect themselves from host defenses and the necessary transcriptional responses required for its amplifying asexual proliferation that result in human-infective cercariae.
