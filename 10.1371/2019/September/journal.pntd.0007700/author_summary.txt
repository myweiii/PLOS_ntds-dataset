Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease that affects a wide range of animals and human beings in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula involving low case fatality rates. A rapid and specific test for RVF diagnosis at the site of a suspected outbreak is crucial for the implementation of control measures. Here, we report the development and the evaluation of the diagnostic performance characteristics of a pen-side test found to be a highly accurate and valuable first-line diagnostic tool for on-site RVF detection.
