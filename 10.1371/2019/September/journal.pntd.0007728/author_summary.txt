Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is a tick-borne rickettsial infection caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Although most cases resolve readily, life-threatening complications can occur without prompt antibiotic treatment. The major difficulty in diagnosing human granulocytic anaplasmosis is due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. Given that scrub typhus is the most frequently reported rickettsial disease in Taiwan and shares similar early clinical signs with anaplasmosis, we retrospectively examined blood samples from patients with suspected diagnoses of scrub typhus in 2011 and 2012. While serological evidence of potential past exposure was found in as many as 31.8% (87/274) of the patients, current or recent anaplasmosis was supported by seroconversion in 11 patients, including 8 patients coinfected with scrub typhus. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in acute phase samples, and the amplified fragments were phylogenetically close to those of variants in the Korea, the USA, Japan, and China. Herein, for the first time, we confirmed the presence of human granulocytic anaplasmosis in Taiwan. By reporting coinfections with anaplasmosis and scrub typhus, the study further highlighted the health risk of increasing contact with wild rodents.
