Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of river blindness that infects approximately 17 million people, mostly in Africa. The current strategy for elimination of O. volvulus focuses on controlling transmission through ivermectin-based mass drug administration programs. Due to potential ivermectin resistance, the lack of macrofilaricidal activity by ivermectin, and the prolonged time (>20 years) needed for successful interruption of transmission in endemic areas, additional tools are critically needed including a vaccine against onchocerciasis. Ov-103 and Ov-RAL-2 are presently the most promising vaccine candidates for a prophylactic vaccine. The mechanism of protective immunity induced in mice by the alum-adjuvanted Ov-103 or Ov-RAL-2 vaccines appear to be multifactorial with essential roles for antibodies, chemokines and the specific effector cells they recruit. In this study, we show for the first time that, anti-Ov-103 and anti-Ov-RAL-2 antibodies, chemokines and innate cells also appear to be associated with protective immunity against O. volvulus infection in humans, similar to the vaccine studies observed in the O. volvulus mouse model.
