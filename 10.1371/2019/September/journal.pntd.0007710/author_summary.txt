We used narrative methods to consider how individualsâ€™ unique positions of power and privilege shaped their illness experience, to explore what practical and feasible steps could support neglected tropical disease (NTDs) programmes to respond to patient need in Liberia and beyond. We asked 27 people living with NTDs (including lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, Buruli Ulcer, and onchocerciasis) to tell us about their experiences. We used narrative analysis with feminist intersectional theory, that allows for consideration of how things such as age, gender and disability interact, to interrogate participant experience. For all participants, morbidity and disability associated with NTDs created upheaval in their lives. Complex health seeking pathways meant that it was socially acceptable for participants to have experienced initial sickness, however as their illness became more permanent, participants described significant negative impacts on their mental-wellbeing, including depression, anxiety and suicide. This is one of the first studies to use narrative approaches to explore experience of chronic disabling conditions within LMICs and is the only study to apply such an analysis to NTDs. The emotive power of narrative should be utilised to influence the value base of policy makers to ensure that NTD programmes respond to all the needs of the most marginalised.
