Our data demonstrate how routine WGS data produced by Public Health England can be further mined for informal passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhi circulating in different geographical regions where typhoid is endemic. We have shown the public health utility of a simplified approach to WGS reporting based on the GenoTyphi genotyping framework and nomenclature, which doesnâ€™t require the generation of a phylogenetic tree or other phylogenetic analysis. These approaches yielded results consistent with previously reported antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of S. Typhi, including prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and fluoroquinolone resistance in different regions in association with different pathogen variants. These data provide a rationale and framework for the extraction and reporting of geographically stratified genotype and AMR data from public health labs in non-endemic countries. Prospective analysis and reporting of such data could potentially detect shifts in regional S. Typhi populations, such as replacement or spread of different subclades and the emergence and dissemination of MDR, fluoroquinolone resistant and/or extensively drug resistant S. Typhi, providing valuable data to inform typhoid control measures in low and middle income countries that are still building their genomics capacity.
