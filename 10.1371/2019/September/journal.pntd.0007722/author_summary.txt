Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a skin infection, transmitted by sandflies. It is most common in Ethiopia, but so far only a few hundred people have received treatment. Five rural villages in Tigray Region, in the north of Ethiopia, were visited to assess the status and determinants of CL. In a door-to-door survey 9,622 residents of 1,721 households were examined and interviewed. A total of 222 had active lesions, an average prevalence of 2.3% CL. Children (up to 9 years old) and teenagers (age 10â€“19) were more affected than other groups. Most active lesions were found in the face and on arms. Almost 11% of the households had one or more cases of CL and this was associated with proximity to habitats of hyrax, intermediate hosts of the disease. A total of 2009 people (20.9%) showed scars from earlier infections. The findings show how widespread the disease is in the north of Ethiopia and provide some first insights into the environmental factors that influence transmission.
