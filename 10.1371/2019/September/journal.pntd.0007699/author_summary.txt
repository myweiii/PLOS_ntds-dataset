Rabies, a serious disease which almost invariably results in death once clinical signs appear, is caused by the rabies virus. The arctic fox lineage of rabies virus persists in fox populations in northern Canada and from the 1960s onwards a sub-population of this virus has circulated in red foxes in the province of Ontario, Canada. By 2000 a provincial wildlife control program attempting to control fox rabies in southern Ontario had eliminated the disease in most of the targeted regions except for a focus of rabies in certain counties in southwestern Ontario which involved mostly skunks. Modified control efforts resulted in apparent rabies elimination with no cases reported in southern Ontario after May 2012 until a rabid bovine was identified in December 2015. Additional cases, mostly in skunks and livestock, have been reported subsequently. To discriminate between a re-introduction of the virus from the north and re-emergence of the Ontario viral variant, we sequenced and compared the genome of multiple viruses from both areas. The sequence data indicate that sub-types of the Ontario variant which eluded control efforts are responsible for these recent cases. These data also permit an examination of potential genetic changes in the virus that may facilitate its circulation in this new wildlife host, the skunk.
