    "Background": "The National Program for Chagas disease was implemented in Bolivia in 2006, and it greatly decreased the number of infections through vector control. Subsequently, a treatment regimen of benznidazole (BNZ) was started in seropositive school-age children living in certified vector control areas.",
    "Methods and findings": "We conducted a 12-month follow-up study and seven blood samples were taken during and after the treatment. Serology, conventional diagnostic PCR (cPCR) and quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) were performed. Plasma Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines levels were also determined. Approximately 73 of 103 seropositive children complied with BNZ, with three interruptions due to side effects.",
    "Conclusions": "Plasma levels of IL-17A might be a bio-marker for detecting persistent infection of T. cruzi and its chronic inflammation."
