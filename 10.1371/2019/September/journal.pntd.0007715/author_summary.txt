Chagas is a zoonosis endemic in 21 Latin American countries caused by T. cruzi. Results of common Benznidazole (BNZ) treatment vary by infection phase, treatment period, and dosage. In Bolivia, the national Chagas program controls vector distribution in different regions of the country. The program began BNZ treatment in school-age children from infestation-free endemic areas. Lack of information regarding follow-up and efficacy in children with recent chronic Chagas makes treatment failure difficult to detect in endemic areas. The present study aimed to estimate parasite DNA in blood through quantitative real-time and conventional PCR (qPCR, cPCR), and observe Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profiling during a 12-month follow-up in Bolivia school children. Results showed persistence of low, substantial amounts of T. cruzi DNA, and significantly higher IL-17A levels in the seropositive group before treatment than the seronegative group, which decreased to seronegative levels one year later. Of 57 treated, 6 showed cPCR positive results 6 months after treatment and were diagnosed as definitely non-reactive (10.5%). The six non-reactive individuals showed significantly higher levels of IL-17A at 12 months than residual reactive (cPCR negative, qPCR negative) and ambiguously reactive (cPCR negative, qPCR positive) groups, indicating that IL-17A might be a biomarker for non-reactive to BNZ.
