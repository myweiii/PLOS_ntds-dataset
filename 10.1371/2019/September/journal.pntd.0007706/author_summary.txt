Neurotoxocarosis (NT) is induced by larvae of the zoonotic roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati migrating and persisting in the central nervous system of paratenic hosts, and may be accompanied by severe neurological symptoms. Toxocara spp. are known to modulate the hosts’ immune response, but data concerning involvement of signalling molecules are lacking. An important class of mediators participating in the complex molecular signalling network during infection and inflammation are bioactive regulatory lipids, derived from arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids. For a better understanding of inflammatory processes in the brain during an infection with Toxocara spp., a comprehensive analysis of regulatory lipids was conducted. The infection was predominantly characterised by only minor changes in the pattern of pro-inflammatory oxylipins, while anti-inflammatory metabolites, derived from lipoxygenase pathways, were significantly elevated in the subacute phase as well as in the beginning of the chronic phase of infection. This trend was also reflected in the 13-HODE/9-HODE ratio, a biomarker for the immunological status of an active infection. Obtained data provide a valuable insight in the host’s immune reaction as response against neuroinvasive Toxocara spp.-larvae, contributing to the characterisation of the mostly unknown pathogenesis of NT.
