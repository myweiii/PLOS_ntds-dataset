Brugia malayi is a parasitic nematode and one of the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis, a disease that affects 70 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no effective therapeutics that kill adult filarial parasites when given as a short course. This limitation has hampered global eradication efforts. Studies have shown that the intestinal tract in nematodes can be effectively targeted by drugs and antibodies. Given this potential, we decided to investigate B. malayi intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase as a potential therapeutic target. We determined that this protein is essential for B. malayi adult worm survival, as gene-expression knockdown rapidly decreased motility, fecundity, and microfilarial release. We also identified two FDA-approved UGT inhibitors that cause death of adult filariae in vitro. This is a critical finding due to the need for effective macrofilaricides and the potentially rapid translatability of these drugs for use in filaria-infected people. Finally, we showed that serum from filarial patients does not contain specific IgE to Bm-UGT and thus this protein would likely not induce allergic reaction if given as a vaccine antigen to endemic populations.
