Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a causative agent of a severe human neuroinfection that threatens Europe and Asia. Little is known about the interaction of this neurotropic virus with neural cells, even though this may be important to better understand why or how TBEV can cause high pathogenicity in humans, especially following neural cell infection. Here, we showed that TBEV induced host translational shut-off in cells of neural origin. In addition, TBEV interfered also with the expression of host ribosomal RNAs. Interestingly, the transcriptional shut-off was documented for rRNA species transcribed by RNA polymerase I (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and their precursor 45-47S pre-rRNA), but not for RNA polymerase III rRNA transcripts (5S rRNA). Artificial inhibition of host translation using cycloheximide resulted in the decrease of all rRNA species. Based on these data, TBEV seems to specifically target transcription of RNA polymerase I. These new findings further increase our understanding of TBEV interactions with a key target cell type.
