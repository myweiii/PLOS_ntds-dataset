The serological detection of Zika virus (ZIKV) is a challenge, as ZIKV infection generally leads to an immune response with a high level of cross reactivity against related viruses, such as Dengue virus. Although seroneutralization assays are the gold-standard to address specificity, a rapid and cost-effective detection assay with good specificity and sensitivity could be used for first-line screening. We used a large cohort to define a set of human reference sera to validate an ELISA based on a recombinant ZIKV antigen. The assay showed 90% specificity and 92% sensitivity, providing a good basis for the development of diagnostic assays. Characterization of both DENV-EDIII-purified human and murine IgG induced by ZIKV infection or ZEDIII, respectively, confirmed the good specificity of the antigen.
