We investigated rabies spread in populations of 50–90 dogs using a simulation model in which dogs’ contacts were based on the social networks of three populations of free-roaming domestic dogs in the Torres Strait, Australia. Rabies spread would not occur unless we included rabies-induced behavioural changes (increased bite frequency and either roaming or paralysis that increased the number or duration of contacts, respectively). The model predicted very low case rates over long durations which would make detection challenging in regions in which there is already a high population turnover, increasing the risk of human infection and spread to other communities via dog movements. Spread also occurred in >30% of model simulations at low incidence for up to 200 days when 70% of the population was pre-emptively vaccinated, suggesting that higher vaccination coverage will be required to prevent rabies emergence in currently free rural areas, especially those in which dogs readily travel between communities.
