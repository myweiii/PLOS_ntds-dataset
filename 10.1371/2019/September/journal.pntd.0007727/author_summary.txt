The objective of this study was to examine the distribution and abundance of Burkholderia pseudomallei in the environment in Puerto Rico. B. pseudomallei is a microbe that lives in soil and causes the disease melioidosis. We conducted sampling around Puerto Rico to survey for the presence of B. pseudomallei in the environment. Of the 600 environmental samples collected, we isolated live B. pseudomallei from just two soil samples collected from the same site, which was in a region of the island where B. pseudomallei had never been previously reported. These results suggest B. pseudomallei is widely dispersed but rare in the environment in Puerto Rico. B. pseudomallei isolates from Puerto Rico are most closely related to other strains from the Caribbean. Caribbean strains are inside a larger group that contained all analyzed isolates from Central/South America, suggesting that B. pseudomallei populations in the Caribbean may have been introduced from Central or South America.
