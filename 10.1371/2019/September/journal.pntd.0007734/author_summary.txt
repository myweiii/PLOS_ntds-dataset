Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, is the deadliest tick-borne disease of the New World. In southeastern Brazil, where 489 patients succumbed to the disease from 2001 to 2018, R. rickettsii is transmitted to humans mainly by the tick Amblyomma sculptum, which uses the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) as its main host. During 2015–2019, we captured capybaras and ticks in seven highly anthropic areas of São Paulo state (three endemic and four nonendemic for BSF) and in two natural areas of the Pantanal biome. The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by much higher tick burdens on both capybaras and in the environment, with a predominance of Amblyomma sculptum. In the BSF-nonendemic areas, another tick species, Amblyomma dubitatum, outnumbered A. sculptum. In the natural areas, six tick species were found; however, with much lower numbers than in the anthropic areas. The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by overgrowth populations of A. sculptum that were sustained chiefly by capybaras, and decreased populations of A. dubitatum. Results of this study support the idea that any intervention resulting in a drastic reduction of the A. sculptum population shall eliminate the R. rickettsii infection from the tick population, and consequently, prevent new BSF cases.
