Leprosy rates in Kiribati are some of the highest in the world and it is one of the few countries yet to reach the World Health Organization leprosy elimination goal of a prevalence of less than one case per 10,000 population. The greatest burden is in the capital South Tarawa and the connected islet of Betio. Interest has increased for the use of chemoprophylaxis, the administration of preventive antibiotics to apparently healthy individuals who may be incubating the disease, which has been demonstrated to be effective in both household contacts and the whole population in two recent studies. In this study we used the individual-based model SIMCOLEP to predict the impact of six difference scenarios using single dose rifampicin (SDR) chemoprophylaxis in household contacts and/or the entire population on future new cases in South Tarawa. We found that all chemoprophylaxis strategies were predicted to be more effective than the current control strategy, particularly a combination of household contact chemoprophylaxis alongside three rounds given to the entire population in consecutive years.
