In South Tunisia, the prevalence of bovine TB is high with Mycobacterium bovis as causative agent and cattle as reservoir of the bacteria. However as previously mentioned in several studies, M. bovis is also responsible for human extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases in South Tunisia. Despite the veterinary and medical problems, M. bovis is still little studied. In this context, this work aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of M. bovis in EPTB patients in south Tunisia in order to determine the main risk factors of transmission. Our results underlined that SB0120, SB0121 and SB2025, previously described in cattle in Tunisia, represent the predominant genotypes. The findings highlighted that human EPTB caused by M. bovis mainly occurred through the consumption of raw milk or derivatives. These data demonstrate the urgent need to implement strategies for preventing and controlling zoonotic TB.
