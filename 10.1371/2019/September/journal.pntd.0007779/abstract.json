    "Background": "Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonosis with major public health implications in humans. Although triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice, there are records of TCBZ failure worldwide. TCBZ-resistant fascioliasis is treated with alternative approved drugs including nitazoxanide (NTZ), with varying levels of efficacy. Data on NTZ efficacy after TCBZ failure in Egypt is scarce. This study evaluated the efficacy of NTZ in cases of TCBZ failure during an outbreak of fascioliasis in Assiut governorate of Upper Egypt.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This prospective study included 67 patients from the outpatient clinic in Manfalout locality of Assiut governorate with clinical manifestations of acute fascioliasis. These included high eosinophilia (> 6% eosinophils in peripheral blood), positive anti-Fasciola antibodies, and hepatic focal lesions (HFL) or ascites on abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. All patients initially received TCBZ at recommended doses. Patients were followed up after 1 month to assess response. According to the responses, patients were categorized as non-responders and responders. The non-responders received a trial of NTZ and were re-assessed for response based on clinical manifestations, eosinophil count, and abdominal ultrasound. Patients not responding to NTZ received additional doses of TCBZ.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Nitazoxanide was partially effective in TCBZ failure in acute human fascioliasis in Upper Egypt. Further studies with larger samples are highly encouraged and further research is urgently needed to find new therapeutic alternatives to TCBZ."
