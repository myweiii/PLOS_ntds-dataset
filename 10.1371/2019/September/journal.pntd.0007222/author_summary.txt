Plasmodium vivax invasion of human erythrocytes relies on interaction between the Duffy antigen and P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP). Whole genome sequences from P. vivax field isolates in Madagascar identified a duplication of the PvDBP gene and PvDBP duplication has also been detected in non-African P. vivax-endemic countries. Two types of PvDBP duplications have been reported, termed Cambodian and Malagasy-type duplications. Our study used a combination of PCR-based diagnostic method, a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay, and whole genome sequencing to determine the prevalence and type of PvDBP duplications, as well as PvDBP copy number on a broad number of P. vivax samples in Ethiopia. We found that over 65% of P. vivax isolated from the symptomatic infections were detected with PvDBP duplications and PvDBP varied from 1 to >4 copies. The majority of PvDBP duplications belongs to the Cambodian-type while the Malagasy-type duplications was also detected. For the asymptomatic infections, despite a small sample size, the majority of P. vivax were detected with a single-copy based on both PCR and qPCR assays. There was no significant difference in PvDBP copy number between Duffy-null heterozygote and Duffy-positive homozygote/heterozygote. Further investigation is needed with expanded Duffy-null homozygotes to examine the functional significance of PvDBP expansion.
