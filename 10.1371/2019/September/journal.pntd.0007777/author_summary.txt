Helminth infections are currently controlled by mass administration of anthelmintic drugs which are effective at treating the diseases but cannot prevent reinfection. As we work to eliminate these diseases, complimentary control methods such as improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene will be crucial to reduce re-exposure and cut transmission. UV disinfection is a widely used form of water treatment but it is often seen as incompatible with low income regions. Recently developed UV-C LEDs and SODIS offer alternative sources of UV light that may be more suitable for this context, but there is little guidance about how we can use this technology to prevent helminth infections. We carried out a systematic review to establish which helminths are more sensitive to UV light and identify the areas which need further research. This will enable the production of design guidelines for household and community scale UV water treatment, so that the WASH community will be able to take full advantage of the recent developments and standardizations in UV disinfection technology.
