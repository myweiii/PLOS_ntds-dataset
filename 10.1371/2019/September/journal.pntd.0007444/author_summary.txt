Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a potentially fatal disease caused by intracellular parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. VL is a serious public health problem in rural India, causing high morbidity and mortality, as well as major costs to local and national health budgets. People at risk of VL are also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths (worms). Intestinal worms are potent regulators of host immune responses often mediated through cross-talk with gut bacteria. Here we have used a modern DNA sequencing approach to determine the composition of microbiota in stool samples from VL cases and endemic controls. This allows us to determine all bacteria, as well as all single-celled and multicellular organisms, that comprise the microorganisms in the gut in a single sequencing experiment from a single stool sample. In addition to providing valuable information concerning commensal and pathogenic gut micro-organisms prevalent in this region of India, we find some specific associations between single-celled gut pathogens and VL case status.
