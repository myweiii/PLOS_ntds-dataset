Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is a sand fly-borne disease of humans and dogs caused by the intracellular parasite Leishmania infantum. Dogs are the proven reservoir. The disease is of global health significance, and usually fatal unless treated. There are limited options to reduce transmission. Insecticide-treated dog collars have been shown to protect dogs against infectious bites from sand fly vectors, resulting in reductions of new infections in both dogs and humans. However, there have been no studies to demonstrate the public health benefits of this approach i.e. the impact on clinical VL incidence. This study assessed the effectiveness of community-wide deployment of insecticideâ€“impregnated collars on dogs to reduce the incidence of clinical visceral leishmaniasis in children, the high risk age-group. Collars were fitted to dogs in 40 endemic villages over 4 consecutive years by the regional public health authorities in NW Iran. The case incidence of infantile visceral leishmaniasis in these villages was compared to that in 40 untreated villages at the end of the intervention period. The community-wide deployment of collars proved to provide a 50% reduction in the development of the disease in children. This effect was achieved under the operational conditions of the regional routine health authorities. We conclude that the implementation of insecticide-impregnated collars should be considered in strategic scale-up operations against zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.
