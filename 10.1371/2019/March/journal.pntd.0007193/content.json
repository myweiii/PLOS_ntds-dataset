    "Introduction": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a protozoan vector\u2013borne parasitic disease of humans following infection with Leishmania donovani or L. infantum, characterized by prolonged fever, wasting, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly, and >95% case\u2013fatality in the absence of treatment[1]. Leishmania are transmitted by female phlebotomine sand flies. Leishmaniasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) strongly associated with poverty and malnutrition[2], resulting in a global incidence of 50,000 to 90,000 new VL cases per year[1]. Difficulties in reducing VL case burdens arise due to the current lack of a human vaccine, limited safe therapeutic drugs, need for improved vector control, and a better understanding of transmission dynamics[3\u20135].\nVL due to L. donovani is anthroponotically transmitted, whereas VL due to L. infantum is a zoonosis involving infectious domestic dog reservoirs[6], and uncertain role of humans[7], in maintaining transmission[8]. Otherwise traditionally known as \u201cinfantile VL\u201d, zoonotic VL is a disease mainly of young children[9\u201314], although case age-distributions may vary e.g. [15, 16].\nRegional VL control programs focus on human case detection and treatment, adult sand fly vector control, and for dogs, optional strategies including canine vaccination, topical insecticide protection, chemotherapeutic treatment, or euthanasia[17\u201319]. Anthroponotic VL has been targeted for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 people per year at district levels) in the Indian subcontinent by 2020, with substantial investment, technical and political support[3, 5, 20]. This has contributed to significant reductions in incidence between 2012 and 2017 [1, 12, 21]. In contrast, investment to reduce zoonotic VL in endemic Latin America, central Asia and Caucasia, are minimal by comparison; no such reductions in incidence are observed notably in the Americas where >90% of cases occur [22, 23].\nVector and animal reservoir control are necessary to reduce zoonotic VL incidence as treatment of human clinical cases, though necessary, is unlikely to impact on the transmission cycle. Insecticides topically applied to dogs as slow release insecticide\u2013impregnated collars have been extensively tested in different regions, showing that they are effective against sand fly vectors[24\u201328], and reduce infection risk in dogs[29\u201337]. Evidence that collars also can reduce human infection incidence is limited to a single cluster randomized trial conducted in NW Iran[31]. However, there are no peer-reviewed studies to test the impact of this approach on human clinical VL disease.\nIn collaboration with the regional VL control program authorities in NW Iran, and with access to VL case records provided by the Ministry of Health (MoH), we had the opportunity to evaluate the impact of community\u2013wide distribution of collars against clinical VL incidence, and as conducted under operational conditions. The principal aims of the study were (i) to measure the efficacy of the collar intervention against VL case incidence; (ii) to evaluate the operational logistics of collar implementation; and (iii) to assess likely causes for the variation in intervention effectiveness.",
    "Methods": "Study location\nThe study was conducted in the rural communities of the Kalaybar and Ahar administrative districts of East Azerbaijan province, NW Iran (38688131N; 4321696E) from 2002 to 2006. Villages were located at altitudes of 369-1305m (Table 1). The main economic activity in the area is agriculture, cash crops and particularly sheep farming. Dogs are kept as shepherd dogs or household guard dogs, and small numbers of livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, chickens) are kept in shelters variably near or attached to houses. Houses are constructed of plastered or unplastered stone, cement, or brick, and rooves constructed of cement, thatched or corrugated iron. Dried manure is generally stocked in piles away from houses as a source of fertilizer and fuel. Temperatures ranged from 1\u00b0C (in January) to 23\u00b0C (in July/August), and rainfall from 18mm (in August) to 76mm (in May).\nIn the region, 100\u2013150 new VL cases were reported annually between 1998 and 2005, representing 45% of the total VL cases in Iran, the vast majority being children <10yrs of age[9\u201311, 38]. At the time of the study, pediatric L. infantum infection incidence measured by Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) seroconversion was 2\u00b74% compared to 1.9% by Leishmanin skin test (LST) reaction [31]. Canine DAT seroconversion incidence was 7%[31], with reported regional seroprevalences of 11%-22% [31, 38, 39]. In the same locations, the canine to human seroprevalence ratio was 1.4: 1 (11% vs 8%)[31] compared to 3.1:1 (22% vs 7%) six years earlier in 1995[39]. Transmission is predominantly peridomestic, with human exposure being independent of age and sex, and associated with endophilic Phlebotomus sand fly vectors and infected dogs[39\u201343]. The risk of childhood Leishmania seropositivity is associated with dog ownership, village dog density (28/km2, 95% C.I.: 23.6\u201332.1), and the dog to human ratio[39]. Two species of sand fly, Phlebotomus (Larroussius) perfiliewi transcaucasicus and Ph. (L.) kandelakii, are likely vectors in this region, being seasonally active for 4 months (late June to October)[41, 44].\nThe VL control program hinges on the District Ministry of Public Health (DTARH) which is responsible for the District Health Centers (DHCs) in Kalaybar and Ahar. These centers coordinate activities of 12 provincial Rural Health Centers (RHCs), which are run by trained medical staff and health officers. Each RHC supervises about ten village health posts (khaneh behdasht) where resident Health Promoters (behvarz) are responsible for disease surveillance, control implementation, and facilitate suspect VL cases attendance at the RHCs. The RHCs provide free VL diagnostic testing and treatment services, and refer those needing more specialist hospitalization to the DHCs or district hospital. Clinical VL is a notifiable disease.\n\n\nStudy design\nRandomisation and treatment allocation.The trial was designed as a pair\u2013matched cluster randomised trial[45]. Villages were designated as clusters and selected in a two\u2013step procedure (Fig 1). All 417 endemic villages in the two districts, and confirmed VL case numbers in the 4\u00b75 years prior to the intervention (January 1998\u2013 June 2002) were listed. The inclusion criteria for village recruitment were that the population size was >100, at least one confirmed clinical VL case was recorded in this period, and that the village population was not nomadic. A total of 91 villages met these criteria.\nFollowing consultation by the RHC supervisors with village leaders and health workers, 80 of the more accessible villages were finally recruited. Ranked in descending order of pre\u2013intervention VL incidence, the top two villages were paired and randomly assigned to the treatment (collars) or control (no collars) group by tossing a coin in the presence of observers. All subsequent pairs were similarly assigned alternately to either the treatment or control group, resulting in 40 control and 40 pair-matched villages.\nThe pre\u2013intervention DTARH house\u2013to\u2013house survey indicated that the collar and control villages (clusters) were demographically well balanced (Table 1). Although Iran has a national Leishmania control program, during the trial period neither insecticide spraying, canine test\u2013and\u2013slaughter, nor VL health education programs were conducted in the enrolled communities. However, 27 stray dogs were removed by the authorities (11 and 16 dogs from five and seven control and collar villages, respectively).\n\nThe intervention.Dog collars impregnated with 40mg/g deltamethrin (Scalibor ProtectorBand, Intervet International, Boxmeer, Netherlands), were fitted to household dogs in the 40 treatment villages in late June/early July in each of four consecutive years (2002\u20132005). The Scalibor collar label claimed 5\u20136 months insecticidal activity[25, 26] which exceeded the annual transmission season.\nThe intervention was implemented by DTARH operational DHCs in Kalaybar and Ahar. The collars were donated by Intervet, and given to the DHCs who distributed them to the village Health Promoters, ensuring that sufficient collars and replacements were supplied each year. Health Promoters conduct routine house\u2013to\u2013house visitation forming part of the DTARH public health advisory and monitoring system. On these visits, they fitted the collars to dogs, promoted the correct use of the collars, recorded the daily numbers of collars fitted, lost, replaced, or refusals to fit collars (defined here as non-compliance), and identified any adverse clinical effects reported by dog owners. The authors helped train the Health Promoters to systematically record these events.\n\nVL case definition and reporting.Confirmed clinical VL case numbers were extracted from secondary records provided by DTARH. At the time of the study, the DTARH protocol stated that suspect VL cases were considered confirmed if they presented clinical signs including prolonged fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, associated with a positive DAT (threshold \u22651/3200 titer), and/or microscopic detection of Leishmania in clinical aspirates. All confirmed cases received treatment following WHO guidelines[12]. Based on parasite infections found in sand flies[42], Leishmania tropica is also transmitted in the region. However, this parasite typically causes cutaneous infections, does not normally induce DAT seroconversion, and the distinctive clinical signs are known by the DHCs.\n\nData management and masking.DTARH collated details of confirmed VL incident cases which were provided to the authors anonymised accompanied by records of the patient\u2019s age, sex, village of residence, and date when they first presented at the medical center.\nLacking placebo collars, the village Health Promotors were not blinded to the intervention, but the clinicians and DTARH data managers who collated the case data were.\n\nTrial outcomes.The primary outcome for analysis was the cumulative number of incident VL cases per village by the end of the 48 months follow\u2013up period. The transmission season of infection was attributed based on the date of the patient\u2019s initial presentation: dates falling between Julyyear \u00d7 and end of Juneyear \u00d7+1 were assigned to transmission seasonyear \u00d7. This interval allowed for a \u22659 month incubation period which exceeds the usual 2\u20136 months incubation period reported in Iran and elsewhere[38].\n\nSample size calculations.The study was statistically powered to detect a 55% reduction in the 48 month clinical VL incidence in collar clusters compared to control clusters, from baseline 0.004 (~3.978 cases per 1000 children \u226410yrs old/yr) calculated for the 4\u00b75 yr pre\u2013intervention period in the 80 trial clusters, and a surveyed harmonic mean of 106 children per cluster. Data from the previous collar trial in the region[31], gave an inter\u2013cluster coefficient of variation of \u03ba = 0\u00b7124 indicative of the degree of cluster pairwise matching achievable. We applied a more conservative \u03ba = 0\u00b725 in power calculations. Under these assumptions, 38 clusters per arm were required to achieve a power of 90% with \u03b1 = 0\u00b705 to reject the null hypothesis. The final number of clusters enrolled was 40 clusters per arm. Comparison of unpublished DTARH and published[39] demographic records showed that the village humans and dog populations were generally stationary and stable.\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe intervention effect was computed using random\u2013effects Poisson regression to test differences in the cumulative numbers of incident VL cases per cluster (= village), expressed as an incidence risk ratio (IRR). The model included variables describing the trial design: the attributed year of infection, the log10 transformed childhood baseline village incidence, and the pair\u2013matching structure (as a cluster term). The number of children \u226410yrs per village, being the well documented high risk group, was set as the model offset parameter. The variance in cluster ratios of children to total population size were similar between treatment arms (Table 1). Additional demographic variables, listed in Table 1, were then individually tested by log\u2013likelihood ratio test [LRT] of nested models, as potential modifiers of the unadjusted intervention effect estimates.\nA secondary analysis following[45] tested the normalized residuals of the observed /expected case ratios for pair-matched clusters (Supplementary S1), where the expected number of cases per cluster were generated first by fitting the Poisson model, simultaneously adjusting for significant covariates as described above, but excluding the intervention term. Then, normalized (square root transformed) residuals of the observed /expected case ratios were tested by Student\u2019s paired t-test where the results of each cluster are given equal weighting[45]. Differences in these ratios were also confirmed by applying a non\u2013parametric two\u2013sided weighted signed rank test.\nThe relationship between post-intervention VL incidence differences between pair-matched villages, and pre-intervention incidence, was examined by linear regression (illustrated in Fig 4). The relationships between village incidence pre\u2013and post\u2013intervention was evaluated by negative binomial regression (nbreg), and by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (illustrated in Fig 5).\nData were analysed in Stata v.15.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n\n\nEthical considerations\nThe trial protocol was approved by the Regional Committee of Medical Ethics, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The University of Warwick\u2019s Biomedical and Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC) confirmed that the trial raised no significant ethical concerns due to its use of secondary anonymised human case data. There was no local animal ethical committee at the time of the study. Informed written consent was obtained from village leaders, and from dog owners to fit collars, and dogs were monitored on a regular basis by village Health Promotors for any adverse reactions to the collars.",
    "Results": "In the 4\u00b75 years prior to the intervention (January 1998\u2013 June 2002), 113 confirmed clinical VL cases were reported in a population of 6,562 children in the 40 control villages, with an average annual case incidence of 3\u00b783 per 1000. In the 40 collar villages during the same period, 118 cases were recorded amongst 6,341 children, an average incidence of 4\u00b714 per 1000. These rates were not significantly different (IRR = 1\u00b704 [95% C.L.s 0\u00b7802, 1\u00b7344], p>0\u00b777).\nDuring the 48 month intervention period, 24 compared to 46 clinical VL cases were recorded in the collar and control arms, respectively. The corresponding incidences were 0\u00b795/1000/yr and 1\u00b775/1000/yr. Accounting for a general decline in VL case numbers over the years of observation in both trial arms (Fig 2), there was a significant cumulative protective effect attributed to the collar intervention (LR test: \u03c72(1) = 7\u00b783, p = 0\u00b70051). The trial design\u2013adjusted incidence risk ratio (IRR) was 0\u00b750 (95% C.I. 0\u00b7300, 0\u00b7822) (model fit: Wald \u03c72(5) = 25\u00b77, p<0\u00b70001), equivalent to 50% (95% C.I. 17\u00b78%, 70\u00b70%) protection against clinical VL.\nArrow represents when collars were fitted in late June/early July of each year before the start of transmission.\nThe intervention effect was further confirmed by showing a significantly lower than expected number of cases in collared vs control villages (Student\u2019s t = -3.39, df = 39, p = 0\u00b70016) (Supplementary S1). The non\u2013parametric sign rank test of these residuals was also significant (p = 0\u00b7008).\nAdditional demographic variables (listed in Table 1) were individually tested for effect estimate modification, but none of the variables significantly improved the model fit (LRT: \u03c72(1) <1\u00b792, p>0\u00b7187).\n\nVL case characteristics\nThe median age of the 70 reported clinical cases during the trial period was 1.6yrs (range: 0.5\u20135yrs), with M:F sex ratios of 25:21 and 12:12 in control and collar arms, respectively. There were no significant differences in case age distributions between trial arms (Poisson regression: z = -0\u00b797, P = 0\u00b7331), nor between intervention years (non\u2013parametric test for trend: z = -1\u00b754, p = 0\u00b7124).\n\n\nHeterogeneities in the intervention effect\nYear of intervention.The annual point estimates of the intervention effect suggested that the protective effect steadily increased with time under intervention, though the case numbers were low and the errors broad (Table 2).\n\nVariation in the intervention effect between villages.By the end of the intervention, 12 (30%) of the 40 collar villages, compared to 24 (60%) of the 40 control villages, presented \u22651 clinical VL case, indicating a reduced risk also at the village level (IRR = 0\u00b757 [95% C.I.s 0\u00b7372, 0\u00b7879], \u03c72(1) = 7\u00b727, p = 0\u00b7007).\nEleven of the 40 paired\u2013matched villages reported zero cases post\u2013intervention in both treatment arms. Of the remaining 29 pairs, 22 (76%) collared villages showed reductions in incidence compared to the pair-matched control villages (Fig 3), with 11 new VL cases recorded compared to 42 VL cases in the control villages. However, in seven collared villages, there was an increase in incidence, with 13 VL cases compared to 4 cases in the pair-matched control villages over the 4 year period.\nNegative differences represent a reduction in incidence attributed to the collar intervention. Positive changes represent an increase in incidence in the collar compared to the pair\u2013matched control village. Values calculated as (post incidence collar\u2013control) for pair\u2013matched villages.\nThe difference in post-intervention VL incidence between pair-matched villages attributed to the intervention was negatively associated with their pre-intervention baseline incidence (linear regression b = -0\u00b7427, z = -3\u00b719, p<0.001) (Fig 4). This suggested that despite the general decline in VL case numbers by the end of the study, the intervention had a larger impact on higher compared to lower levels of pre-existing transmission intensity.\nVillages were pair\u2013matched based on their pre\u2013intervention incidence as described in the Methods, and ordered from low to high (Y axis: numbers 1\u201340). Dashed line: least squares linear fit from regression of the post\u2013intervention incidence difference against the pre\u2013intervention incidence.\nIn the control arm, there was a positive association between village pre\u2013and post\u2013intervention incidence (nbreg: b = 0\u00b7095, z = 1\u00b786, p = 0\u00b706; Spearman\u2019s r = 0\u00b7420, p = 0\u00b7007) (Fig 5). This relationship was interrupted by the intervention (nbreg: b = -0\u00b7107, z = -0\u00b775, p = 0\u00b745; Spearman\u2019s r = -0\u00b7109, p = 0\u00b750) (Fig 5).\nLine: least squares linear fit from regression of the post\u2013intervention incidence against the pre\u2013intervention incidence, weighted by number of children in the denominator (symbol size).\n\n\n\nCollar coverage\nOver the trial period, 6,835 dogs were fitted with collars before the beginning of the sand fly season (1,682, 1,722, 1,689, and 1,742 dogs annually in the 4 years). Of these, 6.9% (95% C.I. 6.25%, 7.56%) were lost per year, respectively 7\u00b73% (123/1,682), 6.4% (110/1722), 6.9% (117/1689) and 7.0% (122/1742). The mean annual coverage (percent of total dogs collared) was 87% (95% C.I. 84\u00b72, 89\u00b70%) being consistent across years (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test: \u03c72(3) = 0\u00b7260, p = 0\u00b7967), although it varied significantly between villages (range: 65\u00b77%\u2013100%) (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test: \u03c72(39) = 0\u00b7122, p = 0\u00b70001) (Fig 6). Coverage in any single village and year was not associated with the village dog population size (z = 1\u00b714, p = 0\u00b726).\nY axis error bars represent the minimum and maximum annual dog collar coverage per village over the 4 years intervention.\nThe variation in post-intervention VL incidence between pair-matched villages were not associated with the mean or variance in village collar coverage (t<0.67, p>0.51, r2 = 0.008); similar coverage was observed in villages with no incident VL cases, as those with >0 incident VL cases (Fig 6).\n\n\nIntervention logistics\nCollar fitting, loss and replacement rates.Based on the most complete daily records (2002 data), collars were distributed by the DHCs to all village Health Promoters within 16 days at the start of the study. Aligned from the date (19th June 2002) of supply to the first village, all collars were fitted in the 40 villages within one month.\nIn individual villages, all collars were fitted within a median 14 days (IQR 12.3\u201314.0; range: 4\u201330 days) from collar provision, with >70% in place within eight days. The number of dogs per village did not influence either the total fitting time (quantile regression: t = 0\u00b795, p = 0\u00b7348) or daily fitting rates (comparison of daily slope interactions: z<0\u00b771, p>0\u00b754). Fitting rates were similar for guard and shepherd dogs (Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test: z = -0.262, p = 0.794).\nCollars were lost in 35 of the 40 collar villages, 2\u2013147 days post-fitting. A median 3 (IQR 2\u20134; range 1\u201310) collars were lost per village. However, these were rapidly replaced: 59% within 4 days, and 91% within 8 days.",
    "Discussion": "The effectiveness of insecticide\u2013impregnated collars against human clinical VL had not been trialled as a potential public health control option. Community\u2013wide collar coverage over 4 transmission seasons reduced the relative risk of infantile VL by 50% (95% C.I. 30%, 82%), and reduced the total VL case numbers by 48% during the intervention period.\nThe protective effect was clear despite a 70% general decline in reported case numbers over the study period, the decline being consistent with national trends from the late 1990s to 2014 in Iran[9] and elsewhere: waxing and waning cycles in incident case numbers are reported in the Indian subcontinent[5], with speculation over the regulating mechanisms[46]. In Iran, VL is a notifiable disease, subject of major public health programs, and well known to physicians in the study region. Development of VL from subclinical infection in the region is 8% (1 in 13 infections), where conversion risk declines with age associated with a rise in cell\u2013mediated immunity[40]. The observed VL cases were \u22645yrs old, similar to the VL age\u2013distributions throughout Iran[9\u201311]. This contrasts to the older average age groups afflicted with VL due to L. donovani infection[47], and in immunocompromised VL patients generally[16]. Traditionally a disease of children, variability in L. infantum VL case age distributions are appearing[23].\nAll eight published studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of Scalibor collars, demonstrated reduced canine seroinfection incidence by 46%\u201386% within 1\u20132 years of use[30\u201335, 37, 48]. They have been shown to reduce also sand fly densities[27], and sand fly infection prevalence with L. infantum[48]. The DTARH program did not monitor changes in canine infection rates or sand fly densities during the trial period, which is one limitation of this study. However, a previous cluster randomized trial of community-wide distribution of Scalibor collars in the study region, reported protective effects against canine infection of 54% [95% C.L.s 30%, 70%]), associated with a reduction in infection (cf. clinical disease) incidence of 43% (95% C.L.s 10%, 63%) in \u226410yr old children[31]. What was not clear from that study, was whether reductions in seroconversion would directly translate into reductions in clinical VL incidence. Scalibor collars release deltamethrin into dermal secretions, resulting in reduced sand fly blood\u2013feeding by >90%, and increased mortality in blood\u2013fed sand flies by 35%\u2013100% over 8 months[25, 26]. More recent studies suggest that Scalibor collars offer 94\u201398% protection against Phlebotomous perniciosus sand fly bites for up to 12 months[49]. These effects reduce the likelihood of a collared dog acquiring infection and being a source for onward transmission, thus, they are expected to reduce the number of infectious bites on humans. The risk of clinical development is associated with elevated parasite burdens and immune responses[50, 51]; collars may also reduce the metacyclic inoculum delivered by vectors, and/or the initial amastigote infection burdens, sufficient to reduce the subclinical to clinical VL conversion rate. Lower incident anti\u2013Leishmania antibody titers, observed in seronegative collared dogs[32], support this hypothesis.\nThe annual effect estimates in this study suggest that one to two years of continued intervention achieved a similar outcome to the 4-year cumulative effect. However, the point estimate errors were broad as the study was not statistically powered to detect significant changes in any single transmission season. Interpretation of the effect estimates over time was further hindered by the very low VL case numbers in both arms and inevitable stochastic events in the latter years of the study. A different cyclical pattern of VL between control and intervention villages is unlikely to have occurred due to the randomization of trial clusters.\nClinical VL cases continued to be notified in villages during the years of collar use, indicating that collars were not wholly effective in interrupting transmission. Villages with higher pre\u2013intervention incidence were more likely to experience continued transmission, despite achieving greater relative reductions in disease incidence compared to villages of low pre\u2013intervention incidence. This raises the possibility that the collar coverage was insufficient in some villages.\nCollar coverage showed significant variation between villages with some being consistently low. Changes in village VL incidence was not associated with village coverage, nor indeed with any demographic variable. In three of the seven collared villages where the intervention failed to prevent a higher number of incident cases compared to controls, annual collar coverage was >84% (average c.90%); and in all except one of the 7 villages, the minimum annual coverage was >77%. Therefore, we do not attribute these failures to lower collar coverage levels. Nor do we attribute it to collar losses or to non\u2013compliance (owner refusing to have collars fitted to dogs). Short\u2013term allergic dermal reactions to deltamethrin, reported in 2%\u201316% of collared dogs in two Brazilian studies[32, 37], usually cause owners to remove the collars. Such adverse effects were not reported in this trial, nor in the previous trial in NW Iran[31]. Similarly, there were no cases of dog owners refusing to have collars fitted to their dogs by the Health Promoters.\nDogs \u22643m old were not collared (following label instructions) but represented <3% of the canine population. The period of latency to infectious onset far exceeds the 4 month transmission season[6], thus ruling out these dogs as significant reservoirs for continued transmission. Stray dogs were rarely seen (27 in total), equivalent to <0\u00b72 dogs per study village year. Although local wild canid populations can support infections[38], their densities are relatively low, and the role of wild canids in maintaining transmission is disputed[8, 52, 53].\n\nPotential scale-up and sustainability\nA significant finding of this study was that the intervention effect was achieved under the operational conditions as implemented by the DTARH VL control program. After ensuring that the design and village randomisation processes met CRT analytical requirements, the authors had minimal contact with authorities. The authors supplied known numbers of collars to the DHCs who distributed them to the villages, and collated details of the collar implementation. This provided the opportunity to measure the logistics and likely sustainability of programmatic scale\u2013up.\nCollars were fitted within only 15 days of village supply, and collar losses were rapidly replaced, suggesting coverage levels were maintained during the transmission seasons. Neither coverage level nor time to complete collar fitting were related to the total number of dogs eligible for a collar, concluding that lower village coverage levels were not due to time constraints. Feasibility of a regional\u2013level scale\u2013up was indicated by DTARH taking only 16 days to deliver collars to all 40 villages spread over an area of 15,000km2, and total collars being fitted within one month from collar provision to the first village.\nCollars were socially accepted, visibly distinguished treated dogs, and should not require replacement every 3\u20134 weeks, unlike alternative topical formulations. Coupled with the short transmission season, effective collar duration, and rapid replacement rate, the feasibility of effective sustainable scale\u2013up is indicated. Collar losses in this region of between 1% per month[31] and 1.7% (95% CI: 1.6%, 1.9%) per month (this study), were not substantially higher than in other endemic regions: 0\u00b78% in Brazil[37] and 0\u00b76\u20130\u00b77% in Italy[34, 54], though exceptional rates, 7\u00b78% and 8\u00b72%, in both continents have been reported[32, 33].\nSustainability will be governed also by costs and cost\u2013effectiveness. Considering the cost of collars alone, in this study, collars were donated by the manufacturer. However, based on \u20ac14 per collar, the annual material cost would have equated to approximately \u20ac24,000, or \u20ac96,000 over 4 years. That is \u20ac4,364 per VL case averted compared to case numbers in the control arm. This value is for a period with 70% relative decline in reported case numbers from the late 1990s to 2014[9]. Better cost\u2013effectiveness may be expected as the cyclical waning in case numbers inevitably reverses in non\u2013intervention regions.\nOne key knowledge gap is how best to implement dog collar programs: currently unknown is the minimum community coverage level necessary to reduce transmission, equivalent to vaccination coverage thresholds calculated to maintain herd immunity[55]. Mathematical models suggest that increasing collar coverage from 70% to 90% could cause moderate to substantial reductions in both canine and human infection prevalences[32, 56, 57]. However, three empirical studies that report coverage of 70%\u2013100% failed to corroborate these predictions[31, 34, 37]. Without known target thresholds, collar campaigns may result only in protection of the individual dog or its household.\nOf relevance to NTD elimination strategies, our data suggest that greater initial reductions in incidence may be achieved in communities with higher compared to lower preexisting transmission pressure. One prediction is that by reducing transmission, infection in the lower-prevalence settings becomes more clustered, thus more stable and more resilient to interventions[58]. Approaching elimination will require different control strategies to those used in the initial attack phase. For example, heterogeneities in household sand fly densities, and the transmission potential of individual vectors and reservoirs[53, 59, 60], imply the need for high coverage levels to encounter such transmission hotspots.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study promote the community-wide application of insecticide\u2013impregnated collars as a public health tool to reduce clinical VL burdens, not just human and canine infection. The observed level of impact was achieved working within the existing MoH infrastructure, demonstrating many desirable attributes of a potentially sustainable control program that could be scaled\u2013up with minimal additional technical capacity training."
