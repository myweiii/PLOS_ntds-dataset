Cells respond to cellular stress by decreasing protein translation, to prevent the formation of partially folded or misfolded new polypeptides whose accumulation can be detrimental to living cells. Under such conditions, the cells benefit from storing inactive mRNAs and stalled ribosomal particles, to maintain their availability once conditions improve; dedicated granules offer a solution for such storage. Leishmania parasites are exposed to a variety of stress conditions as a natural part of their life cycle, including the nutritional stress that the parasites experience within the gut of the sandfly. Thus, Leishmania and related trypanosomatids serve as a good model system to investigate RNA fate during different stress conditions. Various granules appear in Leishmania and related organisms in response to different stress conditions. Here, we investigated how nutritional stress, in particular elimination of purines, induced the formation of granules that harbor a specific cap-binding protein, LeishIF4E-3. The starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules consist of a variety of ribosomal proteins, along with RNA-binding proteins and mature mRNAs. We thus propose that Leishmania modulates the assembly of LeishIF4E-3-containing granules for transient storage of stalled ribosomal particles and inactive mRNAs. Following renewal of nutrient availability, as occurs during the parasiteâ€™s life cycle, the granules disappear. Although their fate is yet unclear, they could be recycled in the cell. Unlike other granules described in trypanosomes, the LeishIF4E-3-containing granules did not contain RNA degradation enzymes, suggesting that their function is mainly for storage until conditions improve.
