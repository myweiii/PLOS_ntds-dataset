Schistosomiasis japonica remains prevalent in China and in the Philippines. The current changes in the epidemiological and socio-economic picture in the endemic areas makes it imperative that affordable and more sensitive field diagnostics are developed as an important component to evaluate ongoing integrated control and elimination efforts. Three diagnostic approaches, namely Kato-Katz stool microscopy, ELISA and droplet digital PCR assays, were compared by detecting infection in a cohort from schistosome-endemic areas in the Philippines. This comprehensive comparison further defined the diagnostic performance and features for each assay. Prevalence of schistosomiasis determined by the SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA and ddPCRs was at least 2.5 times higher than that by the KK method. The prevalence determined by the SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA and ddPCRs was similar, but low agreements between these assays were evident. The ddPCR assays showed considerable diagnostic performance but the high associated costs and the need for specialized equipment present major obstacles in their application in screening campaigns although they can serve as reference standards for evaluating other diagnostic assays. The SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA represents a cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica and this assay could prove an important monitoring tool to evaluate the impact of integrated control measures over time.
