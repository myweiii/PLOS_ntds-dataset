High prevalence of loiasis can confound the mapping efforts for lymphatic filariasis (LF) that use tests for circulating filarial antigen. In order to develop a LF mapping strategy for loiasis endemic areas, we screened day blood samples from 5,001 subjects residing in 50 villages in 6 health districts throughout Cameroon. Circulating filarial antigen (FTS) rates varied from 0.3 to 2.2% between health districts while L. loa microfilaria (Mf) rates varied between 0 and 46%. Around 0.4% of the subjects with no or less than 8,000 Mf/ml were FTS positive, while 22.2% of subjects with >8,000 Mf/ml were FTS positive. A L. loa Mf density of >8,200 Mf/ml was determined as the cut point at which positive FTS results should be excluded from the analysis. No FTS positive sample was positive for W. bancrofti antibodies as measured by two different point of care tests that use an antigen not found in L. loa. Night blood examination of the FTS positive subjects also showed a high prevalence of L. loa Mf with densities up to 12,710 Mf/ml, but no W. bancrofti Mf as confirmed by qPCR. Our results show that high L. loa Mf in day blood (> 8,200 Mf/ml) are a predictor for FTS positivity and rapid antibody tests specific for W. bancrofti can be used to confirm the absence of W. bancrofti. Our study provides a simple day blood-based algorithm for LF mapping in loiasis areas. The results indicate that many districts that were formerly classified as endemic for LF in Cameroon are non-endemic and do not require mass drug administration for elimination of LF.
