The cell cycle is a complex and highly regulated cellular process in which different checkpoints are coordinated and a unique pattern of protein activities is present. In trypanosomatids, this process is even more complex because of the presence of the kinetoplast, a network of circular DNA inside a large mitochondrion that coordinates its division and segregation with the nuclear mitosis. Aurora kinases comprise a family of enzymes that regulate key steps during the cell cycle by varying their subcellular localization. In this work, we identified three Aurora kinase genes (TcAUK1, -2 and -3) in T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, and established that TcAUK1 has the typical behavior of a mammalian Aurora B kinase, localizing inside the nucleus and associating with the mitotic spindle during mitosis. On the other hand, during interphase TcAUK1, localizes at each side of the kinetoplast, showing a novel localization that has not been described before. Finally, here we present evidence for the relationship between the novel localization of TcAUK1 and its participation in kinetoplast division.
