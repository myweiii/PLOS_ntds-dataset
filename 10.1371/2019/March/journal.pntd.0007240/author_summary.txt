Natural compounds represent one of the richest sources for the discovery of new active compounds against diseases such as cancer or infections, including helminth infections that cause the highest disease burden in tropical countries. Surprisingly, insects have been almost completely neglected with respect to anthelminthics discovery although they represent the most species-rich class of animals known on earth, producing a wide spectrum of compounds with biological activities. In insect biotechnology, the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis raised high interest being a rich source of antimicrobial compounds such as the alkaloid harmonine. Harmonine is thought to act as a chemical weapon keeping otherwise detrimental microsporidia in the beetle under control. Testing the antiparasitic potential of harmonine against adult Schistosoma mansoni, one of the most harmful helminths worldwide, resulted in multifaceted negative effects. The compound damaged tissues essential for survival and reproduction of schistosomes (tegument, intestine, gonads) and also affected stem-cell proliferation. Furthermore, we obtained first evidence for acetylcholinesterase as one potential molecular target, which was partially inhibited by harmonine. This is the first time to proof a direct effect of a defined insect-derived compound on a helminth parasite, a finding that will encourage further studies to explore insects as sources of novel anthelminthics.
