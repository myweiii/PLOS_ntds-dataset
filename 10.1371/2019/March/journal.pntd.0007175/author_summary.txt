Equine trypanosomiasis is endemic in many areas of the world with high morbidity and mortality in affected populations. Trypanocides form an essential part of current treatment strategies but evidence regarding efficacy in equines is scarce. In order to inform disease management, the efficacy of three trypanocidal drugs was assessed in horses and donkeys that fulfilled 2/5 clinical inclusion criteria for trypanosomiasis in The Gambia. Selected equines received randomised treatment with either isometamidium, diminazene or melarsomine dihydrochloride and were observed for adverse drug reactions. Follow-up was performed at 1 and 2 weeks. Blood collected at each timepoint was analysed for Trypanosoma spp. using a PCR approach. Within the selected population 66% were PCR positive pre-treatment for Trypanosoma spp.. Trypanosome positive individuals responded favourably to each treatment, but clinical evaluation and PCR status post-treatment supported a superior effect for isometamidium. Melarsomine dihydrochloride had inferior efficacy to isometamidium. Immediate adverse side effects were only documented following isometamidium administration in donkeys (26%) and these were self-limiting. Diminazene had the longest duration of action as judged by PCR status. The data support the continued use of isometamidium and diminazene but not melarsomine dihydrochloride for trypanosomiasis in equines at the doses and routes of administration reported.
