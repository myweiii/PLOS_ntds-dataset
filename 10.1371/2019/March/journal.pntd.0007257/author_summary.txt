Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the virus that belongs to the same family as that of Ebola Virus disease. The disease is characterized by severe clinical symptoms such as high fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, and severe bleeding from most body openings. On average, 54% of the people who get infected with Marburg virus die from it [1]. In October 2017, Uganda reported an outbreak of MVD in the eastern district of Kween that borders Kenya in the Mount Elgon plains. This was the first time MVD was being detected in this part of the country since previous MVD outbreaks had been reported in the western part of Uganda. The Ministry of Health together with partners instituted rapid outbreak response for control. Investigations revealed a cluster of one family involving four cases whereby only one survived. The outbreak was traced back into bat caves in Kween district. Rock salt mining in the cave led to a spill-over of the virus into the human population with the subsequent person-to-person transmission. Through contact tracing and isolation of the infected people among other approaches, the outbreak was brought under control as explained in this article.
