Dengue is the most important vector-borne viral infection that endangers an estimated 2.5 billion people globally. The recently licensed dengue vaccine has major weaknesses and there are no antiviral drugs for the treatment of dengue related diseases. Identifying the virulence determinants is important for understanding the molecule bases of viral life cycle, also contributing to vaccine design and development. In this study, we analyzed the virulence differences among five DENV1 strains that obtained from the 2014 DENV outbreak in Guangzhou, China, and identified two novel virulence determining sites for DENV1. This study provides new ideas for investigation of DENV protein function, pathogenic mechanism and novel attenuated vaccine.
