VGSC mutations of Aedes aegypti threaten vector control programs and have been brought to attention in dengue endemic areas. Taiwan has suffered dengue outbreaks, which usually begin from an imported case. Pyrethroid insecticides were used to kill infectious females and adults in the surrounding environment of each suspected case. In Taiwan, V1016G and F1763Y mutations of VGSC have been described previously. Here, we further describe two additional amino acid substitutions (S989P, F1534C) and two forms of the intron between exon 20 and 21. We also propose six haplotypes for VGSC genes in Taiwan today. In conclusion, four kdr mutations (S989P, V1016G, F1534C and D1763Y) and two intron forms (Group A and B) are commonly found in local Ae. aegypti populations in Taiwan.
