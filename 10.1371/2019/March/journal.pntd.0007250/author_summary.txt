Coral snakes are distributed in the Americas form Southern United States to Argentina. These snakes cause envenomings that, despite not being common, often lead to death. The antivenoms currently produced to treat accidents caused by these snakes have limitations regarding the number of species venoms they could neutralize. Here, we present an antivenom with a wide spectrum of neutralization, when compared to other Anticoral antivenoms. Nevertheless, more studies are still necessary to evaluate its neutralization capacity against the venoms of other species. This antivenom has great potential, as it neutralizes the lethal effects of some of the most common Micrurus species in the Americas.
