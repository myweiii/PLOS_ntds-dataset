Although the public health significance of melioidosis as a particularly highly fatal emerging infectious disease threat in the tropics is being recognized, data on the risk factors and the geographic distribution of the disease is still limited. Previous studies have also largely been based on the investigation of case series data. Here, we extend these studies by employing a hospital-based matched case-control study to carry out a more robust examination of the demographic, socioeconomic, and landscape risk factors that may govern melioidosis incidence in the Alor Setar area of Kedah, State, a key disease endemic region of Malaysia. Our results indicate that melioidosis in northern Malaysia is significantly associated with gender, race, occupation, co-occurring chronic disease as well as living in risky landscapes, with disease risk increasing and declining non-linearly with the degree of ecosystem modification. These findings denote that the disease represents a complex socio-ecological public health problem in Kedah, and that its control requires an understanding and modification of both the human and natural variables that underlie disease transmission in this setting.
