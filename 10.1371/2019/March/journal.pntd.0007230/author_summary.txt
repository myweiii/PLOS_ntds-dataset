S. stercoralis is a soil transmitted helminth that is common in many subtropical and tropical countries, but is also found in other regions of the world. In this study we reviewed all published material on endemic infection of S. stercoralis acquired in Spain issued before 31st May 2018. We collected data from these articles and reported clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients. Our systematic review of the articles showed a clear geographical pattern; nearly 97% of the cases described had been acquired in the Valencia province. Most of them (82.9%) were male, and most had current or past dedication to agriculture. Our results showed that 70.3% had at least one condition or treatment that could have made them more vulnerable to suffer a severe form of this helminthic disease. Our data suggests that S. stercoralis infection probably remains underdiagnosed in Spanish population. Due to the scarce information available about endemic strongyloidiasis in Spain until now, we believe that the present work will be relevant and the conclusions derived from it might raise awareness about underdiagnosis. Transmission risk factors described in the people diagnosed may be key for prevention and control strategies implementation.
