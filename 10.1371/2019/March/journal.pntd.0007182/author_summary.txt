Scabies is a neglected tropical disease affecting more than 130 million people, with major costs on health care systems worldwide. While effective treatments exist, it is unknown which treatment strategies result in the best outcomes against the lowest costs, and to what extent this differs between communities. Health economic modelling can help answer these questions, but has rarely been used in this disease area. This review discusses all available scabies transmission models (n = 4), and uses them to create a new, comprehensive modelling framework. This framework can be used as aid for creating a scabies transmission model, the details of which will be determined by the context (population) and the question being addressed. The current paper also reviews the data that is needed to inform scabies modelling: on scabies biology, quality of life and resource use. Unfortunately, available data is limited and particularly data on crusted scabies (associated with high morbidity and mortality rates) is rare. With this review, we hope to assist researchers and policy makers to predict and/or evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions against scabies in their population(s) of interest. To tackle scabies, it is key to use effective treatment strategies in a cost-effective and sustainable way. The models and data described in this review, may help researchers, clinicians and funding bodies to facilitate this.
