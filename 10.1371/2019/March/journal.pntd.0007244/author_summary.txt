Tungiasis even though curable, continues to cause a lot of morbidity and in some cases death to millions of people living in tropical and subtropical countries. The global burden of tungiaisis is not known unlike for most diseases which attract a lot of attention and funding. There are also gaps on the exact geographical distribution of this disease and the communities affected, hence it is largely ignored and neglected by the scientific community, the health sector, pharmaceutical industries and policy makers. As a consequence, there are no universally accepted methods to treat and control tungiasis. The study attempted to close this gap by combining geographic information system and questionnaire data to visualize the burden and risk factors of tungiasis in Vihiga County, Kenya. The researchers found that tungiasis is an important health burden in Vihiga County, Kenya and that its occurrence was associated with factors that point to poverty. These findings suggest a need to design control strategies for tungiasis that are cost effective and easily accessible by the communities affected.
