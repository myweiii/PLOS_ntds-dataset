Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a lifelong and debilitating neglected illness of major significance in Latin America, for which no vaccine or adequate drugs are yet available. Identification of novel biomarkers able to transcend the current limits of diagnostic and/or therapeutic assessment methods hence surfaces as a main priority in Chagas disease applied research. In this framework, we herein undertook a thorough biochemical and antigenic characterization of T. cruzi TolT surface antigens. Our results unveil an unexpected complexity within this family, with at least 12 polymorphic TolT genes in the T. cruzi CL Brener reference strain genome. According to structural features, TolT deduced molecules could be split into three robust groups that show differences in their structural features, expression profile, sub-cellular distribution, post-translational modification(s) and antigenic structure. Overall, we show that TolT molecules are conspicuously expressed by both major mammal-dwelling stages of the parasite, and that they are differentially recognized by the immune system in Chagasic patients and in T. cruzi-infected mammals. Our findings are discussed in terms of the evolution and possible structural/functional roles of TolT molecules, as well as in terms of their applicability in Chagas disease serodiagnosis.
