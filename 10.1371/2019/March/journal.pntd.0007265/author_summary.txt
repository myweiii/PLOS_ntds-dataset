Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infects about 30–100 million people worldwide and it is the main causative agent of strongyloidiasis, a chronic parasitic infection. Similarly, tuberculosis (TB) affects nearly 2 billion people and both Ss and TB are co-endemic as well as share a major global disease burden. Earlier studies have revealed that helminth co-infection can modify the effect produced by the host immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, no studies have examined the association of helminth co-infection with extra-pulmonary TB, especially in tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL). In the present study, we have addressed this gap by measuring the cytokine profile in co-infected helminth-TBL individuals. Our study first shows that TBL-Ss+ co-infection is associated with “higher bacterial burden” in the affected lymph nodes. Our study also shows that co-infection is associated with alterations in plasma cytokines, specifically Type 2, regulatory and Type 17 cytokines were elevated and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced. Our study demonstrates significantly diminished unstimulated or TB—antigen stimulated levels of Type 1, Type 17 or IL-1 family of cytokines in TBL-Ss+ coinfected individuals. Hence, we conclude that helminth coinfection can possibly skew the protective immunity in TBL disease or infection.
