Mce1A protein is a cell surface protein encoded by the mce1A region of mce1 locus of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, and is involved in the bacteria’s invasion into epithelial cells. Using cloned sub domains of mce1A and peptides synthesized for these sub domains, cell entry studies and binding studies were performed. The present study revealed that the active sequence of M. leprae involved in the invasion into nasal mucosa epithelial cells is present in the 316–531 bp region of mce1A. The Mce1A protein is a good candidate as a contributor to invasion of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis into epithelial cells. The comparative data between Mce1A of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis was relied on to further elucidate the role of specific regions within Mce1A. The most important region of Mce1A protein involved in the invasion of M. tuberculosis into human epithelial cells is called the InvIII region, which is located between amino acids at position 130 to 152. The InvIII region of M. tuberculosis corresponds to InvXb of M. leprae. The sequences of these regions are identical between amino acids at positions 1 to position 22 as counted from the N terminus, except that amino acids at positions 1 to 3, 5, 8, 9, 13 are different between M. leprae and M. tuberculosis.
