Plasmodium vivax transmission is heterogeneous and discontinuous in the Peruvian Amazon. Such heterogeneity is the result of factors that include, but are not restricted to, the environment, public policies, and characteristics of the parasite, the vector, and human activities. All these factors make P. vivax transmission resilient to interventions. In order to achieve the goals of control and local elimination, P. vivax surveillance must inform how those factors sustain disease transmission in order to focalize and synchronize control strategies. In this study, we implemented molecular surveillance complemented with population genetic tools in the areas of Cahuide, Lupuna, and Santa Emilia located in the Peruvian Amazon. In particular, we characterize the transmission and the parasite genetic variation in these sites from September 2012 to March 2015. The changes in parasite diversity, the wide geographic dispersion of parasite subpopulation and the introduction of a new parasite clone or subpopulation in Lupuna documented in this study suggest that connectivity among the different endemic areas, likely due to human mobility, sustains disease transmission in the region hindering the success of control measures. This information must be considered in the design of current control strategies.
