Individuals and communities affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are often the poorest and most marginalised. Some NTDs (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis and trachoma) have been given specific targets for control and elimination by the year 2020. Reaching these goals is important for the attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as well as the Sustainable Development Goals and has been described as a litmus test. However, few studies have considered how fair progress toward attainment of these goals has been to date. We used qualitative research methods to explore the equity of progress toward these targets across four countries (Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia and Ghana). We used a framework for assessing health services coverage (The Tanahashi Framework) and combined it with gendered intersectional theory (a theory that helps us think about how individuals position of power and privilege shape their experience) to understand who is left behind and why in NTD programme delivery. We found that health systems challenges and limitations due to lack of consideration of gender and equity issues have left vulnerable populations underserved in relation to the prevention and treatment of PC NTDs. Key steps need to be taken at different health system levels to ensure the most vulnerable have continued access to future treatment options. This will contribute to the attainment of UHC, allowing the NTD community to continue to support their vision of being a true ‘litmus test’.
