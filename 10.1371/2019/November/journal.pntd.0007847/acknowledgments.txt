We would like to extend our thanks to all the community members and health systems actors who took the time to take part in the COUNTDOWN research programme across Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia and Nigeria. We would also like to thank the data collection teams across all of our study sites for their commitment to the COUNTDOWN research programme.
