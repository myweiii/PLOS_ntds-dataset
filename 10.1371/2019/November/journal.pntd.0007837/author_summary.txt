Dengue virus is the most common cause of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. Over half of the worldâ€™s population lives in an at risk area for dengue virus infection, and this number will continue to grow as climate change allows the mosquito vectors of dengue virus to expand their breeding ranges to more temperate climates. Currently, there are no specific treatments for dengue virus infection. Understanding how dengue virus causes hemorrhagic fever could inform the development of these much needed treatments. Populations of important immune system mediators, such as white blood cells and platelets, are significantly dysregulated during dengue virus infection. These cells originate in the bone marrow, which experiences significant suppression, including a complete ablation of megakaryocytes (platelet progenitor cells), during DENV infection. Here, we add to the knowledge on how dengue virus induces bone marrow suppression by investigating whether dengue virus infects human megakaryocytes. We discovered that dengue virus infects human megakaryocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of dengue virus infection; however, dengue virus infection does not appear to directly affect viability of human megakaryocytes. Future studies will investigate whether infected megakaryocytes are still able to perform their functions of producing platelets and maintaining bone marrow homeostasis.
