Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoon Trypanosoma cruzi, is the third most common parasitic infection worldwide, the most important in Latin America and is an emerging disease in non-endemic countries. Actually, millions of people live in areas of exposure and are at risk of contracting the infection. Most of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic for all of their lives, but around 30% of the chronically infected individuals develop irreversible cardiac damage and 10% digestive lesions. Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in the susceptibility or resistance to Chagas disease. In this work, we investigated variants of the IL18 gene in different Latin America populations. This gene encoded the interleukin-18, which is involved in the immune response to intracellular pathogens like T. cruzi. Our results showed that an IL18 gene variant plays an important role in the protection against T. cruzi infection.
