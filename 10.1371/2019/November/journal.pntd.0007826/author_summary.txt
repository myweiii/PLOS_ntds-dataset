Over 200 million people are infected with schistosomiasis, yet there are limited therapeutic options available to treat this disease. The benzodiazepine meclonazepam is known to cure both intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis in animal and human studies, but dose-limiting sedation has been a barrier to its development. Little is known about the structure-activity relationship of meclonazepam and other benzodiazepines on schistosomes, or the identity of the parasite receptor for these compounds. However, schistosomes lack obvious homologs to the human GABAARs that cause sedation. This indicates that the parasite target of this drug is distinct from the host receptors that underpin dose-limiting side effects of meclonazepam and raises the possibility that benzodiazepines with poor GABAAR affinity may still retain anti-parasitic effects. Here, we report an in vitro screen of various benzodiazepines against schistosomes, and the identification of hit compounds that are active against worms yet display reduced affinity for the human GABAAR that causes sedation.
