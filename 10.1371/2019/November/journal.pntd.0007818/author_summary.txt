The Voltage Gated Sodium Channel (VGSC) in insect is targeted by pyrethroid insecticides and genetic variations in the protein are known to confer pyrethroid resistance. Since the VGSC gene in genome consists of many exons and long introns, there is no simple method to genotype whole of coding regions from the genomic DNA of insect. Here, we designed hybridization capture probe set to concentrate VGSC coding exons in NGS library from individual genomic DNA of the arbovirus vector mosquito Aedes albopictus. The probe set we designed was able to capture VGSC exons not only from A. albopictus genomic DNA but also from genomic DNA of two other mosquito species belonging to the same subfamily only with slight decrease of efficiency. The technology will allow unbiased analysis of the VGSC gene in multiple mosquito species with relatively low sequencing cost and enhance discovery of new resistance mutations.
