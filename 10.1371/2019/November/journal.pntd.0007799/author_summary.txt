The development of stomach diseases like gastritis, ulcer and cancer are associated with several factors, which include the colonized stomach bacteria, lifestyle, the environment and the host genes. Soon after its discovery, the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori were linked with stomach diseases like gastritis, stomach ulcer and cancer. However not all H. pylori infected individuals develop stomach disease, and not all patients with stomach disease have H. pylori infection. Initially, H. pylori were thought to be the only relevant bacterial coloniser of the human stomach, but several studies have shown that bacteria other than H. pylori can also colonise in human stomach. The role of these bacteria remained unclear, but it has been shown that the bacterial diversity in stomach differs depending on whether H. pylori is present or not. This work illustrates that Mycobacterium abscessus, a non-tuberculous bacteria is among the most frequently observed gastric bacteria in individuals with various stomach diseases and it is important to evaluate the significance of this infection.
