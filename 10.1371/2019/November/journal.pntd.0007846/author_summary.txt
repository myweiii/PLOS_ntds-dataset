Angiostrongylus cantonensis, rat lungworm, is a common pathogen that causes human eosinophilic meningitis via eating contaminated food. Human angiostrongyliasis has been reported globally. This worm has a complex life-cycle, which includes an especially wide range of snails as intermediate hosts, making it more difficult to eradicate. In this study, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome, and performed comparative analyses to study the potential genetics of its biology using short-read and long-read sequencing technologies. We revealed some potential adaptive evolution in the genome, such as the expansion of retrotransposons and gene families encoding antioxidant enzymes, invasion, migration and digestion related proteases. Specifically, we found a potential clue suggesting convergent evolution of EC-SODs in Angiostrongylus and flukes, all of which require snails as intermediate hosts. These results provide an abundant data resource to study the biology and evolution of A. cantonensis and showed some potential targets against A. cantonensis and helminths with similar traits.
