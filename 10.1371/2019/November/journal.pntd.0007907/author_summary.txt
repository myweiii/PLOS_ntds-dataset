Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world and is caused by bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue infection is a systemic and dynamic disease with a wide clinical spectrum that includes both severe and non-severe manifestations. In some cases dengue can lead to death. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates. Without a cure or routinely available vaccine, dengue control relies largely on reduction and avoidance mosquitoes. In Cambodia dengue mosquito control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. The current qualitative study was designed to better understand the community acceptance and perceptions of biological controls that would overcome insecticide resistance for consideration in dengue control strategies for the future. Two control methods were deployed in different size water containers: (1) guppy fish to predate mosquito larvae in large containers, and (2) a slow-release larvicide (pyriproxyfen) product in small containers. A total of 103 people participated in 12 FGDs and nine IDIs. Both methods were generally seen positively. The advantages of guppy fish were their ease of use and rearing, and evident propensity to eat larvae. The advantages of pyriproxyfen was its long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell, and easy maintenance. Interpersonal communication through health volunteers was the most preferred method of transmitting prevention messages. Both mosquito control interventions should be considered in future projects in Cambodia.
