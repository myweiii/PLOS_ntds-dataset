Lymphatic and visceral filariasis, as well as loiasis and onchocerciasis, are parasitic infections caused by filarial nematodes that can cause extensive and diverse clinical manifestations, including edemas of the lower limbs and visual impairment. These parasites successfully maintain a crosstalk with the immune system of their host and one potential mediator of this communication is extracellular small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) released by the parasite. However, little is known of the mechanisms of sRNA export, how the exported sRNAs differ between lifecycle stages, and how the parasite microenvironment (e.g. in vitro vs. in vivo) contributes to the composition of sRNAs that can be detected. In this report, we show that all the developmental stages of the filarial parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis release sRNAs, which include tRNA fragments and miRNAs, in vitro. A subset of the miRNAs are differentially represented in the ES products between adult stages (males and gravid females) and larval stages (microfilariae) in vitro, however all of the miRNAs detected in serum or macrophages in vivo are present in the ES from all life stages. We show that the parasite-derived miRNAs are protected from degradation in vitro and are stable in vivo, as they are readily detectable in the serum of infected jirds. Several parasite miRNAs are also detected within macrophages purified from infected hosts, consistent with parasite RNAs having a yet unidentified functional role in host cells.
