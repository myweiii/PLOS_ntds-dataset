Ascariasis is considered a major problem for the public health system, which has an estimated 800 million infected people worldwide. It occurs in the United States, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and is generally associated with poverty and precarious health conditions. Pulmonary fibrosis affects 14â€“63 people per 100,000 habitants/year, and is characterized by collagen deposition and alveolar wall thickening. The comorbidities caused by infections are commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis exacerbations, poor prognosis, and high mortality. Despite the comorbidities caused by helminth infections, which display a pulmonary parasitic cycle such as that of Ascaris, there is no evidence relating to pulmonary fibrosis progression, possibly because Ascariasis is considered a neglected disease. We evaluated the role of Ascaris during pulmonary fibrosis. We considered two simple questions: (1) Whether Ascaris infection could protect or aggravate fibrosis (comorbidities) and (2) whether pulmonary fibrosis could change the cycle of Ascaris as a result of increased alveolar thickening, larvae retention, and the limitation of influx into airways. We answered both questions as follows: (1) Ascaris infection exacerbates pulmonary and liver injury and inflammation, but not fibrosis; and (2) Pulmonary fibrosis did not alter the course of Ascaris cycle in lungs during transmigration into airways, because Ascaris preferentially seeks and penetrates into the lung areas, which are thought to be preserved, but not into fibrotic areas.
