Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection caused by dengue viruses (DENV), and is currently a major public health concern worldwide. No antiviral drug for dengue is available. To develop a potent inhibitor of the DENV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), we performed a high-throughput screening of a fragment library. We identified RK-0404678 as a potent inhibitor of the DENV RdRp. Interestingly, we found that RK-0404678 binds to two distinct sites in the DENV RdRp domains. Site 1 lies in the thumb domain, which is distant from the active site, and Site 2 is located in the active site of the RdRp domain. RK-0404678 binding to Site 2 induces a conformational change around the Tyr607 residue. These are unique features among the known RdRp inhibitors. In addition, our adaptation experiment demonstrated that this compound imposed a high genetic barrier to the emergence of an RK-0404678-resistant virus. These characteristics of RK-0404678 suggest that this inhibitor is a promising lead compound for the development of anti-dengue therapeutics.
