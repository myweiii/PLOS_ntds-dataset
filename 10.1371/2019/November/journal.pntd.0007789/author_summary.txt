Leptospirosis, an important emerging neglected zoonotic disease, is caused by Leptospira and affects humans as well as animals. Due to the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the development of alternatives to antibiotics has become an inevitable requirement in this new situation. Immunoregulators act as biological response regulators that do not induce toxicity, side effects, or resistance and can enhance, regulate, and restore nonspecific immunity to a host's immune response. β-Glucan, an immunostimulant, increased the survival rate, alleviated tissue injury, and decreased the abundance of leptospires in target organs. β-Glucan enhanced the inflammatory response, which was associated with enhanced prevention hamsters from Leptospira infection. Our findings also demonstrated that β-glucan-induced trained immunity protected against Leptospira infection. These results contributed to an explanation for the preventable mechanism against Leptospira infection and revealed that β-glucan and even other immunostimulants could be potent and valuable agents for controlling Leptospira infection.
