We established a SFTS nomogram scoring system, which is the first nomogram for this disease. According to this nomogram, patients were divided into three levels of mortality risk: low, moderate, and high. This scoring system is helpful to identify critically ill patients, allowing for early intervention and intensive care, which may contribute to reducing the mortality of SFTS.
