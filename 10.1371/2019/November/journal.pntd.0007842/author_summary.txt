Development of resistance against insecticides has challenged mosquito control programmes globally and prompted the research of alternative options that can complement insecticides. An insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen (PPF) usage against mosquitoes can effectively reduce the vector population. PPF mainly inhibits the metamorphosis of mosquito larvae into pupae and prevent the adult emergence, therefore it is generally applied in mosquito breeding habitats. PPF has been shown to exhibit delayed residual effect that may impair the reproductive capacity by affecting the survival, fecundity and fertility of adult mosquito exposed through tarsal contact. Presently, the effectiveness of different concentrations of PPF intended to be delivered through contact have been evaluated against dengue vector Ae. aegypti. Results suggested that very low PPF concentration treated surfaces drastically reduce the fecundity, fertility and adult emergence in mosquitoes. Study suggests that control interventions based on PPF-treated surfaces could provide an additional route to target mosquito vector control by overall population density reduction.
