The study of enteric pathogens has progressed from examining single isolates to being able to integrate large amounts of genomic and epidemiological data. These types of analyses have allowed the identification of trends in the genomic data that would have remained unexamined with technologies that have less resolution. In the current study the genomic content of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates from Chile was compared to that of previously sequenced isolates that represent the global distribution of ETEC. We identified genomic content and virulence factor combinations that are common and unique to ETEC in Chile compared to a global collection of ETEC. Completion of the extrachromosomal plasmids, which contained the majority of the virulence factors, also identified common genetic themes among ETEC from Chile. This study highlights the diversity of ETEC in Chile and provides additional avenues of research to examine these important human pathogens.
