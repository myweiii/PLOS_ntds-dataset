Parasites can manipulate host immune responses to build favorable environment to them. Because this parasite-driven immune modulation is often linked to symptoms in infected individuals, not only parasiticidal compounds but also immunological interventions limiting such the parasites’ abilities will serve as treatment options. In this study, we studied the mechanism and its role of hemophagocytosis (the phenomenon whereby macrophages engulf erythrocytes) caused by Leishmania donovani, a causative agent of VL. In vitro experiments revealed parasites have ability to directly disrupt macrophage’s recognition of self-cells, and that the induced engulfment of erythrocytes by L. donovani infection is beneficial to the parasites for their intracellular survival. These results suggest that Leishmania parasites actively induce hemophagocytosis by manipulating the ‘don’t-eat-me’ signal in macrophages for their survival. Although it is still to be determined how Leishmania parasites change the ‘don’t-eat-me’ signal in macrophages, our study may facilitate development of an immunotherapy which limits the change and lead to improvement of anemia due to hemophagocytosis as well as control of parasite survival.
