Childhood undernutrition is widespread throughout the world and has severe, long-lasting health impacts. Substances measured in blood, urine and stool could be used as biomarkers to identify children undergoing growth failure before these impacts occur. However, it is not yet known which of the many markers that can be identified are accurate and clinically useful predictors of poor growth in infants and children. This study used a large number of candidate biomarkers of immune activation, metabolism and hormones and applied statistical methods to narrow them down from 110 different substances, to the 36 best predictors of growth in 258 Peruvian infants. It also estimated how large the effect of each of these markers was on height two months later. The biomarker with the largest effect was transferrin, a glycoprotein that can be measured in blood samples. 15-month old children with elevated transferrin were around two thirds of a centimeter taller on average at 17 months than those with low levels. Transferrin and other proteins, glycoproteins, hormones and antibodies that this study identified, can be measured easily and affordably in standard laboratories making them feasible to be used broadly as prognostic markers as part of child health and nutrition programs in under-resourced settings.
