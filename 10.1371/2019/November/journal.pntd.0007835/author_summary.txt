As an individual with trichiasis blinks, the eyelashes abrade the cornea, which can lead to corneal opacity and blindness. Through high quality surgery, which involves altering the position of the eyelid margin, it is possible to reduce the number of people with trichiasis. Accurate estimates of the number of persons with trichiasis and their geographical distribution are needed in order to effectively align resources for surgery and other necessary services. We obtained district-level trichiasis prevalence estimates for 44 endemic and previously-endemic countries. We used the most recently available data and expert assessments to estimate the global burden of trichiasis. We estimated that in 2016 the global burden was 2.8 million cases (95% CI 1.1â€“5.2 million).
The 2016 estimate is lower than previous estimates, probably due to more and better data; scale-up of trichiasis management services; and reductions in incidence due to lower active trachoma prevalence.
