    "Introduction": "Few studies have simultaneously examined the role of sanitation conditions at the home, school, and community on soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection. We examined the contribution of each domain that children inhabit (home, village, and school) to STH infection and estimated the association of STH infection with sanitation in each domain.",
    "Methods": "Using data from 4,104 children from Kwale County, Kenya, who reported attending school, we used logistic regression models with cross-classified random effects to calculate measures of general contextual effects and estimate associations of village sanitation coverage (percentage of households with reported access to sanitation), school sanitation coverage (number of usable toilets per enrolled pupil), and sanitation access at home with STH infection.",
    "Findings": "We found reported use of a sanitation facility by households was associated with reduced prevalence of hookworm infection but not with reduced prevalence of T. trichiura infection. School sanitation coverage > 3 toilets per 100 pupils was associated with lower prevalence of hookworm infection. School sanitation was not associated with T. trichiura infection. Village sanitation coverage > 81% was associated with reduced prevalence of T. trichiura infection, but no protective association was detected for hookworm infection. General contextual effects represented by residual heterogeneity between village and school domains had comparable impact upon likelihood of hookworm and T. trichiura infection as sanitation coverage in either of these domains.",
    "Conclusion": "Findings support the importance of providing good sanitation facilities to support mass drug administration in reducing the burden of STH infection in children."
