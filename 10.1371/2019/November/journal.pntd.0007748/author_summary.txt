Leishmaniasis is one of the most important neglected parasitic diseases in humans worldwide. American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is a disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, which are injected into the skin by small insects known by sandflies. Many different Leishmania species may cause ATL, which can affect the skin and/or oral and nasal mucosa. In this study, we analyzed flows between the likely location of infection (LLI) and the place of residence (PR) in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state and identified Leishmania species isolated from travelers and migrants attended between 2000 and 2015 in a reference hospital for the care of patients with ATL. This work is the first contribution to knowledge about the routes of Leishmania species introduced to RJ state by migrant and traveling patients. In addition to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, which was the most common species, other species have also been introduced to RJ state, including L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (V.) naiffi, L. (Leishmania) amazonensis, and genetic variants of L. (V.) braziliensis. Knowledge of the migratory flow and geographic location of these imported Leishmania species may contribute to the surveillance and control of ATL in RJ state, Brazil.
