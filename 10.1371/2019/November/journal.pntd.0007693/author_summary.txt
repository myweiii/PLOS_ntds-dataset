Human schistosomiasis is caused by infection with parasitic blood fluke worms. Global control of this NTD is currently facilitated by administration of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). This mono-chemotherapeutic strategy of schistosomiasis control presents challenges as PZQ is not active against all human-dwelling schistosome lifecycle stages and the evolution of PZQ resistant parasites remains a threat. Therefore, new drugs to be used in combination with or in replacement of PZQ are urgently needed. Here, continuing our studies on Schistosoma mansoni epigenetic processes, we performed anthelmintic screening of 37 epigenetic probes/epigenetic inhibitors obtained from the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC). The results of these studies highlighted that schistosome protein methylation/demethylation processes are acutely vulnerable. In particular, compounds affecting schistosome SMYD (LLY-507, BAY-598) or JMJD (GSK-J4) homologues are especially active on schistosomula and adult worms during in vitro phenotypic drug screens. The active epigenetic probes identified here as well as their corresponding S. mansoni protein targets offers new starting points for the development of next-generation anti-schistosomals.
