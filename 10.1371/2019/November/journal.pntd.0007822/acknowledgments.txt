We wish to thank all participating students for their cooperation and patience during all of the observations and their parents for consenting their participation. We are most grateful to the schools, head teachers and teachers, for allowing us to conduct the study in their schools and for being so supportive throughout the study. Our gratitude goes to social worker Esther Fondo for managing and caring for the students and the community volunteers who assisted with identifying students, washing them and conducting follow-up visits. We thank Baldwyn Torto, Xavier Cheseto and Ruth Kihika for the chemical analysis of the neem samples, and Patrick Sawa for providing medical oversight for the trial. Lastly, we thank the Kilifi Health Management Team and Research Committee for their support, particularly Omar Sigomba and the Public and Community Health Officers, Arthur Mwangi, John Jewa and Fanuel Mwachoffi for their assistance.
