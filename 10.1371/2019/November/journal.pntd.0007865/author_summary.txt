Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different species and sub-species of the intracellular parasite Leishmania. It is prevalent mainly in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. Disease manifestations range from self-healing cutaneous lesions to chronic form of the disease, depending on the infecting species of Leishmania and host immune protection. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are largely unknown. Lymphocytes play a central role in the protection against Leishmania infection; however, their role in pathogenesis is poorly defined. Experimental infection studies showed the inconsistent role of lymphocytes in pathogenesis. Here, we compared disease outcomes in mice infected with different strains of Leishmania major, either Friedlin or 5ASKH. The pathogenesis caused by L. major 5ASKH infection was suppressed by the lymphocytes, while it was augmented by the lymphocytes during L. major Friedlin infection. Thus we found that the influence of lymphocytes in pathogenesis was determined by the genetic background of the parasites.
