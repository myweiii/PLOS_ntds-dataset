Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa most affected by the HIV-1 epidemic. Schistosomiasis causes genital damage when schistosome ova become lodged in the female genital tract, inducing inflammation that may elevate HIV-1 genital viral loads and increase the risk of HIV-1 transmission. Schistosomiasis may also promote viral replication by facilitating cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1, elevating HIV-1 plasma viral load levels. Using data from 370 individuals residing in Kenya or Uganda who acquired HIV-1 while participating in one of four prospective cohort studies, we tested the hypotheses that schistosomiasis increases plasma and genital viral load levels. We found no evidence that individuals with schistosomiasis had higher set point plasma viral load levels, a measure of viral replication obtained during the set point period 4â€“24 months after HIV-1 acquisition when viral load levels remain relatively stable. Additionally, we found no evidence that schistosomiasis was associated with higher female set point genital viral loads measured from vaginal or cervical swabs. Unexpectedly, we found that S. mansoni infection was associated with a decline in plasma viral load levels while S. haematobium infection was associated with a decline in cervical viral load levels. Thus, our results do not support the hypotheses that schistosomiasis increases plasma and genital HIV-1 viral loads.
