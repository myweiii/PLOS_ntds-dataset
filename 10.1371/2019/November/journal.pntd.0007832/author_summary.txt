Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a widespread severe chronic disease in dogs, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies, of which the most important one in southwestern Europe is Phlebotomus perniciosus. A sand fly bite is accompanied by the inoculation of saliva, which elicits a specific antibody response in the host. Past studies have used these antibodies as markers of exposure to sand flies. Recently, a rapid sand fly exposure test was prepared using one salivary protein of P. perniciosus, the SP03B protein. This rapid test possessed a high sensitivity and specificity when screening experimentally exposed versus non-bitten dogs. However, since naturally exposed dogs possess a higher variability of antibodies against sand fly saliva, we have optimized the previously proposed rapid test and evaluated its detectability on field samples. In this study we present the optimized rSP03B sero-strip that possesses a higher specificity and an ability to detect seropositive dogs from a naturally exposed dog population in a similar fashion as standard serological methods. Furthermore, we have optimized it with whole canine blood which renders it suitable for use in field conditions.
