Here we show that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) can be re-purposed from cancer immunotherapeutics to anti-protozoals by changing the specificity of the immunoglobulin to target a trypanosome cell surface receptor. Trypanosomes were used as a model system due to the availability of receptor null cell lines that allowed the unambiguous demonstration that ADCs targeted to a parasite surface receptor could be specifically internalised via receptor-mediated endocytosis. A single low dose of the resulting ADC was able to cure a stage 1 mouse model of trypanosome infection. We have used toxins and conjugation chemistry that are identical to anti-cancer ADCs demonstrating the ability to piggy-back onto the huge research efforts and resources that are being invested in the development of such ADCs.
The potential for development of ADCs against a wide range of human pathogens is vast, where only epitope binding sites need vary in order to provide selectivity. This provides a far-reaching opportunity for the rapid development of novel anti-protozoals for the targeted killing of a wide range of pathogens that cause disease worldwide, especially in developing countries.
