Soil-transmitted helminths affect more than 1.5 billion people, mostly in very poor regions without proper sanitation. To control infections, countries periodically give deworming drugs to populations at risk, such as school-age children, based on the results of diagnostic testing to determine the prevalence of infection. The current method to detect infection works when infections are prevalent, but is less useful after repeated deworming, when disease prevalence is lower. We conducted formative research—including user and market research—to inform development of a new diagnostic tool with improved sensitivity. Findings from this research highlight pain points with current methods and processes, which are also opportunities for innovation. Access to new STH diagnostics may improve program decision-making and eventually contribute to elimination of these infections.
