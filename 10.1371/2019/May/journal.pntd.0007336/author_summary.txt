The zoonotic parasite Taenia solium, commonly known as the pork tapeworm, causes substantial public health and economic losses worldwide. It is commonly found in low-income countries where pigs are raised in areas of poor sanitation, including Zambia. The links between the parasite and its different disease forms in humans and pigs are not very well known, and ignorance of the parasite is a known risk factor for infection. Health education can significantly increase knowledge and awareness of the parasite and can inspire behavioral change that reduces disease transmission. ‘The Vicious Worm’ is a computer-based program designed to provide T. solium education in a fun and interactive way. We conducted educational workshops in three primary schools in rural areas of eastern Zambia, and preliminary assessment indicated that the ‘Vicious Worm’ educational content significantly improved students’ knowledge of T. solium. We also conducted follow-up studies in the same students one year later, and discovered that the students’ knowledge was still significantly higher than at baseline. We conclude that ‘The Vicious Worm’ may be a useful educational component to enable targeting of school students, and would recommend its inclusion in integrated T. solium control programs in future.
