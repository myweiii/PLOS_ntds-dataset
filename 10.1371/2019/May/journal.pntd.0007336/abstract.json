    "Background": "Taenia solium is a neglected zoonotic parasite endemic throughout many low-income countries worldwide, including Zambia, where it causes human and pig diseases with high health and socioeconomic burdens. Lack of knowledge is a recognized risk factor, and consequently targeted health educational programs can decrease parasite transmission and disease occurrence in endemic areas. Preliminary assessment of the computer-based education program \u2018The Vicious Worm\u2019 in rural areas of eastern Zambia indicated that it was effective at increasing knowledge of T. solium in primary school students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of \u2018The Vicious Worm\u2019 on knowledge retention by re-assessing the same primary school students one year after the initial education workshops.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Follow-up questionnaires were administered in the original three primary schools in eastern Zambia in 2017, 12 months after the original workshops. In total, 86 pupils participated in the follow-up sessions, representing 87% of the initial workshop respondents. Knowledge of T. solium at \u2018follow-up\u2019 was significantly higher than at the initial \u2018pre\u2019 questionnaire administered during the Vicious Worm workshop that took place one year earlier. While some specifics of the parasite\u2019s life cycle were not completely understood, the key messages for disease prevention, such as the importance of hand washing and properly cooking pork, remained well understood by the students, even one year later.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Results of this study indicate that \u2018The Vicious Worm\u2019 may be an effective tool for both short- and long-term T. solium education of rural primary school students in Zambia. Inclusion of educational workshops using \u2018The Vicious Worm\u2019 could be recommended for integrated cysticercosis control/elimination programs in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly if the content is simplified to focus on the key messages for prevention of disease transmission."
