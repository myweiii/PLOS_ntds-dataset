At least 5–10 million people live with the Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) worldwide, and around 0.25–5% of them may develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/Tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), which is associated with chronic inflammation. In this study, involving 175 HTLV-1-infected subjects originally classified as asymptomatic, we found that 42 of them in reality presented some early clinical conditions, including alterations related not only to the neurological system, but also to the eyes and the skin. We called such conditions intermediate syndrome. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that all HTLV-1-infected subjects should be monitored for symptoms that may arise earlier in the course of their infection.
