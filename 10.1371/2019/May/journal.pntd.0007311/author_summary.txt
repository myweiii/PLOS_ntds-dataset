Brucellosis is endemic in Zimbabwe. This article describes the use of various assays such as AMOS, Bruce-ladder, MLVA, and whole genome sequencing to characterize Brucella species isolated from different animals in Zimbabwe. Choice of which assays to use in the laboratory is generally done considering reproducibility, robustness, expertise and affordability in a given setting. As evidenced in this study, most laboratories in Africa lack resources especially finances, equipments and expertise to perform necessary tests for diagnosis and identification of specific pathogens. The study shows that the differentiation of species can be correctly concluded from the analysis with AMOS, Bruce-ladder and MLVA16 assays. Furthermore, MLVA16 can be used as an epidemiological tool and traceback of outbreaks. These PCR assays can therefore add to the control and eradication of brucellosis, since the Brucella species (B. ovis, B. abortus, B. suis and B. canis) existing in Zimbabwe could be identified and characterized.
