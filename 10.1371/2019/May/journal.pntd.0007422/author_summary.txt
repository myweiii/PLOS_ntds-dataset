It is critical that we develop new strategies for the environmentally safe control of disease vector mosquitoes. In this study, bakerâ€™s yeast was genetically engineered to produce interfering RNA molecules corresponding to the mosquito synaptotagmin (syt) gene, but which do not match any genes in humans or other non-target organisms. Larval consumption of the yeast, which was prepared in a ready-to-use dried inactivated tablet formulation, turned off the syt gene and disrupted function of the mosquito nervous system. The yeast larvicide induced high levels of larval mortality in a variety of different human disease vector mosquito species. Inactivated yeast interfering RNA tablets performed well in contained semi-field experiments, suggesting that this technology, if further developed and optimized in the field, could one day be used for the biorational control of mosquitoes and the prevention of multiple mosquito-borne illnesses.
