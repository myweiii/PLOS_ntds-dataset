Human infection by different arthropod borne viruses such as Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika causes a continuous and extensive health burden mainly in tropical regions of the world. Most of the CHIKV infections result in only mild symptoms, however more extreme manifestations can occur, occasionally leading to death. Different CHIKV genotypes have been circulating in almost all continent around the globe but so far human outbreaks were reported only for single CHIKV genotypes. In Brazil two CHIKV genotypes arrived in the North and Northeast region: the Asian/Caribbean and African ECSA respectively. Here, through viral genome sequencing, we showed that some samples were coinfected by both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA CHIKV genotypes, indicating that these two genotypes expanded their ranges and currently co-circulate in some areas of Brazil. In summary, such findings call for improved surveillance in order to detect co-circulation of different viral genotypes and further evaluate the impact of co-infection in disease epidemiology.
