Anisakiasis is a zoonotic disease (infection transmitted between animals and humans) contracted by consumption of raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with Anisakis spp. nematode larvae. Anisakiasis usually presents with variable and unspecific gastrointestinal and/or allergic symptoms, which accounts for the high rate of misdiagnosed cases. Due to changes in dietary habits, such as eating raw or undercooked seafood, anisakiasis is considered an emerging public health problem. Despite the increase in number of reported cases worldwide, mechanisms of immune response to this unspecific human pathogen are poorly known. We have shown that in experimentally infected rats, Anisakis larvae cause severe hemorrhages and necrotic changes of affected tissues in the early phase of infections. Neutrophils and macrophages were abundantly present in tissue lesions, while eosinophils, hallmark of helminth infections, were scarcely present. We have also demonstrated particularly strong expression of several inflammatory genes. Moreover, we give for the first-time insight into putative regulatory mechanism mediated via a distinct class of RNA molecules. Our study may provide new opportunities for better understanding of cellular and molecular response to Anisakis spp., aiming at development of more specific therapeutics and alleviation of pathologies associated with Anisakis spp. infection.
