A half century ago, investigators identified cellulose in the Acanthamoeba cyst wall, which has two layers and conical ostioles that connect them. Here we showed cyst walls contain three large sets of cellulose-binding lectins, which localize to the ectocyst layer (a Jonah lectin) or to the endocyst layer and ostioles (Luke and Leo lectins). We used the lectins to establish a sequence for cyst wall assembly when trophozoites are starved and encyst. In the first stage, a Jonah lectin and glycopolymers were present in dozens of distinct vesicles. In the second stage, a primordial wall contained small, flat ostioles outlined by a Luke lectin. In the third stage, a Jonah lectin remained in the ectocyst layer, while Luke and Leo lectins moved to the endocyst layer and ostioles. A description of the major events during cyst wall development is a starting point for mechanistic studies of its assembly.
