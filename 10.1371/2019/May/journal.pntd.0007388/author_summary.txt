Cutaneous leishmaniasis form disfiguring lesions that leads to depression and social isolation. Both consequences result often in economic and education loss for communities already short on resources. The actual treatment aims to eliminate the protozoa disease-vector. Yet, it presents undesired effects or parasite resistance, besides the need for intravenous infusions and hospitalization. There is a few topical leishmanicidals but none with prolonged action. As highlighted, no ideal therapy exists; we must keep searching for alternatives, which includes new drugs, vehicles or therapies. For drugs, the most cost-effective way comprises testing approved molecules for other diseases, such as the antimicrobial polymyxin B (polB). Repositioning a drug has the added benefit of known safety profile and drawbacks, shortening and narrowing the research path. In turn, carriers can decrease side-effects and multiple dosing. They shield and/or improve drug targeting, which in this case means delivering inside macrophages infected with Leishmania. An example is poly (n-butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (PBCAnp), shown as an efficient carrier for targeting an extended drug release. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate leishmanicidal and adjuvant properties of polB, alone and absorbed onto PBCAnp.
