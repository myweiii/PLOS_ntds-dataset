Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most prevalent opportunistic microsporidian species causing diarrhea in humans and animals worldwide. Due to frequent occurrence of chronic or life-threatening diarrhea mainly in HIV/AIDS patients and others patients such as elderly people, transplant recipients and cancer patients, epidemiological studies of E. bieneusi focus on this susceptible population. Asymptomatic carriers of E. bieneusi are often neglected, and their role in the transmission of this microorganism is not paid enough attention. The prevalence of E. bieneusi is also actually related to the geographical locations, the populations and the socioeconomic conditions. The infectious diseases usually disproportionately affect poor populations. In China, although total economy has developed rapidly, there is the regional imbalance in economic development and some minority areas remain poor. Thus, we carried out a molecular epidemiology survey of E. bieneusi among 289 Yao people with and without diarrhea from a poverty-stricken ethnic township. We identified E. bieneusi in 8.30% (24/289) of people, with the majority (83.33%, 20/24) of positive individuals having no diarrhea. Meanwhile, zoonotic genotype Peru6 was found to be dominant in infected people. Our study emphasizes the importance and significance in epidemiological surveys of E. bieneusi in non-diarrheal people and assessment of risk factors for E. bieneusi infection.
