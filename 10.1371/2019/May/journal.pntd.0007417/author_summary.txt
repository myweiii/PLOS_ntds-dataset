Oral cholera vaccines are increasingly used as public health tools for prevention of cholera and curtailing the spread of outbreaks. However, current killed vaccines provide minimal protection in young children, who are especially susceptible to this diarrheal disease, and require ~7–14 days between vaccination and development of protective immunity. We recently created HaitiV, a live-attenuated oral cholera vaccine candidate derived from a clinical isolate from the Haiti cholera outbreak. Unexpectedly, HaitiV protected against cholera-like illness in infant rabbits within 24 hours of administration, before the onset of adaptive immunity. However, HaitiV’s capacity to stimulate adaptive immune responses against the cholera pathogen were not investigated. Here, we report that HaitiV induces immunological correlates of protection against cholera in adult germ-free mice and leads to protection against disease in their offspring. Protection against disease was transferable through the milk of the immunized mice and was not due to transmission or colonization of HaitiV in this model. Coupling the immunogenicity data presented here with our previous observation that HaitiV can protect from cholera prior to the induction of adaptive immunity, we propose that HaitiV may provide both rapid-onset short-term protection from disease while eliciting stable and long-lasting immunity against cholera.
