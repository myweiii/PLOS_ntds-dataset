SFTS now brings about a substantial global public health concern. Preexisting chronic conditions were thought to increase risk of severe SFTSV infections, however with sparse data mining efforts. In this study, we quantified the frequency of chronic comorbidities in SFTS, estimated their contribution to disease severity, and separately evaluated the effect from diabetes mellitus and chronic viral hepatitis on resulting in fatal outcome.
