Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne ulcerating skin disease affecting several million people worldwide. The causative Leishmania spp. protozoa are transmitted by infected phlebotomine sand flies. During a sand fly bite, bacteria can be coincidentally inoculated into the dermis with the parasite. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium in CL skin lesions. Symptomatic CL is characterized by papulonodular skin lesions that ulcerate and resolve with scarring, although most cutaneous Leishmania infections are asymptomatic. We sought to explore factors that determine whether infection with a cutaneous Leishmania species would result in symptomatic CL rather than asymptomatic infection. We hypothesized that local bacteria promote the development of symptomatic CL lesions during infection with Leishmania major. We discovered that cutaneous lesions were significantly larger in mice inoculated simultaneously with S. aureus and L. major than in mice infected with either organism alone. Coinfection led to increased S. aureus growth in skin lesions, whereas L. major parasite numbers were unchanged by coinfection. The size of the exacerbated lesion correlated with early increased numbers of neutrophils and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-17A during the first 7 days, and with sustained increases in IL-17A through 28 days of coinfection. Neutralizing antibody experiments suggested IL-17A was partially responsible for lesion exacerbation during coinfection, whereas IL-1β was important for both control of early lesion exacerbation and promotion of IL-17A production. These data suggest that treatment of symptomatic CL targeting the parasite, local commensal bacteria, and host proinflammatory IL-17A immune responses might improve the outcome of CL.
