Rabies transmitted by dogs remains a threat in much of the developing world. Although infection in humans is preventable with pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, management and elimination of the disease in dogs is the only definitive way to eliminate human risk and avoid the high costs of human treatment. In this article, we present and apply a model of canine rabies management that can be used to maximize the benefits of management resources. We also developed a web application front end for our model so that managers can access it from any computer with an internet connection. Critically, our model can help answer complex strategic questions surrounding vaccine application, population control, campaign timing, and budget allocation. We demonstrated application of the model in a region of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, and our findings suggested that puppies should be vaccinated, adding female sterilization to vaccination campaigns is not optimal, and campaigns should be repeated annually.
