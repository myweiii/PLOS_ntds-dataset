Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) are considered major public health challenges. In addition to the epidemic caused by DENV, which has been described in many tropical countries, the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV in these countries is a major public health concern. These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the species Ae. Aegypti and its related diseases result in increased financial costs associated with diagnosis and treatment. To support the design of efficient diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies, a bioinformatics tool has been developed for the genotyping of these viruses based on appropriate evolutionary models in an automatic, accurate and rapid manner. A set of virus reference sequences was obtained from GenBank and used for the development of the tools. This process involved the alignment of the reference sequences followed by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds. As shown experimentally, genotypes are classified most confidently using the envelope gene or complete genome sequences.
