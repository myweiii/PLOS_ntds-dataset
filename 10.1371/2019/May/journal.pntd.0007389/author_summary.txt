Following the review of hospital admission criteria for dengue cases in the aftermath of the 2004â€“2005 dengue epidemic in Singapore, the proportion of dengue cases hospitalized plummeted from 72.6% in 2006 to the nadir of 25.6% in 2014. There was no concomitant increase in adverse outcomes as a result of the more selective admission criteria. Median length of stay remained stable over the years; overall stay was 3 to 4 days and intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 2 to 3 days. Among hospitalized dengue patients, less than 2% were admitted to the ICU. Overall case fatality rate was low and remained below 0.5%. Elderly patients aged 65 years and older constituted the highest proportions of dengue cases hospitalized and patients admitted to the ICU.
