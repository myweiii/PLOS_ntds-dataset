Soil-transmitted helminths are intestinal worms that cause significant suffering among the poorest communities in the world. They are transmitted via contaminated water, food or soil, all of which result from poor sanitation. Children and women of reproductive age are at heightened risk of related morbidities such as malnutrition, cognitive impairment and anaemia. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to severe maternal and neonatal complications. Deworming drugs are cheap, safe, and effective in reducing morbidity related to soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Large scale drug administration campaigns have distributed donated medicines to children in endemic countries, but women of reproductive age are currently not well covered. Yet, demographic surveys show that they are being treated for soil-transmitted helminthiasis through health care services. This study provides estimates for the number of pregnant women at risk of soil-transmitted helminthiasis being dewormed by antenatal services in endemic countries conducting Demographic Health Surveys. These estimates mark the preliminary reference point for deworming coverage among pregnant women in endemic countries, and will thus prove useful for tracking overall progress in the ongoing effort to eliminate neglected tropical diseases.
