Leishmaniasis caused by intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania is a neglected tropical disease widely distributing worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. Approximately 20 species are known to be pathogenic to humans, of which eight species have been recorded as causative agents of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniases in Ecuador. Since infecting species are the major determinant of clinical outcomes, identification at the species level is important for the treatment and prognosis. The parasite species have been identified conventionally by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and recently by genetic analysis such as sequencing and genotyping. In the present study, PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) targeting multiple nuclear genes was employed, and the results were compared with those obtained by kinetoplast cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequence analysis, which is widely applied to species identification. Although most results corresponded between the two analyses, PCR-RFLP revealed presence of unexpected genetically complex Leishmania strains having characteristics of hybrid and mito-nuclear discordance. Since hybrid strains of Leishmania were suggested to increase disease severity and may be transmitted by a wider range of sand fly species, careful epidemiological research, including clinical courses and vector research, will be needed.
