Chagas disease in humans is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and it is endemic to the Americas. Poor populations are most at risk. The parasite infects an estimated six million people of 21 endemic countries in the Americas, with 30,000 new infections yearly. The main mode of transmission is vector-borne by triatomine bugs, which tend to live in close association with humans. The main Chagas disease vector in the Southern Cone of South America, where the highest burden of disease exists, is Triatoma infestans. As blood-sucking insects, triatomines become infected when they bite a T. cruzi-positive human and once infected they transmit the parasites in their feces. Controlling the vector populations is the main strategy of Chagas disease transmission reduction efforts. Microbiota-mediated methods to control this vector-borne disease are now being explored to determine whether microbes typically found in the vectorsâ€™ gut have a detrimental effect on T. cruzi and how they may be used to modify the vector and curb the ability for T. cruzi to be transmitted to humans. To advance this new field, we first must gain better knowledge of the gut microbiota of triatomines. Our study is the first to use sensitive high-throughput methods to study the gut microbes of T. infestans, using both laboratory-reared and wild insects. We have found that the microbial composition of T. infestans in the laboratory does not reflect the complete collection of gut microbes of wild T. infestans and inferring the gut microbiota profile of wild insects through studying lab insects alone may not be possible. We also found evidence that in wild insects T. cruzi affects the composition of the gut microbiota and identified some bacterial taxa which may be important in modulating the T.infestans-T.cruzi relationship.
