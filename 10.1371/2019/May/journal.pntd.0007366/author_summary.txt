Brucellosis is considered a neglected zoonotic disease that creates a very large obstacle to the development of animal production and is a great threat to human health. High brucellosis awareness and knowledge is critical for the implementation of correct practices and habits and consequently the control and prevention of brucellosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the awareness and knowledge of brucellosis, specifically regarding its zoonotic nature, mode of transmission, and signs in humans and in animals as well as awareness information sources. To this end, a meta-analysis of data from 79 studies was performed. The included studies on the awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were mainly from Africa and Asia. There were no significant differences in the awareness levels of brucellosis among high-risk groups in Asia and Africa. Overall, peopleâ€™s awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were low and insufficient. Health workers had the highest pooled levels of awareness and knowledge regarding brucellosis. In addition, livestock stock owners (farmers) had notably higher awareness and knowledge levels than dairy farmers and abattoir workers. Neighbors and friends were the most common sources of brucellosis information for farmers. The low and insufficient awareness and knowledge about brucellosis is an obstacle for public health. Raising awareness and increasing detailed knowledge of brucellosis are of great significance for the control of brucellosis and the protection of human health. The potential of the media and health workers in the dissemination of knowledge about the disease needs to be fostered.
