The rearrangement of alleles among individuals in a population during sexual reproduction maintains high allelic diversity within individuals in a population at polymorphic genes. Allelic diversity within individuals can be particularly important for parasites as it enhances their ability to evade host immune systems. Despite the potential benefits of sexual reproduction for parasites, natural populations of the protozoan parasite—and causative agent of human Chagas disease—Trypanosoma cruzi, exhibit clonal population structures indicative of asexual reproduction. This is particularly surprising as T. cruzi has the capacity for sexual reproduction. Here, we resolve this apparent contradiction by sequencing whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates from a natural population in Arequipa, Peru. Evidence of past sexual reproduction and allelic rearrangements are common in this T. cruzi population. However, the majority of sexual reproduction events occur between close relatives resulting in an apparent clonal population structure. Sexual reproduction with distant relatives in areas with greater strain diversity has the potential to affect public health by increasing diversity in immune evasion genes within individuals and enhancing within-host survival, rapidly diversifying antigens that could affect the sensitivity of serological diagnostics, and by generating diversity in pathogenicity or drug resistance.
