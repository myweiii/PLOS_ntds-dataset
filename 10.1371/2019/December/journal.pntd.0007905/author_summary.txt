Tsetse flies transmit parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Tsetse can be controlled using insecticide-treated fabric targets, which are typically blue or black and traditionally made of cotton. The efficiency of these targets might be improved by using modern synthetic fabrics that last longer and hold insecticide better, and by optimising the colour of these fabrics to be more attractive to tsetse. However, because flies see colour differently from humans, any attempts to do this must consider colour from a fly’s-eye-view. First, we tested a range of existing target fabrics against savannah tsetse in Zimbabwe. We found that a blue polyester currently produced for riverine tsetse targets was equally as effective in attracting tsetse as standard cotton targets, demonstrating that these more robust polyesters can be used for savannah tsetse control. We then employed novel models of tsetse attraction based upon fly photoreceptor responses to deliberately engineer a new violet polyester for greater predicted attractiveness to tsetse. In field tests, our new violet fabric attracted significantly more tsetse than a traditional black cotton or typical blue polyester. Our work shows that innovative fly’s-eye-view approaches can result in genuine improvements in tsetse control devices.
