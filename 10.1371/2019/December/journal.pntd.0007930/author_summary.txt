Laboratory colonies provide the opportunity to study live organisms in a controlled environment and serve as phenotypic surrogates of their natural populations. Over time, these strains are prone to change as they face novel environments. We analyzed laboratory and field colonies of the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), primary vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya fever and a model system in vector biology, and an Ae. aegypti-derived cell line (Aag2) to determine genetic similarity between laboratory strains and their wild relatives. We found lower levels of genetic diversity in laboratory populations compared to wild populations, with colonies of the same name diverging over time or likely contaminated. We also found that the genetic composition of the Liverpool strain, used as the reference genome for this species, is inconsistent with historical records that suggest an African origin and instead points to an outside Africa source. Finally, we did not find major genetic changes in Aag2 cell lines across laboratories. Laboratory evolution of reference strains and strain contamination are severe problems that can change experimental outcomes and complicate cross-study comparison. Our results illustrate the need of a common Aedes aegypti repository and the development of strain validation tools.
