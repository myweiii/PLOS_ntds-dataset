Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world-wide. It is a conjunctivitis caused by repeated infections with Chlamydia trachomatis, spread from person to person by contact with infected ocular/nasal secretions. While mass treatment with azithromycin decreases infection, re-emergence occurs, indicating that elimination may require other sustainable interventions. Environmental changes largely focus on facial hygiene and latrines, but further work to identify other possible transmission targets is needed. In this cross-sectional study of households where at least one child has trachoma, we found evidence of C. trachomatis DNA on several environmental sources including clothing, bedsheets, furniture, and hands. Besides the presence of infection with C. trachomatis in the index child, chlamydial DNA in the environment was also associated with the presence of an infant in the household. Washing clothes within the past three days was associated with not having C. trachomatis DNA in the environment. Our study provides suggestive evidence that in high prevalence villages, C. trachomatis may be contaminating environmental objects, including hands and clothing. These findings suggest that behavior change communication around hygiene may need to be enlarged to focus on keeping ocular and nasal secretions off faces and hands, and promoting washing of clothing as well.
