Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira, affects people and animals, including dogs, cows and horses. Many species of small mammals, and particularly rodents, are believed to be natural reservoirs of the pathogen across numerous geographical ranges with similar climatic conditions. The Cumberland Gap region (CGR) in southern Appalachia has several climatic risk factors for leptospirosis. With this in mind, we tested surface water, kidneys of small wild mammals, and blood from cows and horses in the CGR for the presence of leptospiral DNA or antibodies. Notably, more than 60% of tested small mammals carried leptospires in their kidneys. Furthermore, we found that 2 of the 89 tested environmental water samples contained leptospiral DNA, and a significant percentage of cows and horses had leptospiral antibodies. These findings will advance our understanding of the ecology of leptospirosis in the region, which will lead to stakeholder awareness, and development of preventive interventions with broad applicability within and outside this region of southern Appalachia.
