Proficiency testing (PT) schemes also known as “external quality assessment schemes” are one means to assess the quality and validity of routine measurements. PT schemes are the most common, and perhaps the most important type of inter-laboratory comparisons. As the specific institute to coordinate the approval of the laboratories, designated by the European Commission in 2000, our laboratory organizes annual PT for laboratories already agreed or willing to be agreed to perform rabies serological controls in the frame of international trade. Our PT program is conducted in compliance with the requirements of the ISO/ IEC 17043 International Standards. To enhance the robustness of our statistical analyses, we used an original approach to assess the performance of participants consisting in comparing individual laboratory values with assigned values calculated from compiled PT historical data. Since the beginning of these PT schemes in 1999, the overall percentage of failing laboratories remained stable over the years. The improvements carried out and the consistency of our statistical analyses have resulted in the compliance of the rabies serology PT with the International Standards.
