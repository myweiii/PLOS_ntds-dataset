Spain is the country with the highest burden of Chagas disease, with an estimated 52,000 cases, 81% of which are reported. Nevertheless, recent publications have shown that only 44% of the Bolivian population living in Madrid had a screening test performed (prevalence = 27.7%). This neglected tropical disease is transmitted through the bite of a kissing bug in endemic regions, while mother-to-child transmission, as well as blood transfusion and organ transplant transmissions occur in endemic and non-endemic countries. Without treatment, Chagas disease could cause severe cardiac and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, and ultimately death. Early diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease improves the clinical prognosis, prevents vertical transmission and it could also prevent blood transfusion and organ transplant transmissions. Our study is the first study in Spain to use qualitative methods to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices of primary care professionals about Chagas disease. The results show that is necessary to develop strategies in a protocolized way in order to avoid that the diagnosis depends exclusively on the request of the patient. Our findings have important public health and policy implications, offering different strategies in primary care which could facilitate the early diagnosis of Chagas disease.
