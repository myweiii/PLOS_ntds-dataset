Echinococcosis, caused by the larval stages of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus, is a neglected disease that affects millions of people world-wide. These parasites show elaborate developmental features that rely on a complex control of gene expression. microRNAs are small molecules which have been discovered in the last decades and control gene expression in animals, plants and viruses. microRNAs are highly expressed in several tapeworms but their biological function in these parasites is unknown. Assuming that microRNAs will be important for parasite development, we analysed the function of these molecules in Echinococcus multilocularis, employing an in vitro model that mimics the first developmental transitions which occur in the human host. By artificially decreasing the concentration of the highest expressed microRNA, we observed phenotypic alterations and inhibition of development. In addition, we identified possible mRNA molecules targeted by microRNAs and found that some of these are known for being involved in developmental processes in other organisms. This work provides novel methodology to study microRNA function in tapeworms. Furthermore, highly expressed parasite microRNAs that are absent in the host but fulfil an important role in parasite developmental processes can serve as selective drug targets against the underlying diseases.
