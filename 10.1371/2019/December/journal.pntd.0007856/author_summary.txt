Cutaneous leishmaniasis (LC) is a parasitic disease characterized by a non-fatal evolution but marked by significant morbidity resulting from lesions that are usually ulcerated, sometimes disfiguring, and distributed in exposed areas of the body. Pentavalent antimony compounds administered systemically (EV) are still considered the pillars of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) treatment despite its high toxicity. Other therapeutic approaches, including the intralesional infiltration of antimony derivatives have been proposed as an alternative as effective as the systemic route. In this study we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of the meglumine antimoniate intralesional treatment (IL-MA) compared to systemic therapy with the same drug, from the perspective of the main source of pay in Brazil, Brazilian Public Health System (SUS). This is the first cost-effectiveness study evaluating the IL-MA approach compared to MA endovenously for the treatment of CL. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental costs per patient cured. In our model, IL-MA was more effective and led to substantially lower costs for the public health system. Analytical decision model showed that the IL-MA therapy could represent a cost saving of approximately US$ 877.64 per additional patient cured compared with the endovenous route, representing the more cost-effectiveness approach for treatment of selected CL cases in Brazil.
