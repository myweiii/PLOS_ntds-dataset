The present work comprises an unprecedented capture effort and large-scale field survey of Plasmodium species in non-human primates (NHPs) in RJ, a state recording three-decade history of autochthonous human cases of benign tertian malaria lacking epidemiological clarification of their origin. This is the first study to describe the infection rates by Plasmodium spp. in free-living NHPs in RJ, thereby matching the spatial distribution of P. simium in NHP with that of the local human cases of benign tertian malaria occurring due to this parasite. This study confirmed howler monkeys as the only reservoir of this zoonotic malarial parasite in RJ and reported that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms were present in all P. simium infected howler monkeys, despite their geographical origin of malarial foci. Moreover, this is the first study to record P. brasilianum/malariae in free-living NHPs from RJ, and to illustrate their widespread distribution in this state. Collectively, these findings help us in evaluating the simian malaria prevalence in the Atlantic Forests and in assessing the zoonotic characteristics of autochthonous human malaria in Rio de Janeiro, thus providing assistance in shaping surveillance and control.
