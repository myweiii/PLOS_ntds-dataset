Permanent damage to ecosystems and direct transmission to humans (zoonoses) are two serious consequences of infectious wildlife diseases. Rabies is one such zoonotic disease of concern. Recently, two rabies vaccine efficacy studies were conducted with raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). These studies allowed us the opportunity to investigate the presence of volatile signals of rabies immunization coded in fecal odors. These signals, if sensitive and specific, could permit non-invasive monitoring of rabies vaccination in wildlife populations. Semi-quantitative analyses of fecal volatiles and quantitative assessment of rabies binding antibodies (rVBA; which represent humoral immune responses to the vaccine or virus) were made at multiple time points. Regression models predicting rVBA responses using volatile fecal metabolites demonstrated predictive qualities in both species. This is the first study to link volatile compounds with adaptive immunity and provides further evidence that the volatile metabolome holds great promise for contributing to our understanding of wildlife diseases.
