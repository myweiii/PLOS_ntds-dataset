Acute fever without localized signs is a common presentation of communicable neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Scrub typhus, a potentially severe chigger-borne intracellular bacterial infection, is also an important differential diagnosis of acute febrile NTDs, which is endemic particularly in Asia. In Vietnam, the proportion of scrub typhus cases among patients with acute fever is currently unknown even in a tertiary hospital, because both clinical and laboratory diagnoses of scrub typhus are challenging. In this study, we enrolled acute fever patients hospitalized in the department of infectious diseases at a national tertiary hospital in Hanoi through a year. Scrub typhus was diagnosed using serological and PCR assays in 2.9% of enrolled patients. We found that the characteristics of scrub typhus patients were generally non-specific and most cases were missed based on clinical diagnosis alone. We also found that currently available serological assays were sub-optimal in Vietnam by comparing multiple diagnostic assays. Since the diagnostic antigens were not originally from Vietnam, the serological findings may underrepresent the actual number of cases. The presented data underlines the importance of a preemptive treatment strategy for scrub typhus among acute fever patients and adaptation of diagnostic assays to cover endemic strains.
