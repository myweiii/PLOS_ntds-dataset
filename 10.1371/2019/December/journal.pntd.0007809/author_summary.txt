There have been many epidemiological studies on the seroprevalence of Toxocara infection or toxocariasis in humans in individual countries, but there has been no systematic review/meta-analysis to estimate the extent of Toxocara infection or exposure in human populations worldwide. By reviewing 250 studies of 265,327 people from 71 countries, we provide the first comprehensive global estimates of T-seroprevalence in humans to date. The findings indicate that almost one fifth (19%) of the worldâ€™s human population is seropositive to Toxocara. The highest seroprevalence rates were found in Africa (37.7%) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (8.2%). Individual countries with high HDIs and high income levels usually had low T-seroprevalence rates. Our findings also showed that T-seroprevalence varies markedly among countries, according to geographical location (coordinates) and climatic features. Evidence from this study indicates that human toxocariasis is a prevalent, neglected tropical disease and potentially one of major importance to global public health. Our study emphasizes the need for governmental authorities to pay increased attention to the risks and socioeconomic impact of HT in many countries around the world, and for them to design and implement HT prevention or control programs, considering risk predictors identified here.
