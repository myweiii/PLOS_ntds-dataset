    "Abstract": "Schistosoma mansoni threatens hundreds of millions of people in >50 countries. Schistosomulae migrate through the lung and adult worms reside in blood vessels adjacent to the intestinal mucosa. Current candidate vaccines aren\u2019t designed to elicit a mucosal response. We have repurposed an attenuated Salmonella enterica Typhimurium strain (YS1646) to produce such a vaccine targeting Cathepsin B (CatB), a digestive enzyme important for parasite survival. Promoter-Type 3 secretory signal pairs were screened for protein expression in vitro and transfected into YS1646 to generate candidate vaccine strains. Two strains were selected for in vivo evaluation (nirB_SspH1 and SspH1_SspH1). Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice, 3 weeks apart, using six strategies: i) saline gavage (control), ii) the \u2018empty\u2019 YS1646 vector orally (PO) followed by intramuscular (IM) recombinant CatB (20\u03bcg IM rCatB), iii) two doses of IM rCatB, iv) two PO doses of YS1646-CatB, v) IM rCatB then PO YS1646-CatB and vi) PO YS1646-CatB then IM rCatB. Serum IgG responses to CatB were monitored by ELISA. Three weeks after the second dose, mice were challenged with 150 cercariae and sacrificed 7 weeks later to assess adult worm and egg burden (liver and intestine), granuloma size and egg morphology. CatB-specific IgG antibodies were low/absent in the control and PO only groups but rose substantially in other groups (5898-6766ng/mL). The highest response was in animals that received nirB_SspH1 YS1646 PO then IM rCatB. In this group, reductions in worm and intestine/liver egg burden (vs. control) were 93.1% and 79.5%/90.3% respectively (all P < .0001). Granuloma size was reduced in all vaccinated groups (range 32.9\u201352.8 x103\u03bcm2) and most significantly in the nirB_SspH1 + CatB IM group (34.7\u00b13.4 x103\u03bcm2vs. 62.2\u00b16.1 x103\u03bcm2: vs. control P < .01). Many eggs in the vaccinated animals had abnormal morphology. Targeting CatB using a multi-modality approach can provide almost complete protection against S. mansoni challenge."
