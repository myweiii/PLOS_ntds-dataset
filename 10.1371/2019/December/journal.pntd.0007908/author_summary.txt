Helminth parasites chronically infect over 1 billion people, with filarial nematodes accounting for 120 million. Protection is mediated by Th2 cells, but infection invokes dominant down-regulatory immune responses forming a major barrier to the development of protective immunity. We previously demonstrated that during murine filarial infection Th2 cells change phenotype, developing a novel form of Th2 cell-intrinsic dysfunction that impairs parasite clearance. Here we investigate the gene expression profile of Th2 cell dysfunction, and whether it represents a unique and stable form of T cell differentiation. Dysfunctional Th2 cells had a different gene expression profile to effector Th2 cells, and retained their unresponsive phenotype in the absence of antigen and active infection when transferred to a na√Øve recipient. Dysfunctional Th2 cells produced IL-21, through which they may inhibit protective immunity, as IL-21R neutralisation increased parasite killing. In comparison to known forms of T cell intrinsic regulation, dysfunctional Th2 cells had a distinct gene expression profile to exhausted T cells, but shared characteristics with anergy and tolerance. Together this indicates that Th2 cell dysfunction represents a unique and stable state of Th2 cell differentiation, which has important implications for understanding the outcomes of helminth infections and designing therapies for Th2-mediated allergies.
