Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a mosquito-borne disease that annually affects at least 50 million people worldwide. The cytokine response during DENV infection is mercurial and abstruse. IL-1 receptor-like-1 (IL-1R-L-1 [aka ST2]) protein is associated with the severity of DENV infection, and elevated cytokine levels are important early predictors of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. ST2, a member of the interleukin-1-receptor/toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily, is an important biomarker of severe forms of pediatric DENV infection. We first confirmed a similar trend in the elderly cohort. Serial changes of soluble ST2 (sST2) levels were a more reliable predictor for dengue fatality than a single measurement was. Patients given fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions had significantly higher serum ST2 levels than those who had not been given FFP transfusions. SerumsST2 might be necessary for modulating coagulopathy in severe DENV infections. The exact molecular mechanism and the optimal timing for sST2 testing need further investigation.
