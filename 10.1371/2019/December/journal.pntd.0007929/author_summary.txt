Severe leptospirosis continues to carry a high mortality. To improve outcomes, several countries have developed national guidelines for the management of severe disease. However, there is substantial variation in these guidelines despite the fact that severe leptospirosis has a very similar presentation around the world. In tropical Australia, the case-fatality rate of severe leptospirosis is only 4%. This retrospective study reviewed 55 patients with leptospirosis requiring support in an Australian Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in an effort to identify the management strategies that might explain these excellent outcomes. The low case-fatality rate was associated with prompt multimodal ICU support that included early antibiotics, protective ventilation strategies, conservative fluid resuscitation, traditional thresholds for renal replacement therapy initiation and corticosteroid therapy. However prospective, multinational studies–which include the resource-poor settings that bear the greatest burden of disease–are necessary to define which of these interventions have the greatest therapeutic value.
