Canine rabies is a fatal yet preventable disease. Once a canine rabies-free status has been achieved, there is little guidance available on vaccination standards to maintain that status. However, the risk of reintroduction and the associated costs may not be negligible. We used a modified version of RabiesEcon, a deterministic mathematical model, to evaluate the potential impacts and cost-effectiveness of preventing the reintroduction of canine rabies through a proactive dog vaccination. We found that vaccinating 38% to 56% of the susceptible dog population (i.e., free-roaming dogs with no immunity to rabies) could prevent the re-establishment of canine rabies within the first 2 years of the incursion. Among the various preventive vaccination strategies, it was most cost-effective to continue dog vaccination at the minimum coverage required, with the average cost per human death averted ranging from $257 to $398 USD. To maintain rabies-free status and protect the significant investments made to eliminate canine rabies, it may be necessary to vaccinate portions of susceptible dog populations depending on the risk of reintroduction, surveillance capacity, and transmission dynamics.
