Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a serious and often fatal disease caused by viruses known as hantaviruses. These viruses are harbored by wild rodents and people can become infected through contact with infected-rodents droppings, urine or saliva. After an incubation time of 1–8 weeks, patients usually present flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue and muscle aches, although some patients may also present headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It is only 4–10 days after initial symptoms, however, that the severe stage of disease takes place. Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath and eventually the lungs fill with fluid which can lead to shock and death. As such, HPS should be diagnosed quickly as any delay may have great impact on patient recovery. However, given the unspecific nature of early symptoms, clinical diagnosis of HPS is difficult and laboratory assays are needed to confirm hantavirus infection as soon as possible, helping physicians to choose the most adequate treatment. In this study, we developed new laboratory assays that can help detect the virus in infected patients in early stages of disease. In addition, we showed these assays have a good performance in discriminating HPS from other similar diseases by testing not only several samples collected from both HPS patients and healthy individuals but also samples infected with other pathogens. Our results show that these assays may become important tools for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of HPS.
