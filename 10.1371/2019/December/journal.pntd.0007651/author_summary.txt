Periodic nutrient scarcity plays crucial roles in the life cycle of the protozoan parasite Leishmania spp. Although adaptation to nutrient stress has a pivotal role in Leishmania biology, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In a period of nutrient starvation, the parasite responds by decreasing its protein production to conserve nutrient resources and to prevent formation of toxic proteins. However, even during severe starvation, the parasite generates certain essential quality control and rescue proteins. Differential identification of the complete repertoire of these proteins synthesised during starvation from the pre-existing proteins in the parasite holds the key to understanding the starvation adaptation mechanisms. This has been challenging to accomplish due to technical limitations. Using a combination of chemical labelling techniques and protein mass-spectrometry, we selectively identified and measured the proteins generated in the starving Leishmania parasite. Our results show a starvation time-dependent differential expression of important protein synthesis regulators in the parasite. This will serve as an important dataset for a holistic understanding of the starvation adaptation mechanisms in Leishmania. We also believe that this method will find widespread applications in the field of protozoa and other parasites causing Neglected Tropical Diseases.
