Salmonella enterica infections are common causes of bloodstream infection in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with a high mortality rate. Levels of multidrug resistance have become alarmingly high. Then, third-generation cephalosporin (C3G) and fluoroquinolones have become standard for first-line empirical treatment. Recently, C3G-resistant Salmonella populations have emerged and spread over all continents. This resistance is mainly mediated by acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes carried by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. We report here the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in isolates in the Central African Republic (CAR) between 2004 and 2013 and the genetic basis for resistance to C3G. Overall, resistance rates to antimicrobials were low during the study period, for all classes other than conventional antimicrobials, confirming recommendations for first-line treatment based on C3G and fluoroquinolones. Only one ESBL-producing isolate was recovered. The ESBL gene and the majority of antimicrobial resistance genes found were present in a large plasmid highly similar to ESBL-carrying plasmids found in East and West Africa, highlighting its significant role in the spread of ESBL genes in Salmonella isolates in sub-Saharan Africa. These finding have implications for treatment of salmonellosis and support the growing necessity for increased microbiological surveillance based on networks of clinical laboratories in order to control dissemination of antibiotic resistance among Salmonella isolates.
