Schistosomaisis control programs often employ the use of chemical molluscicides, such as niclosamide, to control the obligatory intermediate snail hosts. Despite its widespread use, we know little about how niclosamide affects snails like Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the most important vector Schistosoma mansoni in Africa. Following sequencing the transcriptomes of uninfected and S. mansoni-infected B. pfeifferi treated with niclosamide, we analyze the snailâ€™s response to both biotic and abiotic stressors. We can also examine the response of S. mansoni to niclosamide exposure during intramolluscan development. Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails exposed only to niclosamide showed unique up-regulation of stress and defense-related transcripts not seen in snails infected with a biotic stressor like S. mansoni infection. Schistosoma mansoni-infected B. pfeifferi treated with niclosamide were clearly unable to regulate normal metabolic and detoxification processes. Cercariae-producing sporocysts within snails treated with niclosamide are largely unaffected and continue to produce transcripts required for cercariae production.
