Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is present worldwide, affecting mainly economically vulnerable populations in over 80 countries. In the Americas, Brazil accounts for approximately 96% of the cases. VL as one of the most relevant endemic neglected diseases in the world, due to its incidence and high fatality, which is generally reported among untreated individuals, and its emerging pattern in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. Despite the increasing knowledge on prognostic factors, incorporation of new diagnostic tools and increasing access to new treatments, case fatality rate remains high in Brazil. The analysis revealed differences in the time to event investigation according to HIV status, being greater for HIV infected individuals, particularly for the period between case notification and death. The time between onset of the symptoms and case notification appears to be greater in peri-urban and rural areas compared to the urban areas. Also, differences in the time to event investigation according to patientâ€™s age at the onset of symptoms was evident, being longer for 5 years old or older patients. Our findings identified that children under 5 years old are at higher risk of premature death being relevant for planning interventions aimed at reduction of VL lethality in Brazil.
