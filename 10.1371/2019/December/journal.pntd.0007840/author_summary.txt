This study provides insights into how gender influences peoples’ access to health services for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There is considerable evidence to show that women and girls suffer a greater NTD burden due to their higher levels of poverty, lower education and social status. The psychological and social consequences of NTDs also tend to be worse for women. There is an urgent need to integrate NTDs into basic healthcare services, yet there is little evidence that can support a gender-based approach of how best to do so. This study addresses that gap by exploring how gender affects health seeking behaviour for NTDs in Ethiopia through a series of focus group discussions and interviews with community members and health service providers. The findings provide new insights into why women might not seek care or delay care seeking. In particular, there are reservations about disclosing diseases that affect “hidden” body parts, for example in the case of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that can affect the urogenital system. Men, on the other hand, may delay seeking care if they are affected by hydrocele, scrotal swelling that can be caused by lymphatic filariasis. There is therefore a need to adopt a gendered approach to NTD health service delivery.
