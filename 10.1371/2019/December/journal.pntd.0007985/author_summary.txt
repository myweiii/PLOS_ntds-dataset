Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus mainly transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes notably Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. In Central Africa where both vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are well established, the role of each species in dengue transmission remains poorly investigated. Here, we assessed the vector competence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus collected in different ecological settings in Central Africa to transmit dengue 2 virus (DENV-2). We provide evidence that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Central Africa were able to transmit dengue virus with Ae. aegypti exhibiting a higher transmission rate. These findings could increase the risk of dengue outbreak in the region and emphasize the need for a comprehensive vector surveillance program to prevent and preparedness for an intervention in case of outbreaks.
