Trachoma is a contagious infection of the eye and the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Mass drug administration (MDA) is one of the WHO initiated a global program to eliminate trachoma by 2020. Mass drug administration is a strategy used to administer medicines to the entire at-risk population of an area, most commonly a district using a campaign-style approach. This coverage survey was aimed to assess knowledge and source of information about the previous trachoma mass drug administration campaign, its coverage level, and the reason for not taking the drug. It highlighted the previous challenges, existing gaps and explained differences in coverages reported within the respective districts. Therefore, future MDA rounds will be able to take into account these findings and reach target populations that might have been missed during previous rounds of MDA. For this survey, it was found that mass drug administration coverage was lower than reported one by the districts, except for Haro Limu and Boneya Boshe. The difference was as small as 2% in Haro Limu district to as high as 20% in Boneya Boshe district. Therefore, in the districts with lower MDA coverage, improvements should be made for the future campaign to reach the expected thresholds.
