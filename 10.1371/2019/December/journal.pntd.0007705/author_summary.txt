IDH is a recurrent eczema caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) that occurs mainly in children and adolescents. IDH disappears in adulthood but may predispose to the early development of other HTLV-1 associated diseases such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). In Bahia, Brazil, 47% of the IDH patients develop HAM/TSP. In this study, we evaluated HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in a cohort of children and adolescents with HTLV-1 infection who were followed-up during 14 years in the different clinical settings of IDH and HAM/TSP. IDH is considered a risk factor for HTLV-1 associated diseases in adults. We observed that PVLs in patients with IDH and in those with IDH and HAM/TSP were similar and, in both groups, higher than in asymptomatic carriers. Moreover, high PVL in these patients did not predispose necessarily to HAM/TSP. PVL remained high after IDH remission. Intra-individual PVL did not fluctuate significantly during the 14 years of follow-up. Our results indicate the importance of monitoring IDH patients even after remission because they remain with high levels of PVL that can favor the development of ATL.
