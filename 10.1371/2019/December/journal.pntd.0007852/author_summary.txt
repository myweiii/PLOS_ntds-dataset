Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue in Laos and the control of this vector rely mainly on insecticide treatments. Compared to the neighboring countries, where resistance has been detected, there was no data on the distribution, the levels, and the mechanisms involved in the resistance in Laos. Laboratory bioassays showed that resistance to the currently used larvicides (temephos) and adulticides (pyrethroids) was present at different levels and distributed throughout the country. This may have important implications for dengue vector control in Laos. The mechanisms underlying the resistance were determined to be both metabolic and target site mutations (kdr) supporting results found in other countries. Several key detoxification enzyme genes were identified as potential candidates for metabolic resistance. This study provides a baseline on insecticide resistance in Laos and will help the Public Health authorities in designing more adapted vector control strategies.
