The authors would like to thank the respondents who gave up their time to speak with us and for sharing their experiences, however difficult. We would also like to thank the village leaders who welcomed us into their villages to conduct the research, The Hope4Humans centre for their support and the Ministry of health for providing us with necessary secondary data to help select our field sites. We would also like to thank Prof. Robert Colebunders and Dr. Adam Hendy for their continuous support, and to all the administrative and support staff at Makerere University, the Institute of Tropical Medicine, and Centre for Tropical Neuroscience for their contributions.
