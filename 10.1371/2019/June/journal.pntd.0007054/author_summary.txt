Rickettsia is a bacterial genus that contains distinct species that are transmitted by arthropods. Many of these agents produce infection and disease in humans. The illness can range from very severe, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever caused by Rickettsia rickettsii to mild human disease characterized by eschar formation at the tick feeding site and less severe symptoms caused by Rickettsia parkeri and often apparently asymptomatic seroconversion as observed with R. amblyommatis. To study these diseases, animal models are invaluable, and mouse models offer the best advantages for studies of immunity and pathogenesis because of the availability of immunologic reagents and gene knockout animals. Several mouse models are available for the study of the acute lethal disease produced by these bacteria, providing the opportunity to test different treatments and vaccine candidates. However, work with these models requires an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this report, we present an alternative mouse model with R. parkeri Atlantic Rainforest strain available for investigation in a biosafety level 2 laboratory to study an acute dose-dependent lethal spotted fever group rickettsial disease with the advantage that experiments can be performed at this biosafety level.
