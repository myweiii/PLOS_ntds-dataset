Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is highly prevalent worldwide, affecting millions of people in undeveloped countries. Leishmania parasites are transmitted to humans by phlebotomine flies. The transmission occurs mainly in rural areas, although the urbanization of the disease is in process. Phlebotomine vectors may also transmit RNA virus (arboviruses) to humans. Our group has previously demonstrated the induction of the host anti-viral pathways by L. (L.) amazonensis, Since some anti-viral response pathways potentiate L. (L.) amazonensis infection and the same group of Leishmania arthropod vectors transmits RNA viruses belonging to the genus Phlebovirus, we hypothesized that coinfection could aggravate the parasitism by L. (L.) amazonensis. Using a phlebovirus isolated from L. amazonensis rodents reservoirs (Icoaraci), we demonstrated that Icoaraci coinfection enhanced the parasite load, both in vivo and in vitro. These observations were partialy corroborated with Pacui, another Phlebovirus isolate. Increased macrophage infection required IFN type I expression induced by the parasite and amplified during coinfection. Importantly, the infection by another prevalent arbovirus, DENV2, did not result in the exacerbation of the parasite infection. Overall our results support the importance of complex and multifactorial analysis of infectious processes, especially in tropical regions that frequently have endemic areas of overlap.
