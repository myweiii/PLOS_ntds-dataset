Dengue is a disease that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. In areas where the use of a dengue vaccine has not been authorized due to safety concerns and is not cost-effective, reducing the population of Aedes mosquitoes remains the key method in controlling the disease. One approach to mosquito population control is the use of inspections to identify and eliminate mosquito larval habitats in homes. However, evidence supporting the use of this approach is limited. In this study, which used national data from Singapore, we investigated the relationship between the frequency of inspections and the propensity for mosquito larval habitat reports in homes. We found that homes that had been inspected more frequently had fewer reports of mosquito larval habitats. We also found that the characteristics and locations of homes, and their history of previously reported mosquito larval habitats influenced present findings for mosquito larval habitats. We conclude that homes that are more frequently inspected have a lower number of reported mosquito larval habitats. Knowledge of the characteristics and locations of homes, and their history of previous reports may improve resource allocation for the control of mosquitoes in homes.
