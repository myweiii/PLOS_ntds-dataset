    "Abstract": "Although Mycobacterium leprae (M.leprae) is usually found in macrophages and nerves of the dermis of patients with multibacillary leprosy, it is also present in all layers of the epidermis, basal, suprabasal, prickle cells, and keratin layers. However, the mechanism by which M.leprae invades the dermis remains unknown, whereas the underlying mechanism by which M.leprae invades peripheral nerves, especially Schwann cells, is well defined. M. leprae binds to the \u03b1-dystroglycan (DG) of Schwann cells via the interaction of \u03b1-DG and laminin (LN) -\u03b12 in the basal lamina, thus permitting it to become attached to and invade peripheral nerves. In the current study, we investigated the issue of how M.leprae is phagocytosed by human epidermal keratinocytes, neonatal (HEKn). LN-5 is the predominant form of laminin in the epidermis and allows the epidermis to be stably attached to the dermis via its interaction with \u03b1/\u03b2-DG as well as integrins that are produced by keratinocytes. We therefore focused on the role of LN-5 when M. leprae is internalized by HEKn cells. Our results show that M.leprae preferentially binds to LN-5-coated slides and this binding to LN-5 enhances its binding to HEKn cells. The findings also show that pre-treatment with an antibody against \u03b1-DG, integrin-\u03b21, or -\u03b24 inhibited the binding of LN-5-coated M.leprae to HEKn cells. These results suggest that M. leprae binds to keratinocytes by taking advantage of the interaction of LN-5 in the basal lamina of the epidermis and a surface receptor of keratinocytes, such as \u03b1-DG, integrin-\u03b21, or -\u03b24."
