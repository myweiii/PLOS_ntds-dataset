In the current study, we investigated the issue of how M.leprae is phagocytosed by human epidermal keratinocytes, neonatal (HEKn). We focused on the role of LN-5, a predominant form of laminin of the epidermis, in the interaction of M. leprae with keratinocytes. Our results show that M. leprae preferentially binds to LN-5-coated slides and coating M.leprae with LN-5 enhanced its binding to HEKn cells. In addition, a pre-treatment with an antibody against α-DG, integrin-β1 or -β4 inhibited the binding of LN-5-coated M. leprae to HEKn cells. These results suggest that M. leprae binds to keratinocytes by taking advantage of the interaction of LN-5 in the basal lamina of the epidermis and a surface receptor of keratinocytes, such as α-DG, integrin-β1, or -β4.
