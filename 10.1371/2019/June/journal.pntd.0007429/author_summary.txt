Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits pathogenic viruses like chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Inside the vector, the virus replicates in a way so that it is able to survive within the mosquito without causing damage to it. However, once in the mammalian host, it becomes pathogenic and induces death to the infected cells. Amongst several mosquito specific factors that allows or rejects the virus survival, microRNAs play a decisive role. In several studies, miRNAs have shown to be playing role in controlling virus replication either by binding to viral genome or to suppress the expression of any host factor. In the present study, we identified an Aedes miRNA, miR-2944b-5p, which binds to 3'UTR of CHIKV and regulates the replication of the virus in the mosquito. Analysis of the mode of action of this regulation revealed that miR-2944b-5p played a role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential during CHIKV replication by targeting cellular factor vps-13.
