The only currently available method for accurate assessment of the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis is to undertake detailed examination of tissues at necropsy. Most investigations have found that in pigs, Taenia solium encysts in the striated muscles and nervous tissue. Recently an investigation of porcine cysticercosis carried out in Zambia described 27% of infected pigs as having T. solium cysts in the liver, as well some animals having cysts in other unusual tissues locations. We collected lesions from the tissues of pigs derived from T. solium endemic areas in Uganda and Nepal. Particular care was taken to avoid cross contamination of specimens with T. solium DNA from other tissue sites or from other animals. Control tissue samples were collected from the same organs as lesions were collected, but from sites where no lesion was present. The samples were assessed macroscopically, histologically and by PCR-RFLP analysis of DNA isolated from the lesions. Evidence was obtained for lesions in tissues other than the striated muscles and nervous tissue being caused by Taenia hydatigena, Taenia asiatica, Echinococcus granulosus and nematode parasites, however no evidence was found for the presence of any lesion in these tissues being caused by T. solium.
