Leishmania braziliensis is the main etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America. In the Pernambuco state, a highly endemic area for CL in Northeastern Brazil, ten zymodemes have been previously described, identified through the detection of variations in the mobility of selected enzymes on gel electrophoresis (MLEE). Here we used next-generation genome sequencing to reevaluate the genetic diversity and relatedness between isolates representing these zymodemes. The genetic analysis clustered these isolates into three distinct phylogenetic groups, with those circulating in forested environments more related to each other (Z72 and Z75) and separated from the other eight isolates from more urbanized environments, but nevertheless forming two further groups. All ten isolates were definitely identified as L. braziliensis, including one from zymodeme Z26, previously identified as L. shawi through MLEE. Chromosome copy number variation was observed in all isolates studied, but restricted mainly to chromosome 31, with a single isolate (from zymodeme Z27) showing more than two copies of other chromosomes. A low heterozygosity observed only for both Z72/Z75 isolates also confirm differences associated with them. Our findings confirm that MLEE, despite still being considered the gold standard for characterization of Leishmania spp., does not reflect relevant information on intra-specific variations. It also highlights the substantial diversity observed between L. braziliensis isolates.
