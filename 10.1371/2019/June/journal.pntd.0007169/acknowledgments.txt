We are grateful to present and former members of the Hinton lab and Lab H at the Institute of Integrative Biology for helpful discussions. In particular we would like to thank Alex V Predeus and Evelien M Adriaenssens for their ongoing bioinformatic advice and support. We are also grateful to Blanca Perez-Sepulveda for managing the 10 000 Salmonella genomes project, without whom sequencing of these isolates would not have been possible. We would like to express our gratitude to Nicholas Feasey for his advice on Salmonella isolation. We thank the Centre for Snakebite Research and Interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine for access to faecal samples from venomous snakes, and to the Leahurst diagnostics unit at the University of Liverpool for providing access to the collection of Salmonella isolates from reptiles housed at Chester Zoo.
