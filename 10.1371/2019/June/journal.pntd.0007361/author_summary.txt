Knowledge of the microbial communities associated with disease vectors can be exploited for symbiotic control of vector-borne diseases. Here, we characterized and compared the bacterial communities of field-caught populations of Aedes mcintoshi and Aedes ochraceus, the primary vectors of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in Kenya. We show that the two mosquito species harbor distinct microbial communities whose diversity and richness are heavily influenced by the site of collection. Because some bacterial species are known to influence vector susceptibility to pathogens, differences in bacterial communities between the two mosquito species is likely one of the primary factors accounting for the spatial and temporal variation in transmission dynamics of RVF virus.
