Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by ingestion of the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. The liver is the most commonly infected organ. There are currently four treatments for CE: surgery, percutaneous treatment, medical treatment (benzimidazoles), and watch-and-wait strategy. Treatment is decided based on the WHO cyst staging. The surgical techniques employed depend on the cyst location and related complications (e.g. cyst-biliary fistulas, rupture, and secondary bacterial infection). The two principal surgical approaches are radical (resection of the cyst) and conservative (evacuation of the cyst content and partial removal of the cyst capsule) surgeries. In this study, we presented a conservative surgical approach, a standardized endocystectomy technique, that is suitable for surgical residents. This standardized endocystectomy technique is a safe procedure with acceptable morbidity, no mortality, and without recurrences in our patient series. Important components of CE management are interdisciplinary patient care, adequate diagnostic work-ups, and regular pre- and postoperative visits, including long-term follow-up for early and reliable capture of recurrences.
