With the continued activities of the prevention and control programme in China, the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum infection have been reduced to low levels. This makes it impossible to detect any infections in humans or livestock using the traditional approach of fecal and serological testing, so as to evaluate properly the risk map of infection. However, detection of existence of schistosome cercariae in waters could be an alternative way of detecting a potential focus of transmission. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of studies performed over the last 40 years to estimate the overall infection rates of S. japonicum in sentinel mice. The estimate across China in 2004 to 2018 was 3.66%, significantly lower than in 1980 to 2003. The highest estimates were observed in Hunan, followed by Anhui and Jiangxi. Two studies conducted in Hubei in 2015 and 2016 respectively, reported infected sentinel mice where no infected snails had been reported across the province since 2014. Transmission was found be most likely in April, July and October. The estimates largely mirror the ongoing trends of S. japonicum infections in terms of periods and regions. Due to the presence of snails and other infected wildlife, detection of schistosome cercariae in waters with a highly sensitive tool remains of great importance in schistosomiasis monitoring and evaluation. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first time that the potential threat of S. japonicum in nature, to humans and livestock has been assessed in this manner. We would suggest that the current criteria for transmission interruption or elimination of S. japonicum in China be adjusted by integrating the results of sentinel mice.
