Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent human malaria pathogen worldwide, but little is known about its biology as the majority of experimental studies have focused on Plasmodium falciparum, the main cause of malaria in Africa. We therefore know little about the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in P. vivax and have yet to develop tools to experimentally understand drug resistance, which limits the ability to adapt drug policies and reduce the spread of resistance. Here, we used a related parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, as a model system to investigate genes that might be involved in P. vivax drug resistance. Multiple P. vivax proteins were expressed and their location in P. knowlesi was explored using organellar markers. None of the candidates induced changes in parasite response to chloroquine or mefloquine, two front-line antimalarials for which resistance is a concern in P. vivax. This could be due to technical reasons, or could indicate that these genes do not actually play a role in resistance. Despite not linking candidate gene expression to drug resistance phenotypes, we demonstrated that P. knowlesi is a promising model for P. vivax studies with rapid generation of transgenic lines and good expression of exogenous P. vivax proteins.
