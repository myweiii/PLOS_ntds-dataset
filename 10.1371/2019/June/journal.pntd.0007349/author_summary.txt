Nearly 258 million people are infected worldwide by schistosome parasites. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set control guidelines to combat the morbidity and mortality induced by infection, defined by reaching ≤5% and ≤1% prevalence of heavy-intensity infections in school-aged children (SAC), respectively. Mass drug administration (MDA) is the major route for morbidity control and elimination. However, MDA does not provide long-term protection against schistosome parasites and frequent drug administration is therefore required to control morbidity. Infection does not induce lasting acquired immunity to reinfection. Drug resistance is another issue with MDA which, if it arises, could possibly make drug treatment ineffective over time as drug-resistant genes in the parasite population increase in frequency. A vaccine is ideally needed to both reduce the possibility of reinfection and to achieve transmission elimination within a feasible time frame. Based on the recent results obtained for a new candidate vaccine in the baboon animal model, we employ an individual-based stochastic model to assess the impact of a vaccine with an efficacy of 100% when applied in endemic regions with different intensities of transmission. Simulations suggest that the probability of achieving morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem depends on the duration of protection provided by vaccination, the age categories of the human host population vaccinated, and the coverage levels achieved. In order to achieve elimination as a public health problem, model simulations suggest that combining vaccination (with 5 years of protection) with MDA (treating 75% of school-aged children, 5–14 years of age) is the best option, particularly in high transmission settings.
