Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae and is one of the major causes of preventable disability. In the recent years there has been an increase in the number of new leprosy patients with disability in India. People affected by leprosy often experience severe stigmatization because of its disabling consequences. This neglected tropical disease continues to pose a major disease burden in India. Despite the availability of health facilities, there continues to be barriers towards leprosy diagnosis and early treatment. Assessment of risk factors for disability is important in the era of leprosy integration with general health services. Risk factors for disability related to the patient and health care provider were identified to help the policy makers to develop appropriate strategies to promote early diagnosis and prevent disability.
