Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp, is one of the most widespread zoonoses. In recent years, human leptospirosis with occasionally fatal infections has been frequently reported in Jiangxi Province, a highly endemic region located in the south of China. However, there is a lack of information on circulating Leptospira strains in this province. To identify the etiological characteristics, 401 Leptospira from Jiangxi were characterized using serological and molecular typing methods. Serological typing revealed that 61.10% of the isolates belonged to serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae. Two species, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A. agrarius may be the main carrier of leptospirosis in this endemic region. Furthermore, the diversity of leptospiral isolates was demonstrated using MLST analysis. ST1, as the most prevalent ST of pathogenic leptospires, was widely dispersed in China. Significant geographic variation and host diversity in the distribution of dominant species, serogroups and STs were found in Jiangxi. This study is the first to demonstrate the distribution of Leptospira in domestic and wildlife animals in Jiangxi. This retrospective study represents the longest and largest field epidemiological investigation on the etiological characteristics and genetic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira among large wild animal reservoirs and human populations in Jiangxi. A better understanding of the circulating etiological agents and epidemiology of leptospirosis will provide a good starting point for efforts to control and prevent this disease.
