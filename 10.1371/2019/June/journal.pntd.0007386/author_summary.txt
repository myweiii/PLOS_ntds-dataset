Oncomelania hupensis is the sole intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum and it is critical for the long-term sustainable control and elimination of schistosomiasis. We suggest a new analytical framework to predict high-risk snail habitats based on ecological models. Their predictive performance were compared via three indices (receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve, Kappa value and calibrating plot) and further they were classified into three grades with different discrimination ability. The four best models were chosen and combined to identify snail habitats, facilitating classification of the snail habitats in the Poyang Lake region into four risk grades, which should be prioritized for interruption of the snail life cycle, with control intensity and scope dependent on the available health resources.
