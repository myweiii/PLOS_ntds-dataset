Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a serious neglected tropical disease with social stigma and associated disfiguring with health burden, especially in poor endemic regions of the world. Iran is among the seven high burden CL-infected countries. Limited data are available in regarding to CL treatment and related risk determinants. Parasitologically confirmed ACL patients caused by Leishmania tropica were treated over a 5-year period (2012â€“2016), with IL meglumine antimoniate (MA) (Glucantime), combined with cryotherapy or with IM MA alone. The objective of this study was to identify the potential risk factors that are associated with response to treatment. The ensuing results with both therapeutic routes identified 5 major risk determinants namely male patients, lesion on face, multiple lesions, poor treatment regimen and disease duration >4 months. The extent to which medical instructions related to patients, therapy and the healthcare system should be seriously monitored. This requires multidisciplinary actions to address specific barriers which directly threaten the treatment outcome. Furthermore, early detection and prompt treatment <4 months following the disease duration together with implementations of public health education and prophylactic measures should receive priority in high risk areas.
