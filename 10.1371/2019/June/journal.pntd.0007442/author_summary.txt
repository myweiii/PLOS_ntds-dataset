Mass distribution of a single dose of the broad-spectrum antibiotic azithromycin twice per year to pre-school children in Sub-Saharan Africa has been shown to reduce childhood mortality. The mechanism by which azithromycin reduces mortality is currently not clear, especially since the antibiotic is not targeted to sick children but rather given to all children in the community whether or not they have an infectious disease. In this study, we report the height and weight of children enrolled in a trial in Ethiopia in which communities were randomized either to twice annual mass azithromycin distributions for blinding trachoma or to no treatments. After accounting for age and sex, children from azithromycin-treated communities were on average slightly taller at the 12- and 36-month study visits than those from untreated communities, but the difference was not statistically significant.
