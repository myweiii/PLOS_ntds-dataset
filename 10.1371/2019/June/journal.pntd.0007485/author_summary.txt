Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is both a prominent global cause of zoonotic gastroenteritis, in association with the industrial production of eggs and poultry, and of bloodstream-invasive infection in sub-Saharan Africa, a clinical syndrome referred to as invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease. African epidemic iNTS strains are frequently multi-drug resistant, leaving fluoroquinolone antibiotics as key agents in reducing iNTS-associated morbidity and mortality. We analysed the genomes of S. Enteritidis collected in Ghana from patients with iNTS disease to investigate the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in the region. Extensive phylogenetic diversity was present, however, fluoroquinolone resistance was confined to a single clade causing global epidemics of poultry-associated gastroenteritis. This resistance has predominantly emerged locally, rather than being imported. We found that antimicrobial resistance patterns differed by S. Enteritidis clade, highlighting the challenges of devising empirical sepsis treatment guidelines in the absence of diagnostic microbiology facilities to monitor changes in resistance profiles. Furthermore, we detected fluoroquinolone resistance in closely related poultry and human isolates, suggesting a role of antimicrobial use within the growing local poultry industry in driving the emergence of resistance and a need for surveillance measures within this industry to protect a human population at high risk of iNTS disease.
