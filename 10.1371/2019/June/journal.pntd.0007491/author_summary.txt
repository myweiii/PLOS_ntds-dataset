Ministries of health in multiple countries have made progress in reducing the prevalence of trachoma, the leading cause of infectious blindness. With the increase in displaced populations throughout the world, the work of these national programs could be put at risk as formerly endemic or non-endemic districts now host large numbers of refugees from trachoma endemic regions. To properly respond, national programs must first assess the extent of the disease. We conducted baseline surveys in South Sudanese refugee camps located in two Sudanese localities to determine the prevalence of trachoma. These surveys showed that conducting prevalence surveys in refugee camp settings was possible. Trachoma was found to be present within the refugee camp population and programmatic interventions are required. The global community cannot expect to eliminate trachoma in the near future if displaced populations within countries and across country borders are not addressed.
