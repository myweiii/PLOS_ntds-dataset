DVI among children is a leading cause of hospitalization in endemic areas. In developing or underdeveloped countries, the antibiotics stewardship policy has not been well implemented yet. Thus, the risk of unnecessary antibiotics used in hospitalized patients becomes higher. Changing the way medical doctors use antibiotics is needed to greatly slow down the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We evaluate whether antibiotics administration given to hospitalized children with DVIinfection in two different hospital settings, teaching and private hospitals, were appropriate. The use of antibiotics in private hospitals was inappropriate in most cases while the use of antibiotics in the teaching hospital was more accountable. This study indicated that intervention should be made, such as the implementation of the antibiotics stewardship program, especially in private hospitals, to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.
