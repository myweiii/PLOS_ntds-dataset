Helminth infections are a highly prevalent global health problem. These parasitic worm infections occur in areas also burdened with intestinal protozoan infections, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus. While these pathogens tend to be studied in isolation, there remains a need to better understand the nature, extent, and health consequences of helminth polyparasitism and co-infection with major diseases. Here, we reviewed the literature and performed meta-analyses to evaluate the commonality of helminth polyparasitism and co-infection, the potential for interspecies interactions between parasites, the association between parasite pairs, and the health consequences among multiply-infected individuals. We confirmed that polyparasitism and co-infection with major diseases are common in the global South and found that multiply-infected individuals experienced worse health consequences when compared to singly or not-multiply infected individuals. Our analysis suggested the potential presence of interspecies interactions and we identified the existence of positive associations between parasite pairs. These findings support the call for integrating deworming into malaria, TB, and HIV treatment protocols and suggest there remains a need to improve our understanding of the factors influencing co-transmission to achieve sustainable parasite control.
