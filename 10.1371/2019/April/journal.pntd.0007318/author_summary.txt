Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, affects over 200,000 people annually worldwide and remains endemic in the ethnically diverse, mountainous and underdeveloped southwestern regions of China. Although it is curable, delayed diagnosis of leprosy persists in China, with a disability rate as high as 20% nationwide. To identify the source of infection and block transmission more effectively, further knowledge about the diagnostic value of antigen-specific induced host immune responses in patients is needed. The current study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of an overnight whole-blood assay for the diagnosis of paucibacillary (PB) leprosy patients, and differences in the ability of specific M. leprae antigens to stimulate a panel of host markers was tested by an overnight whole-blood assay. Our findings suggest that host markers induced by specific M. leprae antigens in an overnight WBA have diagnostic value in leprosy patients and discriminatory value between leprosy patients and healthy household contacts (HHCs) or tuberculosis (TB) patients.
