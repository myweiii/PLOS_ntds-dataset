Culex species are highly prevalent in both urban and rural settings in Cameroon and are responsible for high nuisance and transmission of pathogens such as Wuchereria bancrofti and arbovirus. Despite the important epidemiological role, that Culex could play, they are still less studied. The current study was conducted to assess Culex species distribution, susceptibility to insecticide and role in W. bancrofti transmission in the city of Yaoundé. Mosquito collection was conducted using three collection methods human landing catches, CDC light traps and larval collection. Once collected, mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys and PCR diagnostic tools. They were later processed to determine their infection status. Bioassays with Culex females of 2 to 5 days old were conducted to determine their susceptibility level to different insecticide families. Culex quinquefasciatus emerged as the most abundant species. Up to 13 different culicine species were recorded. Culex species were recorded to be highly resistant to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin. A high frequency of the West Africa kdr allele was recorded. No mosquito was detected to be infected by LF.
The study confirms the need for further xenomonitoring activities in order to control the risk of outbreaks due to Culex mosquitoes in the city of Yaoundé.
