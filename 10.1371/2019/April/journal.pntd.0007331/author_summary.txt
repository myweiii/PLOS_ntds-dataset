Pattern of diseases in a community are associated with changes of culture, socio-economic and environmental conditions. In Malaysia, while transition towards modernity by socio-economic development has shown significant reduction in intestinal parasitism in the general population, no significant difference was observed among the Orang Asli (indigenous) communities. Nevertheless, since the 1970s, the Malaysian government has initiated the Resettlement Plan Scheme (RPS) to improve health, socio-economic status and education opportunities of the OA. Known as hunter gatherers, the Negritos represent a good model to study the effects of living conditions transition on intestinal parasitism. Like other tribes, they are also undergoing the transition from foraging and gathering practices towards demarginalization primarily by resettlement. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate STH infections in two categories of Negritos; (i) Inland Jungle Villages (IJV) communities, living in the interior forested areas and (ii) the Negritos who have been gathered and relocated to designated settlements closer to towns (RPS). A study to compare the current pattern of STH profiles in terms of prevalence and intensity of infection together with their associated risk factors among these two categories of communities was conducted. Since STHs are still plaguing the OA communities, the information gathering in the present study will be crucial for customizing a cost-effective deworming program involving selection of drug dosages, frequency of administration, type of modalities and most importantly community inclusion and empowerment programs through health education.
