Due to the rapid urbanization of China, many villages in the urban fringe are enveloped by ever-expanding cities and become so-called urban villages (UVs). UVs are widely distributed in not only the Guangzhou core areas but also the other cities in the highly urbanized region of China (e.g., Shenzhen, Wuhan). UVs are commonly featured by poor sanitation, overcrowding population, absent infrastructure, and some environmental pollution due to the development is neither authorized nor planned, resulting in a high environmental suitability for some vectors (e.g., Aedes albopictus), as well as the vetor-borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever) in these regions. In this study, we demonstrated that UVs may serve as transfer stations for the transmission of DF epidemic in the regions with developed transportation, higher GDP and dense population. This is manifested as that the rates of DF incidences were significantly positively associated with UV area. Furthermore, the density of DF cases and the DF incidence rates in UVs were 1.81–3.13 and 1.82–3.06 times of that of normal construction land and about 90% of the total DF cases were concentrated in 500m radius of UVs’ buffers. And the aggregation effects of UVs on this epidemic in the central region were obviously affected by public traffic conditions at the grid level. This study is the first quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between UVs, public transportation, road density, population density, GDP and DF epidemics, which will provide a useful reference for accurately preventing and controlling DF epidemic in urban regions with numerous UVs.
