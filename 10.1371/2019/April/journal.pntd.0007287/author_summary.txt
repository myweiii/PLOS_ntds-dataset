HPX8C is a heme-containing peroxidase, which can move reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage to the organism by reducing H2O2 to H2O. Previously, the peroxidase gene has been shown to modulate midgut immunity and regulate anti-malarial response in mosquitoes. In this study, the classical immune signaling pathways, Toll and IMD genes might be late responses against the viruses. HPX8C was demonstrated here to play a role in antiviral immunity against DENV infection in Ae. Aegypti mosquitoes. HPX8C expression was induced by DENV infection and continued to increase with an elevated virus titer. In HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes, the ROS level was found to be increased with a corresponding decrease in the DENV and ZIKV virus titer. Therefore, it was speculated that HPX8C mediated immune responses against the DENV in the mosquito in the late stage of viral infection, which could be controlled by Toll pathway.
