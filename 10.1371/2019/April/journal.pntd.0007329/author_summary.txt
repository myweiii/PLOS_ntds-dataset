Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease that mainly affects the nerves. If untreated, it may cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes leading to physical disability. Through use of a combination of drugs, Kenya was able to declare the disease as eliminated in the year 1989. However, there are still pockets of leprosy in some Kenyan counties where physical disability persists, mainly due to late diagnosis. To be able to curb this disease, control measures must be intensified, especially in the counties reporting more cases. We used data of the leprosy cases reported in Kenya for the period 2012 through to 2015 in order to describe geographical variation and factors influencing this variation. More than half of the registered cases had visible physical disability. The risk of leprosy notification increased with an increase in age as well as the severity of disease. We estimated that people living in Kwale, Kilifi and Homabay counties are 15, 9, and 5 times respectively more at risk of leprosy as compared to the whole country. Given the limited resources, itâ€™s therefore paramount that high risk counties be initially targeted for control, with a focus on early diagnosis.
