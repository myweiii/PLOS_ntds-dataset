Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease. It has been recorded in southern Africa including Namibia since the early 19th century. At present, Namibia is aiming at controlling the disease in its main reservoir, the domestic dog. This study assessed the baseline data for rabies surveillance in Namibia from 2011â€“2017. There are continuous reports of rabies in humans mainly from the Northern Communal Areas, with a total of 113 cases from 2011 to 2017. Among animal rabies submissions, the vast majority of canine samples originated from communal farm land, whereas kudu and eland submissions were almost exclusively from freehold farmland. Cattle samples were submitted evenly among freehold farms and communal land use. Those three species, i.e. dogs, cattle and kudus represent the animal species with the highest numbers of sample submissions and positives. Spatially, the transmission cycle of rabies in dogs appears restricted to the northern communal areas of Namibia, whilst rabies in wildlife species is predominately reported from farmland in central Namibia, affecting mostly the kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros). Given the spatial overlap of kudu and livestock rabies cases, an independent horizontal transmission cycle among kudus as previously suggested is highly unlikely. Rather, wildlife canids such as jackals or bat-eared foxes could be the reservoir for wildlife rabies in Namibia.
