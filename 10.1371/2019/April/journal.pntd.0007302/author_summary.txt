With the introduction of new interventions to prevent leprosy, such as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) given to contacts of leprosy patients, it is necessary to update our understanding of knowledge and perception of leprosy among the populations where these interventions will be introduced, in order to tailor communication optimally to the current situation. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding leprosy in Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. A cross-sectional study design with a mixed-methods approach was used. We assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices with the KAP measure, and stigma with the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue community stigma scale (EMIC-CSS) and the Social Distance Scale (SDS). A total of 446 participants were included: 100 people affected by leprosy, 111 close contacts, 185 community members and 50 health care workers. In addition, 24 in-depth interviews were conducted and 35 people were included in focus group discussions. This study revealed poor knowledge regarding leprosy among all four participant groups. Knowledge on mode of transmission, cause and symptoms of leprosy was especially poor. In addition, we found high levels of stigma and social distance towards people affected by leprosy. Community education that takes cultural beliefs, knowledge gaps and fears into consideration could improve knowledge, reduce misconceptions and positively influence the perception of leprosy.
