The strategy of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is based on the surveillance of patients suffering from Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) and mass vaccination with live-attenuated vaccine strains of polioviruses (PVs) in endemic areas. However, vaccine strains of PVs can circulate and replicate for a long time when the vaccine coverage of the population is low. Such prolonged circulation and replication of vaccine strains of PVs can result to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses [cVDPVs] that are as virulent as wild PVs. In this study, we performed the molecular characterization of a large collection of 377 virus isolates recovered from paralyzed patients between 2008 and 2012 in DR Congo and healthy children in 2013 in the Kasai Oriental and Maniema provinces of DR Congo. We found that the genetic diversity of enteroviruses of the species Enterovirus C is more important than previously reported. Interestingly, 50 of the 54 cVDPVs featured recombinant genomes containing exogenous sequences of the 2C ATPase and/or 3D polymerase coding genes acquired from co-circulating Coxsackieviruses A13, A17 and A20. Coxsackieviruses A20 strains were identified for the first time as major partners of genetic recombination with co-circulating live-attenuated polio vaccine strains.
Our findings highlight the need to reinforce and maintain high quality surveillance of PVs and efficient immunization activities in order to ensure early detection and control of emerging cVDPVs in all settings where high frequency and diversity of Coxsackieviruses A13, A17 and A20 have been documented.
