Zika virus (ZIKV) was first discovered in Uganda in 1947, and is thought to have spread from Africa through equatorial Asia in the middle of the 20th century. Along the way the virus diversified, so that now two genetic lineages, African and Asian/American, are recognized. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), the set of fetal and neonatal complications associated with ZIKV infection in pregnancy, was noted during the recent outbreak in the Americas. But the origins of CZS remain a mystery. In particular, it is unclear whether ZIKV recently acquired the ability to cause CZS, perhaps as Asian-lineage viruses spread to the Americas, or whether African-lineage viruses can also cause CZS. To address this question, we used a mouse model of vertical ZIKV transmission to assess pathogenic potential to the fetus of African and Asian/American ZIKV. Our data show that ZIKV of both African and Asian/American lineages can cause fetal harm in the mouse pregnancy model, and that this capacity does not require asparagine at amino acid residue 139, which recently emerged in Asian-lineage viruses and has been suggested to increase ZIKVâ€™s pathogenic potential for fetuses. Our results, therefore imply that ZIKV infection during pregnancy poses a risk for fetal harm in all regions where the virus is endemic.
