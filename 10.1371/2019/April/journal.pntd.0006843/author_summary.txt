Clonorchis sinensis, a human fluke, resides in the liver of humans and is commonly found in the common bile duct and gall bladder. This parasite is the main cause of cholangiocarcinoma, also called bile duct cancer, in humans. Of note, the excretory-secretory products (ESP) of C. sinensis are known to cause inflammation in the biliary epithelium, which may ultimately result in neoplasms via production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent DNA damage. Together with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potent hepatotoxin that can cause fibrosis and tumors in the liver, ESP led to an increase in the growth and proliferation of cholangiocytes. Our results showed that examination of changes in the expression of gap junction proteins, which are related to tumorigenesis, showed that connexin 43 was upregulated with ESPs from C. sinensis and NDMA. Together, our results suggest that exposure to C. sinensis, in addition to low levels of carcinogen could promote carcinogenesis in the bile duct epithelium via uncontrolled cell-to-cell communication. Moreover, silencing of Cx43 reduced cancer related protein. Therefore, Cx 43 can serve as a potential target for developing a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in humans.
