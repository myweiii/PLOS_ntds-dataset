In Mexico, estimates of Chagas disease prevalence and burden vary widely due to the ecology and epidemiology of this disease resulting of many geographical, ecological, biological, and social interactions. Better data are thus urgently needed to help develop appropriate public health programs for disease control and patient care. In this study we performed a meta-analysis from published data on T. cruzi infection seroprevalence in Mexico between 2006 and 2017. This systematic review shows a national estimated seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection of 3.38% [95%CI 2.59â€“4.16], with over 4.06 million cases in Mexico, which is higher than previously recognized. The presence of T. cruzi infection in specific subpopulations such as pregnant women, children and blood donors also informs on specific risks of infection and calls for the implementation of well-established control interventions. This work confirms the place of Mexico as the country with the largest number of cases, highlighting the urgency of establishing Chagas disease control as a key national public health priority.
