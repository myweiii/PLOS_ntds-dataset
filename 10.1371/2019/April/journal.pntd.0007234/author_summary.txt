Standard human landing catches (sHLCs) have historically been used to obtain key Onchocerca volvulus transmission data that has helped with the design and monitoring of the WHOÂ´s onchocerciasis control programmes. To avoid the health risks associated with sHLCs, alternative human-bait-free blackfly trapping methods, most of which immobilize and suffocate blackflies with a viscous liquid substance, have been developed. Questions, however, have be raised as to whether these human-bait-free trapping methods generate O. volvulus transmission data that is directly comparable with historic sHLC data. In this study, we have combined sHLCs with mineral oil vector capture and shown that the skin application of mineral oil can significantly reduce (and possibly eliminate) simuliid biting during HLCs. In direct comparisons, we have shown that mineral oil protected human landing catches (mopHLCs) were more efficient at capturing the O. volvulus vector Simulium oyapockense than sHLCs. We have also shown that mopHLCs, performed in isolation of vector collectors using exposed skin for their trapping, are less efficient than HLCs, but still function well. We believe that mopHLCs represent a promising alternative to sHLCs that merit further testing for their utility in the epidemiological monitoring of onchocerciasis and, indeed, other vector borne diseases as well.
