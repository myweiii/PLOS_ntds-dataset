Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, an often fatal tick-borne viral disease, has made an impact in the Sultanate of Oman—affecting nationals and expatriates alike—for the past 20 years. In this retrospective review of the epidemiology and outcomes of cases in Oman from 1995 to 2017, we identified 4 sporadic cases in 1995 and 1996, then none until 2011, followed by a steady increase until 2017. The mortality rate of 32 of 88 cases (36.4%) is high in comparison to studies from other countries and this could be explained by under-diagnoses of milder cases in the Sultanate. Transmission is commonly associated with animal husbandry and butchering and 88% cases were infected by contact with animals, whereas transmission by tick bite is more commonly recorded in some countries. A proportion of cases (23.8%) were clustered around the Eid-Al-Ahda festival which has, from 2011–2017, occurred in the summer months, which have a higher risk of transmission. This additional risk has been noted and preventive measures have been introduced to reduce the risk of transmission to animal handlers and butchers.
