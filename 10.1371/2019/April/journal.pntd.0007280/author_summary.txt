Dengue is a disease caused by four separate but related viruses transmitted by mosquitos. In this systematic review, we aimed to describe dengue research in the Philippines, where the disease is of great concern, to better understand the types of dengue research and the main findings and important gaps. We identified 135 studies that described dengue research in the Philippines during the past 60 years. Our review showed that in the early years, dengue studies were mainly simple descriptive studies and case reports. Recently the types of investigations have become more complex and diverse, reflecting advancement in local research capacity and infrastructure but more research activity would be beneficial in several areas.
