Infections with dengue viruses and malaria protozoans affect approximately a third of the world´s population and their epidemiologic patterns constitute a burden for the human health and the global economy. Even though infections with these parasites are often asymptomatic, it a spectrum of physiologic responses can be elicited from the human hosts, including fever. We explore here a hitherto unknown beneficial role of febrile temperatures, namely the increase in antibody affinity for relevant antigens from these pathogens at 40°C, compared to the physiologic body temperature. We also highlight the importance of temperature equilibration prior to protein-protein measurements in vitro. We anticipate that these results are useful for delineating the role of febrile temperatures in the immune response against infections.
