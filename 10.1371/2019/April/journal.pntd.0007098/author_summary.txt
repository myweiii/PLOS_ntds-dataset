Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community. Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and in the disease progress. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1β, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients’ demographic characteristics. The results of this study showed that, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. However, the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1β cytokine Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a negative significant association with IL-12. These findings uncover a possible the role of IL-35 and IL-37 in the pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may declare their potential value in treatment of mycetoma.
