Burkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental bacterium, causes melioidosis, a serious but neglected infectious disease that is endemic in many tropical regions. Infection routes include inoculation, ingestion and inhalation. Several environmental sources serve as niches for persistence, providing a mechanism for further dissemination of the bacterium across distances, increasing the risk of human infection through repeated exposure or consumption. Understanding the exposure-relevant environmental sources and transmission routes is required to prevent and control the infection. The present study demonstrates several environmental samples, including those collected from soil and the rice rhizosphere as well as from various water sources, such as pond, rain, dug wells, and pump wells, from sampling points near the patientâ€™s residence were the reservoirs of B. pseudomallei with diverse genotypes. This suggests that the patient was exposed to B. pseudomallei multiple times. Thus, intervention strategies targeted at controlling environmental sources, preventing disease spread, and increasing education measures to reduce B. pseudomallei infection-related morbidity and mortality in Northeast Thailand are urgently required.
