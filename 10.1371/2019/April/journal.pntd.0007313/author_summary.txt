Visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. The disease is endemic in several Brazilian regions, including the city of Belo Horizonte, where visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum and transmitted by Lutzomyia longipalpis. This study evaluated the competence of non-human primates to infect Lutzomyia longipalpis with Leishmania infantum. Eight of 52 non-human primates were positive to leishmaniasis by xenodiagnosis, i.e. capable of infecting sand flies, with averages of 5.67 to 1,181.93 promastigotes/Î¼g of DNA. Positive animals had higher levels of IgG anti-Lu. longipalpis saliva when compared to negative animals, prior to xenodiagnosis. This study highlights the importance of non-human primates in the leishmaniasis cycle, providing information that is relevant for development of better public health strategies, and to conservation medicine.
