In Nepal, immunisation using a live attenuated vaccine is given against Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by the mosquito-transmitted JE virus (JEV). JE immunisation has taken place via catch-up campaigns and is now part of the routine immunisation programme. Although previous studies have shown good vaccine efficacy in areas where there is a lot of natural exposure to the virus (high endemicity), it is suggested that the efficacy may wane in areas where transmission is lower. Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the same family and genus as JEV. Previous infection with DENV may also influence the immune response to JEV. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Nepal to measure immunity to JE, in districts of differing historic JE incidence, and time from JE vaccination. This showed that neutralising antibody to JEV was found more frequently in districts which had been the subject of more vaccination campaigns, rather than in the most recently vaccinated district. In addition, we cannot rule out a role for natural exposure to JEV in maintaining higher antibody levels. Additionally, the study showed that previous exposure to DENV was positively associated with an immune response to JEV, though this effect was modest. We conclude that there is a need to consider further JE vaccine catch up campaigns in some areas especially given that we could detect JEV IgM, indicating ongoing transmission. We show that ELISA yielded many false negative results for exposure to JEV or vaccination, when compared with neutralising antibody. We also identified some individuals during the course of the study with DENV IgM in their blood, but with no history of travel to India. This suggests that DENV may have become established in some areas of Nepal.
