Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira strains, is an emerging bacterial zoonotic disease mostly affecting humans in tropical countries. Despite its public health importance, little is known about the strains that are circulating worldwide due to the lack of a universal common language on strain types. In this work we describe a new strain genotyping and classification system that is highly standardized, thus facilitating global collaboration, and that can discriminate all members of the Leptospira genus at high resolution. We then examine the genetic diversity of Leptospira strains from different origins. This study provides a framework for optimizing diagnostic methods and epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis.
