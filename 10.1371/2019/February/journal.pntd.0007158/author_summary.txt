Scrub typhus is a neglected tropical disease that causes acute fever and can cause serious complications without appropriate antibiotic treatment. Diagnosis is usually made by the detection of specific antibodies or the causative agentâ€“Orientia tsutsugamushi. Specific antibodies can be detected using ELISA technology however there is an apparent lack of standardization in the development of cut-offs used in diagnostic accuracy studies and observational studies. This study assessed 46 studies that used ELISA antibody cut-offs to diagnose scrub typhus patients. Overall, 22 studies (47.8%) provided little to no explanation as to how the ELISA cut-off was derived, and 7 studies (15.2%) did not even state the cut-off used. Furthermore, with the exception of studies using ELISAs manufactured by InBios company, there was no standard approach to the selection of antigenic strains, and therefore they may not be representative of the local antigenic strains causing disease. As a result, we have concluded that there is a lack of consensus in the determination of a cut-off. We recommend interpreting the results from these studies with caution and further studies will need to be conducted at each geographic location to determine region-specific cut-offs take into consideration background antibody levels to discriminate true disease from healthy individuals.
