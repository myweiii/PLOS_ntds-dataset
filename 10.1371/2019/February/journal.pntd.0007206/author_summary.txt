The available drugs used in treatment of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, include pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B. The cost and associated toxicity of the drugs, side effects and the emergence of drug resistance parasites, as well as the discomfort in drug administration suggests the need for new and better chemotherapeutic interventions. Iron is involved in several biological processes in the Leishmania parasite and itâ€™s important for its growth and survival. The effects of using iron chelators to deprive parasite of iron was investigated in this study. Treatment of L. donovani with rosmarinic acid and apigenin inhibited the growth of promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in a dose dependent manner. Morphologically, the compounds induced alterations in the parasites upon treatments. Rosmarinic acid was observed to cause the dysfunction of the mitochondria and alter the expression of iron dependent enzymes. Rosmarinic acid ability to chelate iron could be responsible for the changes in cell morphology and cell cycle observed.
