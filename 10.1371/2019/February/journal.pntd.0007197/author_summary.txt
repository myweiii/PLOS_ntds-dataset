The envenomation by venomous animals is considered a common and serious occupational disease, especially in rural areas of tropical developing countries. Its public health relevance has been largely ignored by medical authorities worldwide. Specifically in regions of southern and southeast Brazil, accidents with the venomous caterpillar Lonomia obliqua have been an emergent problem, not only for their high incidence rates, but also by the severity of the clinical consequences observed in envenomation cases. Frequently, envenomed victims present a severe hemorrhagic syndrome that can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and death. L. obliqua venom is highly nephrotoxic, AKI is the main cause of death between patients and its mechanisms are poorly understood. Even after the introduction of antivenom therapy in 1995, there was no reduction in the incidence of AKI. In this work we investigated the contribution of kallikrein to the hemodynamic instability, inflammation and consequent renal and vascular impairment during envenomation. A multidisciplinary approach was employed including methods of renal physiology/biochemistry, morphological and cell culture analysis. We believe the data presented here give new insights to the actual knowledge presenting kallikrein and the kinin system as key points to control the progression of renal disease, which may be explored as an approach complementary to serotherapy.
