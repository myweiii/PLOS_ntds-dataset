Leishmania parasites are a significant threat, causing some 0.9â€“1.6 million new infections and 20,000 deaths annually. Amphotericin B is gaining importance in control of leishmaniasis, as other treatment options are increasingly compromised by emergent drug resistance. We sought to identify mechanisms by which resistance to amphotericin B could emerge through experimental selection and characterisation of four novel resistant L. mexicana lines. Whilst in all cases, sterol metabolism was dramatically affected, in three lines specific sterol changes resulted from decreased expression of the sterol biosynthesis enzyme sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT). We found that this resulted from structural variation events at the genome level, resulting in specific loss of the more highly expressed SMT gene copy. These events appear to arise due to repetitive sequence elements in the genomic region, suggesting that SMT could be particularly prone to loss of expression in this manner. Moreover, in at least one line, we found that disruption of SMT function was not associated with any loss of fitness. These findings are significant in demonstrating that an apparently common mechanism of resistance-associated mutation does not compromise parasite virulence, thus representing a possible route to emergent resistance in the clinical setting.
