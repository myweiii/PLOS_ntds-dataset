African trypanosomes cause significant disease in humans and animals across sub-Saharan Africa. For both human and animal infections diagnostics that can accurately identify an active infection are lackingâ€“this is particularly the case in animal disease where most diagnosis is based upon clinical signs, which is not a specific or sensitive means of detecting infection. There is therefore a significant unmet need for a pathogen marker of active infection that accurately indicates whether an animal or human is currently infected. Through analysing the blood of cattle infected with trypanosomes, we identified a short sequence of RNA that was present at very high levels. This small RNA derives from the trypanosome genome, and we could identify its presence in the genome of all three species that are responsible for human and animal disease. We were able to design species-specific tests, and showed that in samples from infected animals the assays were more sensitive than the traditional microscope-based detection, importantly the signal disappeared relatively quickly after successful treatment, and when treatment failed, the assay was able to accurately identify when infection persisted. We also demonstrated that the causative agent of human trypanosomiasis secretes the marker at similar levels to that seen in the animal-infective trypanosomes. Therefore, we have discovered a marker of trypanosome infection that is present at high levels in the blood of infected animals, disappears quickly upon successful treatment, but is effective at detecting instances of unsuccessful treatment and persistent infection. This represents a potentially powerful diagnostic tool for human and animal trypanosomiasis.
