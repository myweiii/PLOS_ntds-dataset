Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a diverse group of nanoparticles involved in intercellular communication under physiological and pathological conditions. Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan that causes Chagas disease, releases EVs that facilitate parasite invasion of the host cell, immunomodulate the host response, and help the parasite to evade this response. However, little is known about how the host cell is altered. In this work, we confirm that EVs of tissue-culture cell-derived trypomastigotes of the Pan4 strain increase cell parasitism. We also demonstrate that EVs affect cell permeability in Vero cells and cardiomyocytes and raise intracellular Ca2+ levels, altering the actin filaments and arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phases. This work seeks to elucidate the way in which EVs influence certain aspects of the cell physiology that favour the establishment of this parasite inside the host cell.
