Tick feeding results in negative health and economic consequences worldwide and there has been continued interest in the development of products with novel mechanisms of action for control of tick populations. Kir channels have been shown to be a significant ion conductance pathway in arthropods and are critical for proper functioning of multiple biological processes. Previous work on insect Kir channels has focused on their physiological roles in renal system of mosquitoes and the data suggest that these channels represent a viable pathway to induce renal failure that leads to mortality. Based on the functional and cellular similarities of arthropod salivary glands and Malpighian tubules, we hypothesized that Kir channels constitute a critical conductance pathway within arthropod salivary glands and inhibition of this pathway will preclude feeding. Data presented in this study show that pharmacological modulators of Kir channels elicited a significant reduction in the fluid and ion secretory activity of tick salivary glands that resulted in reduced feeding, altered osmoregulation, and lead to mortality. These data could guide the future development of novel acaricides, RNAi, or genetically modified ticks to mitigate health and economic damages resulting from their feeding. Further, these data indicate a conserved function of Kir channels within multiple tissues of taxonomically diverse organisms, such as ticks and humans.
