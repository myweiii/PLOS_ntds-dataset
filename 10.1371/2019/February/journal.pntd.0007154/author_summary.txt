Most childhood diarrheal diseases studies focus on children from health centers or emergency hospitals that contribute to a lack of understanding of the etiology of community diarrhea. We aimed to investigate the etiology and severity of diarrheal diseases in children living in Brazil’s low-income, semiarid region communities. We used a case-control study of diarrhea (1,200 children, 596 cases and 604 controls) and showed that six enteropathogens (norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, STEC, Giardia and EAEC) are associated with diarrhea in these communities. Furthermore, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) was associated with a high diarrhea clinical severity score. These findings help further the understanding of diarrheal disease etiology of previously unevaluated children from Brazil’s low-income semiarid region. This study contributes new information that expands our knowledge of diarrheal etiology in non-hospitalized children from developing countries. Moreover, we believe this work will support further research on specific enteropathogens, with special attention to the role of EAEC in severe cases of diarrhea and guide public health policies and physicians in the management of diarrheal diseases in Brazil’s low-income semiarid region.
