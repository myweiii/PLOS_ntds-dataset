Approximately half of the worldâ€™s population is at risk of contracting dengue virus (DENV). Ethical and logistical concerns with feeding lab-raised mosquitoes directly on naturally infected human subjects, and the lack of a relevant animal model for DENV experimental infection, are important obstacles to better understanding DENV transmission from humans to mosquitoes. Results from artificial infectious blood meals can bias estimates of mosquito infection and transmission rates. Based on 12 focus group discussions, we determined that the practice of feeding uninfected lab-raised mosquitoes on naturally infected human subjects is highly acceptable to people living in Iquitos, Peru, especially after common concerns are addressed. The majority of participants were willing to have mosquitoes feed on them directly and to give venous blood samples to feed to mosquitoes indirectly. Most participants stated a preference for direct feeding. This formative research, including recognition of and addressing common misconceptions, will help guide future development of protocols using biologically relevant direct mosquito feeding methods.
