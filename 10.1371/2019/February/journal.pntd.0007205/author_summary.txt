Leptospirosis, a neglected tropical disease with a global distribution, is estimated to kill 60,000 people every year. Predicting those at risk of developing severe disease is challenging, and a simple scoring system to quantify the risk of severe disease has proven elusive. Identifying the high-risk patient is important, as it might expedite the initiation of life-saving supportive care. This review of 402 adult patients with leptospirosis in tropical Australia determined that three clinical variables identified at presentation independently predicted severe disease (a subsequent requirement for Intensive Care Unit admission, intubation, vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy or the development of pulmonary haemorrhage). These three variables (abnormal auscultatory findings on respiratory examination, hypotension and oliguria) were used to generate a simple, three-point clinical score which can be determined rapidly and reliably at the bedside by health care workers with minimal training. This simple score may help the clinical management of patients with leptospirosis, particularly in lower and middle-income countries that bear the greatest burden of disease.
