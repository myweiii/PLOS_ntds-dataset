Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that infects mammals, transmitted by triatomine insect vectors in America, causing Chagas disease in humans. There are six T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs). Our goal was to estimate T. cruzi infection rates and describe the DTUs present in mammals and triatomines of Chile, evaluating spatial and temporal variation. We captured nine small mammal and two triatomine species in six localities during two periods (summer/winter) of the same year. We detected T. cruzi DNA and some DTUs were identified. We report one mammal species infected for the first time. Infection presented significant variation among species. The endemic vector had higher infection rates than Triatoma infestans. The DTUs TcI, TcII, TcV and TcVI were present, with predominance of TcI. Temporally, we detected higher rates of infection during summer in small mammals and during winter in triatomines. Infection was spatially and temporally aggregated in small mammals and vectors. Some species might have higher risk of infection, and this may be different between localities or periods, or even within the same locality.
