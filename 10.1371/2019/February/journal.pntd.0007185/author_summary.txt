Survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) experienced stigma throughout the 2013â€“2016 West African outbreak, but post-outbreak experiences of EVD-related stigma have been limited to qualitative studies. We adapted a 7-item EVD-related stigma index from the HIV literature, which was administered to EVD survivors of the observational cohort, Ebola Natural History Study, in Liberia beginning in June 2015. While 63% of 859 EVD survivors reported any EVD-related stigma during the end of the outbreak in Liberia, only 5% of 741 survivors reported any stigma 18-months post-outbreak, suggesting that survivors experienced little to no EVD-related stigma in the absence of active Ebola virus transmission. Among survivors who screened negative for stigma, additional probing may be considered based on age, education, and referral to care.
