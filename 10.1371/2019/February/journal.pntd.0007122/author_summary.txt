Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can be transmitted to child during pregnancy, or postpartum, by an infected mother. Syphilis in children can interfere in the development and, in some cases, may lead to death. We analyzed cases of syphilis during pregnancy and mother-to-child transmission of syphilis from 2007 to 2013 occurred in a Brazilian region. We used a public online website provided by the Brazilian government to obtain information about cases, generate map locations and design a transmission pattern in the region. During the period investigated, we identified 80 cases of syphilis in pregnant woman and 61 related to mother-to-child transmission, both notified mainly during Summer (from November to February). Children infection might be related to incorrect treatment of mother and the partner. Not only the mother must be treated but the partner as well, otherwise women may be infected during pregnancy, transmitting syphilis to fetus. This study may help in the establishment of measures to control and eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.
