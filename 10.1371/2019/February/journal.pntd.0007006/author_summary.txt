Echinococcosis occurs in humans as a result of infection by a cestodes of the genus Echinococcus. One of the species, E. granulosus, causes cystic echinococcosis (CE) in humans worldwide. In the lifecycle there is a definitive host (generally dogs) which host this parasites at the small bowel. From there, ground is shed with the eggs of the parasite through feces and the intermediate host (usually a sheep or other herbivores get infected). Humans act as an incidental intermediate host when they become infected through the consumption of water or food contaminated with Echinococcus eggs. Once the egg has been ingested, it penetrates the intestinal mucosa and through the circulatory system finds an anatomical site forming a cystic lesion (hydatid or hydatid cyst). Characteristically, CE are found in the liver and the lungs, but virtually any part of the body may be affected. Incidence of osseous CE is low, its diagnosis and management is challenging and there is little information published. In this study we report our experience at a referral unit during nearly 30 years in the management of a series of patients with osseous CE. Such information may be useful for other physicians when treating osseous CE.
