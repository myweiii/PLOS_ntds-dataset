Neurocysticercosis is a disease caused by a parasitic infection of the brain. The parasite responsible, Taenia solium, is transmitted by pigs where human sanitation is poor and pigs roam freely. Neurocysticercosis is responsible for many cases of epilepsy in people living in poor, developing countries. The feasibility and sustainability of implementing control measures have been major impediments to reducing the incidence of neurocysticercosis. Recently, two new commercial products have become available which together offer the possibility of interrupting the parasite’s transmission by pigs–the TSOL18 vaccine (Cysvax, IIL, India) and an oxfendazole formulation (Paranthic 10%, MCI, Morocco) licensed for use in pigs for the treatment of cysticercosis. Here we describe the impact of implementing vaccination plus drug treatment of pigs in the Banke district of Nepal. The intervention eliminated the risk of transmission of T. solium by the animals vaccinated and treated during the trial. Application of the vaccination and drug treatment program used here, possibly with strategic use of anthelmintics also in the human population, is an effective option for reducing the incidence of neurocysticercosis in Nepal and elsewhere.
