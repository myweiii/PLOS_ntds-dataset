Opisthorchiasis, caused by an infection with the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, is a neglected tropical disease endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Lao PDR. O. viverrini as well as Clonorchis sinensis have been classified as group I biological carcinogenic agents for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Due of the impact of control programs, the prevalence and worm burden in endemic communities have been reduced and this has caused the conventional fecal examination to be less sensitive and unreliable. In order to improve the diagnosis and to move towards the elimination of liver fluke to reduce CCA, we evaluated a novel urine antigen detection method by mAb-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis and screening of opisthorchiasis in endemic communities in northeast Thailand. We concurrently applied two coprological methods for antigen detection and fecal examination by formalinâ€“ethyl acetate concentration technique, a reference method for comparison. Urine and copro-antigen detection had comparable diagnostic accuracy and both methods performed better than the fecal examination. Because of the ease and acceptance of urine specimen collection and handling, urine antigen detection has a high potential for the diagnosis and mass screening of opisthorchiasis in control and elimination programs.
