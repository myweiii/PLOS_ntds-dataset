In the context of ongoing clinic- and field-based epidemiological studies on dengue virus (DENV), we compared methods of feeding mosquitoes on blood from naturally infected humans. Participants chose to participate in direct (uninfected mosquitoes applied directly to skin) and/or indirect (uninfected mosquitoes fed on a membrane feeder in the laboratory with blood drawn from a participant) methods. Overall, rates of DENV infection and dissemination were lower in mosquitoes fed indirectly on blood with no additive than in mosquitoes fed directly on a participant. Rates of DENV infection and dissemination were similar between mosquitoes fed directly and indirectly when anticoagulant (EDTA) was added. The indirect-EDTA method resulted in more variable infection rates than the direct method. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using either direct or indirect feeding methods to study DENV-human infectiousness to mosquito vectors. In our experience, however, direct feeding is preferable to indirect feeding in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
