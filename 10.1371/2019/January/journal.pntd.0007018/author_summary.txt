Sparganosis is a rare parasitic disease with a high prevalence in East Asia. Because of limited radiological technology and clinical experience, the prevalence of cerebral sparganosis is likely underestimated in developing countries. Cerebral sparganosis is the most serious complication of human sparganosis. Currently, it is generally believed that the most effective treatment for cerebral sparganosis is surgical treatment. However, the choice of treatment is a challenge for inoperable patients, including those with multifocal lesions or lesions in deep structures or important functional areas and those refusing invasive treatment due to personal willingness. Currently, there is no standard for the treatment of inoperable patients. In addition, anthelmintic treatment for sparganosis has rarely been reported in the literature. High-dose praziquantel therapy is a useful therapeutic choice for many cerebral parasitic diseases, including neurocysticercosis, and is well tolerated for patients, but it has not been sufficiently evaluated for the treatment of cerebral sparganosis. This study aims to describe the clinical, radiological and therapeutic data following high-dose praziquantel therapy for ten inoperable patients. All patients reached clinical cure after one to five courses. These results suggest that high-dose praziquantel therapy for cerebral sparganosis could achieve favorable outcomes and that MRI plays an important role in follow-up, especially when clinical symptoms have improved.
