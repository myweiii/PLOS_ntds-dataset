Ante-mortem diagnosis of human rabies is essential for patient management and public health measures. The detection of virus specific antibodies in the CSF/serum of patients with suspected rabies is thought to have a limited diagnostic role owing to late seroconversion and short survival in rabies. We examined the diagnostic and prognostic utility of antibody detection by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) in CSF/serum samples received from clinically suspected human rabies cases (2015â€“2017). RFFIT (in CSF and/or serum) could confirm ante-mortem diagnosis in 45 (34.6%) of the 130 clinically suspected cases, accounting for 81.8% of the total 55 laboratory confirmed cases. The sensitivity of CSF RFFIT increased with the day of sample collection (post-onset of symptoms) and was found to be 100% after 12 days of illness. Patients who had received prior vaccination had an increased likelihood of a positive RFFIT and negative PCR result. Patients who were positive by RFFIT alone at initial diagnosis had longer duration of survival, although with poor functional outcomes. Antibody detection by RFFIT in CSF/serum was found to have a diagnostic utility especially in patients who survived beyond a week and a limited prognostic role in human rabies.
