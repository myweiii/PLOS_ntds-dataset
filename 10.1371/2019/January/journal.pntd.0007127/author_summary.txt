Trachoma programs currently use the clinical sign of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) to guide community treatment decisions and evaluate response to mass drug administration with azithromycin. These programs rely on clinical grading that poorly correlates with infection with the causative agent of trachoma, Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), in low prevalence areas. Serologic measures of Ct may provide additional information about exposure and transmission patterns. Here, we evaluated the relationship between serologic markers of Ct, infection, and TF at the individual and community levels to evaluate the utility of serology for measuring trachoma in a mesoendemic region of Niger. We found that serologic markers correlated with both infection and TF, indicating that inclusion of serologic markers may be useful to guide trachoma decision making.
