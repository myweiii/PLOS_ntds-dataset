Schistosomiasis remains a major health threat, predominantly in developing countries. Even though there has been some progress in search of new drugs, praziquantel remains the only available drug. Probably the most important advance in the search for new drugs was in vitro transformation of cercariae and their subsequent culture. However, hit identification in compound screenings is exclusively tested in skin stage parasites and is only confirmed for more mature worms in a subsequent step. This is in part due to the lack of an easy culture system for advance-stage parasites. We present here a reliable and highly standardized way to generate LiS worms in vitro in a cell-free culture system. The inclusion of in vitro drug tests on advanced-stage parasites in initial hit identification will help to identify compounds that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, the ability to continuously observe the parasiteâ€™s development in vitro will provide an important platform for a better understanding of its maturation in the human host. Taken together, this opens up new avenues to investigate the influence of specific cell types or host proteins on the development of Schistosoma mansoni and provides an additional tool to reduce animal use in future drug discovery efforts (3Rs).
