Detection of nucleic acid has become an important tool for the diagnosis of Chagas disease. Whole blood samples are usually the source of DNA and qPCR the preferred technique to demonstrate the presence of T. cruzi DNA. Although DNA extracted from clot samples has shown higher sensitivity than from whole blood, DNA extraction is performed using phenol-chloroform, which has biohazard issues. We theorize that a clot traps parasites, making it a better source of DNA for Chagas diagnosis using PCR. The present study describes a new DNA extraction methodology from clot samples which avoids the use of phenol-chloroform. The new methodology was compared to the internationally standardized diagnostic method, which is based on extraction of DNA from whole blood preserved with guanidine EDTA and a commercial kit.
