After years of mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, many co-endemic countries need to demonstrate the interruption of transmission of these parasitic infections. This interruption of transmission is the key to stopping mass drug administration. One of the major challenges facing national programs is a reliable point of care diagnostic tool capable of detecting recent infection in children. To this end, the SD Bioline Onchocerciasis / LF IgG4 Rapid Test was used to evaluate the transmission interruption of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis in previously endemic regions of Mali. This rapid diagnostic tool demonstrated good performance in 6 of districts in 2 “so-called’ evaluation units. There was very good overlap of the serological results obtained by the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and previous endemicity profile of the different study districts for the two infections. We would argue that this RDT could be a single integrated approach for assessing transmission in areas where lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are/were co-endemic.
