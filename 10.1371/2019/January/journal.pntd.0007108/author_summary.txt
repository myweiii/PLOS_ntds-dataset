The human filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness). To curb transmission and eventually eliminate the disease, current mass drug administration programs rely on ivermectin that primarily targets the microfilariae, which are released from adult female worms. The female worms, which can live for more than 10â€“15 years, release millions of microfilariae throughout the course of infection. Thus, to stop transmission of infection and shorten the time to elimination of this disease, a safe and effective drug that kills the adult stage is needed. However, there is no small animal model for an O. volvulus infection that enables investigators to validate macrofilaricidal drugs. In the present study we describe a newly developed in vitro culturing system that supports the growth and development of O. volvulus young adult worms (OvL5) from the L3 stage and show in preliminary assays that these young worms can be used as an auxiliary for screening putative macrofilaricidal drugs against the ultimate target organism, O. volvulus.
