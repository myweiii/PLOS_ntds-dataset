Cholera still remains a burning public health issue in the developing world. Microbiological culture is the gold standard method for cholera diagnosis. However, it requires well equipped laboratories and 24–72 hours’ time for the isolation of pathogens, which may not be feasible for hard to reach areas and during epidemics or seasonal outbreaks. For the effective control of disease outbreaks, detection methods should be both quick and easy without sacrificing specificity and sensitivity. Rapid diagnostic test for cholera could be a potential alternative for early detection of the disease. Addressing this issue in our study, we report the performance of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), Cholkit for the diagnosis of cholera cases using stool obtained in field settings and the assessment of its performance with those of microbial culture and Crystal VC assay, a commercially available dipstick.
