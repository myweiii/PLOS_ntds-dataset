One in three people with leprosy develop an immune reaction, which worsen quality of life. Reactions occur despite effective treatment of the causative bacteria of leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae, with antibiotics. These reactions cause worsening skin lesions and additional nerve damage. Reactions can be chronic and recurrent, and may necessitate years of treatment with high dose corticosteroids. Our research focuses on why certain people develop these reactions while others do not. We found that people who have higher antibodies to M. leprae when they are diagnosed with leprosy are more likely to develop immune reactions in the two years after diagnosis. Also, we identify that C4 levels in the blood may be useful for monitoring the development and progression of leprosy reactions. These may be ways to identify who is at highest risk for leprosy immune reactions before they occur.
