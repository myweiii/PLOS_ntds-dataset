Brucellosis continues to be a global public health concern. It is caused by facultative, intracellular Brucella species. The most commonly described complication of brucellosis in humans is the infection of bones and joints, which is predominantly reported in all ages and sexes in high-risk regions, such as the Middle East, Asia, South and Central America, and Africa. In this current study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis. We demonstrated an evidence of geographical variation in the prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis with estimates ranging from 27% in low-risk regions to 36% in high-risk regions. However, the difference was not significant. Therefore, the prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis is not dependent on the endemicity of brucellosis in a particular region, and brucellosis patients have at least a 27% chance of developing osteoarticular disease.
