Cystic and alveolar echinococcosis, caused by E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, both occur in humans in Austria. Lesions may develop at any site, with the liver being most frequently affected. Morbidity–especially for alveolar echinococcosis–can be significant and treatment may include major surgery or long-term suppressive medical therapy. The present study was performed to investigate direct healthcare-related costs of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis in Austria based on the data from a clinical registry maintained at the reference center for echinococcosis, the reference laboratory for echinococcosis and data from the national disease reporting system. Annual incidences of AE and CE were estimated at λ = 12 and λ = 40 newly diagnosed cases per year, respectively. Estimated costs due to cystic echinococcosis were 486,598€ (95%CI 341,825€ – 631,372€) per year, and 683,824€ (95%CI 469,161€ - 898,486€) for AE. Major cost drivers were surgical interventions with hospitalizations and drug costs. These data will provide a basis for cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention programs, and highlight possible targets for cost reduction strategies.
