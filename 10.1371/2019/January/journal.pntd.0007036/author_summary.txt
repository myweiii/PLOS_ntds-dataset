Until recently, Tibet, “the third pole” of the earth, has been relatively isolated from the outside world, and has stayed rabies free for almost two decades. However, from 2015 to 2017, one human case has been reported each year. Investigation of the origins of these cases revealed each of the three human cases has distinct origins. Case 1 (2015) seems to be a result of a wildlife spillover event, and is consistent with rabies virus strains found in Russia, and Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang in China. Case 2 (2016) is associated with the current Chinese epizootic and appears to have originated from the neighboring province of Yunnan. Lastly, Case 3 (2017) is most closely related to a few recent Nepalese strains and originates from the Indian subcontinent clade, also found in India and Sri Lanka. Thus, Tibet is facing a major rabies threat on three fronts.
