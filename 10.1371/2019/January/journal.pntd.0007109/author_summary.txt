Epilepsy and progressively worsening severe chronic headaches are the two most common clinical manifestations of neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis. To understand where the prevalence of these neurological disorders is highest for targeted infection control, valid prevalence estimates are needed. Most neuroepidemiological studies conducted in low-resource settings use a two-step approach to identify cases (screening questionnaire followed by physician examination among screened positives) to obtain prevalence and burden estimates. We found that this most commonly-used two-step approach in community-based studies leads to an underestimation of the prevalence in our study. Our paper provides an analytic solution to reduce errors in estimating the prevalence of neurological disorders in community-based studies when using the two-step approach. Our proposed approach provides more valid estimates of the prevalence of these neurological disorders and could be used to better reflect the consequences that neglected tropical diseases manifesting as epilepsy or headaches have on peopleâ€™s health and disabilities.
