Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus Schistosoma, is prevalent throughout the developing world, with more than 230 million people infected. Left untreated, schistosome infection may cause relatively mild disease with some morbidity, or, in a minority of cases, result in severe pathology and death. These variable outcomes are recapitulated in animal models, where the natural history of schistosome infection is profoundly influenced by the responses of host CD4+ T helper cells. Type 2 CD4+ T cell (TH2) responses, which allow for host survival by limiting pathology, have ironically also been co-opted by schistosomes to promote parasite development. On the other hand, TH17 responses have been implicated in the development of severe pathology, in both experimentally infected animals and naturally infected humans. Here we show that a schistosome proteolytic enzyme (SmCB1), produced in the parasite gut and released into the bloodstream, induces both TH2 and TH17 responses by a mechanism that requires the enzymeâ€™s inherent proteolytic activity. Further investigation revealed that acute schistosome infection also induces a transient TH17 response that is rapidly down-regulated once parasite egg-laying commences. Regulation of TH17 responses during early infection may help determine whether mild or severe pathology develops as the infection progresses.
