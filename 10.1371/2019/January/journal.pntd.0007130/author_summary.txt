China used to a country with a high burden of trachoma, but recent empirical observation and routinely collected eye care data were suggesting that elimination of trachoma had been achieved in China. In order to verify that and reach the target set in the WHA 51.11 Resolution, we have assessed current situation using the World Health Organizationâ€™s Simplified Trachoma Grading System and TRA. As China is a country with a big population and huge regional disparity, this national condition is also considered in methodology design and implement. Among 8,259 children examined in 128 primary schools in 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas, only 16 cases of conjunctivitis were graded as TF. 38 cases with TT were found among the 339,013 examined residents in villages surrounding the schools, among these 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas only in 3 areas, the prevalence of TT was more than 0.2%. Trachoma is no longer a public health issue in China, however, we still need to pay attention to TT in the remote and poor areas. Therapeutic interventions for few residual patients have been provided for free, and health education and publicity on trachoma prevention have been continued in the whole society.
