Podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) is one of a disabling and stigmatizing neglected tropical disease (NTD) which affects the lower limb found mostly in low income countries. Even though there were mostly prevalence studies and disease mapping, there was no report, especially on factors associated with the disease, from the study area. Hence, community based cross sectional study was conducted to determine its prevalence and factors associated with it in the west Shewa Zone of Dano district community. Data were collected from a total of 652 randomly selected peoples using interviewer administered structured questionnaire and observation. In addition, a blood sample was collected from the study subjects who had leg swelling for ruling out lymphedema due to lymphatic filarasis by using Immunochromatographic test card. Podoconiosis case was defined as bilateral but asymmetric swelling which develop first in the foot often confined to the lower leg and negative result for immune-chromatographic test (ICT card). Accordingly, the prevalence of podoconiosis in the district was found to be 6.3%. Age at first shoe wearing, washing practice of feet by water only and not wearing shoe daily were found to be the risk factors for the development of podoconiosis. Hence, this study revealed that there was significant burden of the disease in the study area. Thus, collaboration between local government and non-government stakeholders, and integration with existing programs addressing foot hygiene which involves washing feet with soap and water needs to be addressed.
