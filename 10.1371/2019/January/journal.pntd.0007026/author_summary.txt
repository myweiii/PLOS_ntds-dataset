This article describes pharmacokinetic profiles and results of safety pharmacology, toxicity and genotoxicity studies with an oral ASD formulation of flubendazole with improved bioavailability. Flubendazole administered as ASD formulation has good oral bioavailability in animals ranging from 15% to more than 100%. In in vivo toxicology studies, increased systemic exposure does not induce Cmax-related effects in CNS and cardiovascular systems. Increased exposure upon repeated dosing results in changes in haematological, lymphoid and gastrointestinal systems and in testes. In dogs, the liver was an additional target organ. These changes were at least partially reversible. Flubendazole is negative in the Ames test but positive in the in vivo micronucleus test. Because of the carcinogenic risk associated with this positive effect in the in vivo micronucleus test, exposure duration in patients should not exceed one day. Flubendazole-induced toxicity and associated risk is monitorable and controllable in patients if stringent precautions are applied in view of testicular toxicity and previously described teratogenicity. Considering both, treatment regimen needed for efficacy and outcome of toxicity and genotoxicity studies, it was concluded that the risk/benefit associated with the use of orally bioavailable flubendazole for the treatment of onchocerciasis in the field does not support further development.
