Chagas disease caused by the infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in Latin America. In Argentina, it is estimated 1.5 million patients have Chagas disease and 2.2 million people in risk of T. cruzi infection. The endemic area covers the north of the country where the conditions, such as high levels of poverty and social exclusion and low population density, mostly rural, favor T. cruzi infection. Most affected people remains asymptomatic after infection for the rest of their lives, but around one third of infected people may develop clinical symptoms of visceral damage. Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC), the most frequent and severe consequence of the chronic infection by T. cruzi, is manifested predominately as an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis of CCC is not completely understood, but it is believed that the human genetic variation may be a determinant factor of disease progression. We studied in Wichi and in admixed populations from Argentina the CCR2-CCR5 genes, two CC chemokine receptors involved in the trafficking of several immune cells and in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our results showed that CCR2-CCR5 genes are associated with CCC and highlight the relevance of the evolutionary context in which disease-associated genes are found.
