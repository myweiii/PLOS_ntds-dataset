Yellow fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and its infection may be asymptomatic or lead to a wide clinical spectrum ranging from a mild febrile illness to a potentially lethal viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by liver damage. Although a yellow fever vaccine is available, low coverage allows 80,000–200,000 cases and 30,000–60,000 deaths annually worldwide. There are no specific therapy and treatment relies on supportive care, reinforcing an urgent need for antiviral repourposing. Here, we showed that sofosbuvir, clinically approved against hepatitis C, inhibits yellow fever virus replication in liver cell lines and animal models. In vitro, sofosbuvir inhibits viral RNA replication, decreases the number of infected cells and the production of infectious virus particles. These data is particularly relevante since the liver is the main target of yellow fever infection. Sofosbuvir also protected infected animals from mortality, weight loss and liver injury, especially prophylatically. Our pre-clinical results supports a second use of sofosbuvir against yellow fever.
