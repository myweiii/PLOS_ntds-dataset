Many emerging pathogens are zoonotic and transmit from their abiotic reservoir to wild animals, domesticated animals and humans. It is now well known that environmental changes lead to variability in their dynamics in the environment and contribute to changes in the infectious risk. Many aquatic bacteria are responsable for major public health concerns, and more importantly in developing countries where access to drinking-water and sanitation is often limited. Whilst their environmental dynamics are directly linked to seasonal changes of their habitat, they also rely on the ecological processes underpining their transmission, i.e. directly transmitted vs. vector-borne. However, few studies have compared such environmental dynamics despite the fact that it would help to better characterise the infectious risk in the environment, as well as to better monitor the emergence of infectious diseases. Our aim was to provide data on the prevalence of generalist vs. vector-borne aquatic bacterial pathogens in the environment that would further allow the comparison of their environmental dynamics in the same unit of time and space, and across rural and urban habitats. We showed that urbanization and seasonality are two important factors underlying Buruli ulcer and leptospirosis disease emergence in French Guiana (South America), and propose that the mode of transmission of such environmental pathogens might have a detrimental role in disseminating the infectious agent in the environment.
