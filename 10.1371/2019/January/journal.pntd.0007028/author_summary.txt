Strongyloidiasis is an understudied chronic intestinal infection and one of the most overlooked of the neglected tropical diseases, particularly in countries such as Bolivia. The strongyloidiasis usually remains paucisymptomatic for decades in immunocompetent persons, but may lead to severe conditions with high mortality rates in immunocompromised individuals. We carried out a study to explore the epidemiology of strongyloidiasis among Bolivian patients with cancer, HIV infection, and rheumatic or hematologic diseases. Our study highlighted that strongyloidiasis was widely prevalent in tropical and inter-Andean temperate areas of Bolivia among patients at high risk of life-threatening complications. One in five participants was infected. We showed that strongyloidiasis was highly prevalent in both tropical and temperate regions. Improved access to adequate diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures are therefore urgently required in Bolivia, and most likely elsewhere in the region. Treatment of uncomplicated strongyloidiasis is simple, highly effective, and potentially life-saving.
