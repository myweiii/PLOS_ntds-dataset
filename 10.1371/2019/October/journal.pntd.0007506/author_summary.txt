Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease that primarily affects livestock and wildlife. In humans, the disease is characterized by prolonged fever, body aches, joint pains and weakness, while in livestock, the disease mainly causes abortions and infertility. We carried out a study in northeastern Kenya (Garissa and Tana River Counties) to identify factors that affect the distribution of the disease in people and livestock. Livestock and people from randomly selected households were recruited and serum samples were obtained and screened using ELISA kits for Brucella IgG antibodies as a measure to determine the level of exposure to Brucella spp. Data obtained were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regression models. Results obtained show that human and animal Brucella spp seroprevalences cluster at the household level. The odds of exposure in humans were at least three times higher in households that had at least one seropositive animal compared to those that had not. These results can be used to design risk-based surveillance systems where each Brucella spp. infection identified in livestock or humans could signal potential locations of additional brucellosis cases in humans and animals.
