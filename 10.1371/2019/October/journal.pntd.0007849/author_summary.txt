Chromoblastomycosis, a neglected tropical disease, is one of the most frequently encountered subcutaneous mycoses. The disease is usually caused by traumatic inoculation of a specific group of dematiaceous fungi. Chromoblastomycosisis characterized by slowly expanding skin lesions and is associated with low cure and high relapse rates. In recent years, effective methods, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), have been employed for inhibiting the pathogenâ€™s activity. The authors treated 5 refractory and complex cases of chromoblastomycosis with 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) combined with oral antifungal drugs. The lesions improved after 4 to 9 sessions of ALA-PDT treatment at an interval of one or two weeks, and in some cases, mycological testing results became negative. The authors also found that ALA-PDT alter the fungi cell wall and increase reactive oxygen species production. This research provides the basis for the development of a new therapeutic approach, and ALA-PDT combined with oral antifungal drugs constitutes a promising alternative method for the treatment of refractory and complex cases of chromoblastomycosis.
