Taking advantage of several factors, as worldwide trading, climatic changes and urbanization, Aedes mosquitoes are impressively expanding their geographic distribution. A paradigm is provided by the rapid global spreading of Aedes albopictus, a species that is a competent vector of several arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, Zika, chikungunya) and has been responsible of quite a few outbreaks in the last decade. Historically, vector control always played a pivotal role for the containment of arthropod-borne diseases, and this appears especially crucial for arboviral diseases for which no effective vaccines or specific medications are available. Currently, host exposure to mosquitoes is indirectly evaluated by entomological methods; however, exploitation of human immune responses to mosquito salivary proteins is emerging as a relevant additional tool, with important epidemiological implications for the evaluation of mosquito-borne disease risk. This study provides preliminary but solid indications that the 34k2 salivary proteins from Ae. albopictus and Aedes aegypti may be suitable candidates for the development of serological assays to evaluate spatial and/or temporal variation of human exposure to Aedes vectors. Combined to the presently available tools to assess arboviral exposure/infection, this may be of great help for the development of a serological toolbox allowing for the simultaneous determination of human exposure to Aedes vectors and to the pathogens they transmit.
