Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing and disabling skin infection, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The infection, a skin-related Neglected Tropical Diseases, affects mostly people living in limited resources settings. Since the introduction of rifampicin based combination antibiotic therapy as standard care, the role of surgery as adjunct therapy to kill M. ulcerans is less defined and understood. A randomized controlled trial showed benefit from delaying the decision to operate. Nevertheless, the rate of surgical interventions differs highly per clinic. We present the differences in rate of surgical interventions in six different Buruli ulcer treatment centers in Ghana and Benin. We demonstrate that these differences mainly depend on the opinion of the health care workers working in the treatment centers even after adjusting for disease severity.
