Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma cancer, varies geographically. KSHV infections are highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with Uganda having the highest prevalence reported to date. Infection with KSHV is lifelong with an intermittent revival of the virus, leading to viral spread. In this study, we show that infection with Schistosoma mansoni and malaria parasites is associated with being infected or exposed to KSHV. These parasite infections interfere with the proper functioning of the immune system to control viral infections. Although not shown in the current study, these parasite infections might lead to reactivation of KSHV in infected people increasing the likelihood of having detectable KSHV antibodies. Consequently, this viral reactivation may increase the spread of KSHV in sub-Saharan Africa.
