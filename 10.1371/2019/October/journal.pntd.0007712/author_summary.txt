Leishmaniases are diseases caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted through the bites of infected female sandflies during blood feeding. In Kenya, two main forms of the disease exist; visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Most recent CL epidemics in Kenya have been reported in Gilgil, Nakuru county, where the disease has become a public health problem. However, little is known about the factors that drive its transmission in the area. In this study, we investigated the occurrence, distribution, host preference and Leishmania infection rates in sandflies collected from Gilgil using molecular tools. This could lead to a better understanding of the disease and improvement of control strategies in the area. Our results revealed a high infection rate of L. tropica in two sandfly species (Ph. guggisbergi and Ph. saevus s.l.), which may indicate a high circulation level of this parasite in the area. However, we also identified L. major infection from Ph. guggisbergi species by PCR. Analysis of sandfly bloodmeal sources showed that Ph. guggisbergi fed on a diverse range of vertebrates including goats, rock hyraxes, rabbits, wild pigs and rodents whereas Ph. saevus s.l. fed mainly on humans. The potential of Ph. guggisbergi as a vector of L. major and whether other vertebrate hosts play a role in maintaining Leishmania parasites in this CL endemic area needs further investigation.
