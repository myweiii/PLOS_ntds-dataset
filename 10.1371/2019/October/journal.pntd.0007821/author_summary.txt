Melioidosis is a vastly underdiagnosed infectious disease caused by the bacterial soil pathogen B. pseudomallei. Global environmental suitability for B. pseudomallei has recently been predicted to cover huge areas with three billion people potentially at risk to acquire infection. Although sensitive as well as specific molecular methods are available, cultural isolation of B. pseudomallei strains from the environment will be indispensable to verify this prediction in potential endemic, low-income countries and is a prerequisite to assess the virulence potential and genetic diversity of strains. The currently applied cultural detection lacks sensitivity, which is at least partly due to a lack in selectivity allowing other highly abundant soil microorganisms to outcompete B. pseudomallei. We therefore aimed to develop a more selective medium by taking advantage of B. pseudomallei erythritol catabolism, a metabolic pathway, which is not commonly encountered in other related bacteria. Validation of our new medium with erythritol as the single carbon source was performed by molecular and cultural detection using soil samples from rice paddies in Vietnam. We observed an enhanced enrichment and selectivity resulting in the isolation of B. pseudomallei strains from soil samples, which were otherwise culture-negative when tested by the standard method.
