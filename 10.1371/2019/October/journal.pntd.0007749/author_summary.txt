Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is treated at the population level with mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Decisions to stop MDA are subsequently made following impact surveys designed to determine the prevalence of trachoma in children aged 1â€“9 years. However, clinical signs of trachoma can persist in treated communities even in the absence of active C. trachomatis infection, potentially leading to continued MDA that may be unnecessary. In this study, we use the platform provided by six impact surveys to compare prevalence of clinical signs of trachoma in children with prevalence of C. trachomatis infection and anti-C. trachomatis antibodies. Based on current policy, prevalence of clinical signs of trachoma in four of six evaluation units surveyed indicated further MDA is warranted. However, tests for C. trachomatis DNA indicate extremely low levels of infection making the need for further MDA unclear. Prevalence of anti-C. trachomatis antibodies were similar to that found in other low prevalence settings, however the significance of such levels, and of levels of current C. trachomatis infection, with regard to the risk of reinfection are, as yet, unknown.
