Many examples of emergence of viruses that trigger severe diseases in humans are known. Emergence can be due to the sudden increase of the pathogenic power of a virus that had silently circulated into human populations for a long period; it can also be due to the cross-species transmission of a virus from its animal host to humans. The recent outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases due to enteroviruses D68 (EV-D68) brought to the light to potency of members of the species Enterovirus D (EV-D) to emerge as severe human pathogens.
By many aspects, EV-Ds are still mysterious: their natural history and epidemiology are poorly studied and even their main hosts remain unknown. For decades, EV-Ds were believed to infect mainly humans but recent data about EV-Ds identified in sub-Saharan Africa support their zoonotic origin. In an attempt to increase our knowledge about EV-Ds, we undertook genetic and phenotypic characterization of four EV-D111 isolates, a virus type that was recently uncovered in humans and in non-human primates in Central Africa. Our results show that EV-D111s are probably enteric viruses and evolve by exchanging genetic sequences with EV-D94.
