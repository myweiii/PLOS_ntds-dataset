As visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV patients is difficult to treat and associated with high mortality, strategies to detect and treat asymptomatic Leishmania infection in HIV patients should be explored. However, data on the prevalence, incidence, determinants of asymptomatic infection and risk of VL are lacking. We conducted a longitudinal study, including HIV-infected adult patients in HIV care in a district hospital in a VL-endemic area in North-West Ethiopia. Asymptomatic Leishmania infection was evaluated by Leishmania antibody tests (DAT and rK39), urine antigen tests (KAtex) and PCR, and was defined as positivity on any Leishmania marker. We also looked for independent risk factors for asymptomatic Leishmania infection at study recruitment. A total of 511 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 38 years, 62.6% were male. The median time of residence in a VL-endemic area was 18 years. Most (95.5%) were on antiretroviral treatment at enrolment, for a median of 52 months. The median CD4 count at enrolment was 377 cells/mm3. The baseline prevalence of Leishmania infection was 12.8% in males and 4.2% in females. Overall, 7.4% tested positive for rK39, 4.3% for DAT, 0.2% for PCR and 0.2% for KAtex. Independent risk factors for a prevalent infection were male sex and concurrent malaria infection. Amongst the 49 prevalent infections that were present upon enrolment in the study, the probability of losing the Leishmania markers by one year was 40.1%. There were 36 new infections during the course of the study, with an overall risk of 9.5% by one year of follow-up. One case of VL was detected during follow-up. In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infection, which persisted in most cases. The incidence was more modest. Larger and longer studies would be needed to decide whether a test and treat strategy would be justified in this context.
