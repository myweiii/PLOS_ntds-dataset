Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a vector-borne infectious disease that causes sleeping sickness across many African countries. Reported gHAT cases show a continued decline, but it is unclear if this is sufficient to reach the WHO goal of stopping transmission by 2030. We develop a stochastic model necessary to address the critical question of persistence of gHAT infection at the local-scale. In contrast to other commonly studied infections, we predict long-term persistence of gHAT in small populations (< 1, 000 people) despite very low prevalence. Our local-scale predictions (together with previous larger-scale studies) suggest that, to achieve regional elimination, controls need to be widespread and intensified in the worst affected regions, while the movement of infected people could rapidly lead to re-emergence.
