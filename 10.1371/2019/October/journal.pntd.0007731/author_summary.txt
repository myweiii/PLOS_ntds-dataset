Leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to humankind and is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Despite being curable, leprosy is still a notorious disease, causing serious disability and a stigma generally associated with late diagnosis. The disease is challenging to diagnose because there is no gold standard method for detecting M. leprae or its cellular components (DNA, lipids or proteins). In past decades, different PCR methods were developed to amplify different M. leprae gene targets, such as the RLEP gene, with high sensitivity in leprosy diagnosis using skin biopsy and slit skin smear (SSS) specimens. However, few reports have focused on FFPE specimens. Because FFPE specimens can be transferred remotely or retrieved from previous leprosy patients, we developed and evaluated the STNPCR assay for detecting M. leprae in these specimens. Our results suggest that STNPCR of RLEP using FFPE specimens performs better as a diagnostic test and for monitoring response to MDT than does simple PCR.
