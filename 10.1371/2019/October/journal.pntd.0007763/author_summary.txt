On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following a “cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders in Brazil” and highlighted the “urgent need” for coordinated international efforts to investigate the relationship between maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and microcephaly. Due to the lack of a standard algorithm, resultant epidemiological investigations have utilized different strategies for defining cases of ZIKV infections in pregnancy. Here, we report the experience of the Microcephaly Epidemic Research Group in Pernambuco, Brazil, in evaluating 694 pregnant women presenting with rash (i.e., a common sign of ZIKV infection) during the 2015–2017 Latin American outbreak. Integrating time-sensitive data from both nucleic acid amplification testing and serologic assays, a panel of experts developed an evidence-graded set of criteria for identifying cases of maternal infection. When applied to the cohort, nearly one-third of the participants were categorized as having robust or moderate evidence of being infected with ZIKV in pregnancy. The classifications described in this investigation will enable scientists to investigate maternal ZIKV infection and estimate the absolute and relative risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The results also underscore the importance of on-going efforts to develop robust diagnostic assays for ZIKV.
