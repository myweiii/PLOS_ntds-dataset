DNA-based tools are increasingly being used for the diagnosis of intestinal worm infections in both clinical and research laboratories. However, recovering DNA from intestinal worm eggs in stool remains a challenge since this DNA is protected by a very rigid egg shell. Furthermore, stool contains inhibitors that can affect test results and these should be removed during DNA extraction. Prior to DNA extraction, samples are often preserved, but the impact of the type of preservatives and the duration of preservation remains poorly studied. In the present study, we assessed the impact of four DNA extraction and three preservation protocols on the downstream performance of a DNA-based diagnostic tool for intestinal worms. We found significant differences in DNA recovery across the DNA and preservation protocols, but DNA from worm eggs in stool proved to be stable over time in all preservatives.
