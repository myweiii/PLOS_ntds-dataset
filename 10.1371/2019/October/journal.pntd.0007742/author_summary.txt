Fungi from the genus Paracoccidioides cause paracoccidioidomycosis, a neglected tropical disease that mainly affects poor rural workers in Latin America. Paracoccidioides can live its whole life in the soil, without the need to infect humans or other animals to complete its life cycle. Studies with other such free-living organisms suggest they have acquired the ability to survive and cause disease in humans by interacting with soil predators such as amoebae and worms. In this study we have investigated organisms present in soil in which Paracoccidioides had been previously detected, with a focus on predatory amoebae. Cultures from soil samples showed numerous amoebae, which were isolated and identified using genetic tools. These amoebae were able to ingest and destroy Paracoccidioides yeast cells. More detailed experiments made with a laboratory strain of Acanthamoeba castellanii showed that the interaction with amoebae did increase the fungal ability to survive in and kill not only cells such as amoebae and mouse macrophages, but also whole organisms such as Galleria mellonella larvae and mice. This better understanding of the habitat in which Paracoccidioides lives in nature might lead to new and improved strategies to prevent infection and thus mitigate the burden of this disease.
