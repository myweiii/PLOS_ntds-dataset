Development and use of devices to diagnose infectious diseases outside of health facilities (i.e., at home or in remote areas) continues to increase, providing new options for the follow up and treatment options of individuals, depending on the diseases. In this qualitative study, researchers in Iquitos, Peru, and Phnom Penh, Cambodia explored what local people thought about the possible availability of such a device to diagnose dengue and malaria in their own houses, and what would motivate them to use such a device instead of going directly to a health facility for the diagnosis. Participants reported being willing to use device on themselves and were motivated by the possibility that, by using this diagnostic device and taking the result to their health facility, they might be able to obtain quicker and more optimized attention at the health facility; for example, by obtaining a positive result to dengue or malaria on the rapid diagnostic device, they are aware they might still need confirmatory tests, but they would be able to reduce the wait time for obtaining a definitive diagnosis and starting treatment by a full day. Questions regarding accuracy of tests, complicated instructions and safety of using these devices in the community were brought up by participantsâ€”individuals living in the communities and local health professionals. Also, in this study, it was clear that if these devices were to be made available in Peru and Cambodia, different strategies for disseminating and using these in the communities would be needed to accommodate for different health infrastructure in both sites.
