Point-of-care (POC) assays are important tools in control and elimination of parasitic diseases such as lymphatic filariasis, malaria, and leishmaniasis. Most POC assays use immunochromatographic and lateral flow assay principles with gold nanoparticles as a reporter. Assays based on gold nanoparticles usually provide qualitative or semi-quantitative results and have relatively low sensitivity. However, other reporter alternatives are available, including quantum dots (Qdots), up-converting phosphor nanoparticles, and superparamagnetic particles. We developed a Qdots-based test in a lateral flow assay format with a mobile phone reader to detect antibody responses, using neurocysticercosis (NCC) as a disease model, and found that the performance is similar to the traditional platform for detecting antibody responses in subjects with NCC. The incorporation of the mobile phone reader offers the advantage of portability and adaptability for use in areas where laboratories are not immediately accessible. This novel POC assay with mobile phone reader is a feasible option for antibody responses detection.
