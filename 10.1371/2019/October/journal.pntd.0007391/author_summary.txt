Chrysomya bezziana larvae are characterized by feeding aggressively on the living tissues and body fluids of the host. The dreadful feelings of patients suffering from myiases with severe tissue and bone destruction, even death, and the enormous economic losses in the livestock industries have been described previously. But our findings indicate that C. bezziana myiases still appear to be under-recognized as a serious medical or veterinary condition throughout the world. Both in China and the world at large, it is probable that C. bezziana distribution could well be greater than currently reported. Our study provides an opportunity for clinicians and health authorities to gain a comprehensive understanding of this disease from its etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, epidemiology, prevention and control. In addition, our findings will engage governments, health staff, veterinary workers, aged-care facilities, and also the general public, in efforts to recognize, prevent, and control such infestations.
