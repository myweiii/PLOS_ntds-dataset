Acute infection during pregnancy with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, if left undiagnosed and untreated, is linked to a wide range of medical complications, and severe adverse outcomes for the infected fetus and newborn. This is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the global prevalence of ATI in pregnant women, and was based on 217 studies of a total of 902,228 pregnant women from 74 countries. The overall global prevalence of ATI was 1.1%. According to studies that used strict criteria (seroconversion and low IgG avidity) for the definition of ATI, 0.6% of pregnant women had ATI during gestation. Countries with high-income levels and higher human development indices had significantly lower prevalence of ATI. In addition, the prevalence of ATI varied among countries depending on geographical location and climatic features. The findings of this study should increase awareness among public health leaders and educators regarding the global burden of ATI in pregnant women—which translates to a significant number of children worldwide being at risk of acquiring congenital toxoplasmosis and developing long-term sequelae—if maternal infection is left undiagnosed and untreated. The findings also indicate a need for universal prenatal screening for early diagnosis and treatment.
