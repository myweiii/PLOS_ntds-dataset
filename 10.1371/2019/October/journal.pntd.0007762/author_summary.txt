Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP) is a critical but neglected component of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. Lack of infrastructure, trained practitioners, political will, and resources are challenges to effective implementation of MMDP services. This is compounded by the paucity of treatment options for limb lymphedema. Currently daily washing, elevation, and exercise are the only therapy available to most patients with filarial limb lymphedema, and new treatments are sorely needed. We previously reported that portable three-dimensional infrared imaging provides rapid, accurate, and reproducible limb measurements in patients with filarial lymphedema. Here, we show that similarly accurate and reproducible limb measurements are possible outside the clinic (in or outside patientsâ€™ homes). Using this technique we quantify how much limb volume varies from day to day and during the day for patients with filarial lymphedema, and provide recommendations for the optimal use of this tool in longitudinal monitoring of limb volume in research or in the clinic.
