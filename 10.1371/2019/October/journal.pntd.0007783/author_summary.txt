Yellow fever is a dreadful disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus circulating in Africa and South America. Historically, the Asia-Pacific region has remained free of yellow fever but the ever increasing influx of travelers puts places such as Singapore at unprecedented risk of yellow fever virus introduction. The present study characterized the potential contribution of a mosquito species called Aedes malayensis to yellow fever virus transmission in Singapore. Aedes malayensis breeds in urban parks of Singapore and is suspected to have participated in the resurgence of other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue because it is not targeted by current mosquito control measures. Not only was Ae. malayensis able to experimentally acquire and transmit yellow fever virus, but it was also found to engage in contact with humans in a field situation. This empirical evidence indicates that Ae. malayensis is a competent vector of yellow fever virus and should be targeted by mosquito control programs.
