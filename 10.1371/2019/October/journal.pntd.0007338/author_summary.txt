Snakebite is a major public health concern in rural regions of the tropics. The Eastern Russellâ€™s viper (Daboia siamensis) is a medically important venomous snake species that is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and Southern China, including Taiwan. Envenoming by D. siamensis causes several systemic pathologies, most notably acute kidney failure and coagulopathy. The administration of antivenom is the mainstay therapeutic for treating snakebite, but in remote areas of Southern China access to antivenom is limited, and can result in the use of inappropriate, non-specific, antivenoms and treatment failure. Therefore, maximizing the utility of available efficacious antivenom is highly desirable. In this study, we investigated the utility of the widely available Thai Red Cross antivenoms for binding to and neutralizing D. siamensis venoms sourced from four distinct locales in Asia. Since the effectiveness and antivenom dose required to prevent D. siamensis venom-induced nephrotoxicity has been controversial, we also examined the preclinical efficacy of D. siamensis antivenom at preventing this pathology in experimentally envenomed anaesthetised animals. Our findings suggest that monovalent antivenom from Thailand, which is clinically effective in this country, has highly comparable levels of immunological binding and in vivo venom neutralization to D. siamensis venoms from China, Taiwan and Myanmar. We also show that the early administration of high therapeutic doses of antivenom are likely required to neutralize nephrotoxins and thus prevent acute renal failure following envenoming. Our findings suggest that certain Thai Red Cross antivenoms likely have wide geographical utility against D. siamensis venom and therefore may be useful tools for managing snakebite envenomings by this species in the absence of locally manufactured therapeutics.
