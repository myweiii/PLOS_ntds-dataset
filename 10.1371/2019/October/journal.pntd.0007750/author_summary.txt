Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium with the potential of morbidity and mortality among fragile subjects. Although the frequency of this parasite is higher in under-developed countries, it can be a frequent source of diseases, in developed areas. This may be due, among other factors, to the immigration flows from poor endemic places to industrialized countries contributing thus to the parasite spread. Human illness was formerly thought to be caused by a single Cryptosporidium species, but advanced studies have demonstrated that it is caused by more than 20 different species. We examined characteristics and risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium among new immigrants in Qatar. We predominantly identified Cryptosporidium parvum as infecting species. We found that factors like religion, education, monthly income and the house contents play a major role in the parasite occurrence. Therefore, there is a need for better awareness about the parasite and about strategies for its eradication among the new immigrants in Qatar.
