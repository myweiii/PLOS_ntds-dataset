We thank JR Kiechel, M Dormeyer, D Sassella, PE Bost, E Pinheiro, C Burri, F Chappuis, and S Croft for their contributions to the design and interpretation of the preclinical studies; H HÃ¤nel (sanofi-aventis) and his former colleagues from Hoechst for providing initial samples, data, and advice from the previous Hoechst development programme on fexinidazole, and J Ferguson and AM Sevcsik for their contribution to a previous version of this manuscript.
As DNDi is not a pharmaceutical company, much of the manufacture and preclinical profiling of fexinidazole has been subcontracted to contract research organizations. In particular, we thank Accelera SpA (Milan, Italy) and Covance Ltd. (Harrogate, UK) for technical advice on, and conduct of, the ADME-PK, safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, and Centipharm (Grasse, France) for the cGMP manufacture of fexinidazole.
We also thank the teams at the University of Swansea and the National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, for their work on production and validation of the nitroreductase-deficient Salmonella strains, as well as RF Anderson from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, for the redox potential measurements.
