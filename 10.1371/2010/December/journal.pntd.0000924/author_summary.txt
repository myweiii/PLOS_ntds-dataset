Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease in humans, with 50â€“100 million infections per year. The severity of dengue ranges from an acute febrile illness, DF, to a life-threatening vascular leakage syndrome with or without shock, DHF/DSS. Determinants of these syndromes are mainly host factors including non protective but cross reactive antibodies which are known as preexisting enhancing antibodies. These antibodies enhance disease severity through increasing the virus infected cell mass and facilitating intracellular virus replication. Here we demonstrate that DENV exploits preexisting subneutralizing antibodies to defeat the pathogen recognition system and to down regulate the TLR signaling pathway resulting in suppression of an array of innate immune responses. Furthermore, we also show that this phenomenon specifically occurs in the severe form of dengue but not in the mild form of disease.
