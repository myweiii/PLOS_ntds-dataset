Buruli ulcer (BU) is a serious necrotizing cutaneous infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is a neglected emerging disease that has recently been reported in some countries as the second most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans after tuberculosis (TB). Cases have been reported from at least 32 countries in Africa (mainly west), Australia, Southeast Asia, China, Central and South America, and the Western Pacific. BU is a disease found in rural areas located near wetlands (ponds, swamps, marshes, impoundments, backwaters) and slow-moving rivers, especially in areas prone to human-made disturbance and flooding. Despite considerable research on this disease in recent years, the mode of transmission remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. In this article we review the current state of knowledge on the ecology and transmission of M. ulcerans in Africa and Australia, discuss traditional and non-traditional methods for investigating transmission, and suggest an intellectual framework for establishing criteria for transmission.
