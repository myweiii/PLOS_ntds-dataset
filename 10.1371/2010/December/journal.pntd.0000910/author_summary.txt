There is a need to better understand communities' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of neglected tropical diseases to improve prevention and control efforts. We studied the socio-cultural aspects of parasitic worm infections in two villages (Mélapleu and Zouatta II) of western Côte d'Ivoire, where research and control activities have been implemented. Zouatta II was exposed to a community-based approach, while school-based interventions were implemented in Mélapleu. KAP surveys were carried out using qualitative and quantitative methods. Although there was some knowledge of parasitic worm infections in both villages, we found important differences between the two villages regarding intestinal schistosomiasis: there was a better understanding of this disease in Zouatta II. However, even the community-based research and control efforts implemented in Zouatta II were ineffective in transforming the information conveyed into preventive behavior related to water contact. Our results suggest that KAP of parasitic worm infections conveyed by research and control activities targeting only school-aged children have shortcomings as older population groups are left out. Hence, for effective control of parasitic worms, children and adults must be educated and interventions should include access to deworming drugs, clean water and sanitation.
