Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A is a significant and emerging global public health problem and accounts for one fifth of all cases of enteric fever in many areas of Asia. S. Paratyphi A only infects humans, and the lack of an appropriate animal model has limited the study of S. Paratyphi A infection. In this study, we report the application of an RNA analysis method, Selective Capture of Transcribed Sequences (SCOTS), to evaluate which S. Paratyphi A genes are expressed directly in the blood of infected humans. Our results provide insight into the bacterial adaptations and modifications that S. Paratyphi A may need to survive within infected humans and suggest that similar approaches may be applied to other pathogens in infected humans and animals.
