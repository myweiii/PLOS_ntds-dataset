We are grateful for the support of the local communities and local government workers in Kaberamaido and Dokolo and to Richard Selby and Joseph Ssempijja for their assistance in geo-referencing villages. The MCMC iterations and final predictions were run on the University of Southampton IRIDIS Beowulf computing cluster.
