Leishmania parasites are responsible for the disease leishmaniasis. They are spread through sandflies. The primary hosts are mammals, including humans. They occur in two different morphological forms. The flagellated promastigotes live in the gut of the sandfly vector. After transmission to the mammalian host they get phagocytized by macrophages and convert into the amastigote form, which is able to survive within the phagolysosome. The molecular mechanisms underlying this transformation process from promastigote to amastigote are poorly understood so far. A striking difference of the life cycle stages is a long flagellum in the promastigote compared to only a rudimentary flagellum in the mammalian stage amastigote. During an earlier study of the stage differentiation of Leishmania donovani we identified a flagellar protein, a subunit of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC2). This protein is part of a flagellar structure called the axoneme. Here we have further characterized the protein regarding its role within the life cycle of the parasite. Mutant promastigotes lacking DC2 protein show reduced flagellar length and a more amastigote-like appearance overall. In addition, the motility is heavily retrenched and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the flagellar ultrastructure is affected. Furthermore, the mutants express amastigote-specific genes and show increased in vitro infectiousness towards macrophages. Therefore, we conclude that the correct assembly of the flagellum is vital for maintenance of the promastigote stage of the parasite.
