Without the invaluable help of the following persons, this work could not have been carried out. Many thanks to Kristin Harper (who provided the sequence dataset on treponemes used [19]), to Peter C. Gerszten, Rimantas Jankauskas, Gyorgy Palfi, Michael Pietrusewsky, Bruce Rothschild, Ann Stodder and T.S. Vasulu for sending us their reprints and to Della C.

Furthermore special thanks are extended to our two anonymous referees, as well as to Mark Spigelman and Connie J. Mulligan for their thoughtful comments, which significantly improved our work. We would also like to thank José Filippini for Figure 1 and Eduardo Gameiro for his artwork. The human remains depicted were exhumed from the shell mound Jabuticabeira II through the project run by Paulo de Blasis: many thanks to him and his team. This paper is the result of a graduate course from the Departamento de Genética e Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo.
