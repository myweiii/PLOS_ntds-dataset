The incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically over the last 50 years, largely because of the increasing size of the population at risk, which especially includes immunocompromised hosts. Scedosporium apiospermum is a filamentous fungus that causes a variety of infections, ranging from localized disease to life-threatening disseminated infections. Glycoproteins are molecules present in the fungal surface and are comprised of carbohydrate and protein components. They are involved in different important functions in the fungal cell. Monoclonal antibodies can be used as therapeutic agents for infectious disease, but some factors involved in their efficacy are often not well understood. We found that monoclonal antibodies to glycoproteins present in fungal surface can be nonprotective and can even enhance the disease. The administration of these antibodies can affect functions of the fungal cell and the immune cells, resulting in a survival advantage for the fungus during interactions with the host.
