Snakebite is principally a health concern of rural poor communities. The high snakebite risk of subsistence farming and paucity of effective antivenoms in sub-Saharan Africa means that many communities remain unacceptably vulnerable to snakebite mortality and morbidity. There is therefore a compelling need to maximise the utility of the snakebite therapies that are available. To address Nigeria's severe snakebite problem, the government funded a collaboration of ministry officials, antivenom manufacturers and academics (the EchiTAb Study Group) to produce, test and deliver antivenom. Accordingly, we prepared EchiTAbG, an antivenom specific for envenoming by the saw-scaled viper (E. ocellatus) which is responsible for 80% of snakebite deaths in Nigeria. Since E. ocellatus is widely distributed across the West African savannah, EchiTAbG offers considerable therapeutic promise in many countries in the region. Since other Echis species represent public health concerns elsewhere in Africa, the objective of this study was to examine the pre-clinical intra-generic venom-neutralising efficacy of EchiTAbG. Our results suggest that EchiTAbG (Nigeria registration: A6-0078) has pan-African efficacy against Echis envenoming indicating that costly investment in region-specific antivenoms therefore may not be required. This represents an important progression to minimise development costs and maximise the delivery of snakebite therapy for the continent.
