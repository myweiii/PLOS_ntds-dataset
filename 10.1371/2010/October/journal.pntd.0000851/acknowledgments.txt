The authors wish to thank Paul Rowley for expert herpetological assistance, Damien Egan and Paul Vercammen (Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife, United Arab Emirates) for providing specimens of E. c. sochureki and John Landon, Ibrahim Al-Abdulla and MicroPharm Ltd for raising antisera against the four Echis venoms and the provision of EchiTAbG antivenom. The authors would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to other members of the EchiTAb Study Group, including Professors Warrell and Theakston, the clinicians Drs AS Ballah and YP Ofemile treating snakebite victims in Kaltungo and Zamko hospitals, whose sustained efforts have combined to dramatically improve the treatment of Nigerian snakebite victims.
