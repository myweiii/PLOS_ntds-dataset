Surveillance has served as a basis for important public health responses to new threats, and as a source of invaluable information for health providers and policy makers. A budget proposal to stop the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding in surveillance and research for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus has the potential to leave the country ill-prepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. The present article uniquely integrates infectious disease models with economic analysis, taking advantage of a unique detailed dataset. By coupling a mathematical model with cost analysis we were able to evaluate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted disease of global importance, in an economically developed urban environment. Our analysis clearly shows that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones that follow the introduction of vector-borne pathogens. Our findings will help provide a science-based justification for re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program. More generally our study demonstrates the power of rigorous analysis of carefully collected data for a balanced assessment of the economic implications of a public health program shift.
