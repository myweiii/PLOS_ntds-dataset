Little information is currently available on the lifecycle and morphology of pentastomids, a new zoonotic parasite in China. The lifecycle of Armillifer agkistrodontis was established in multiple hosts, i.e., an intermediate host and a definitive host, and the parasite examined in terms of morphology and genetic relationship with other species. The time required for the completion of an entire lifecycle was about 14 months. The main morphological difference between A. armillatus and L. serrata is the number of abdominal annuli. The genetic data supported the notion that pentastomids belong to the phylum Arthropoda. Based on the 18S rRNA sequence, the shortest hereditary distance was found between A. agkistrodontis and Raillietiella spp. The highest similarity in the Cox 1 nucleic acid sequences was found between A. agkistrodontis and A. armillatus. The established multi-host model provides a possible approach to confirm suspected infections and offers an opportunity to further study this parasite.
