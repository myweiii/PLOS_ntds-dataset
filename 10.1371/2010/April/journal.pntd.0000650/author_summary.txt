Despite being considered a relatively benign disease, Plasmodium vivax infection has been associated with fatal outcomes due to treatment failure or inadequate health care. The identification of sensitive and reliable markers of disease severity is important to improve the quality of patient care. Although not imperative, a good marker should have a close causative relationship with the disease pathogenesis. During acute malaria, an intense inflammatory response and a well-documented oxidative burst are noted. Among the free radicals released, superoxide anions account for the great majority. The present study aimed to evaluate the reliability of using an antioxidant enzyme, responsible for the clearance of superoxide anions, as a marker of vivax malaria severity. Thus, we investigated individuals from an Amazonian region highly endemic for vivax malaria with the goal of predicting infection severity by measuring superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) plasma levels. In addition, we compared the predictive power SOD-1 to that of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. SOD-1 was a more powerful predictor of disease severity than TNF-alpha in individuals with different clinical presentations of vivax malaria. This finding opens up new approaches in the initial screening of severe vivax malaria cases.
