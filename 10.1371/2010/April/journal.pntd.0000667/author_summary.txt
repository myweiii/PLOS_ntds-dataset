A key feature of schistosomiasis, as well as of other systemic helminth infections, is their chronic nature. This reflects the successful evasion and suppression of host immune responses by the parasites. One of the mechanisms that could underlie this phenomenon is modulation of the dendritic cells (DC), which play a central role in initiation and control of T cell responses. Although several in vitro studies have documented the modulatory capacity of Schistosoma antigens on DC function, it is still unclear what effect schistosomiasis has on human DC function in vivo. To address this question, we isolated the two main DC subsets present in peripheral blood from infected and uninfected individuals living in a Schistosoma-endemic area in central Africa, and found that specifically the myeloid DC from Schistosoma-infected subjects displayed an impaired capacity to respond to Toll-like receptor ligands and to drive T cell responses. These findings provide new insights into how schistosomiasis suppresses host immune responses, which can be exploited for new strategies to enhance immunity against the parasites.
