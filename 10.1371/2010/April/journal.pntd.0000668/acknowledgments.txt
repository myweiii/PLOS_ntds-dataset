The authors thank the study subjects, who patiently endured our “learning by doing.” This study would not have been possible without the invaluable assistance of the lymphedema clinic staff at Hôpital Ste. Croix: Denise Dor, Antoine Michelus, Arielle Seraphin, Carline Octela, Lauriette Phrasier, Muracile Joseph, Rocelyn Gelin, Rose Claudelle Louis-Charles, Soeur Eliane St. Jacques, and Mirene Maddy. We received essential support, assistance, and encouragement from “a great cloud” of contributors, each of whom made this study possible: Alix Luc Valmé and Jack LaFontant from Hôpital Ste. Croix; Maude Heurtelou and Fequiere Vilsaint, of Educa-Vision, Inc., for training, development of educational materials, and creative energy; Ian Roy for training our staff in lymphedema management; Jeannine Coreil, University of South Florida; Fr. Thomas Streit, University of Notre Dame; Suzanne Lutwick and Cheryl Morgan, for assistance with training; and Anne Haddix, Anne Peterson, Maya Yodh, Wanda Jones, Sharon Katz, Wendy Hitch, Susan Kirby, and LeAnne Fox from CDC. Wayne Kirby and Duel Seymore, CDC, created and built the volumetric measuring device. Narda Butler created an ingenious and inexpensive compression garment (the “vlopay”) using Velcro for this study. Finally, we are indebted to Mike Brooks, for keeping us supplied, often at the last minute. This paper is dedicated to the memories of Robin Gorsky, whose encouragement for this work provided a critical initial spark; Soeur Esta Joseph, who hosted “hope clubs” and other events for the patients in the study; and Antoine Maurice, whose deep suffering with elephantiasis could not extinguish his gentle spirit.
