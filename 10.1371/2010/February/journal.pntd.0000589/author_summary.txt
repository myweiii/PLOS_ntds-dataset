For Leishmania, one genus among several genera belonging to the parasitic Trypanosomatidae family, many nonhuman mammals are known to be hosts in addition to humans. Most studies that describe Leishmania wild reservoirs are based on isolated descriptions of infection that can lead to misinterpretation of information. The definition of the epidemiological importance of a putative reservoir host depends on adequate data on the dynamics and peculiarities inherent to the host-parasite interactions and their involvement in the transmission cycle of these parasites. Our objectives were to sort out the features displayed by nonhuman mammal populations (the caviomorph rodent Thrichomys laurentius) which, with an insect host, perpetuate Leishmania transmission cycles. This rodent species had the ability to act as maintenance and/or amplifier host of both tested Leishmania species. The similar pattern of infection displayed by T. laurentius infected by these two Leishmania species shows that the definition of dermotropic or viscerotropic based on the clinical features observed in humans should not be applied to natural hosts, and it emphasizes that the search for Leishmania reservoirs should consider all possibilities of the infection course, independent of current knowledge in other mammal hosts.
