Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent and serious parasitic diseases in tropical and subtropical regions. Schistosomes are pathogens that have a unique repertoire of genes expressed at different life cycle stages. Small regulatory RNAs play an important role in the control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In a previous study, we identified five conserved miRNAs in adult S. japonicum worms through traditional sequencing methods. In this work, we discovered more microRNAs, including 16 new schistosome-specific miRNA families in addition to 20 conserved miRNA families. We identified two miRNA gene clusters using the data obtained from high-throughput sequencing. We demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of endogenous small interfering RNAs in schistosomes. Identification of these small regulatory RNAs should provide a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding functions of small RNAs and ultimately of small RNA regulatory networks in this important pathogen.
