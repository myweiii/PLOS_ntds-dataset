Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms, is a significant cause of illness and death in the developing world. Furthermore, recent reports suggest that the global burden of disease due to schistosomiasis has been significantly underestimated. Schistosomiasis of the liver arises due to inflammation and the deposition of scar tissue around parasite eggs trapped in this organ. In the current study we analysed the gene-expression profile of the mouse liver at several time points following infection with a virulent strain of Schistosoma japonicum to better understand the mechanisms that regulate this process. Progression of disease was associated with increased expression of different groups of genes with distinct biological functions. Specifically, we identified several genes encoding chemical signalling molecules that contribute to different phases of the response by recruiting key cell types to the site of inflammation. This study represents the most comprehensive report to date of the gene expression profile in the liver during schistosomiasis. These results provide further insight into the mechanisms that regulate the development of schistosome-induced inflammation and scarring and will aid in the development of novel treatments to alleviate the burden of disease caused by this parasite.
