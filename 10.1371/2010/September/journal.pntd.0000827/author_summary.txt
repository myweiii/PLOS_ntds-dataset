Schistosomiasis is a well studied parasitic disease that is far from eradication despite the development of an effective treatment. The lack of an efficacious vaccine and high re-infection rates after treatment are major factors in its intractable worldwide prevalence. A non-invasive imaging technique like positron emission tomography (PET) could give clinicians and researchers a quantitative and visual tool to characterize the worm burden in infected individuals, determine the efficacy of a candidate vaccine, and provide information about parasite migration patterns and basic biology. We are therefore proposing the novel application of PET imaging to schistosomiasis in order to advance the management and research of this infectious disease. Herein, we demonstrate that schistosome parasites take up 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). FDG uptake in regions adjacent to or within the liver linearly correlate with the worm number in infected mice, but the correlation was stronger in mice with high infection burdens. We anticipate that this research is a first step in the development of more specific radiotracers optimized for schistosomiasis, and will eventually translate to human studies.
