Many infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis are transmitted to people by biting insects, in this case by female sand flies. To control this and similar diseases we need to understand why particular species of sand fly transmit particular species of Leishmania. One important feature of the Leishmania parasite-sand fly interaction is the ability of the parasite to bind to the midgut wall of the fly, as it is within the gut that the parasite lives. Here we have studied the specificity of this interaction and report two main findings. The first is that only specific stages in the parasite life-cycle are capable of binding to the gut. The second is that, providing these life-cycle stages are analysed, parasite species that can be transmitted by particular sand flies are always capable of binding to their guts, but in some cases they are also capable of binding to non-transmitting sand fly species. This shows that gut binding by parasites is necessary but not sufficient to explain transmission. This research advances our understanding of Leishmania biology, but also shows us that there are further aspects that need to be investigated before we can fully understand the Leishmania-sand fly relationship.
