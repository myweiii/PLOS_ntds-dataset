Leptospirosis is an infection caused by Leptospira bacteria, and is probably the most widespread zoonosis in the world. It is carried by a wide range of animals that contaminate the environment by shedding organisms in their urine. Humans become infected when they come into contact with contaminated urine or water in the environment that has been contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Despite its ubiquity, isolates are rarely identified to the serovar level due to the cumbersome, complicated serological methods that are involved. Serovar identification is important for epidemiology and enabling public health interventions. In this study, we employed a molecular method of serovar identification using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to identify 175 clinical isolates of Leptospira. In order to validate this method for serovar identification, we also performed complex serological testing on a subset of the isolates. The results indicated that pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is an appropriate alternative to serological tests for serovar identification. Serovar identities of the clinical isolates are also discussed. Fifteen percent of the clinical isolates were identified as potentially new serovars and demonstrates the utility of a more rapid, standardized molecular method in order to keep up with the changing taxonomy and epidemiology of Leptospira.
