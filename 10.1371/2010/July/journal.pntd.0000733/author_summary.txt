Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 10â€“12 million people in Latin America. Patent parasitemia develops during acute disease. During this phase, polyclonal B cell activation has been reported to generate high levels of serum antibody with low parasite specificity, and delayed protective humoral immunity, which is necessary to prevent the host from succumbing to infection. In this manuscript, data show that relatively resistant mice have improved parasite-specific humoral immunity and decreased polyclonal B cell activation compared to susceptible mice. Parasite-specific humoral immunity was associated with differential expansion of B cell subsets and T cells in the spleen, as well as with increased Th1 and decreased Th2 cytokine production. These data suggest that host susceptibility/genetic biases impact the development of humoral responses to infection. Th2 cytokines are generally associated with improved antibody responses. In the context of T. cruzi infection of susceptible mice, Th2 cytokines were associated with increased total antibody production concomitant with delayed pathogen-specific humoral immunity. This study highlights the need to consider the effect of host biases when investigating humoral immunity to any pathogen that has reported polyclonal B cell activation during infection.
