Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, a neglected devastating infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, has a huge impact because of the massive necrotizing, disfiguring ulcers that may result if not treated. Therapeutic options are surgery, antibiotics or combinations of both. Since 2004, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of antibiotics (rifampicin and streptomycin) for the management of the disease. The effectiveness of this antibiotic treatment on advanced lesions is, however, not well documented. We evaluated this strategy on large ulcers clinically suspected to be BU, in a rural zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also assessed the outcome of treatment based only on clinical diagnosis. All patients were treated with antibiotics for 12 weeks and surgery was performed after 4 weeks. BU was confirmed by laboratory tests in 67% of the patients indicating that the clinical diagnosis of ulcerated forms of BU may be more difficult than usually reported. Although delayed surgery seemed detrimental in some confirmed cases, it was possible to treat 92% of patients successfully with low recurrence rates (1.1%) by combining antibiotic treatment with surgery in a rural zone. However, the need for and the best time for surgery for large Buruli ulcers requires clarification.
