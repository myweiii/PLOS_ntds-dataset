Scrub typhus, the rickettsial infectious disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, is endemic across the Asia Pacific region. The bacterium is transmitted by the bite of larval stages of trombiculid mites (“chiggers”; Leptotrombidium spp.), which more typically feed on small rodents. Clinical features include fever, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy and an eschar at the site of the bite. Despite the importance of this pathogen, little is known of the population diversity or the role of homologous recombination in driving the microevolution of this species. Here, we describe the development and application of a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme that can be applied directly to blood samples, and that was applied to 108 O. tsutsugamushi isolates. We found that this organism demonstrated a high rate of homologous recombination, a surprising finding given the intracellular life-style of this species. We also found that 25% of patients in our study were simultaneously infected with multiple sequence types, suggesting multiple infection caused by either multiple mite bites, or multiple strains co-existing within individual mites.
