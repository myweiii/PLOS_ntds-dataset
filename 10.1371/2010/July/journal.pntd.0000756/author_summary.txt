Scabies, a neglected parasitic disease caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is a major driving force behind bacterial skin infections in tropical settings. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are nearly twenty times more likely to die from acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease than individuals from the wider Australian community. These conditions are caused by bacterial pathogens such as Group A streptococci, which have been linked to underlying scabies infestations. Community based initiatives to reduce scabies and associated disease have expanded, but have been threatened in recent years by emerging drug resistance. Critical biological questions surrounding scabies remain unanswered due to a lack of biomedical research. This has been due in part to a lack of either a suitable animal model or an in vitro culture system for scabies mites. The pig/mite model reported here will be a much needed resource for parasite material and will facilitate in vivo studies on host immune responses to scabies, including relations to associated bacterial pathogenesis, and more detailed studies of molecular evolution and host adaptation. It represents the missing tool to extrapolate emerging molecular data into an in vivo setting and may well allow the development of clinical interventions.
