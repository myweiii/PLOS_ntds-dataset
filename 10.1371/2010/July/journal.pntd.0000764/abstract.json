    "Background": "The present pilot study investigating the minimum dose for short-course single and double-dose treatment of kala-azar with an apparently new liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, Fungisome, led to identification of immunological components for early detection of success and/or failure to cure.",
    "Methods": "Patients were treated with 5, 7.5 (single-dose) and 10 mg/kg body weight (5 mg/kg double-dose) of Fungisome. Immunological investigations involving plasma cytokines and antigen-specific lymphoproliferation and cytokine responses from PBMCs were carried out before, 1 week after Fungisome treatment, at the time of relapse, and again after conventional amphotericin B treatment.",
    "Results": "At 1-month follow-up all the patients showed 100% initial cure. However, total doses of 5, 7.5 and 10 mg/kg Fungisome showed 60%, 50% and 90% cure, respectively, at 6-months posttreatment. Patients successfully cured demonstrated downregulation of IL-12 and IL-10 in plasma, and two-fold or more elevation of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and TNF, and significant down-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 in culture supernatants 1-week posttreatment irrespective of drug-dose. A differential immune profile, involving insignificant decline in IL-10 and IL-12 in plasma and negligible elevation of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and TNF, and persistence of IL-10, despite decline in TGF-\u03b2 in culture supernatants, in apparently cured individuals, corresponded with relapse within 6-months of treatment.",
    "Conclusion": "Immunological investigations revealed significant curative and non-curative immunomodulation 1-week posttreatment, correlating with successful cure and relapse, respectively. Although immune-correlation was dose-independent, almost consistent curative response in patients treated with the highest dose 10 mg/kg reflected a definitive impact of the higher-dose on the immune response.",
