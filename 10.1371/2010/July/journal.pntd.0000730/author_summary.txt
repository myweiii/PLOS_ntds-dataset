In Latin America, 18 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan that causes Chagas' disease. Vertebrate calreticulins (CRTs) are multifunctional, intra- and extracellular calcium binding, chaperone proteins. Since human CRT (HuCRT) inhibits capillary growth (angiogenesis) and suppresses tumor growth, the presence of these functions in T. cruzi CRT (TcCRT) may have interesting consequences in the host/parasite interactions. Previously, we have cloned and expressed TcCRT and shown that, when translocated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the area of trypomastigote flagellum emergence, it promotes infectivity, inactivates the complement system, an innate defense arm and inhibits angiogenesis in the chorioallantoid chicken egg membrane. TcCRT inhibits angiogenesis, since it interferes with endothelial cell multiplication, migration and capillary morphogenesis in vitro, as well as angiogenesis in rat aortic rings. The parasite molecule also displays important antitumor effects. In these activities, TcCRT is more effective than the human counterpart. Perhaps, by virtue of its capacity to inhibit angiogenesis, TcCRT is anti-inflammatory, thus impairing the antiparasite immune response. The TcCRT antiangiogenic effect could also explain, at least partially, the in vivo antitumor effects reported herein and the reports proposing antitumor properties for T. cruzi infection.
