In the Horn of Africa, visceral leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex, continues to pose a major health problem affecting the poorest of the poor. Population genetic studies are crucial for the development of drugs and vaccines against microorganisms. However, our knowledge about the population structure of L. donovani parasites in this region is still very limited. Using a highly discriminatory multilocus microsatellite typing approach, we found a remarkably high genetic diversity among the East African strains of L. donovani studied which grouped into two genetically and geographically distinct populations comprising parasites from SE and Kenya, and those from NE and Sudan. Despite Leishmania being widely regarded as a clonal organism, our results suggest a possible co-existence of clonal and sexually reproducing strains of L. donovani from SE. The information obtained by the present study is helpful for future design of parasite-targeted control measures in East Africa.
