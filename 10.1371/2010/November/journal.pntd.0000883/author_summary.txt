Japanese encephalitis, caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, is the most prominent viral encephalitis in Asia. Three billion people live in endemic areas and at least 50,000 clinical cases occur each year, although reliable vaccines are available. Concerning the burden caused by this disease, more should be done to prevent it. Good and reliable diagnostics are one of the prerequisites for an effective fight against the virus, but it is nearly impossible to produce and evaluate an in-house assay according to high standard quality criteria as done for commercial tests. Only a few commercial assays are available and the thorough evaluation of these assays is of great importance for diagnostic laboratories. The sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures to assess the performance of a diagnostic assay. In this study the Euroimmun IgM indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) was compared to the Panbio and InBios IgM ELISAs. It showed a specificity of 95% and 100%, and a sensitivity of 86% and 93.8%, respectively. The specificity of the IgG IIFT in comparison to PRNT50 was 100% and the sensitivity was 93.8%. Overall, the IIFT showed a comparable performance and could be used as an alternative to the established assays.
