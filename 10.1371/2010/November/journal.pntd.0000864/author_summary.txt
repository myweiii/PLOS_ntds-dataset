Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoon Trypanosoma cruzi, is an ailment affecting approximately 12â€“14 million people in Iberoamerica and is becoming increasingly important in North America and Europe as a result of migratory currents. The parasite invades mainly cells of the heart or the walls of the digestive tract. The patients with symptoms develop heart disease or gastrointestinal motor disorders. We and others have implicated the T. cruzi gp85/trans-sialidase surface protein family in the attachment of the parasite to the host cells. These proteins share a peptide motif called FLY. The involvement of FLY in parasite interaction with endothelial cells from different organs has been studied using bacteriophages expressing the FLY peptide as surrogates. We found that phages expressing FLY bind to endothelial cells in an organ dependent manner, particularly in the heart. Also, this peptide binds strongly to intermediate cell filaments, like cytokeratins and vimentin. These results indicate that FLY might be an important contributor to tissue tropism. It also supports the notion that the vasculature and the endothelial cells are important players in Chagas' disease. These data may have important implications in the pathology of Chagas' disease and novel therapeutic approaches for patients afflicted with this disease.
