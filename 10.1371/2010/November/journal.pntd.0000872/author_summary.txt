Buruli ulcer is a slowly progressive but potentially devastating disease of skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease is widespread throughout West and Central Africa, and some countries in the region have established Buruli ulcer control programs. Buruli ulcer is difficult to distinguish from other chronic skin conditions that require different treatments, and there is an urgent need for an accurate point-of-care diagnostic test. In this study, we have used genomic techniques to identify 45 potential M. ulceransâ€“specific antigens, 33 of which we have been able to produce and purify. We tested these proteins against sera from patients, healthy people living in the same region as the patients and from individuals living in a region with no cases of Buruli ulcer. We found that seven proteins were able to elicit antibody responses that were significantly different between patients and the control subjects from the non-endemic region but not from the healthy individuals in the same Buruli ulcer endemic region. Further analysis showed that six of these M. ulcerans proteins might be useful as markers of exposure to M. ulcerans and could be developed into tools to uncover environmental reservoirs and understand transmission pathways of the bacterium.
