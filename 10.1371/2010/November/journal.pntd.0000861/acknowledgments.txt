Azithromycin was donated to the National Trachoma Control Programs of each country by Pfizer Inc through the International Trachoma Initiative. Many thanks to the laboratory at the Proctor Foundation run by Dr Thomas Lietman of the University of California San Francisco for the laboratory standardisation. We would also like to thank all the community leaders and children for participating in this project, and all the members of the PRET team.
