We want to thank all pregnant women who provided a stool sample. We also want to thank all SMRU staff who work or have worked in the SMRU ANC, the laboratory, the computer and the logistic department. This project was part of the Wellcome Trust Mahidol University Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme.
