Malaria and schistosomiasis are the most prevalent tropical diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and together exert a huge burden of mortality and morbidity. The geographical overlap of these diseases among the individuals and at the population level commonly occurs resulting inevitably in frequent co-infections. It is not clear how helminth infections affect the outcome or the course of malaria caused by P. falciparum. Previous studies have suggested both exacerbation as well as suppression of symptoms due to one or both pathogens. Thus the possibility of synergistic or antagonistic interactions needs to be taken into account in planning and implementing interventions, so as to adjust control priorities and strategies accordingly. The most notable impact of schistosome co-infection revealed by our studies was at the prevalence of sexual and asexual stage malaria parasites, which may have implications on malaria disease severity and transmission dynamics.
