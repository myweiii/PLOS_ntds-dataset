For a successful development within the midgut of the sand fly vector, Leishmania must overcome several barriers which are imposed by the vector. The ability to overcome these barriers has been associated with species specificity, and interference with the sand fly vector-parasite balance can change the outcome of the infection in the vector. Recently, our group has carried out a transcriptome assessment of the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi midgut, uncovering many transcripts possibly associated with the barrier to Leishmania development. In order to validate the role of such genes, we have developed a dedicated RNA interference (RNAi) platform to assess whether RNAi targeting such genes can reduce Leishmania major development. PpChit1 is a midgut-specific chitinase presumably involved in the maturation/degradation of the peritrophic matrix in the gut of the sand fly after a blood meal. Our results show that knockdown of PpChit1 via RNAi led to a significant reduction of Le. major within the gut, supporting the potential use of PpChit1 as a target for transmission blocking strategies against sand fly-transmitted leishmaniasis.
