Schistosoma japonicum involves two obligatory host stages, with asexual reproduction within a molluscan host and sexual reproduction within a mammalian host. Having over 40 species of mammals suspected of being potential reservoirs complicates the transmission patterns. Understanding the complex transmission patterns is further hampered by the ethical and logistical difficulty in sampling adult worms from mammalian hosts. However, the two free-swimming larval stages, cercariae (released from a mollusc and then infective to a mammal) and miracidia (hatched from eggs passed in a mammal's faeces, and then infective to a mollusc), are available, and elucidating the genetic composition of parasites at theses two stages could provide information of infection processes. Here we sampled cercariae during April 2006, miracidia during September-October 2006, and cercariae during April 2007 in three marshland and three hilly villages in Anhui Province of China, and, using microsatellite markers, analyzed the population genetic structure and, for the first time, the familial relationships of parasites at different stages. We found contrasting population structures of parasites, and host species-associated diversities and transmission patterns of parasites between and within two regions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the successful application of sibship analyses to infection process provides an alternative approach to the dissection of transmission dynamics.
