Aedes mosquitoes transmit many human viral pathogens including dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. Most of these pathogens have no specific treatment or vaccine and hence their control is reliant on controlling the mosquito vectors, which usually involves the use of insecticides. In order to prevent the alarming prospect of mosquito control failure due to the rapid selection and spread of insecticide resistance in several mosquito populations worldwide, it is essential that effective resistance management strategies are implemented and adhered to. The development of simple diagnostic tests for the early identification and monitoring of resistance is an important prerequisite for this task. Here, we describe the development of a simple colorimetric test for the detection of GSTE2-2/DDTase-based resistance in individual mosquitoes. The novel assay combines the most desirable features of specificity and sensitivity with the low cost and ease of use required for a routine test in endemic countries. It can have direct application in routine vector monitoring as a resistance indicator and help improve the sustainability of insecticide based control strategies.
