Trypanosoma vivax is responsible for animal trypanosomosis, or Nagana, in cattle and small ruminants. Under experimental conditions, the outbred mouse model infected with a well studied West African T. vivax isolate reproduces the main characteristics of the infection and pathology observed in livestock. Anemia and non-specific (parasite-directed) polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia are the most common disorders coincident with the rise in parasitemia. Our results presented here show that the decrease in peripheral B cell populations does not seem to be compensated by newly arriving B cells from the bone marrow. The infection nevertheless prompts intense production of stem cells that mature into myeloid and lymphoid precursors. In spite of this, B cell numbers are specifically reduced in the periphery as the infection progresses. Thus, negative feedback seems to be set in motion by the infection in the bone marrow, more precisely affecting the maturation of B precursors and consequently the output of mature B cells. The origin of these phenomena is unclear but this doubtless creates a homeostatic imbalance that contributes to the inefficient immune response against T. vivax infection.
