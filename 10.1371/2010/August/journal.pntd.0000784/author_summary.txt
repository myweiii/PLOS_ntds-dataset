Antigen B (EgAgB) is a major protein produced by the metacestode cyst of Echinococcus granulosus and plays an important role in modulating host immune responses, although its precise biological function still remains unknown. Previous studies suggested the EgAgB gene family is variable between isolates and genotypic strains of E. granulosus. We designed specific primers to amplify and determine the number and variation of the genes using genomic DNA from individual worms. Based on sequence alignment analysis, we found that the gene family comprises ten unique genes. Each of the genes was identical in both larval and adult E. granulosus and in isolates collected from the two distinct geographical areas. We showed that the genes were differentially expressed in different stages of E. granulosus with one gene, EgAgB3/1, expressed predominantly in all stages. This is the first study to report such a large number of unique and conserved genes in the EgAgB gene family and their differential expression in different life cycle stages of E. granulosus. These findings are fundamental for determining the expression and regulation of this gene family in E. granulosus and the biological function of antigen B.
