Human neurocysticercosis is a severe parasitic disease caused by the installation of Taenia solium larvae in the central nervous system. Neurocysticercosis is still deeply rooted in Latin-America, Africa and Asia, where it develops its complete life cycle promoted by poor sanitary conditions. It is also emerging in developed countries due to human migration. Although hard data on the evolution of the disease incidence in endemic countries are lacking, its presence is being obscured by the growth of degenerative and metabolic diseases, creating the illusion of having disappeared.
 In this article, we show that neurocysticercosis frequency has not significantly changed between 1994 and 2009 among patients attending the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía, Mexico City, the principal Mexican neurological center. We also show that clinical severity of the cases diminished during this period, associated with the higher proportion of neurocysticercotic patients from Mexico City rather than from the states, where local neurological facilities have improved. These results show that neurocysticercosis is still relevant in México, and that more effective efforts should be put toward its eradication.
