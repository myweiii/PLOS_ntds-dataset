Schistosomiasis is an infectious disease resulting from the infection of parasitic trematode worms called schistosomes. About 600 million people are currently exposed to schistosomiasis and 200 million people are infected in about 76 countries. Current diagnostic methods are unable to detect schistosomiasis at its early stages and thus are incapable of preventing disease causing further complications. In order to understand the effects of schistosome infection on hosts' biochemistry associated with disease progression in a holistic fashion and detect the infection at the early stage, we systematically investigated the metabolite composition (metabonome) changes in mice biofluids and liver tissues induced by Schistosoma japonicum using NMR spectroscopy. We detected infection-induced mice metabonomic alterations at three weeks post-infection, a week earlier than traditional methods. We found that the infection-caused elevation of urinary 3-ureidopropionate was not only associated with disease progression but also worm burden. We further found that overall metabonomic changes were also closely associated with disease progression, and our methods were capable of distinguishing different levels of worm burden at week five post-infection. Our findings provided further understandings in host responses to the infection and demonstrated metabonomics as a potentially useful tool for early diagnosis of S. japonicum infections.
