Borrelia recurrentis, the causal agent of louse-borne relapsing fever is transmitted to humans via infected body lice. Infection with B. recurrentis has been achieved only in humans and is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory disease, multiple relapses of fever and massive spirochetemia. A key virulence factor of B. recurrentis is their potential to undergo antigenic variation. However, for survival in the blood during the early phase of infection and for persistence in human tissues, spirochetes must be endowed with robust tools to escape innate immunity. We have recently shown that B. recurrentis acquires the serum-derived regulator factor H, thereby blocking the alternative complement pathway. Here, we show that B. recurrentis expresses in addition a novel outer surface lipoprotein that selectively binds serum-derived C4b-binding protein and C1 esterase inhibitor, two endogenous regulators of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation. The combined data underscore the versatility of B. recurrentis to effectively evade innate and adaptive immunity, including serum resistance. Thus, the present study elucidates a new mechanism of B. recurrentis important for its evasion from complement attack and will be helpful for the development of new drugs against this fatal infection.
