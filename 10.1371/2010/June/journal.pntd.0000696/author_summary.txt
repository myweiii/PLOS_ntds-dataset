Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a disabling mosquito borne parasitic disease and one of the major neglected tropical diseases. In most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa the control of LF is based on yearly mass drug administration (MDA) with a combination of ivermectin and albendazole, in order to interrupt transmission. We monitored the effect of 3 repeated MDAs with this drug combination, as implemented by the Tanzanian National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme, on human infection and mosquito transmission during a five-year period (one pre-intervention and four post-intervention years) in a highly endemic community in north-eastern Tanzania. After start of intervention, human infection with the blood-stage larva of the parasite (microfilaria) initially decreased rapidly, leading to considerable reduction in transmission. The effects thereafter levelled off and transmission still occurred at low level after the third MDA. The MDAs had limited effect on molecular markers of adult worm burden (circulating filarial antigens) and transmission exposure (antibodies to Bm14 antigen) in the human population. The study highlights the importance of monitoring and regular evaluation in order to make evidence based programme adjustments, and it points to a need for further assessment of the long-term effect of repeated ivermectin/albendazole MDAs (including the importance of application intervals and treatment coverage), in order to optimize efforts to control LF in sub-Saharan Africa.
