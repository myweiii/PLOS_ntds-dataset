From 14 diseases considered by WHO as Neglected Tropical Diseases, four involve helminth infections, such as schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Toxocariasis is a soil-transmitted worm highly prevalent in many developing countries, while schistosomiasis causes an annual mortality of 14,000 deaths per year, with 200â€“300 million infected people and 10% at risk of infection worldwide. Additionally, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in many settings, particularly in the world's poorest countries. Mycobacteria and helminths are co-endemic and induce opposing patterns of immune responses in the host, recognized as Th1 and Th2 respectively. These co-existing patterns could be associated with the failure of TB vaccines. In this sense, we investigated the inflammatory and immune response in a coinfection model with T. canis or S. mansoni and M. tuberculosis analyzing the effects of an immunotherapy that has previously shown efficacy in experimental TB. This immunotherapy is based on a DNA vaccine that codifies a mycobacterial heat shock protein (hsp65), which can prevent TB in a prophylactic and also therapeutic setting. In this work, we show that helminth coinfection does not abrogate the therapeutic effects of DNAhsp65 vaccine against TB.
