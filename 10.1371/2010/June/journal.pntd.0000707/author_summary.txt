Childhood helminth infections can reduce the risk and severity of allergies and autoimmune diseases, by means of immunomodulation, and a decrease in helminth infections could potentially account for the increased prevalence of these diseases in the western world (hygiene hypothesis). We hypothesized that the same immunomodulatory effect can have an impact on metabolic diseases like obesity, diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis, wherein inflammation plays a crucial role (extended hygiene hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we examined the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) among diabetic, pre-diabetic and non-diabetic subjects who were part of the CURES (Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study) study. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found reduced prevalence of LF among diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects. This was associated with decreased filarial antigen load and anti-filarial antibody levels. The association remained significant even after adjusting for socioeconomic status, age and gender. Interestingly, within the diabetic subjects, those who were filarial positive had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-Î±, IL-6 and GM-CSF) compared to those who were filarial negative. In light of these findings, the decreasing incidence of filarial infection due to mass drug administration could potentially have an unexpected adverse impact on the prevalence of diabetes in India.
