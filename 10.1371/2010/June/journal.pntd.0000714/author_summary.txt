Helminth diseases of humans remain a major problem in many parts of the tropics. Treatment of these parasitic infections is restricted to a limited number of drugs and few new compounds are in development. One of the major obstacles to the development of new therapeutics is the lack of high-throughput screens that can be adapted to parasitic species for the identification of small molecule inhibitors. Here we present a simple, inexpensive assay for the identification of inhibitors of Hsp90 in filarial worms. The assay, first described for the identification of Hsp90 inhibitors in tumor cells, does not require recombinant protein but relies upon the ability of a fluorescently labelled drug to bind to Hsp90 in the context of a soluble fraction of worm homogenate. We validated the assay using known inhibitors of Hsp90, including derivatives of the synthetic purine-scaffold series of Hsp90 inhibitors and were able to show a differential sensitivity to these compounds between human and Brugia Hsp90.
