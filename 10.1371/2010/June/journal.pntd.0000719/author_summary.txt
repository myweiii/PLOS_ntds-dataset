The parasitic worms, Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini, have a serious impact on the health of tens of millions of people throughout Asia. The greatest impact, however, is through the malignant, untreatable cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) that these parasites induce in chronically infected people. These liver flukes are officially classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Group 1 carcinogens. In spite of their massive impact on human health, little is known about these parasites and their relationship with the host at the molecular level. Here, we provide the first detailed insight into the transcriptomes of these flukes, providing a solid foundation for all of the molecular/-omic work required to understand their biology, but, more importantly, to elucidate key aspects of the induction of cholangiocarcinoma. Although our focus has been on the parasites, the implications will extend far beyond the study of parasitic disease. Importantly, insights into the pathogenesis of the infection are likely to have major implications for the study and understanding of other cancers.
