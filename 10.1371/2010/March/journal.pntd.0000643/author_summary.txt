Paracoccocidioidomycosis is acquired through inhalation of spores released from filamentous forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis presumably present in the soil of endemic areas. However, successful isolation of the fungus from these areas has been rare, making it difficult to determine the fungus's ecological niche and the environmental factors that might influence the rate of infection and disease. Identifying clusters of acute paracoccidioidomycosis cases could potentially help at identifying these factors. However, there are no published reports of paracoccidioidomycosis outbreaks. We describe an undetected cluster of acute paracoccidioidomycosis cases diagnosed in 1985 in São Paulo State, Brazil, and investigate its association with climate. We observed that soil water storage was atypically high in 1982/83, and that the absolute air humidity in 1984 was much higher than normal, which may have favored, respectively, antecedent fungal growth in soil and conidia liberation in 1984, the probable year of exposure. This atypically high soil water storage was due to the strongest El Niño event in the area in the last 50 years, which also caused atypically high precipitation in that area. Better knowledge of the conditions that favor the fungus's survival and growth in the environment and that enhance human exposure may facilitate the development of preventive measures.
