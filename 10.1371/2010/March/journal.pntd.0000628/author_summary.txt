Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic skin infection transmitted by the bite of a sand fly, can result in chronic skin sores and is estimated to affect more than 1.5 million persons worldwide. While the infection generally heals on its own in months to years, treatment can be expensive and difficult. We compared a heat treatment using the ThermoMed device to an (abbreviated) ten day course of intravenous Pentostam (a pentavalent antimony drug) in a population of U.S. soldiers who acquired their infections in Iraq. We found no statistically significant difference between the two treatments in the healing rate at two months. The heat treatment had less associated toxicity. Heat therapy is a ruggedized, battery operated method that could be adapted to humanitarian situations and less developed health care settings, likely with less cost and side effects than local treatment alternatives.
