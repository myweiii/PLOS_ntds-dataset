The intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum in Asia is the snail Oncomelania hupensis, which can be separated phenotypically into ribbed- and smooth-shelled morphotypes. In China, the typical morphotype is ribbed-shelled, with its distribution restricted to mainland China. Smooth-shelled snails with varix are also distributed in China, which are considered to belong to the same subspecies as the ribbed-shelled snails. In this study we investigate the genetic variation among O. hupensis from different geographical origins using combined complete ITS1 and ITS2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Snails including ribbed-shelled and smooth-shelled (but with varix on the shell) from the lake/marshland region of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and smooth-shelled snails from mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, were genetically distinct with no shared haplotypes detected. Furtheremore, the snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces were clustered in separate clades in the phylogenetic tree, and three clades were observed for snails from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The population diversity of O. hupensis in China is thus considered large, and evolutionary relationships in the host-parasite system of O. hupensis-S. japonicum may be of interest for further research.
