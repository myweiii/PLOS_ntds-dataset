Brucellosis is a bacterial disease transmitted from infected animals to humans. This disease often presents as a prolonged but non-specific illness primarily characterized as fever without specific organ localization. Because infections can result after ingestion (typically from unpasteurized animal milk or milk products from goats, cattle or sheep) or inhalation (important because of bioterrorism potential) of small numbers of organisms, the bacteria that cause brucellosis are potential biological warfare agents. Here, a protein microarray containing 1406 Brucella melitensis proteins was used to study the antibody response of experimentally infected goats and naturally infected humans in B. melitensis infection. Goats recognized 18 proteins and humans recognized 13 proteins as serodiagnostic antigens; antibody detection of only two of these antigens was shared by goats and humans, suggesting either fundamentally different immune responses or different responses in relation to mode or setting of infection. The human serodiagnostic antigens were evaluated in a simple nitrocellulose line blot assay, which validated the protein microarray results. The approach described here will lead to the development of new diagnostics for brucellosis and other infectious diseases, and aid in understanding the human and animal host immune response to pathogenic organisms.
