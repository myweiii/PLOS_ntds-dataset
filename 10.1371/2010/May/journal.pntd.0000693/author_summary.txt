Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are endemic in Dar es Salaam and partially share common vectors, but no synergy exists between their control programs. The vast majority of mosquito breeding habitats in the city is human-made, and therefore could be mitigated through the implementation of a community-based vector control program accompanied by an educational campaign to sensitize the population and promote behavior change. Of particular importance are clogged drains and ditches with stagnant water, which are the most common larval habitat in the city. This problem could be addressed by an environmental management intervention in order to restore and maintain the functionality of drains. Such intervention can potentially contribute to reduce vector-borne disease transmission, but also promote an overall healthier environment, particularly improving the situation of those living under slum conditions, as proposed by the Millennium Development Goal 7. A synergy between efforts to control lymphatic filariasis and malaria, identifying common strategies, combining monitoring activities, optimizing the use of limited financial resources, and carefully evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the joint venture would not only contribute to current goals of lymphatic filariasis and malaria elimination, but also provide important lessons for future integrated control efforts.
