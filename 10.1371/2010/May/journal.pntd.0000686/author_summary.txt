Schistosomiasis is a significant cause of illness and death in the developing world. Inflammation and scarring in the liver and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) are common features of the disease. Changes occurring in the spleen have the potential to influence the way in which the body deals with infection but the mechanisms driving these changes are not well characterised. In the present study we determined, for the first time, the gene expression profile of the mouse spleen during infection with Schistosoma japonicum and compared these results to those previously reported for the liver to determine if processes occurring in these organs co-operate to promote hepatic inflammation and granuloma formation. Our data indicated that gene expression in the spleen is related to the types of cells present and suggest that the spleen might be important in controlling schistosome-induced inflammation. Comparison of the liver and spleen showed that expression of cell signalling molecules (chemokines) was much higher in the liver, potentially promoting the recruitment of specific cell types to this organ, causing inflammation and scarring. The results from this study enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms that drive schistosome-induced splenomegaly and liver inflammation.
