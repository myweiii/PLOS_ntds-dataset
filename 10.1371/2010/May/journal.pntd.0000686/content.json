    "Introduction": "Schistosomiasis, characterised by extensive hepatic fibrosis and splenomegaly, is a significant cause of parasitic morbidity and mortality [1]. Although extensive studies have been carried out to identify the processes driving hepatic granulofibrotic response, the immunopathogenesis of schistosome-induced splenomegaly has been largely neglected.\nSplenomegaly is a common feature of many infectious diseases and can lead to alterations in the splenic architecture as well as the inherent immunological function of the organ. Changes in the splenic architecture following Leishmania and some viral infections have been shown to influence the nature of the immune response to subsequent infections [2], [3]. Schistosome infections induce significant splenomegaly characterised by loss of definition between the red and white pulp [4], [5], [6], [7]. Additionally, schistosome infections are known to modify the nature of the immune response to a number of other pathologies, including allergic responses and other parasitic infections, by as yet undetermined mechanisms [8]. Furthermore, undefined processes occurring in the spleen during active schistosome infections enhance the granulofibrotic response occurring in the liver [5]. The precise molecular mechanisms and transcriptional modulations corresponding to these cellular and immunological changes, however, have not been fully evaluated. Characterising the molecular processes occurring in the spleen during schistosomiasis is an important research priority if we are to fully comprehend the immunopathogenesis of this disease and the mechanisms by which schistosome infections modulate the immune response to other pathogens.\nThe study presented here describes the use of whole genome microarray analysis combined with flow cytometry and histology, to provide a comprehensive profile of the transcriptional and cellular response occurring in the murine spleen during Schistosoma japonicum infection. As well, we compare and contrast these results with those we have previously reported for the liver during the progression of S. japonicum egg-induced granuloma formation and hepatic fibrosis [9]. Our results reveal that there is co-ordinated expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules in the liver and spleen that may regulate the recruitment of effector cells to the liver during schistosome infection. Additionally, we demonstrate the up-regulation of several immunomodulatory elements in the spleen that may be involved in the control of the immune response to S. japonicum infection. The results of microarray analysis, flow cytometry and histology of the livers of the S. japonicum infected mice used in the present study are available [9] and the liver gene expression data are in the public domain (NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus; Series Accession Number: GSE14367). Taken together these results provide insight into the integrated molecular mechanisms driving the development of schistosome induced pathology.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Ethics Statement\nAll work was conducted with the approval of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee.\n\n\nMice and Parasites\nFull details of the time-course experiments undertaken on S. japonicum-infected mice are described elsewhere [9]. Methods related to the analysis of the spleen are outlined below. Livers and spleens from the same animals were used for the purposes of parasitological, histological, microarray and flow cytometry analyses.\nFour to six week old female C57BL/6 mice (Animal Resource Centre, Canningvale, Australia) were percutaneously infected with 20 S. japonicum cercariae (Chinese mainland strain, Anhui population). Mice were euthanized at 4 (n\u200a=\u200a7), 6 (n\u200a=\u200a7) and 7 (n\u200a=\u200a8) weeks post-infection (p.i.) and spleen tissue collected. Three additional mice were used as uninfected controls. An identical experiment was performed for flow cytometry (n\u200a=\u200a5 per group). Total adult worm pairs per mouse were recorded as a measure of parasite burden and eggs per gram of liver was calculated as a measure of hepatic egg burden as reported [9], [10].\n\n\nHistological Assessment\nFormalin fixed, paraffin embedded spleen sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin to assess splenic structure. Within spleen tissue, eosinophils were identified by Giemsa staining; neutrophils by Leder stain (naphthol AS-D chloroacetate) [11]; and macrophages by immunoperoxidase staining for the macrophage specific cell surface marker F4/80 (Primary antibody: rat anti-mouse F4/80, Abcam, Cambridge, USA; Secondary antibody: biotin-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, USA. Detection: Streptavidin-HRP, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, USA). Slides were scanned using an Aperio slide scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, USA). The number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the spleen of each mouse was quantified by calculating the average number of positively stained cells in 20 high power fields (\u00d7400). Positive staining for F4/80 was measured using Aperio's Spectrum Plus Software positive pixel count algorithm (Version 8.2; Aperio Technologies, Vista, USA).\n\n\nFlow Cytometry\nLeukocytes were isolated from whole spleens as described [12]. Briefly, spleens were digested in collagenase D (1mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and DNAse I (0.5mg/mL; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C. The tissue was then passed through a 70\u00b5m cell strainer (BD Falcon, Bedford, USA) and washed with FACS buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% sodium azide (v/v) in phosphate buffered saline). Red blood cells were lysed with Gey's lysis solution. The solution was then underlayed with FACS buffer and centrifuged at 1300rpm for 5 mins. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer and the cells counted.\nCells were stained for specific cell markers by first incubating with anti-Fc-receptorIII antibodies (Monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma; Clone: 24.G2) to block non-specific binding and then with commercially available fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 30 mins on ice (APC-anti-CD4, FITC-anti-CD8b and PE-anti-CD19: BD Pharminogen; FITC-anti-CD3, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Cells were defined as CD4+ T-cells (CD3+/CD4+), CD8+ T-cells (CD3+/CD8+) and B-cells (CD19+). Data were acquired on a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD Bioscience) and analysed using FlowJo Software (Treestar Inc) and GraphPad Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).\n\n\nRNA Isolation and Purification\nTotal RNA was extracted from spleen tissue as described [13]. Briefly, spleen tissue was homogenised in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) using a Qiagen Tissuelyser (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, USA). A portion of the homogenate was then processed by phase extraction with Trizol and by column chromatography using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia USA). RNA quantity was measured using the Nanodrop-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA) and quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, USA).\n\n\nPooling of Spleen RNA for Microarray Analysis and Real-Time PCR\nEach mouse group was normalised by log transformation for egg burden and outliers were excluded on the basis of 95% confidence intervals as described [9]. An equal amount of total RNA from the spleens of four mice with the highest quality total RNA were pooled for cRNA and cDNA synthesis.\n\n\nMicroarray Analysis\ncRNA synthesis and whole genome microarray analysis.cRNA was synthesised using the Illumina Total Prep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, USA). Microarray analysis was performed using Illumina Mouse 6 version 1.1 Whole Genome Expression Chips and scanned using an Illumina BeadStation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Two technical replicates were performed for each cRNA sample. Splenic gene expression data are publicly available (NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus; Series Accession Number: GSE19525).\n\nData analysis.Quality control of microarray data was performed by examining intensity histograms of hybridisation efficiency and noise in BeadStudio (version 3; Illumina, San Diego, USA). Expression values were entered into GeneSpring GX version 7.3 (Agilent Technologies/Silicon Genetics, Foster City, USA) and normalised to the 50th percentile. Values less than 0.01 were set to 0.01. Data were then normalised to uninfected controls and filtered for significant signal on the basis of detection score, a BeadStudio generated measure of the signal intensity of the gene relative to negative controls (d>0.949, which equates to a confidence value of p\u22640.05). For a gene to be accepted, at least 4 of 8 hybridisations had to pass these filtering criteria. Differentially expressed genes were identified by analysis of variance (ANOVA, p\u22640.05 using Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple testing). Hierarchical clustering with the Pearson correlation measure of similarity was performed on ANOVA filtered data to identify common patterns of temporal gene expression. Keyword based searches for specific gene names were used to identify chemokines and other genes of interest.\n\nComparison of liver and spleen microarray profiles.Venn diagrams comparing genes that passed all filtering criteria and were \u22652 fold up- or down-regulated in the spleen and liver [9] were constructed to identify genes that were:\n\ncommonly up- or down-regulated in the spleen and liver\nenhanced in the spleen (i.e. up-regulated in the spleen while down-regulated or unchanged in the liver)\nenhanced in the liver (up-regulated in the liver and down-regulated or unchanged in the spleen)\nspecifically down-regulated in the spleen\nspecifically down-regulated in the liver\n\nIdentification of over-represented biological functions and signalling pathways.DAVID functional annotation analysis (DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 2008, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH [14], [15]) was used to identify biological processes, molecular functions and signalling pathways in the DAVID knowledge data base over-represented by genes in each of the identified hierarchical clusters and gene lists generated from comparison of the liver and spleen data. Ranking of functional annotations in DAVID is based Modified Fischer's exact test (EASE score, p\u22640.05) [14]. To identify groups of common terms, functional annotation clustering was applied. The overall importance of functional annotation clusters is ranked on the basis of enrichment score, the geometric mean of the p-values of each annotation term in the group [14]. An arbitrary cut off of \u00b12 fold change in expression was applied allowing identification of changes in gene expression with likely biological significance.\n\n\n\nReal-Time PCR\ncDNA was synthesised from pooled splenic total RNA using a Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen Inc., USA). cDNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA.). Real-time PCR was used to validate a subset of the microarray data. Forward and reverse primers were sourced from the literature [16], [17], [18] or designed using Primer-Blast software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) (Table S1). Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltranferase (HPRT) was used as a housekeeping gene [18]. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) on a Corbett Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, Concorde, Australia). Rotor-Gene 6000 Series software (version 1.7), Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Windows (San Diego, California USA) were used in the analysis of results. Correlations between microarray and real-time PCR results were assessed using Spearman's Rho measure of correlation in GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Windows.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nChanges in parasitological, histological, real time PCR and flow cytometry data were assessed by One Way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing (p\u22640.05) using the GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Windows (San Diego, California USA). Statistical analysis of microarray data was performed using GeneSpring GX (version 7.3.1). Correlations between microarray and real-time PCR data were measured using Spearman's Rho correlation in GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for windows as described [19].",
    "Results": "Parasitological and Histological Analyses\nDetails of the parasitological burden and kinetics of granuloma formation and fibrosis in the livers of the S. japonicum infected mice used in these experiments are reported elsewhere [9]. Briefly, mice were moderately infected with an average of 5 worm pairs. Schistosome eggs were first observed in the liver at 4 weeks post infection (p.i.) and hepatic egg burden increased significantly thereafter (1-Way ANOVA, p\u22640.05) [9]. The kinetics of granuloma formation and fibrosis were consistent with previous reports for S. japonicum [20], [21].\nTotal spleen weight increased significantly from 4 weeks p.i. onwards (Figure 1, upper panel). Changes to the splenic architecture were observed as early as 4 weeks p.i. and were characterised by increasing congestion of the red-pulp associated with loss of definition between the white and red pulp (Figure 1A\u2013D, lower panel).\nUpper panel: Spleen weight increased over time following S. japonicum infection reaching approximately 4.5 times that of controls at 7 weeks p.i. The graph represents mean spleen weight of mice pooled for microarray analysis \u00b11SD (n\u200a=\u200a4 per group). Lower panel: Schistosome induced splenomegaly was associated with increasing congestion of the red pulp and loss of definition between the red (lighter staining) and white pulp (darker staining) over time A: Control; B: 4 weeks p.i.; C: 6 weeks p.i.; D:7 weeks p.i. (Haematoxylin and eosin \u00d740; Bar equals 100\u00b5m.).\nThe number of neutrophils in the splenic red pulp increased significantly from 6 weeks p.i. and eosinophil numbers were significantly elevated compared with uninfected mice at 7 weeks p.i. F4/80 staining for macrophages was significantly increased from 6 weeks p.i., reaching a peak of 19% total section area at 7 weeks p.i. (Figure 2A\u2013I).\nThere was a significant increases in the number of neutrophils (A\u2013C: Leder stain for neutrophils (pink stain, arrowed) \u00d7200 in uninfected control mice (B) and at 7 weeks p.i. (C)), eosinophils (D\u2013F, Giemsa stain \u00d7400 in uninfected control mice (E) and at 7 weeks p.i. (F)) and F4/80+ macrophages (G\u2013I: F4/80 staining in uninfected control mice (H) and at 7 weeks p.i (I). (red-brown) \u00d740) in the splenic red pulp from as early as 6 weeks p.i. Values represent mean cells/high power field (eosinophils and neutrophils) or percent positive staining (F4/80) \u00b11SD of mice pooled for microarray analysis (n\u200a=\u200a4 per group). Bar\u200a=\u200a100\u00b5m.\n\n\nFlow Cytometry\nFlow cytometry for CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells and B-cells revealed an early increase in the total number of these cells at 4 weeks p.i. followed by a return to baseline levels by 6 weeks p.i. (Figure 3A). In contrast, the ratio of T-cells and B-cells to total splenocytes decreased significantly after 4 weeks p.i. (Figure 3B).\nA: Flow cytometry demonstrated a significant increase in the total number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and CD19+ B-cells in the spleen at 4 weeks p.i. followed by return of these cells to baseline levels by 6 weeks p.i. B: The ratio of T- and B-cells to total live cells decreased significantly over time. Values represent means \u00b11SD. N\u200a=\u200a5 per group except for 6 weeks p.i. where one mouse harboured no adult worms and was excluded from all further analyses.\n\n\nMicroarray Analysis\nTranscriptional profile of the spleen during S. japonicum infection - Filtering of microarray data.Normalised data for each of the 46,643 genes on the microarray were filtered for significant signal, thereby reducing the data set to 18,438 genes of which 4,553 were shown to be differentially expressed (1-Way ANOVA, p\u22640.05). Hierarchical clustering identified four distinct patterns of gene expression (Figure 4) comprised of genes (Dataset S1) that were:\n\nDown-regulated during infection (3045 genes)\nUp-regulated early in infection (180 genes)\nConsistently up-regulated during infection (806 genes)\nUp-regulated late in infection (478 genes)\nFour distinct clusters representing genes that were significantly down-regulated (cluster 1); up-regulated earlier (cluster 2), consistently up-regulated (cluster 3) and up-regulated later (cluster 4) were identified by hierarchical clustering analysis. Prominent biological processes and molecular functions (gene ontologies) associated with genes 2-fold or greater up- or down-regulated in each of these clusters and genes associated with these ontologies are listed in the boxed text. Data are represented in heat map form where green represents down-regulated gene expression, red represents up-regulated expression, with relatively unchanged expression coloured black.\nFunctional annotation clustering of genes 2-fold or greater up- or down-regulated revealed that each of these gene clusters was associated with distinct gene ontologies (Figure 4; Table S2). Accession numbers and Illumina Probe IDs of genes of interest are provided (Table S3).\nThere was significant and sustained down-regulation of genes associated with B-cell and T-cell activation and proliferation, including components of the B- and T-cell receptor complexes including immunoglobulin genes (Igh-VJ558, Igh-VS107), B-cell receptor accessory molecules (e.g. CD79a,b), T-cell receptor chains (Tcrd-V1, Tcrb-V8.3, Tcrb-V8.2, Tcrb-V13) and T-cell receptor accessory molecules (CD3e,d,g,z). Additionally, there was sustained down-regulation of several cytokines and cytokine receptors associated with lymphocyte activation (e.g. IL21r, IL2rg, IL27ra, IL18r1, IL7r, IL7, and IL18). Down-regulation of genes associated with chemotaxis, including numerous chemokines (CCL4,-5,-19,-21a\u2013c, CXCL9,-12,-13, XCL1), was also a prominent feature of the splenic transcriptional response to schistosome infection. Genes involved in morphogenesis and angiogenesis (e.g. Fgf1, Pdgfa, Vegfc, Ctgf, Tgfbr2) were also down-regulated from 4 weeks p.i.\nGenes consistently up-regulated were predominantly associated with progression through the cell cycle and included key cell proliferation markers (e.g. Mki67) and genes associated with the M-phase of the cell cycle (e.g. Cell division cycle homologues, E2F1 and 2, Cyclin D3, Cyclin F). Significant up-regulation of key enzymes of the porphyrin and heme biosynthesis pathways (e.g. Fech, Uros, Ppox) was also observed.\nGenes up-regulated early in infection were functionally associated with immune responses including several interferon-inducible genes such as Irf7, Oas2, Ifit3 and Ifit2. Genes up-regulated in the spleen later in infection were associated with wound healing and defence responses as well as chemotaxis (e.g. CXCL4, CCL8, S100A8), glycolysis and peroxidase activity. Other genes whose expression increased significantly over time included chitinase-like genes (e.g. Chi3l1, Chi3l3, Chi3l4), neutrophils markers (e.g. Ngp, NE), eosinophil markers (e.g. Epx and Ear1\u20133,6,10), Annexin a1 (ANXA1) and Cathelicidin Antimicrobial Peptide (CAMP).\n\nComparison of transcriptional profiles of the spleen and liver.Comparison of spleen and liver microarray datasets identified 297 genes that were commonly up-regulated and 78 genes that were commonly down-regulated. There was spleen specific up-regulation of 367 genes and specific down-regulation of 863 genes. Forty-one genes up-regulated in the spleen were down-regulated in the liver and 242 genes down-regulated in the spleen were concurrently up-regulated in the liver. There was liver specific up-regulation of 1,025 genes and down-regulation of 1,255 genes (Dataset S2; Table S4).\nUp-regulation of the proliferation marker Mki67 and genes associated with progression through the cell cycle was common to both liver and spleen (e.g. Cyclin B, Cdc20, Cdca3). Other commonly up-regulated genes included the chemokines CCL8, S100A8, S100A9, whose expression was higher in the liver [9]. Commonly down-regulated genes included some members of the Cytochrome P450 family (Cyp27a1, Cyp2d22, Cyp4f13, Cyp4v3) that have been associated with heme or iron binding, or mono-oxygenase activity.\n\nSpleen specific responses.Elevated expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the heme and porphyrin biosynthesis pathways (e.g. Fech, Uros, Ppox) was specific to the spleen. Sustained down-regulation of cytokine (IL7, IL18) and cytokine receptor genes (e.g. IL7r, IL18r, IL21r, IL27ra) associated with lymphocyte activation was observed in the spleen while their expression was unchanged in the liver.\n\nLiver specific responses.Elevated expression of several procollagen genes, including COL1A1, as well as several profibrotic cytokines (TGF-\u03b2, PDGF-\u03b2, EDN1) was observed exclusively in the liver [9]. Similarly, there was significant down-regulation of numerous components of several metabolic pathways including lipid, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism [9].\n\nContrasting expression of genes associated with cell recruitment.Distinct differences were observed in the expression of genes associated with chemotaxis in the liver and spleen (Figure 5). The chemokines CCL4,-19,-21a-c, CXCL7,-9,-13 and the cell adhesion molecules ICAM1, ICAM 2, down-regulated in the spleen, were concurrently up-regulated in the liver [9]. Further, the chemokines CCL3, -6, -7, -11, -12, -24, CXCL-1, -14, -16 and CX3CL1 and the cell adhesion molecules VCAM1, NCAM1, PECAM1 were up-regulated in the liver [9] while unchanged or undetectable in the spleen. Expression of chemokines (CCL8, S100A8, S100A9) up-regulated in both organs but was higher in the liver [9].\nComparison of spleen and liver transcriptional profiles identified a number of chemokines with contrasting expression. A: Chemokines up-regulated in the liver and down-regulated in the spleen during schistosome infection. B: Chemokines up-regulated in the liver and unchanged or below levels of detection in the spleen. C: Chemokines up-regulated in both organs showed greater expression in the liver. Graphs represent average fold change relative to uninfected tissue by microarray analysis. Dotted lines represent a \u00b12 fold cut-off for biological significance. Expression values for the liver are derived from our previous study of the transcriptional profile of the S. japonicum infected liver [9].\n\n\n\nReal-Time PCR\nReal-time PCR was performed on a subset of genes representative of transcripts that were highly up- or down-regulated in the spleen (NE, EPX, Chi3l3, CXCL13); exhibited contrasting expression in the liver and spleen (CXCL13, CXCL1, CXCL9) and are key genes from important biological categories identified by DAVID analysis (Cell cycle: Mki67; Chemotaxis: CXCL1, CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL13); as well as genes encoding Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4). The results of the real-time PCR analyses correlated closely with those observed by microarray analysis (Spearman's correlation r\u200a=\u200a0.93, p\u22640.0001, n\u200a=\u200a36) (Figure S1).",
    "Discussion": "To date, there have been no studies conducted to specifically define the molecular or transcriptional processes occurring in the spleen during infection with any schistosome species. We have reported here the first such study employing microarray analysis in combination with flow cytometry and histochemistry to characterise the transcriptional and cellular profile of the spleen following schistosome infection, comparing these changes with those occurring in the liver [9].\nOverall, the transcriptional response of the spleen reflected cellular changes in this organ during progression of S. japonicum infection. Significant up-regulation of proliferation markers and genes associated with the cell cycle and lymphocyte proliferation paralleled the expansion of T- and B-cells within the spleen. Similarly, the significant down-regulation of genes associated with T- and B-cell receptor signalling reflected the decrease in the relative proportion of these cells in the splenic compartments over time. The down-regulation of the cytokines that promote Th1 development from 6 weeks p.i. could favour the development of a Th2 response and reflects the shift from a Th1 to a Th2 dominant response observed in the liver at this time point [1], [8], [9]. Further, down-regulation of a large cohort of genes predominantly associated with immune responses is likely to reflect attempts by the host to regulate the immune response to schistosome infection.\nLoss of B-cells/T-cells following initial expansion could be due to cell death or migration from the spleen. We did not detect elevated expression of apoptosis-associated genes in the spleen but there was decreased expression of several chemokines, especially lymphocyte chemokines such as CXCL13, CCL21 and CCL19. Combined with the accumulation of these cells in the liver [9], these results suggest that cellular loss from the spleen is more likely due to migration than apoptosis. Further, it has been shown that S. mansoni infections are able to influence hematopoietic processes occurring in the bone marrow as well as the activity of bone marrow-derived cells (e.g [22], [23]). This raises the alternative possibility that infection-induced modifications in haematopoiesis occurring up-stream of the spleen, contribute to the loss of B- and T-cells from the spleen during S. japonicum infection. Further studies to define the contribution of specific chemokines, apoptosis and alterations to the haematopoietic process within the bone marrow are required if we are to fully comprehend the mechanisms involved.\nAccumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the spleen was paralleled by enhanced expression of neutrophil and eosinophil markers as well as genes known to be expressed at high levels in these cells such as annexin A1 (ANXA1) and Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP). ANXA1 regulates polymorphonuclear leukocyte trafficking and function during innate immune responses and T-cell dependent inflammation during adaptive immune responses [24]. CAMP is known to have direct antimicrobial activity, is chemotactic for a variety of cells, and regulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [25]. The role of these genes in schistosomiasis has not been investigated but their increased expression in the spleen suggests that they may be involved in shaping the immune response to schistosome infections.\nSignificant up-regulation of Chi3l3 and increased staining for the macrophage marker F4/80 suggests that there may be an increase in the population of alternatively activated macrophages in the spleen during schistosome infection. Similarly, there was significant induction of the alternatively activated macrophage markers Retnla and Mrc1 and increases in the number of F4/80+ macrophages in the liver. In light of recent studies demonstrating immunoregulatory roles for alternatively activated macrophages during Th2 responses [26], [27], [28], it is possible that their presence in the liver and spleen during schistosome infection represents a mechanism whereby the host regulates the immune response to infection at both the local and systemic level.\nComparison of the transcriptional profiles of the liver and spleen revealed common up-regulation of genes associated with progression through the cell cycle indicating that cellular proliferation is occurring in both organs during infection. Up-regulation of components of the heme and porphyrin metabolism pathways was specific to the spleen and likely reflects increased blood volume passing through this organ associated with portal hypertension.\nUp-regulation of extracellular matrix components, as well as the profibrotic cytokines TGF-\u03b2, EDN1 and PDGF-\u03b2, was enhanced in the liver but remained unchanged in the spleen reflecting the development of fibrosis [9]. Similarly, there was liver specific down-regulation of many components of several metabolic pathways including, but not restricted to, metabolism of xenobiotics, bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and glutathione metabolism [9]. As discussed previously [9], these results are consistent with studies of the metabolic function of the liver following schistosome infection and are indicative of decreased liver function associated with hepatic injury [29], [30], [31].\nThe most striking difference between the liver and spleen was the contrasting expression of genes involved in cellular recruitment (Figure 5). Several chemokines, including lymphoid homing and T-cell chemokines (e.g. CXCL13, CCL19, CCL21a\u2013c), were significantly up-regulated in the liver [9] but down-regulated in the spleen. Further, expression of eosinophil (CCL24), neutrophil (CXCL1) and macrophage/monocyte (CCL6, CCL7, CXCL14) chemokines and the cell adhesion molecules VCAM1, NCAM1, PECAM1 was enhanced in the liver [9] but was unchanged or undetectable in the spleen. The differential expression of these genes likely contributes to the generation of a chemotactic signalling gradient promoting the recruitment of effector cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes, to the liver during infection leading to the development of granulomas and fibrosis [9]. The observed loss of T- and B-cells from the spleen after initial expansion at 4 weeks p.i. is, therefore, more likely due to migration of these cells from this organ to the peripheral tissues than cell death. Similar induction of CCL21, CXCL16, CXCL9 and CXCL13 in the liver in other models of hepatic disease suggests that common mechanisms regulate the recruitment of lymphocytes to the liver following inflammation [32], [33], [34]. Down-regulation of lymphoid homing chemokines in the spleen has been implicated in alterations in lymphoid structure during Leishmania infection [2], altered motility of dendritic cells and lymphocytes following several viral infections [3], and with decreased responsiveness to secondary infection following primary infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Listeria monocytogenes [3]. The down-regulation of these chemokines during S. japonicum infection may contribute to the significant changes observed in the spleen during schistosome infection and may go some way to explaining how schistosomes skew the immune response to other infections.\nComparison of the expression profiles of the liver and spleen clearly indicate that there is co-ordinated expression of chemokines in these organs during S. japonicum infection. Up-regulation of lymphocyte, eosinophil and monocyte chemokines in the liver [9], and down-regulation of the same chemokines in the spleen may contribute to the development of a chemotactic signalling gradient that promotes recruitment of these cells to the liver, thereby facilitating the development of granulomas and fibrosis. Furthermore, the down-regulation of homeostatic lymphoid chemokines, such as CXCL13 and CCL21, in the spleen could lead to disruption of the splenic architecture and the altered immune responses associated with schistosome infections. Additionally, we observed up-regulation of the alternatively activated macrophage marker Chi3l3 and the immunoregulatory molecules ANXA1 and CAMP in the spleen. These results suggest that the spleen may be an important site for the regulation of S. japonicum-induced immune responses. Together these data highlight the importance of the spleen to the immunopathogenesis of schistosomiasis and significantly enhance our understanding of the chemokine signalling pathways regulating the development of schistosome-induced granulomas and fibrosis."
