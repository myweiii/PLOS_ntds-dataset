The parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human African trypanosomiasis, which is fatal unless treated. Currently used drugs are toxic, difficult to administer, and often are no longer effective due to drug resistance. The search for new drugs is long and expensive, and determining which compounds are worth pursuing is a key challenge in that process. In this study we sought to determine whether different compounds elicited different responses in the mammalian-infective stage of the parasite. We also examined whether genetic knockdown of parasite molecules led to similar responses. Our results show that, depending on the treatment, the replication of the parasite genomes, proper division of the cell, and mitochondrial function can be affected. Surprisingly, these different responses were not able to predict which compounds affected the long term proliferative potential of T. brucei. We found that some of the compounds had irreversible effects on the parasites within one day, so that even cells that appeared healthy could not proliferate. We suggest that determining which compounds set the parasites on a one-way journey to death may provide a means of identifying those that could lead to drugs with high efficacy.
