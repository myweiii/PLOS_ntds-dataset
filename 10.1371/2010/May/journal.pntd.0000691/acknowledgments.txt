We are grateful to Eliana Nieves and Waldo Hasperué for their technical help, and to all the researchers cited in the Table S1 who have kindly accepted to answer our e-mail survey. We have benefited from the statistical advice by Jean Lobry and Peter D. M. Macdonald in the analysis of a mix of normal distributions. We are particularly grateful to Claudia Rodríguez and Alejandro Martínez Ibarra who have kindly provided their original unpublished data on Triatoma patagonica and T. recurva, respectively.
