Chagas disease, an infection that afflicts millions of people in Central and South America, is caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In the chronic stage of the disease, patients' hearts are adversely affected. Chagas is the leading cause of infectious heart disease in the world. The current drugs used to treat Chagas disease are highly toxic, unable to eradiate the parasite, and subject to increasing drug resistance. Consequently, researchers are actively looking for new treatments. One attractive drug target is a Chagas protein called cruzain, which is required for the parasite's survival. Drugs that can inhibit the correct functioning of cruzain within the parasite may one day serve as powerful treatments in the fight against this devastating tropical disease. To design drugs that will be effective against cruzain, we need to know what portions of the protein are crucial for its functionality. For example, portions of the protein that bind to other proteins or to small molecules are likely to be critical. These regions are called “binding sites.” In the current work, we identify two uncharacterized cruzain binding sites. With this knowledge in hand, future researchers may be able to design drugs that target these sites.
