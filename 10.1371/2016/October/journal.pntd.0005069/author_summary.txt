Aedes aegypti is a major vector of several viruses such as dengue and Zika viruses. Understanding the intricate interaction of viruses with mosquito vectors and the factors involved in virus replication are essential for developing effective arbovirus control strategies. In this study, we report a comprehensive list of long intergenic non-coding RNAs encoded by the genome of Ae. aegypti for the first time. In addition, we show that a number of these long non-coding RNAs are differentially expressed in mosquitoes infected with dengue virus, which could be involved in DENV-mosquito interaction. The outcomes provide a new avenue to explore mosquito biology and mosquito-virus interactions that may lead to the discovery of molecules that could be beneficial for vector manipulation.
