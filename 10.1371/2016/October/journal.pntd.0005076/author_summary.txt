Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever caused by a tick-borne bunyavirus (SFTSV) in East Asian countries. The role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in resistance and susceptibility to SFTSV is not known. In this study, we investigated the correlation of HLA locus A, B and DRB1 alleles with the occurrence of SFTS. Our results have expanded the knowledge of the association of HLA genes with SFTS. Our study may be helpful to state the relationship between the occurrence of SFTS with HLA alleles or haplotypes and provide scientific basis for study on pathogenesis and vaccine development.
