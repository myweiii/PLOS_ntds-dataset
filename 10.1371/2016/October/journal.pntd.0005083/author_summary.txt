Spondweni virus (SPONV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus reported in Africa. Human infection with SPONV may result in a febrile illness similar to symptomatic Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, as well as many other tropical infections. Previously, little was known about the genetic relationships between SPONV and ZIKV. Additionally, the ability of SPONV to infect peridomestic mosquito species suspected or incriminated in the transmission of ZIKV was unknown. Both SPONV strains exhibited a high degree of nucleotide and amino acid identity to each other, but considerable nucleotide and amino acid divergence to ZIKV. The open reading frame (ORF) of the nine African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains originally isolated in West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and the New World all exhibited limited nucleotide divergence. Both strains of SPONV exhibited a low degree of infection and/or dissemination in Aedes albopictus, Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes suggesting that these species have a low potential to serve as vectors. These results coupled with differences in geographic distribution, ecology and vector species indicate that SPONV and ZIKV are similar but separate species.
