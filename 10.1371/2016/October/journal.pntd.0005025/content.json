    "Introduction": "Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide. While most dengue virus (DENV) infections are asymptomatic or result in a mild acute febrile illness (AFI), some are life-threatening due to plasma leakage [1, 2]. With no antivirals to treat dengue or prevent its severe manifestations [3], early recognition of severe dengue and timely supportive care is used to reduce mortality [4\u20136]. Several dengue vaccines are in late stage clinical trials and one was recently licensed in several countries [7]. Decisions regarding their use will depend on vaccine performance and safety, and reduction of disease burden, including deaths.\nGlobally, an estimated 3.9 billion people are at risk of DENV infection, and 96 million dengue cases are estimated to have occurred in 2010 alone [8]. Despite its global presense, robust estimates of population-based dengue mortality rates are lacking. Most estimates have been derived from passive surveillance data [9\u201314] or hospital-based, retrospective case reviews [15, 16]. During epidemic periods, these methods have produced annual mortality rates that ranged from 0.30\u20130.59 deaths per 100,000 population. However, these approaches have not been validated as to under recognition due to misdiagnosis or under reporting [14].\nDengue has been endemic in Puerto Rico since the late 1960s [17, 18], and after the first deaths were reported in 1986, surveillance for deaths due to dengue was established in 1987 [19]. Mortality data have been collected through the island-wide Passive Dengue Surveillance System (PDSS), a hospital-based Infection Control Nurse Dengue Surveillance System (ICNDSS) that operated until 2007, and review of death certificates. Evaluations of these systems identified misdiagnosis and underreporting of cases, and failure to include dengue on death certificates of known laboratory-positive dengue cases [14, 20]. Few suspected fatal cases had tissue specimens or appropriately timed pre-mortem serum specimens for diagnostic testing, which resulted in a high proportion of indeterminate diagnostic results [14, 19\u201321].\nIn 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dengue Branch (CDC-DB), Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH), Instituto de Ciencias Forenses de Puerto Rico (in English, Puerto Rico Institute of Forensic Sciences [PRIFS]), Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico, and CDC Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch (CDC-IDPB) established the Enhanced Fatal Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (EFASS) to define mortality due to dengue-like AFI, and determine the etiology of these cases. We describe the findings from the first three years of EFASS.",
    "Methods": "Ethics Statement\nThis project underwent CDC institutional review and formal institutional review board review was not required since the case-patients were deceased. Because cases were reported in the context of public health surveillance, the informed consent of patients\u2019 families was not sought. Patient identifiers were removed from the dataset prior to analysis.\n\n\nData Sources and Case Detection\nEFASS used enhanced surveillance to detect dengue-like AFI deaths, improve reporting, and standardize collection of specimens at autopsy. While PDSS provided retrospective diagnostic data on fatal suspected dengue cases reported early in their illness, the primary source of EFASS cases was reporting by participating epidemiologists, pathologists, and registry statisticians. Specifically, they were asked to report and submit samples from all fatal cases whose death occurred during or immediately following a dengue-like AFI defined by the presence of fever (body temperature \u226538.0C axillary) or history of fever for \u22647 days. This included deaths with pre-defined diagnostic codes on the medical record, autopsy report or death certificate (S1 Appendix); the list of ICD codes was developed in 2009 after a review of the 1994\u20132007 fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases was conducted. Surveillance was enhanced by collaboration with pathologists and epidemiologists at hospitals most likely to encounter severe dengue cases, and included training and provision of standardized protocols. Dengue-like AFI fatalities that occurred at home or within 24 hours of hospital admission and referred to PRIFS were included. Collaborators were contacted weekly, and death certificates, PDSS, and National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) were routinely queried to identify suspected cases.\n\n\nSpecimen and Data Collection\nOnce a suspected case was identified, serum, whole blood, and tissue specimens were obtained, and PRIFS pathologists completed a Surgical Pathology and Autopsy Report (SPAR) (S2 Appendix). Cases with history of respiratory failure had a nasopharyngeal swab submitted for testing.\nData was abstracted from medical records of all health care visits during the illness for laboratory-positive dengue cases using a standard instrument that captured demographic characteristics, past medical history, clinical course, and management.\n\n\nDiagnostic Testing\nSerum specimens were tested by a DENV-serotype specific real time, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay [22], an anti-DENV IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC ELISA) [23], and an anti-DENV IgG ELISA [24]. Serum specimens were also tested by anti-West Nile virus (WNV) MAC-ELISA and, if positive, WNV-specific rRT-PCR and 90% plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) were performed [25]. Serum specimens with sufficient volume were sent to CDC Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch and tested for Leptospira IgM using the ELISA ImmunoDOT kit (GenBio, Inc., San Diego, CA). Acute specimens were tested for nucleic acid by rRT-PCR and 20 Leptospira reference antigens representing 17 serogroups by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) [26]. RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens and tested for Influenza A and B viral genome by rRT-PCR [27].\nTissue specimens were tested at the CDC-IDPB for DENV antigen or nucleic acid by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-PCR, respectively [28]. If clinical presentation or histopathology were suggestive of another etiology pathogen-specific diagnostic testing was performed [26, 29].\n\n\nDefinitions\nA fatal suspected dengue-like AFI case had a dengue-like AFI that immediately preceded death in a Puerto Rico resident. A fatal laboratory-positive dengue case was a suspected case with DENV nucleic acid in serum or tissue; DENV antigen in tissue; IgM seroconversion in paired specimens; or IgM in a single specimen. A fatal laboratory-negative dengue case was a suspected case with no molecular, immunodiagnostic or IHC markers of DENV infection. A fatal laboratory-indeterminate dengue case was a suspected case with no DENV nucleic acid or anti-DENV IgM in the acute serum specimen (collected \u22645 days post-illness onset [DPO]) and no available convalescent serum specimen (\u22656 DPO). A fatal dengue co-infection was a fatal suspected dengue-like AFI case with DENV nucleic acid in serum or tissue and another pathogen detected by PCR or IHC. A primary DENV infection was a fatal laboratory-positive dengue case without anti-DENV IgG in the acute serum specimen [30] and a secondary DENV infection had anti-DENV IgG in the acute specimen.\nA fatal laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis case was a suspected dengue-like AFI case with \u22654-fold increase in MAT titers in paired specimens, MAT titer \u2265800 in a single specimen, or detection of Leptospira spp. nucleic acid in serum by PCR or antigen in tissue by IHC. A probable fatal leptospirosis case had a MAT titer >200 but <800 in a serum specimen.\nDengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) were defined according to the 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [31] (Table 1). Dengue, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue were defined according to 2009 WHO guidelines [2]. Definitions for severe dengue, other clinical features and medical complications are shown in Table 1.\n\n\nData Analysis\nFrequencies were calculated for demographic, clinical and laboratory features of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases. Rates of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases per 100,000 Puerto Rico population were calculated by age group, sex, and municipality using US Census data [45]. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated to compare females to males. Case fatality rates (CFR) were calculated by dividing the number of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases by PDSS laboratory-positive dengue cases. Statistical differences in proportions were tested by Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Differences between municipality-specific fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases and PDSS laboratory-positive dengue cases were examined by calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients. A geographically weighted regression model was used to determine if the number of fatal cases differed from the expected based on PDSS laboratory-positive dengue cases in the municipality and neighboring municipalities. Data analyses were conducted using STATA (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) and ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA); maps were created using ArcMap.",
    "Results": "Identification of Fatal Cases and Diagnostic Testing\nDuring 2010\u20132012, a total of 311 fatalities following a dengue-like AFI were detected by EFASS and 40,881 suspected dengue cases were reported to PDSS, of which 17,929 (44%) were dengue laboratory-positive. Of all fatalities detected, 146 (47%) were identified and reported by PRIFS pathologists, 93 (30%) by death certificate review, 50 (16%) by hospital epidemiologists, 15 (5%) by PDSS, four (1%) by NNDSS, and three (1%) by chart review as part of another study. Serum and tissue specimens were available for 148 (48%) cases, serum alone for 138 (44%) cases, tissue alone for 16 (5%) cases, and 9 (3%) cases had no diagnostic specimens. Of the 164 cases (53%) with tissue, one case was not tested because of sample quality. Of evaluable cases, 159 (98%) had liver, 156 (96%) lung, 155 (95%) kidney, 142 (87%) spleen, 98 (60%) lymph nodes, and 66 (41%) intestine. A nasopharyngeal swab was submitted for 27 (9%) cases.\nA pathogen was identified in 120 (40%) of 302 cases with a diagnostic specimen. A pathogen was more likely to be identified in cases with tissue specimens than in those without (69% versus 45% respectively, P <0.0001). Overall, 58 (19%) fatal cases were dengue laboratory-positive, 167 (54%) were dengue laboratory-negative, and 77 (25%) were dengue laboratory-indeterminate. Other pathogens identified included: Leptospira spp. in 34 (11%) cases (32 confirmed, two probable); Staphylococcus spp. in nine (3%) cases; Streptococcus spp. in nine (3%) cases; influenza A virus in three (1%) cases; and one case each with Neisseria meningitidis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptococcus neoformans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and an unidentified Gram-positive coccus.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Fatal Laboratory-Positive Dengue Cases\nOf the 58 fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases, 53 (91%) were DENV RT-PCR positive in tissue, serum or both; four (7%) were anti-DENV IgM positive in a single serum specimen; and one (2%) demonstrated anti-DENV IgM seroconversion in paired specimens (Table 2). Autopsies were performed on 26 (45%) of the 58 fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases and DENV was most commonly identified by IHC or RT-PCR in liver (18/26, 69%), lung (15/22, 68%), and kidney (9/24, 38%) tissue. Of 43 cases with rRT-PCR positive serum specimen, 26 (60%) were DENV-1, 16 (37%) DENV-4, and one (2%) DENV-2; similar to DENV-type distribution in PDSS during the same time period [18]. Among the 36 fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases with an available acute serum specimen, 30 (83%) had a secondary DENV infection and 6 (17%) had primary infection. Five of the DENV RT-PCR positive cases had co-infection with another pathogen, including Leptospira species (4 cases) [46] and Streptococcus species (1 case).\n\n\nEpidemiology of Fatal Laboratory-Positive Dengue Cases\nFatal laboratory-positive dengue cases occurred in the months with increased PDSS dengue reporting (Fig 1). The dengue mortality rate was 1.05 per 100,000 population in 2010, 0.16 in 2011 and 0.36 in 2012; the 3-year average mortality rate was 0.52 dengue deaths per 100,000. The overall CFR for the three-year period was 0.32% and varied from 0.38% during the 2010 epidemic [18],; to 0.39% in 2011, a non-epidemic year, to 0.22% in 2012, an epidemic year.\nThe median age of fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients was 46 years (range: 5 months\u201389 years). Six (10%) case-patients were <20 years old, 39 (67%) 20\u201364 years old, and 13 (22%) \u226565 years old. EFASS case-patients were significantly older than laboratory-positive dengue case-patients reported to PDSS (median 46 vs. 18 years, P < 0.001) and a higher proportion of fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients were adults (90% vs. 49%, respectively, P < 0.001).\nThe majority of fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients were female (Table 3), and were significantly more likely to be female than laboratory-positive dengue cases reported to PDSS during the same period (59% vs. 45%, P <0.05). In 2010, rates of fatal laboratory-positive dengue were 1.3 times higher among females than males; 1.19 and 0.90 cases per 100,000 population, respectively (female-to-male IRR = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70\u20132.50, P = 0.20). Slightly less than half (27, 47%) of fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients were obese, similar to that reported in Puerto Rico [47]. Most fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients had more than one pre-existing medical condition (35, 60%). The most common included: diabetes mellitus (23, 40%), asthma (13, 22%), cardiovascular disease (9, 16%), thyroid disease (8, 14%), psychiatric disease (8, 14%), and rheumatologic conditions (8, 14%).\nFatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients were residents of 35 of the 78 Puerto Rico municipalities, and most (53, 91%) were born in Puerto Rico (Table 3). Fatal laboratory-positive dengue rates were highest in 2010 in Maunabo (0.82 per 10,000 residents), Maricao in 2011 (1.59), and Adjuntas in 2012 (0.51). In all years, there was a positive correlation between the number of PDSS laboratory-positive dengue cases and the number of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases in a municipality (R = 0.56, 0.59, 0.62, and 0.73 in 2010, 2011, 2012, and overall, respectively) (Fig 2). The number of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases detected was no more than expected based on municipality-specific, laboratory-positive dengue incidence rates. However, there were fewer than expected fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases detected in 11 of 78 municipalities in individual years. Only Quebradillas and Patillas had fewer than expected fatalities in all years.\nLeft panels: Incidence per 100,000 population of non-fatal, laboratory-positive dengue cases reported to the Passive Dengue Surveillance System, and number of fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases identified by the Enhanced Fatal AFI Surveillance System. Right panels: the standard deviation (SD) of the standard residuals are displayed. Differences >2 SD denotes significantly fewer than expected fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases, while \u22642 SD denotes significantly more than expected fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases.\n\n\nHealthcare Seeking Behavior of Fatal Laboratory-Positive Dengue Case-Patients\nAll 58 fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients sought care at least once during their illness; 25 (43%) had two healthcare visits, and seven (12%) had three or more visits. The median interval between fever onset and arrival at the first visit was 3.5 days (range: 0\u20138.5 days). Of the 49 (84%) cases with a medical record for review, at the first visit, most (71%) had dengue fever, while some had severe dengue (35%) or DHF (18%) (Table 4); the majority (67%) had warning signs for severe dengue, the most common being persistent vomiting (21 of 33, 64%), abdominal pain (15, 45%), and mucosal bleeding (14, 42%). The leading diagnoses during the first visit were dengue, viral syndrome, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infection. At the first visit, 17 (35%) were admitted to the hospital, 7 (14%) were transferred to another hospital, 7 (14%) died in the ED, and 18 (37%) were discharged home. Of those transferred to another hospital, six (86%) were admitted and died in the ICU, and one died in the ED.\nAmong the 18 case-patients discharged home after their first visit, seven (39%) had at least one recorded warning sign, including compensated shock or hemorrhagic manifestations. Median age was 36.6 years (range 0.6\u201374.9), 14 (78%) were female, and 16 (89%) had at least one chronic medical condition. Two died at home after being discharged; diagnoses of dengue and moderate dehydration, and acute gastroenteritis. The remaining 16 returned to a hospital on average 2 days (range 0.0\u20133.5 days) after discharge. Nine (56%) died during their second visit, four (25%) were transferred to another facility, and three (19%) were again discharged home.\nOverall, the median interval between illness onset and death was 7.1 days (range: 1.2\u201328.4 days); in six (10%) cases the interval exceeded 14 days. Most (43, 74%) case-patients died as an inpatient in a hospital; however, 12 (21%) died in the Emergency Department prior to hospital admission, and three (5%) died at home: one after a 2-day hospitalization, and two after being seen in an ED (Table 4). Of the 43 case-patients who died after being admitted, 33 (57%) died in the intensive care unit, and 10 (17%) died in an inpatient ward. The median interval from hospital admission to death was 1.9 days (range: 0.1\u201328.8 days).\nOnly 25 of 58 (43%) fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients had dengue, DHF, DSS, or dengue-like syndrome listed as primary (17 cases) or contributing (8 cases) cause of death on their death certificate. The five most common primary causes of death included dengue (29%), viral syndrome (16%), cardiorespiratory failure (12%), sepsis (9%), and thrombocytopenia (5%).\n\n\nClinical Outcomes Among Fatal Laboratory-Positive Dengue Case-Patients\nMost of the 55 laboratory-positive dengue case-patients who died in hospital had signs and symptoms consistent with dengue (86%) or severe dengue (82%), but only 62% had that clinical diagnosis (Table 4). Of those who met criteria for severe dengue by the time of death, 38 of 45 (84%) had severe plasma leakage, 25 (56%) had severe bleeding, and 22 (49%) had severe organ impairment. Of note, hemoconcentration was documented in only a few case-patients even when hematocrits were performed over time. However, 34 (62%) case-patients who died in hospital had an effusion and most (62%) case-patients with effusions had acute respiratory failure or ARDS (Table 5).\nThe majority of case-patients who died in a hospital (86%) were bleeding, and 25 (46%) had severe bleeding: 19 (35%) gastrointestinal, 14 (26%) pulmonary, six (11%) vaginal, and six (11%) intracranial (Table 5). Of those with severe bleeding, 14 (56%) received a platelet transfusion while 11 (44%) received a blood transfusion; blood transfusion was more likely to occur with increased hospital stay (median 5.2 vs. 1.3 days, respectively; P <0.001). Of the 26 case-patients who received a platelet transfusion, three (12%) had no recorded bleeding. The best predictor of platelet transfusion was low platelet count [median 13,000 (range: 7,000\u201337,000) vs. 55,000 (range: 8,000\u2013224,000) cells/mm3, recipients versus non-recipients, respectively; P <0.001].\nOther severe clinical outcomes among the 55 laboratory-positive dengue case-patients who died in hospital included acute hepatitis (76%), acute renal failure (18%), cholecystitis (9%), acute liver failure (9%), myocarditis (4%), metabolic acidosis (66%), prolonged shock (53%), and acute respiratory failure (55%) (Table 5). All received intravenous crystalloids, 40% received a diuretic, and 29% received intravenous colloids. Twenty-five (45%; all adults) received intravenous corticosteroids. Those given steroids had a lower median platelet count than those not given steroids (16,000 vs. 47,000 cells/mm3; respectively, P <0.01), and were three times more likely to have a hospital acquired infection (75% vs. 25%, P <0.05).",
    "Discussion": "Enhanced surveillance for dengue deaths showed the majority were not reported to the standard dengue surveillance system and most did not have \u201cdengue\u201d coded on the death certificate. Identification of these unrecognized deaths resulted in a 2 to 3-fold higher dengue mortality rate than previously reported [14, 17, 20, 21, 48, 49]. EFASS demonstrated the importance of appropriate diagnostic testing of tissue and serum to make the correct diagnosis in deaths from a dengue-like acute febrile illness. In addition, EFASS showed its ability to identify unrecognized deaths from other pathogens of public health importance.\nThe EFASS estimated age-specific annual dengue mortality rates were comparable to those from other infectious diseases in the US, including influenza [50, 51]. However, in contrast to influenza, most dengue deaths occurred among adults 19\u201364 years of age. The estimated average annual influenza-associated US death rate is 2.4 per 100,000 residents (range: 0.4\u20135.1). In most years, 88% of these deaths are among persons aged \u226565 years [51, 52]; 17.0 deaths per 100,000 (range: 2.4\u201336.7). Influenza death rates among persons <19 years and 19\u201364 years are 0.1 (range: 0.1\u20130.3) and 0.4 (range: 0.1\u20130.8) per 100,000, respectively. In comparison, EFASS estimated that dengue mortality in 2010 was 0.42, 1.17, and 1.66 per 100,000 persons aged <19 years, 19\u201364 years and \u226565 years, respectively.\nMost fatal laboratory-positive dengue case-patients appeared to have timely access to healthcare. However, many (~40%) were sent home after their first ED visit with warning signs of severe dengue. Although the majority sought care again within 48 hours, two died at home. Most case-patients who died in a hospital had severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, or both, and most received inotropes and half received a platelet transfusion. Although bleeding was present in the majority who received platelets, half of those with severe bleeding did not receive red blood cells. A large proportion of case-patients received corticosteroids, which are not considered of benefit in dengue [2, 53]. As reported by others, we found an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections in these patients [54, 55].\nDengue deaths often occur among patients with comorbidities [14, 19]. Nearly half of case-patients were obese and over half had more than one chronic medical condition; prevalences similar to those found in the Puerto Rican adult population [47, 56], with the exception of diabetes and asthma. The prevalence of diabetes in case-patients was nearly four times that of the adult population, and asthma was twice as prevalent. Adult diabetics have been over-represented in other fatal case series [19, 57], and a recent meta-analysis found diabetes was associated with increased risk of severe dengue [58]. As many endemic areas have reported a substantial proportion of dengue cases in adults, healthcare providers should be attentive to dengue patients with these comorbidities [2].\nSome patients developed acute liver or renal failure or had atypical presentations [19, 57, 59, 60]. Acute renal failure (ARF) affected ~20% of case-patients though none had pre-existing renal disease and 80% were non-elderly (median age 49 years). However, dengue patients with severe dengue, diabetes or secondary infections are known to be at risk for developing acute kidney injury [61]. Six of the ten ARF cases had at least one risk factor and two were co-infected with Leptospira spp. One of the four ARF case-patients without risk factors was an infant with abdominal compartment syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction.\nWhile more sensitive than PDSS, EFASS may not have detected all fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases. For example, a few rural municipalities had fewer deaths than expected. In the case of Patillas, this may have been due to higher dengue case-reporting to PDSS because of an enhanced dengue surveillance project conducted prior to EFASS [62]. Alternatively, individuals in rural municipalities who died at home and were not known to have an AFI would not have been identified. These factors may have led to lower case ascertainment and estimated dengue mortality. Although we increased the proportion of suspect cases with an etiologic diagnosis by obtaining tissue and convalescent serum specimens, about one quarter of cases were dengue laboratory-indeterminate, and were not counted as fatal laboratory-positive dengue cases even if dengue was listed on their death certificate. Hence, our final dengue mortality estimate should be considered conservative.\nEFASS demonstrated the feasibility and importance of enhanced surveillance for dengue deaths, and found a previously unrecognized high dengue mortality in Puerto Rico that was higher than rates observed in other dengue endemic regions during this time period [9\u201314]. Establishment of EFASS-like systems in selected dengue endemic countries would go a long way towards obtaining robust estimates of the global burden of deaths due to dengue, and identify areas for improvement in clinical care of patients with severe dengue."
