The bacteria Coxiella burnetii has a widespread distribution and causes illness in both humans and livestock (Q Fever), including long-term effects in a proportion of cases. Despite a recent resurgence in interest in a European context, there is a significant lack of understanding of the prevalence of exposure, burden of disease, or epidemiological risk factors in low-income settings. Our study provides much needed new evidence, reporting seroprevalence in a linked human and cattle population in western Kenya and identifying factors associated with increased seroprevalence in humans and cattle within this setting. Our results indicate that environmental factors may play a role in patterns of exposure in cattle populations in western Kenya, where cattle in areas with less rainfall were more likely to have evidence of previous exposure to the bacteria. However, human exposure is more likely to be influenced by livestock contact patterns. In addition, cattle brought onto a homestead following purchase at a market or another homestead had higher seroprevalence than those bred on the homestead. Further research on the role of livestock markets in disease spread is required and may form the basis for the future development of Q Fever control measures.
