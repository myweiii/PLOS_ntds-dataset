The current ZIKV outbreak is a major public health concern in the Americas. To further understand the virus, and to develop tools and potentially vaccines, more information on the virus strains circulating in the Americas is required. Here we describe the full-length sequence of a ZIKV isolate from a patient with classical symptoms, including the complete non-coding regions which are missing from many currently available sequences, and put these in context. Moreover, we also demonstrate the production of an RNA molecule derived from the 3â€™ untranslated region that counteracts interferon responses and may therefore be important for understanding the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection.
