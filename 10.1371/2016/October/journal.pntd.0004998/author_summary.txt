Envenoming caused by Bothrops snakes is characterized by drastic local tissue damage involving hemorrhage, blistering, myonecrosis, prominent inflammatory response and intense pain. The most effective treatment for Bothrops snakebites is antivenom therapy, which is very efficient in reversing systemic effects of envenomation but not the severe local effects. Thus, there exists a need to find novel complementary therapies that may further assist in the prevention or even counteract the severe local effects of bothrops snakebite. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of photobiomodulation in reducing local effects induced by Bothropic venoms, however its mechanisms still remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of photobiomodulation in reducing BmV-induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as part of the mechanisms involved in such effect. Results demonstrate that photobiomodulation reduces venom-induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia and this effect depends on a decrease of nociceptor activation at the spinal cord level and by a modulation of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines as well as kinin receptors at mRNA transcriptional levels. These findings make phtobiomodulation a promising candidate to be associated to antivenom therapy for the treatment of the local response induced by Bothrops venoms.
