Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes serious illness in both animals and humans. RVFV is transmitted by direct contact with infectious tissues or by the bites of infected mosquito species of the Aedes and Culex genuses. Its distribution in tropical forests in central Africa is poorly documented. We assessed the current circulation of RVFV among livestock and humans in the Central African Republic (CAR) by detecting anti-RVFV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in sheep, cattle and goats and in people living in Bangui who were considered at risk. We also sequenced the complete genomes of two local strains, one isolated in 1969 from mosquitoes and one isolated in 1985 from humans living in forested areas. Sheep were the most frequently infected ruminants. IgM antibodies were found only during the rainy season; the frequency of IgG antibodies did not differ according to season. No evidence of recent RVFV infection was found in humans at risk; however, 16.7% had evidence of past infection. Phylogenetic analysis showed a perfect match of CAR strains with the East/Central African cluster. Our results confirm current circulation of RVFV in CAR. Further studies should be conducted to determine the vectors involved and the virus reservoirs.
