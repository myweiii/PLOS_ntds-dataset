Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a fatal tropical disease endemic in parts of Southwest Asia and Northern Australia. While it was once believed to be isolated to these areas, recent research indicates the global burden on melioidosis is growing. Furthermore, treatment of melioidosis is difficult because of the high occurrence of disease relapse and increasing antibacterial resistance. Recent research suggests that immunomodulation via COX-2 inhibition to subsequently reduce with PGE2 production is an effective therapeutic strategy for melioidosis. The current study was built on this immunomodulatory principle by using an orally administered COX-2 inhibitor and evaluating its effects on the COX-2 and NF-Ä¸B pathways. We also investigated whether the conjunctive therapies of immunomodulation and antibiotics increased efficacy of the treatment. We confirmed immunomodulation is effective as a post-exposure therapeutic in BALB/c mice. More importantly, we found that conjunctive post-exposure treatment via immunomodulation increased antibacterial treatment efficacy. Conjunctive therapy may prove efficacious for other infectious diseases resembling melioidosis. Hence, further research is needed to identify the long-term effects of the described treatment(s) across multiple animal models.
