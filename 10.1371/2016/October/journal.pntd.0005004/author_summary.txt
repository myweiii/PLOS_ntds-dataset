Emerging and neglected zoonoses are an important global threat to public health. Host range, in particular, is a crucial factor in determining disease risk and the potential for adequate interventions. Here we show that Leishmania has a very wide host range and that Complex Inference Networks can be used to infer ecological relationships in the context of zoonoses, identifying both the potential hosts and their relative importance. These results substantially change the risk profile and potential control measures that can be used to combat the disease, allowing for the design of more efficient surveillance measures and a better understanding of potential dispersal scenarios.
