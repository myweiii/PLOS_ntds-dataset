Dengue is an emerging infectious disease of global significance. Unsuspected dengue among children and adults presenting with undifferentiated fever in western Nicaragua has not been studied. We prospectively studied patients â‰¥ 1 year of age who presented with acute febrile illness in Nicaragua and systematically collected detailed information about exposures and features of the illness as well as serum to confirm acute infections. Overall, 470 (63.5%) had evidence of prior infection with dengue virus; the proportion with antibodies against dengue virus increased with age and reached >90% in those >20 years. Thirty-eight (5.1%) had acute dengue (serotypes 1 and 2) infection. Only 8.1% (3/37) cases were suspected clinically to be dengue. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua and strikes predominantly those in child-bearing years, the same individuls at risk for devastating complications associated with Zika virus infection that is also transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
