The high fatality and burden of rabies stands in contrast to the very low performance of laboratory-based surveillance in resource-challenged countries. The absence of reliable human and animal rabies incidence data ultimately result in neglect of disease prevention and control and the perpetuation of RABV transmission despite the existence of powerful management tools. Rapid, easy to perform rabies diagnostic tests that do not require expensive equipment or special storage conditions, which can be reliably performed by trained ordinary veterinary professionals, are needed urgently for use in low income countries. Such novel methods will help to accurately assess the global rabies burden and are necessary to monitor rabies control and elimination. The present study evaluates the performance and reliability of a rapid, easy to use rabies diagnostic tool. Overall, the validated test was in high accordance with the standard reference method for the detection of RABV by immunofluorescence microscopy and showed even higher reliability when applied in resource poor laboratory conditions. The obtained results support the high potential for the use of this test in the field but suggest a change of the original technical protocol and a need for wider validation.
