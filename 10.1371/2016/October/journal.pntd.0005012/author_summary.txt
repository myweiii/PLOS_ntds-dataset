Cameroon achieved the elimination of leprosy in 2000, however, a number of areas in the country continue to report high numbers of cases. We conducted this study to assess the burden of leprosy in Cameroon from 2000 to 2014. We obtained and analysed leprosy data for this period from the National Control Programme. After elimination in 2000, the leprosy prevalence rate continued dropping, to reach 0.20/10,000 population (78% reduction) in 2014. Similarly, the new case detection rate dropped to 1.46/100,000 population (85.3% reduction) in 2014. All 10 regions of Cameroon achieved leprosy elimination by 2014; however, 10 health districts were still to do so. Using the new leprosy burden concept of analysis, the number of high-leprosy-burden regions decreased from 8 in 2000 to 1 in 2014, meanwhile 18 health districts remained high-leprosy-burdened at the end of 2014. In conclusion, leprosy prevalence and detection rates as well as the overall leprosy burden in Cameroon have dropped significantly between 2000 and 2014. However, a good number of health districts remain high-leprosy-burdened. The National Leprosy Control Programme should focus efforts on these health districts in the next coming years in order to further reduce the disease burden in the country.
