To control malaria, there is an urgent need for applying innovative diagnostics and new technologies. Nanoparticles can augment detection of malaria at lower parasite levels while providing fast and simple methodology. Novel use of MSP10 and gold nanoparticles to identify Plasmodium vivaxâ€™s DNA in urine can be utilized as screening tool with global application potentials. The proposed test could impact the control of the most common species of malaria in low resource settings as it could present a simple, fast, cheap and easy to interpret test. Furthermore, utilizing urine instead of blood eliminates the need for finger-prick which would increase safety profile and likely increase participation rate in mass screening programs.
