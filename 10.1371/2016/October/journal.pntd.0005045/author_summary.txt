For the first time in 100 years, in October 2010, cholera caused by toxigenic strains of V. cholerae was introduced in Haiti. Conventional and genetic analysis revealed that a single clone of V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa strain was brought to Haiti by Nepalese Peace-Keeping troops. These troops arrived in January of that year to provide humanitarian assistance following Haitiâ€™s deadliest earthquake. Subsequently our team has monitored the cholera epidemic by acquiring clinical and environmental samples to assess whether or not the pathogen was able to establish its environmental reservoirs within the country, and whether V. cholerae could undergo evolutionary changes in order to adapt to the stressors imparted by human gastrointestinal tract and environmental aquatic reservoirs. In this study we show that over the past 5 years the initially-introduced and circulating V. cholerae Ogawa serotype has significantly shifted to Inaba serotype by sustaining multiple mutations in wbeT gene, the gene known to mediate serotype shift. Our findings suggest that the new Inaba serotype may be replacing the Ogawa serotype in order to evade Ogawa-induced host immunity and thereby causing cholera potentially among individuals who may previously have suffered from cholera. Our study highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring of cholera in Haiti.
