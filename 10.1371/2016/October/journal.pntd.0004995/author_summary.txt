Dengue is a globally emerging cause of fever that is caused by four serotypes of virus (DENV1-4). Since the 1960s, dengue in Sri Lanka has been documented primarily along the heavily urbanized western coast. Outbreaks from 2005â€“2008 were attributed to a new type of DENV-3 and more recently to a newly introduced type of DENV-1. Having identified serotypes other than DENV-1 as an important cause of fever in southern Sri Lanka in 2007, our prospective surveillance in 2012 enabled detection and characterization of an epidemic of dengue that caused 388 (39.8%) hospitalizations for fever. DENV-1 accounted for 91.2% of 351 virologically confirmed cases; isolates were most closely related to sequences described from China and Southeast Asia, not nearby India. Acute dengue was associated with self-reported rural residence, travel, and rainfall. Emergence of DENV-1 as the foremost serotype in the densely populated but agrarian southern Sri Lanka highlights the changing epidemiology of dengue and need for continued surveillance and prevention.
