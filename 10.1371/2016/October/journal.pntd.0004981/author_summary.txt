The first dengue outbreak in Kenya was reported in 1982 in the coastal region. This was followed almost 30 years later by the 2011 dengue outbreak in Mandera, northern Kenya and subsequently in Mombasa city in the coastal region (2013â€“2014). An entomologic investigation was conducted to establish the density of mosquito species causing the outbreak. Affected parts of Mombasa city were identified with the help of public health officials. Adult mosquitoes were collected using various tools, processed and screened for dengue virus. All indoor and outdoor containers in every accessible house and compound within affected suburbs were inspected for Ae. aegypti immatures. Over 2,000 adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected and 192 houses and 1,676 containers inspected for Ae. aegypti immatures. Although jerry cans (18%) and drums (17%) were the most productive, there was site-specificity in container type productivity. Therefore all containers would be targeted for effective control of the dengue vector, including proper covering of water storage containers and eliminating all discarded outdoor containers through a public environmental clean-up exercise. However, providing reliable piped water to all households in Mombasa city would be a long-term solution to reduce the risk of dengue transmission.
