Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus that causes an acute febrile illness that often occurs with severe joint pain. The virus first arrived in the Western Hemisphere in late 2013 and has since caused epidemics in much of the Caribbean and the Americas. During the first months of the 2014 epidemic in Puerto Rico, we conducted household-based cluster investigations to identify factors associated with chikungunya virus infection and progression to disease. We found that using air conditioning and citronella candles in and around the home were associated with decreased rates of infection. Symptoms significantly associated with chikungunya virus infection included fever, joint pain, skin rash, and arthritis. Less than one-quarter of participants infected with chikungunya virus that sought medical care were diagnosed with chikungunya and one-in-ten were reported to public health authorities. This investigation demonstrates the importance of household-level behavioral interventions to avoid chikungunya virus infection, as well as the need for rapid diagnostic tests to improve identification of chikungunya patients.
