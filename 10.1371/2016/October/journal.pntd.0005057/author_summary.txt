Schistosomiasis is a major health problem that affects over 200 million people. Symptomatic acute schistosomiasis is a systemic reaction to the worms and eggs in individuals from non-endemic areas after a primary infection. Tourists, military personnel and people who practice water sports are at risk. Although most cases resolve 90 days post infection, severe cases with massive distribution of eggs can be fatal. It is frequently misdiagnosed, under diagnosed or has delayed diagnosis because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific and eggs are usually present in stool only 6 weeks post-infection. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acute schistosomiasis are not fully elucidated and currently there is a lack of noninvasive biomarkers to diagnose this form of disease. We report that serum osteopontin levels are increased in patients with acute schistosomiasis and parallel the clinical symptoms, returning to baseline level once the granulomas were modulated and the symptoms resolve. Soluble egg antigens provoke macrophages to produce osteopontin, recruiting more macrophages to the site of injury and inducing the granulomatous reaction. This observation suggests that osteopontin plays an important role in acute schistosomiasis mansoni and could be a novel non-invasive biomarker for this form of the disease.
