Despite the advances in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) vaccine development, progress in developing P. vivax (Pv) vaccines lags far behind. Immunization via mosquito bites with Pf radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) has been the gold standard model for induction of sterile protection against malaria infection and has allowed the study of the complex mechanisms of immunity. The first trials using PfRAS were performed in the late 1960â€™s, and thereafter greatly contributed to the development of vaccines against Pf. However, PvRAS immunization in humans has only been carried out in two volunteers since 1974. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial using significant numbers of volunteers for PvRAS immunization. Our findings confirm that immunization with PvRAS is safe, immunogenic and induces sterile immunity in 42% of the volunteers. It demonstrates that it is possible to induce sterile protection with PvRAS as seen with PfRAS and confirms that immunity against the PvCS protein (IgG1 levels) correlates with protection. Research findings and reagents generated in this study are expected to yield insights on key immune determinants of sterile protection against Pv, which may guide the development of a cost-effective vaccine against this parasite species.
