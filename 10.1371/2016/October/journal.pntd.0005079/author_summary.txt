The Belgian Red Cross-Flanders develops first aid guidelines that specifically target laypeople. In the context of updating the first aid guidelines for sub-Saharan Africa, we aimed to summarize the best available evidence for the treatment of snakebite, feasible for laypeople. Of the numerous first aid measures supported in literature and used in practice, we could only find evidence concerning effectiveness for the pressure immobilization technique on the spread of snake venom, which involves application of a firm pressure bandage on the bitten limb, together with immobilization of the limb. However, studies concerning its feasibility suggest this technique is difficult for laypeople to apply correctly. Keeping the limb immobilized on the other hand had a beneficial effect on the spread of the venom. However, given the low to very low quality of the evidence, high quality trials concerning the effectiveness and feasibility of different variations of the pressure immobilization technique are needed.
