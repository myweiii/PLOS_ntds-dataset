Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a sequela of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that appears after patients have apparently been cured of visceral leishmaniasis; even been reported in patients without a history of VL. Previous clinical and epidemiological data ascertains the main risk factor associated with the development of PKDL is previous treatment for VL with antimonials (SSG); however, PKDL also occurs after treatment with other drugs like paromomycin, miltefosine etc. Here, in light of the risk of arsenic-associated dermal manifestations, we hypothesized that the long term exposure to groundwater arsenic acts as an additional risk factor for development of PKDL in patients treated for VL with SSG or other drugs. Using a cohort, we retrospectively assessed the risk of arsenic in development of PKDL in treated VL patients. Our findings support a significant association and prompts parasites might persist successfully in individuals over-exposed to arsenic and may exhibit features of dermatotropism leading to development of PKDL after treatment for VL. Further research is needed to dissect the mechanistic role of arsenic on VL, as well as PKDL development.
