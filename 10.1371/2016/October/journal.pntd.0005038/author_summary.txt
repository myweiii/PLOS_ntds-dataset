Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus, which is primarily transmitted by Culex species mosquitoes and a leading cause of pediatric encephalitis in Asia. JEV is also an important public health threat to countries outside the endemic region because collections of Cx. quinquefasciatus from around the world have demonstrated competence for the transmission of JEV and are capable of establishing enzootic transmission cycles between viremic avian and swine species. In the last two decades, the dominantly circulating genotype of JEV in endemic regions has experienced a significant shift (genotype III to Genotype I). It is unclear if the newly dominant circulating G1-b genotype can still be vectored by Cx. quinquefasciatus. In this study, Cx. quinquefasciatus collected from North America was demonstrated to be competent for the transmission of the newly dominant genotype. Different infectivities observed between the endemic strains and non-endemic strain provides the mechanistic knowledge of the selection and emergence of endemic genotypes after continuous viral evolution.
