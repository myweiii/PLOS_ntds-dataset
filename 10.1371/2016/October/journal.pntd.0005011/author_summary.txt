In the absence of vaccines and escalating resistance to the available chemotherapeutic drugs, alternate therapeutic options are urgently needed for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar, a systemic and potentially fatal, vector-borne neglected tropical disease, caused by Leishmania donovani. In the present study, we explored the two-prong effect of eugenol emulsion (EE) in eliminating the parasites with synergistic boosting of the dampened immune system, characteristic of active disease. Infected BALB/c mice upon intraperitoneal administration of EE, exhibited a significant decline in liver and spleen parasite load with concomitant drop in splenomegaly. Protection in treated mice coincided with Th1 immunopotentiation as was evident from substantial DTH and lymphoproliferative responses, elevated levels of IgG2a over IgG1 isotypes, significant enhancement in IFN-Î³ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, waning levels of IL-4 and IL-10, augmented nitrite levels, induction of immunological memory and stimulation of antigen presenting capacity of macrophages, compared to infected mice. The dual antileishmanial and immunostimulatory potential of EE with no adverse toxic effects validates it as an adjunct to chemotherapy that may aid in leishmanicidal activity via ameliorating the depressed cellular immunity.
