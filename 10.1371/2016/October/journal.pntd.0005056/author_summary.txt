Infection with the sand flea Tunga penetrans causes severe disease in humans and animals. There are no validated drugs for treatment of animal tungiasis preventing implementation of integrated tungiasis control interventions targeting human and animal infections. A field trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a commercial insecticidal aerosol containing chlorfenvinphos 4.8%, dichlorphos 0.75%, and gentian violet 0.145%, which is licensed to treat tick infestations, myiasis and wound sepsis, on tungiasis in pigs, the major animal reservoir in rural hyperendemic villages in Uganda. Infected pigs were recruited and randomly assigned to treatment (n = 29) and control (n = 26) groups. Seven days after a single application of the aerosol onto the affected body parts, almost 60% of the treated pigs were cured while all control pigs had at least one penetrated sand flea. The number of viable sand fleas and the severity of the tungiasis were significantly lower in the treated pigs than in the controls. This demonstrates for the first time that a simple and effective topical treatment for animal tungiasis based on two organophosphate insecticides and an antibacterial agent can be used to cure individual animals and can be integrated in tungiasis control campaigns.
