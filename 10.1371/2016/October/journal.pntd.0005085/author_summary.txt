Neglected tropical diseases are a group of parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that are often co-endemic in low resource settings. Five of these diseases (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminths, and trachoma) are addressed specifically through a method called mass drug administration, where entire at risk populations are targeted with preventative drug treatments. Because of the geographical and interventional overlap between these diseases, many experts recommend program integration as a method for accelerating their control or elimination. However the optimal approaches for operationalizing integrated programing has not been systematically assessed. We undertook a cross sectional qualitative research study with neglected tropical disease stakeholders to understand different stakeholder approaches to and perspectives on program integration. The stakeholders highlighted different definitions of the term “integration”, the differential effectiveness of specific activities when integrated, the influence of integration on community member engagement, the influence of funders on integrated programming, facilitators and barriers to effective integration, and the effects of integration on health system strength. Our analysis suggests that there are three types of integration to consider: structural, process, and technical. We use these categories to make ten recommendations to stakeholders that might be used to improve integrated neglected tropical disease programming moving forward.
