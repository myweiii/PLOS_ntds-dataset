Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is the most common form of leishmaniasis in Tunisia. The disease is not severe and heal spontaneously with a definitive scar causing a social impact mainly when the lesion occurs in the face. Yet, few studies have addressed these psychological and psychosocial effects. To examine these issues among Tunisian women suffering from ZCL, we administered Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), World Health Organization Quality Of Life-26 (WHOQOL-26) and Psoriasis Life Stress Inventory (PLSI) to a group of girls and women with ZCL scars in the region of Sidi Bouzid. This study demonstrated the wide range of psychological effects (anxiety, psychological distress, lack of self-confidence and self-esteem, frustration, etc…) and psychosocial impacts (stigma, rejection, discrimination in the social and professional setting, etc…) of ZCL permanent scars; mainly when it is located in the face; among women and girls. This study suggests the need of social and psychological support and professional integration for women and girls in rural remote areas first and second conducts studies on ways to establish control measures for ZCL, mainly in vulnerable exposed population.
