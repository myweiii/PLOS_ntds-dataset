Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia in humans with an estimated 68,000 cases annually. The disease is considered a mainly rural one because it occurs mainly in rural areas dominated by paddy fields where the main mosquito species vector of JEV breed. However, other mosquito species, breeding in urban areas, and a large range of animal hosts can play a role in the transmission of JEV, and JEV could therefore be transmitted in peri-urban and urban areas. Our results show an intensive circulation of JEV in sentinel pigs in a peri-urban area of Phnom Penh Cambodia at two different periods of the year. It shows the potential for JEV to circulate in a large range of landscapes and suggest that JEV control should not be limited to rural areas and that JEV may have the potential to emerge and be and be maintained in new areas.
