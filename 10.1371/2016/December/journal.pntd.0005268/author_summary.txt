Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a key event of liver fibrosis. Induction of activated HSCs apoptosis and inhibition of activated HSCs proliferation are the common anti-fibrotic strategies to block liver fibrosis. The induction of senescence of HSCs is responsible for the clearance of the activated HSCs as well. Senescence of HSCs is mediated by exposure to soluble egg antigens (SEA) of Schistosoma japonicum via STAT3/P53/P21 pathway. In this study, we found that SEA induced the senescence of HSCs, accompanied with the increased the expression of P27 protein and the decreased expression of SKP2 and FoxO3a. Either knockdown of P27 or overexpression of SKP2 alleviates the SEA-induced senescence of HSCs. Moreover, SEA droved the nuclear translocation of FoxO3a from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Hence, the present study demonstrates that SEA promotes HSCs senescence through the FoxO3a/SKP2/P27 pathway.
