Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease that affects people in sub-Saharan Africa. There are two stages of the infection. The first stage involves parasites proliferating in the bloodstream following introduction via the bite of an infected tsetse fly. The second, more serious stage, involves parasite invasion and proliferation within the central nervous system causing characteristic disturbances to the patientsâ€™ sleep wake patterns and progressive appearance of other neurological signs, including walking disabilities behaviour changes, abnormal movements, incontinence, then ultimately coma and death. Drugs are available to treat both stages of the disease, but the drugs for stage 2 disease have serious side effects and must be administered in hospital settings. Stage determination is thus a key element for disease management. Currently staging involves microscopic evaluation of CSF following a lumbar puncture. Here, we have analysed the metabolome of CSF, blood and urine of patients to seek biomarkers to stage the disease based on these biofluids. CSF and blood fluids were found to have distinctive metabolic biomarkers and when several of these metabolites are combined, a sensitive and robust discriminatory staging test can be developed. Some CSF metabolic markers relate to brain inflammation, whilst others may be related to somnolence associated with the disease in stage 2 patients, which may also help in understanding disease progression. Interestingly, distinctive biomarkers were also found in plasma, potentially abrogating the need for diagnostic lumbar punctures in the future.
