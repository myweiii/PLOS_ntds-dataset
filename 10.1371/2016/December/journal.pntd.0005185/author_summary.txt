Rickettsial infections and Q fever cause illness characterized by fever and non-specific symptoms and signs. Not only are these infections difficult to recognize, they are also difficult to diagnose because of limitations in existing tests for them. Despite sporadic reports, rickettsial infections and Q fever have not been prospectively studied in Central America. We enrolled consecutive patients presenting with undifferentiated fever in western Nicaragua and collected data regarding potential risk factors as well as symptoms and signs associated with the illnesses. Additionally, we collected blood samples at the initial visit and 2 to 4 weeks thereafter. We used serologic assays to differentiate new (rising antibody titers) vs. old (stable antibody titers) infections. Characteristics associated with both acute and past infection were assessed. We enrolled 825 patients and identified acute (new) rickettsial infections and acute Q fever in 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Clinical features were non-specific and neither rickettsial infections nor Q fever were considered nor treated. Further study is warranted to define the burden of these infections in Central America.
