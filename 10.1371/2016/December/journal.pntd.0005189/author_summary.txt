Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is known for its ability to cause explosive outbreaks of flu-like illness followed by severe joint pain and swelling, which can persist for months to several years. We tested patient serum of both suspected and unsuspected chikungunya fever (CHIKF) cases collected at an emergency clinic in La Romana, Dominican Republic for markers of current or recent CHIKV infection, and showed through next generation sequencing that the causative CHIKV strain is closely related to other isolates from the Americas. After matching clinical outcomes with diagnostic data, we found that relatively few CHIKF patients presented with the joint symptoms typically associated with CHIKV infection in the past, which likely contributed to a notable frequency of CHIKF misdiagnosis. Other deviations from Old World CHIKF outbreaks were also discovered, including shifts in affected age groups and in the frequency of respiratory signs and symptoms. These data are particularly important for improving future surveillance endeavors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of CHIKF in the Americas.
