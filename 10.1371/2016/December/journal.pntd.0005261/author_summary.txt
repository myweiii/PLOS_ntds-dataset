Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin and soft tissue infection possibly leading to deformities and long term consequences with severe impact on patients’ lives. It is one of the neglected tropical diseases. The current research agenda is created solely by health professionals, whereas patients might indicate different priorities. Therefore we conducted qualitative research on former patients’ experience with the BU management and on the priorities for the research agenda as envisaged by patients. We found that the preferences of former patients appeared generally in agreement with the international research agenda. Additionally, they indicated that additional preventive measures, better accessibility to care and pain management were important subjects for them. More counselling and social support in the form of community-based rehabilitation were expected to contribute in dealing with the impact of the disease and to enlarge a public platform for support. For clinical management we found that more information on the disease appears necessary, since former patients indicate they did not know much about the course of treatment and expected side-effects. Involving patients can improve BU management and its research agenda.
