Blocking the transmission of malaria from infected individuals to mosquitoes is an appealing approach to malaria elimination. However, at present there is no reliable experimental model to test the efficacy of transmission blocking interventions. In this study, we assessed the safety and reproducibility of our clinical trial model, in which we inject blood cells infected with malaria parasites into healthy volunteers. Furthermore, we tested if our clinical trial model could be used as a tool to evaluate malaria transmission. We infected healthy volunteers with Plasmodium vivax parasites and monitored parasite growth by molecular methods. When we detected the parasite stage that is infective to mosquitoes (the sexual stage), blood from infected volunteers was fed to mosquitoes. Then, we investigated the presence of parasites in the midgut of mosquitoes. The results from this study show that our clinical trial model is safe and reproducible. Moreover, we observed low levels of transmission of the malaria parasite from infected volunteers to mosquitoes. We need to validate this finding and to optimize it to increase the rate of malaria transmission. Altogether, our clinical trial model seems to be a reliable system to assess interventions to block malaria transmission, which has enormous public health significance.
