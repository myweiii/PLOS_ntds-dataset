Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus whose global distribution and disease incidence has increased in recent decades. In the Middle East and North Africa, the epidemiology of dengue remains poorly characterized despite increasing reports of outbreaks and transmission in new areas. In order to understand the evidence supporting the epidemiology of this virus in the region and the areas in need of further research, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting human prevalence, incidence, and infection rates in the virusâ€™ main mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Among the studies identified, the Red Sea subregion and Pakistan reported the highest seroprevalence estimates for dengue. However, we encountered substantial heterogeneity in the distribution, quality, and quantity of published studies. These findings inform future research and surveillance priorities for DENV in the MENA region.
