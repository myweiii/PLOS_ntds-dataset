Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease. Pathogenic species of Leptospira are excreted in urine from asymptomatic carrier hosts which facilitates disease transmission to new hosts. To date, there are 10 species of pathogenic leptospires which comprise more than 200 serovars. Disease transmission of these strains is maintained by a wide range of domestic and wild animal species. In this work, we discovered that an invasive mammalian species, the greater white toothed shrew, which was first identified in Ireland in 2007, acts as a carrier for a species of leptospires never before identified in Ireland. Results demonstrate that invasive mammalian species act as bridge vectors of novel zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira.
