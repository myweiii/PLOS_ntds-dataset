Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) are neglected tropical diseases caused by infection with filarial parasites, Onchocerca volvulus and Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia species respectively. Efforts to eliminate both diseases are through ivermectin-based mass drug administration (MDA) for onchocerciasis and MDA with albendazole and ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine for LF. Both diseases overlap significantly in Africa and years of ivermectin-based MDA for onchocerciasis in co-endemic areas may have decreased or interrupted W. bancrofti transmission. Senegal is co-endemic for both diseases. As of 2014, 37 LF endemic districts had not received specific treatment for LF; however, eight of these districts had been receiving ivermectin-based MDA for onchocerciasis for more than 10 years. Here we estimated, using an APOC onchocerciasis-related methodology, the status of LF and onchocerciasis in three districts of Senegal after more than 10 years of ivermectin-based MDA for onchocerciasis. We demonstrated the feasibility of integrated evaluation of LF and onchocerciasis. The results showed that W. bancrofti antigenemia prevalence in one district was â‰¥1%. In the districts where we did not detect LF antigenemia among the participants a more robust evaluation like a transmission assessment survey among children is still needed to determine if the infection rate for W. bancrofti is below the transmission threshold and MDAs for LF are not needed. Despite the small sample of children included in this study, the onchocerciasis antibody prevalence among them was above the threshold recommended to stop MDA. This study provides another example of the complexities that encompass stop MDA decision-making in onchocerciasis and LF co-endemic areas.
