Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that causes a fever. It can be severe or fatal. Understanding how many people get leptospirosis helps to determine priorities in allocating resources for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. There are few data about leptospirosis incidence in sub-Saharan African countries. The only mainland estimate is from northern Tanzania for the years 2007–08. To see if leptospirosis incidence had changed since 2007–08, we measured leptospirosis incidence in the same location in 2012–2014. To do this, we systematically approached people at two hospitals in the Kilimanjaro Region and tested them for leptospirosis. We adjusted the number of identified cases of leptospirosis found at the hospitals to account for people with fever who did not come to hospital for testing and care. We also adjusted for imperfect testing methods. We found that the number of people who developed leptospirosis annually had dropped from 75–102 cases per 100,000 people during 2007–08 to 11–18 cases per 100,000 people during 2012–14. Also, the subtype of leptospirosis responsible for the most cases during 2007–08 was not present during 2012–14. The number of people developing leptospirosis was not stable, highlighting the value of measuring how commonly leptospirosis occurs over several years.
