Although leprosy has been eliminated at the national level, but region wise eastern Nepal has still the higher number of leprosy cases. Early diagnosis and then timely treatment is very crucial to prevent disabilities due to leprosy. Slit-skin smear (SSS), the routine diagnostic method was compared with the molecular method polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of new clinically diagnosed cases at BPKIHS. PCR was found to be much more superior than SSS in its diagnostic efficacy detecting more than half number of cases missed by SSS. Moreover our finding of PCR in detection of early stages was nearly 50% where SSS are mostly negative on such spectrum. Therefore, this costly but sensitive diagnostic tool PCR was found to be a better option in detection of early cases of leprosy in comparison to SSS.
