Intestinal helminth and protozoan (parasitic) infections are found mainly in areas with warm, humid climates and in many developing countries. Bolivia currently has high parasite infection rates, including intestinal helminth and protozoan infections. Despite the high prevalence of parasitic infections, nationwide preventive measures for Bolivian children have not yet been implemented. Soil-transmitted helminth infection rates in Japan decreased sharply through practice of health education, mass stool examination and treatment. We investigated the effects of mass stool examination and treatment on parasitic infection rates in Bolivian children. Mass stool examination was performed using the formalin-ether medical sedimentation method between 2013 and 2015, and all infected children were administrated anthelminthic medicine within 2 months post-examination. During the study period, the overall infection rate decreased significantly, but Giardia intestinalis infection rate increased. This may have been related to the interval between treatment and examination. To decrease infection rates for all parasites, the treatment should be performed once or twice a year. Our results suggest that a program of mass stool examination and treatment could effectively reduce the overall parasite-infection rate in Bolivian children.
