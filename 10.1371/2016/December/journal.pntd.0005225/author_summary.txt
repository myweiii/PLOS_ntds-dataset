Schistosoma mansoni is the main species causing intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis worldwide and the snails of the genus Biomphalaria are best known for their role as intermediate hosts of the parasite. Molecular xenomonitoring for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites to detect the presence of schistosomes is an important point to consider for snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination. In our study, we have developed a new simple rapid LAMP assay to detect S. mansoni in Biomphalaria glabrata snails under different situations of infection: early prepatent period, light or low-grade infections and in snails pooled samples. Besides, a simple and rapid method for DNA extraction from snails' tissues was successfully used. This LAMP assay (named Biompha-LAMP) could be potentially useful for large-scale screening in searching infected snails with S. mansoni in field applicable conditions.
