Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infection causes a highly disfiguring, necrotic skin disease known as Buruli ulcer (BU). Antibiotic treatments have low efficacy if the infection is diagnosed after ulceration begins, leading to frequent dependence on surgical removal of infected tissues. A prophylactic vaccine for BU does not exist and several attempts to create an effective vaccine have shown limited success. We recently demonstrated that a recombinant strain of M. bovis BCG expressing the immunodominant MU-Ag85A conferred significantly enhanced protection against experimental BU compared to the standard BCG vaccine. Here we show that BCG expression of a fusion between two alternative MU antigens, Ag85B and EsxH, can promote antigen-specific T cell and humoral immune response capable of significantly improving survival and protection against BU pathology, compared to BCG MU-Ag85A alone. These results support the potential for using the highly safe and ubiquitous BCG vaccine as a platform for further BU vaccine development.
