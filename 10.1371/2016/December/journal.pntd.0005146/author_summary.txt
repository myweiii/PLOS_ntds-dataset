Chagas disease is caused by the infection of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and carries a significant tropical disease burden in the Western Hemisphere. The STOP CHAGAS study was a global clinical trial evaluating therapies for Chagas disease. PAXgene blood DNA tubes used by the study simplified and standardized the sample collection and processing procedures, but challenged published PCR assays that detect circulating T. cruzi. In this study, we report our effort of developing and validating a robust, sensitive and specific PCR assay for detecting T. cruzi in PAXgene blood specimens. The efficacy outcome results of the STOP CHAGAS study that utilized our assay further support the use of the PCR assay as a marker of therapeutic response for patients with Chagas disease.
