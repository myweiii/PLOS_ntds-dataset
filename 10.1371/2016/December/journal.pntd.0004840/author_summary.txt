Peculiarities of Island ecosystems make oceanic islands most suitable areas for analyzing how variations in local ecological conditions may impact on the intensity of arboviral transmission. The Comoros archipelago (2144 Km2) consists of four volcanic islands that are distant of 40â€“60 Km apart, located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. The three northern islands constitute the Union of Comoros that ranks amongst the least developed countries in the world. The geographic proximity to Africa exposes the Comoros archipelago to arboviral emergence as evidenced by a number of epidemics recorded in the last decades (i.e. dengue, chikungunya, and Rift Valley fever). Most interestingly, there is historical evidence that these epidemics have had contrasted courses and severity on the 3 islands of the Union of the Comoros, despite their cultural homogeneity and the frequent inter island mobility of people and livestock. Based on these observations, we conducted a serological investigation in order to delineate the risk to arboviral infection on the 3 islands of the Union of Comoros and assess whether it is relevant to all arboviral species or only to some of them. Our results confirm the differential exposure of the Comoros islands to the arboviral risk. The ecological and anthropological factors that may account for this contrasted epidemiology are discussed.
