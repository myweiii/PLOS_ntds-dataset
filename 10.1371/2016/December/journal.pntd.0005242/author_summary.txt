Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei infection, evolves from the first, haemolymphatic stage, to the second, meningoencephalitic stage. Classical knowledge sets the initiation of the second stage at the time of parasite invasion of the brain parenchyma; experimental findings have indicated that lymphocytes pave the way for this event. The disease leads to a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome, with sleep-wake alterations considered characteristic of the second stage. Staging criteria are still controversial and rely on cerebrospinal fluid examination. However, recent studies have questioned the route of parasite entry into the neuropil and even the occurrence of parasite neuroinvasion, as well as the correspondence of neurological signs and symptoms with the second stage of disease. In infected rats, we studied for the first time functional signs (body weight changes and sleep structure alterations) together with the presence of parasites and lymphocytes in the neuropil. The data show that parasites and lymphocytes invade the brain parenchyma over time, parasites cross blood vessels to enter the neuropil, and neurological features can precede these events. These findings question the cerebrospinal fluid criteria currently used for disease staging and focus attention on the importance of objective monitoring of clinical disease severity in sleeping sickness.
