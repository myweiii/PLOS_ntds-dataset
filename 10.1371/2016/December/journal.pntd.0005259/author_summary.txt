Cutaneous ulcers (CU) in children in yaws-endemic regions have long been attributed to Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue; however, recent studies show that Haemophilus ducreyi is an important cause of CU in these regions. H. ducreyi was once thought to cause only the genital ulcer (GU) disease chancroid; phylogenetically, GU strains belong to two distinct classes called class I and class II. We previously showed that CU strains obtained from Samoa, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea are genetically almost identical to class 1 GU strains. In this study, using published genomes from 11 additional CU strains from Ghana and Vanuatu, we show that CU strains diverged from both class I and class II GU strains and that multiple CU clones may circulate in endemic areas. These findings have implications for epidemiological typing and recovery of H. ducreyi strains from both CU and GU clinical samples.
