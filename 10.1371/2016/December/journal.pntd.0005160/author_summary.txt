More than 1 billion people are infected with blood protozoan diseases worldwide. The most common blood protozoa in humans, animals, and vectors include Plasmodium, Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Toxoplasma gondii and Babesia. Due to similar morphology among different blood protozoan species, misdiagnosis always occurs. Most molecular techniques are only carried out in laboratories, with a small number of samples detected simultaneously. Meanwhile, common detection methods may not be convenient for field investigation of large amounts of samples. In order to better manage blood protozoan infection, proper tools are required for the monitoring of these pathogens. Here, a comprehensive and sensitive DNA microarray was developed and tested, which allowed the parallel detection of 18 blood protozoan species.
