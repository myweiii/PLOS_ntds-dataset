Visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) caused by infection with L. donovani is a deadly parasitic disease that afflicts some of worldâ€™s poorest populations, including the people of the northern Bihar State of India. Once transmitted to a human by an infected sandfly, the L. donovani parasite migrates from the site of the sandfly bite throughout the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in high levels of infection in the spleen, liver and bone marrow that eventually lead to organ failure and death if not treated effectively. India, Nepal and Bangladesh are currently engaged in a program to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis, principally through early case detection, treatment and vector control. As humans are the only reservoir for L. donovani, it is necessary to understand how the disease is transmitted and specifically what role acute visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases, asymptomatic infections and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases play in transmission. We therefore performed a study to determine seroconversion for antibodies against the L. donovani rK39 antigen as a surrogate for transmission in households with VL cases, asymptomatic infections and PKDL cases in 16 highly endemic villages over a 2-year period in Bihar, India. We observed that most transmission occurred in the VL households and further that it occurred closest to the time of acute disease. We were unable to confirm that transmission occurred in the households with either asymptomatic infections or PKDL cases. These observations argue that active surveillance to diagnose and treat VL cases as soon as possible to reduce transmission should remain a priority for VL elimination.
