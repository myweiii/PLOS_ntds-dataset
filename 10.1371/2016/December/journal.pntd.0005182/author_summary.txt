Melioidosis is a bacterial infection occurring in tropical regions of the world. It has been regularly reported from Southeast Asia and Northern Australia and in recent years, reported from South Asia, China and Brazil. The disease can affect any organ in the body, and commonly presents as a lung infection and/or multiple abscesses in internal organs; diabetes is the most common predisposing factor. Melioidosis is associated with a high rate of death because of the early spread of infection to the blood. Although the general clinical presentations of the disease are similar across regions, some regional differences are reported. Therefore, we reviewed case reports of melioidosis from Malaysia. The cases reported from Malaysia were similar to cases reported from South and Southeast Asia with regard to main presentations of pneumonia and soft tissue abscesses and diabetes as a major risk factor; spread of infection to the bloodstream resulted in a greater likelihood of death. Differences were a higher occurrence of neurological presentations, and abscesses of prostate gland, liver and spleen and aneurysms of major blood vessels than previously reported. Abscess of the parotid gland in children was not common. Early diagnosis and treatment including initiating treatment in suspicious cases is crucial to prevent death.
