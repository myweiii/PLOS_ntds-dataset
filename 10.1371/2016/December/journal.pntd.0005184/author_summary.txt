Taenia solium is the leading cause of preventable epilepsy and the highest ranking foodborne parasite in terms of disease burden worldwide. Currently there are no large scale control programmes implemented against T. solium, but efficacious intervention tools are there, making control programmes the next step forward. Because of the zoonotic properties of the parasite, existing in both humans and pigs, a combination of intervention tools is likely to be needed. cystiSim is an agent-based disease model that provides insight into which intervention tools, and the frequency of administration of these tools, are needed to yield an effect on disease prevalence. cystiSim is a valuable tool in designing future control programmes and will assist in the elimination of T. solium as a public health problem.
