Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), closely related to classic rabies virus, is widely distributed in bats in Australia. So far, the only three known human ABLV cases, all fatal, have been reported in Queensland, Australia. Any Australian bat-related injury (bite or scratch), or contact of bat saliva/neural tissue with eyes, mouth, nose, or broken skin of humans, is considered a potential exposure to ABLV. Use of timely, appropriate rabies vaccine and human rabies immunoglobulin is recommended to prevent fatal human ABLV disease. Based on notification data for potential exposures to ABLV in Queensland, we found that intentional handling of bats by the general public was the major cause of bat-related injuries; for example, people reported attempting to rescue bats caught in barbed wire fences or fruit tree netting, or attempting to remove bats from a home. This highlights a need to address the strong motivation of some members of the public to help injured bats or bats in distress and the lack of awareness of the risks of contact with or handling of bats, underscoring the importance of avoidance of bat handling by contacting vaccinated, experienced, and well-equipped professional animal rescue groups to deal with bats. There is a need to improve timeliness of notification to ensure immediate post-exposure management. Queensland Health bat testing results revealed the detection of ABLV in four common species of megabats (all flying foxes) and one species of microbats (yellow-bellied sheathtail bat), further reinforcing the message of avoiding all bat-related injuries. Once a potential exposure to ABLV occurs, immediate cleansing of wound (with soap and water for at least 5 minutes and application of povidone-iodine or alcohol) is required; and appropriate and timely rabies vaccine and human rabies immunoglobulin should be administered.
