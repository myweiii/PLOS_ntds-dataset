Millions of school-age children in Tanzania are infected with Schistosoma mansoni which have an impact on their physical health by reducing growth and fitness, causing anaemia and liver and spleen pathology. Apart from these measurable physical parameters, self-rating of well-being by administration of quality of life questionnaires has been proposed for measuring schistosome related morbidity. A total of 572 schoolchildren aged 7â€“8 years were examined for S. mansoni infection, anaemia, malnutrition and liver/spleen enlargement. Furthermore, the children participated in a 20 metres shuttle run fitness test and answered a quality of life questionnaire for children. While there was no association between S. mansoni prevalence or intensities and anaemia, malnutrition, fitness or organ enlargement, S. mansoni infected children had a significantly lower self-perceived emotional quality of life. Thus, infected children were more often scared, sad, angry or worried about their future compared to their uninfected peers. More in depth studies are needed in order to refine the questionnaire so it focuses more on aspects of quality of life that may be affected by schistosome infections.
