An outer membrane component, capsular polysaccharide (CPS), is a virulence factor expressed by many Gram-negative bacteria including Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. Recently, B. pseudomallei CPS was identified as a useful diagnostic biomarker, leading to the development of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) targeting CPS for B. pseudomallei detection. In this current work, we studied the in vivo fate of CPS using a murine model, to better understand the clinical applications and potential limitations of the LFI. Interestingly, we found that B. pseudomallei CPS has a unique set of characteristics (as compared to other bacterial capsule antigens) including rapid kidney clearance from serum, no deposition in major internal organs, and ability to be cleared without degradation. Clinically, these findings suggest that CPS may be a potential biomarker for detecting active melioidosis and monitoring melioidosis treatment outcome. Additionally, urine may be used as a non-invasive sample for detecting melioidosis.
