Evaluation of the relative impacts of RVF vaccination has not been previously carried out. We present a model that simulates RVFV transmission between two livestock hosts (cattle as a separate host and sheep referring to both sheep and goats) and two mosquito species (Aedes and Culex species). We then apply the model to evaluate policy-relevant impacts of vaccinating (1) different proportions of animals at different times to the simulated outbreak, (2) either of the host species, and (3) different proportions of animals in a periodic biannual or annual vaccination preventative strategy. Vector population growth is dependent on rainfall extracted from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for an RVF endemic site in Kenya over a period of 1827 days. The model reproduces the 2006/2007 RVF outbreak reported in empirical surveys in the target area and other seasonal transmission events that occur during the wet seasons. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, mass livestock vaccination can greatly reduce the potential for a major outbreak. The model predicts that the effectiveness can be improved by increasing the proportion of vaccinated animals, targeting vaccination against cattle and strategically augmenting periodic preventative strategies with reactive strategies once a RVF outbreak is predicted.
