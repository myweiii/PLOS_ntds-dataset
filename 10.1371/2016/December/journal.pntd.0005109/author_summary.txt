In absence of effective treatment and vaccine, vector control is the main strategy against arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Given the limitation of entomologic tool currently used, news tools are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of vector control against arboviral diseases. The present study aimed to investigate whether human IgG antibody specific response to only one Aedes salivary peptide could be useful for assessing the efficacy of vector control against arboviral diseases. For this purpose, IgG response to Nterm-34kDa peptide was assessed from 102 individuals living in urban area at La Reunion Island, Indian Ocean, before and after the implementation of vector control against Aedes albopictus mosquito species. A significant decrease of this specific IgG level was noticed after vector control implementation. The decrease was associated to the decline in Aedes mosquito density estimated by entomological parameters, such as adult mosquito density, House and Breteau indices. The results of the present study indicated that human IgG response to the Aedes Nterm-34kDa salivary peptide could be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of vector control strategies against arboviruses.
