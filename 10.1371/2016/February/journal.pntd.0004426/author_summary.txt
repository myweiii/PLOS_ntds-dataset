Midline destructive lesions of the face (MDL) involve a process that leads to ulceration and loss of the normal structure. The possible causes vary from infectious to neoplastic. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease that is transmitted through the bite of one of the female phlebotomine sandflies and is continuing to spread in endemic and non-endemic regions secondary to environmental and human made changes. CL is rarely reported as a possible cause of MDL. With the influx of over 1,500,000 refugees from Leishmania-endemic areas in Syria seeking shelter from the current conflict in their country, Lebanon, a Leishmania under-endemic country, is facing an epidemic outbreak of CL. In this study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data on 15 patients with solitary nasal lesions caused by CL. We concluded that Leishmaniasis may cause MDL especially in endemic areas and that PCR is instrumental in confirming the diagnosis. Moreover, MDL caused by CL showed wide spectrum of clinical and microscopic presentation.
