Dengue is a major public health problem affecting more than half of the world’s population living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The disease is estimated to place a heavy socio-economic burden on households, health care systems, and governments, particularly during outbreaks; however, country-specific reliable estimates of burden of disease and cost data are limited. This study estimated the public sector costs of dengue control activities and the direct costs of hospitalizations in Colombo district—the most heavily populated and urbanized district in Sri Lanka—during the epidemic year of 2012 from the Ministry of Health’s perspective. Results revealed that the Ministry’s cost of dengue control and hospitalizations totaled US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita), of which US$971,360 (US$0.42 per capita) was for dengue control activities. Personnel costs accounted for the largest shares of the costs of dengue control activities (79%) and of hospitalizations (46%). The results indicated a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities. The average costs of hospitalization ranged between US$216–609 for pediatric cases and between US$196–866 for adult cases according to disease severity and treatment setting. These results suggest that dengue poses a major economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka.
