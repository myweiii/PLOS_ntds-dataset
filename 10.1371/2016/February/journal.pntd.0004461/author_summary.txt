Rabies has been known as a deadly disease in Nepal for decades, but information on epidemiology, impact and control remains scattered. We collected and summarized information from a variety of sources, including scientific literature and government agencies. Only little original research has been conducted on the epidemiology and impact of rabies in Nepal, leaving many questions unanswered. Official reports show that each year 100 livestock and 10â€“100 humans die of rabies, but these numbers very likely underestimate the true rabies burden. Availability and supply of anti-rabies vaccines have remained suboptimal and rabies control activities have been hampered by a lack of collaboration and comprehensiveness. High level political commitment is essential to overcome these problems and to reduce the burden of rabies. We therefore propose to make rabies the model zoonosis for successful control in Nepal.
