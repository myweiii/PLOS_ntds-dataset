Mosquitoes of the Aedes family transmit many important viruses, including dengue virus, between their vertebrate hosts. In the mosquito, the growth of these viruses is limited by the antiviral RNA interference pathway. Key to this pathway is a class of small non-coding RNAs known as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In addition, two related but distinct small RNA pathways known as the microRNA (miRNA) and the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway are implicated in regulating virus replication in mosquitoes. Thus, since small RNAs may critically influence the transmission of dengue virus, we set out to analyze the populations of viral and mosquito small RNAs that are produced in infected Aedes mosquito cells. We found that besides the well-known viral siRNAs, dengue virus-derived piRNAs were produced in these cells and we identified the PIWI proteins that these small RNAs rely on. In addition, we found that viral miRNAs were not expressed from the dengue virus genome and that the levels of mosquito miRNAs were barely changed upon infection. Finally, our data allowed for the identification of novel Aedes miRNAs, complementing the repertoire of these important regulatory RNAs in vector mosquitoes.
