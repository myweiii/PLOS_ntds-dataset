Marburg virus (MARV) is a filovirus closely related to Ebola virus and similarly causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. MARV is endemic throughout parts of tropical Africa. Severe outbreaks of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have occurred involving hundreds of human cases. No effective MARV antiviral therapies are available. In this study, we used a positive charged phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMOplus) targeting the mRNA of the MARV nucleoprotein gene as a medical countermeasure to treat disease in a lethal nonhuman primate model of MVD. The intravenous treatment regimen was well tolerated with no treatment related adverse effects. We showed that when using this antisense treatment, serum virus levels decreased and 83â€“100% of the animals survived, even when the treatment was delayed as much as 96 hours after infection. None of the untreated animals survived the viral challenge in this model. Our results suggest that antisense therapies, such as PMOs, hold great promise for the treatment of severe viral diseases such as MVD.
