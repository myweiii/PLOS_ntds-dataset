Dengue has not been considered to be a major problem in China since it is recognized as an imported disease and only 8,058 cases were reported from 2005 to 2013. However, in 2014 alone, 47,056 new cases were reported. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to determine the possible cause of this outbreak. The most important parameters found to underlie the pattern of a small outbreak in 2013 and a much larger one in 2014 was the timing of the first imported and locally transmitted case. The importance of precipitation and temperature was also confirmed by the simulation results under different climate scenarios. The model also suggests that the earlier and more frequent control interventions in 2014 targeting immature mosquitoes, such as emptying water containers, and adult control, were effective in preventing larger outbreaks. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to imported cases occurring between March 1st and July 1st to prevent early and prolonged transmission. Without early detection and response, the final outbreak size might otherwise be an order of magnitude or more the size when the imported case occurred outside this time period.
