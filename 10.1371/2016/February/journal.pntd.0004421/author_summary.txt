Chemical sensing is crucial to survival of tsetse flies; the sole cyclical vectors of African trypanosomes that cause the neglected zoonotic tropical disease sleeping sickness in humans. For many years, vector control has been used to mitigate trypanosome infections among rural populations of sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, development of an all-inclusive strategy to control tsetse flies using odour-baited traps has been limited by disparate responses to the odors exhibited by various tsetse species. In this study, proteins that are putatively involved in chemical sensing were identified and compared among five tsetse species and their close relatives with an aim of enhancing our knowledge on tsetse olfaction. Our findings suggest that the chemosensory genes are conserved across tsetse fly species despite their documented differential responses in odours. We found no species-specific sequence variations among the five species to suggest that differential response to odours is due to loss or gain of genes. It could therefore be hypothesized that the observed differences emerge during the downstream processing of odour molecules involving post translational modification of the chemosensory proteins. We thus recommend functional studies on the identified proteins to determine their roles and molecular interactions.
