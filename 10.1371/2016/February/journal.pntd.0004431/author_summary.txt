Buruli ulcer is a slow progressing ulcerative disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that is most prevalent in West African rural communities. Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the disease, produces a toxin called mycolactone, which is held responsible for the extensive tissue damage seen in advanced Buruli ulcer lesions. To date, no effective vaccine against the disease exists and it is unclear to what extent antibodies against cell surface antigens of M. ulcerans play a role in protection. To assess whether vaccine induced antibodies against cell surface proteins can protect against Buruli ulcer, we formulated two surface vaccine candidate antigens, MUL_2232 and MUL_3720, as adjuvanted recombinant proteins and investigated their protective potential in a mouse model of M. ulcerans infection. Despite the induction of strong antibody responses against the surface molecules and cross-reactivity of the induced antibodies with the antigens in their native context, we did not observe protection against the disease. While the vaccine-induced antibodies could opsonize the extracellular bacilli, infiltrating phagocytes might be killed early by mycolactone.
