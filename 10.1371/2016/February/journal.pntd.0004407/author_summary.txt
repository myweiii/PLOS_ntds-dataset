Reactivation of Chagas disease in people living with HIV is a serious clinical condition that is associated with high mortality. Hence, early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. Although there are not well accepted criteria to identify patients at risk of reactivation, parasitemia levels are usually considered as the best predictor. Microscopy is used in Latin America for detection of parasitemia levels. However, this has low sensitivity, which usually leads to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Quantitative PCR is used only for research proposes in endemic areas. Antigens in urine (antigenuria) are correlated with parasitemia levels in animal models, as well as in cases of congenital Chagas disease. We believe that antigenuria can also be used for prediction of parasitemia levels in T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. In this study, Chunap (Chagas urine nanoparticle test) was used for concentration and quantification of T. cruzi antigens in urine of T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. Values of more than 105 pg of T. cruzi antigens in urine were observed only in patients with reactivation of Chagas disease. This study shows that antigenuria levels are highly correlated to levels of parasitemia and can be used as a non-invasive technique for monitoring parasitemia levels in T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients.
