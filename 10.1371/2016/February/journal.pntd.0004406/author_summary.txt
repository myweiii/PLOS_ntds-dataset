Despite the clinical importance of Trichobilharzia regenti in bird hosts and as a cause of cercarial dermatitis in humans, almost nothing is known about the molecular aspects of this fluke and its interactions with its hosts. Here, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the transcriptome representing two life stages (cercariae and schistosomula) of T. regenti involved in the first phases of infection of the bird host. We identified key biological and metabolic pathways specific to each of these two developmental stages and also undertook comparative analyses using data available for related flukes. Detailed analyses showed the unique involvement of carbohydrate metabolism, translation and amino acid metabolism, and calcium in T. regenti cercariae during invasion and in growth and development, as well as cell adhesion molecules, microaerobic metabolism (citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation), peptidases (cathepsins) and other histolytic and lysozomal proteins in schistosomula during migration in neural tissues. These molecular insights into T. regenti biology should support future genomic and proteomic investigations of T. regenti, and comparative studies of flatworms.
