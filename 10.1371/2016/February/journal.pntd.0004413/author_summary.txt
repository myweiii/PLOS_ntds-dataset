Although plague primarily affects wild rodents, human plague outbreaks still occur periodically in some areas of the world. Yersinia pestis, the bacterial agent of plague, is transmitted by fleas. Cat fleas are abundant worldwide, regularly infest human habitations in plague endemic areas, and readily bite humans. The cat flea has long been considered to be a poor vector, but this reputation is based on very limited studies; and in general the reasons why some flea species are better vectors than others are not well understood. We found that cat fleas can transmit Y. pestis, but at rates strongly influenced by feeding frequency after the infectious blood meal. When infected cat fleas had unrestricted access to blood (their preferred feeding pattern), most rapidly cleared the infection and they transmitted only during the first week after infection. However, when post-infection blood meals were limited to mimic patterns typical of efficient flea vectors, cat fleas regularly transmitted for one month after infection. Our results indicate that cat fleas in their natural environments have limited potential to develop transmissible infections. However, if their regular daily feeding habit is interrupted, they can be capable vectors.
