In Vietnam, Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is the second most frequent human malaria parasite and a major obstacle to countrywide malaria elimination. Knowing the local parasite structure is useful for elimination efforts. Therefore, we analyzed, with a panel of 14 microsatellite markers, 234 P. vivax mono infections in blood samples collected from 4 communities in central Vietnam. Genetic diversity in the population was moderate; a high occurrence of polyclonal infections and significant linkage disequilibrium were detected, suggesting inbreeding or recombination between highly related haplotypes. In addition, both genetic differentiation and population structure was low and only detected between communities at each side of the river. Those results suggest gene flow between study communities with the river defining a moderate geographical barrier. Future studies should determine how this genetic variation is maintained in an area of extremely low transmission.
