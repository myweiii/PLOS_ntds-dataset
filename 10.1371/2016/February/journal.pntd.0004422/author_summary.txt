Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most widespread parasitic diseases worldwide and is caused by kinetoplastid protozoa of the Leishmania donovani complex. The disease begins with internalization of L. donovani parasites and their multiplication within host macrophages followed subsequently by immune suppression. However, the immunological factors responsible for disease progression and their association with parasite dynamics are not completely understood. Herein, we investigated the correlation of different immune components (cytokines and cellular subsets) with parasite load and their involvement in the course of VL. Our study revealed a significant positive correlation between parasite load and plasma as well as antigen specific levels of IL-10 and TGFβ. In addition to cytokines, cellular subsets could also contribute to disease pathogenesis through their regulatory mechanisms. Our results indicate different Treg cell markers (absolute numbers of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25hi and percentages of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) to be strongly correlated with parasite load. Exploring an association between these immunological correlates revealed Treg cells to be the source of these cytokines during VL. Therefore, this study points to a significant role of IL-10, TGFβ and Treg cells in parasite load and active VL, providing evidence which could be helpful in devising new immunotherapeutic strategies against this disease.
