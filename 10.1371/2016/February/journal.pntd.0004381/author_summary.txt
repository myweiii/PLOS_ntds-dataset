Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) represents a major public health problem in North Africa where Leishmania major is the potential etiological agent associated with all ZCL cases. In many countries across North Africa, L. major is transmitted by the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi, with rodents as likely reservoir hosts. In Libya, ZCL cases are underestimated for lack of reporting, insufficient information about the distribution of ZCL, and interactions between local environmental conditions and different disease components. This situation worsened with recent political and socio-economic changes in the country, with expansion and rapid increases in numbers of cases across the country. For management and planning of leishmaniasis control, predicting the potential geographic distribution of risk of infection with the disease is important to guide such programs. We introduced ecological niche model as a tool for risk-mapping of both ZCL cases and distributions of associated species. Our models were able to anticipate areas of highest risk with statistical significance, lending confidence that they were successful in identifying areas of transmission risk.
