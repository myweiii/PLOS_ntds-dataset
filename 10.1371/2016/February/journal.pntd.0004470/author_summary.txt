Bacterial bloodstream infection (bBSI) is one of the biggest causes of mortality in critically ill patients and standard diagnosis is still done by blood culture methods. Parallel deep sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S metagenomics) is a new and rapidly evolving research field for profiling bacterial communities. We designed a 16S metagenomics approach for the identification of bacteria in the blood of patients with a bBSI, and evaluated its performance in 75 children with severe febrile illness in Burkina Faso. In addition to superior sensitivity compared to standard blood culture, 16S metagenomics revealed important novel insights into the nature of bBSI. Patients with acute malaria or recently recovered from acute malaria are at increased risk of presenting polymicrobial bloodstream infection, which was in itself a significant risk for non-survival. This proof-of-concept study shows that 16S metagenomics is a powerful approach to diagnose and understand bBSI but also that appropriate control samples are crucial for correct data interpretation.
