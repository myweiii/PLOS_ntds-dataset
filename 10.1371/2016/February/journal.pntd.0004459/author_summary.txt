Schistosomiasis continues to be a serious global public health problem that considered by World Health Organization (WHO). More than 200 million people are infected and cause 280 thousand deaths every year. Among, Schistosoma japonicum causes the most severe pathological damages and the slowest immune resistance manifestation. It is estimated there is considerable economic loss in China due to the infection of human and domestic animals. Therefore, development of a useful vaccine is thought to be an efficient strategy to control and prevent schistosome infection. In this study, we co-immunized mice with pcDNA/SjGST vaccine, pIL-12 and rSjGST to develop a new vaccination regimen against schistosomiasis japonica. And we found this regimen can induce both specific cellular and humoral responses to attain a balance between parasite elimination and prevention of pathological tissue injury. The new regimen produced significant anti-parasite, anti-hepatic egg, and anti-pathology effects. Our method of vaccination can be applied in large livestock, such as water buffalo or cow that may help to reduce the transmission of zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica.
