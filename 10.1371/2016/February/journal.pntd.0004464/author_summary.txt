Live attenuated yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) is an efficient and generally safe vaccine. Nevertheless, in recent years the reporting of serious adverse effects together with the given limitations in the use of this live vaccine in certain risk groups has spurred an interest in developing a more generally applicable and safer alternative. Using an adenovector platform and recombinant vaccines targeting both structural and non-structural YF antigens, we now demonstrate that non-replicating adenobased vaccines may be used to induce a state of host immunity, which like YF-17D vaccination encompasses both major arms of the adaptive immune system. Furthermore, in a murine challenge model, adenovector induced protection fully matched that induced by the current vaccine. Taken together our results strongly suggest that adenovectored vaccines targeting structural and non-structural viral antigens represent a viable and safe alternative to the existing live, attenuated YF vaccine.
