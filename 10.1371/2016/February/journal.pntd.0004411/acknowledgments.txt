Amy Burroughs, Gary Crameri, Ina Smith, and James Wynne provided helpful comments on the survey design; Ina Smith additionally provided comments on the manuscript. Three anonymous reviewers provided thoughtful comments which greatly improved the manuscript. Tiggy Grillo included the survey in the Wildlife Health Australia (previously Australian Wildlife Health Network) weekly digest. Kathryn Keen forwarded the survey to members of Ozark, the Australian Wildlife Carers Network. We would especially like to thank all of the dedicated flying fox carers who participated for their time and detailed responses.
