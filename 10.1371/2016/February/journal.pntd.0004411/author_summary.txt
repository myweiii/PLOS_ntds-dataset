Wildlife rehabilitators can encounter risks when handling animals, such as physical harm and exposure to infectious diseases. In Australia, rehabilitators that care for fruit bats may be exposed to Australian bat lyssavirus if bitten or scratched, which is fatal to people not vaccinated against rabies. We initiated a survey to assess rehabilitators’ perceptions of disease risk associated with fruit bats as well as rehabilitators’ safety practices. Despite an excellent rabies vaccination rate (100%), we found room for improvement in use of personal protective equipment. Supporting this, our regression analysis showed that use of protective equipment is associated with less chance of being bitten or scratched. Rehabilitators that are able to safely handle fruit bats can reduce risk to themselves, model good behaviour for onlookers, and protect animals from euthanasia. We recommend that carers develop Australia-wide guidelines for safety when rehabilitating bats and that the responsible government agencies in Australia support carers who rescue potentially lyssavirus-infected bats by offering compensation for costly protective equipment.
