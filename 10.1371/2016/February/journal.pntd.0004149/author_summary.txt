Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium, and is curable with multi-drug therapy, a combination of antibiotics taken for 6 or 12 months. However, some leprosy patients develop an inflammatory condition known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or Type 2 reaction. ENL affects multiple organs and causes systemic illness as well as nerve damage that leads to disability and deformity. ENL is often chronic and patients have multiple flare-ups requiring prolonged steroid treatment. Patients are at risk of developing adverse events related to long term steroids. There are no effective, non-teratogenic alternative treatments for patients who no longer respond to steroids or have contra-indications to steroids. We conducted two studies to see if ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant used in many inflammatory conditions, could safely be used either as an alternative or in conjunction with prednisolone to treat ENL. Patients with acute ENL showed promising results with ciclosporin treatment, with a 16 week median delay in recurrence of ENL. It did not however appear to have a significant steroidâ€“sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL. This suggests that further ENL studies should look at carefully tailored regimens of medication in order to assess the effect of ciclosporin or other immunosuppressant drugs.
