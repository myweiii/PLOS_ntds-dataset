A major aspect of the evolution of Life on Earth is the contemporary loss of biodiversity. To understand the effects of biodiversity on biological phenomena is increasingly important. A key question is whether biodiversity facilitates or reduces infectious diseases transmission. Surprisingly, although many human pathogens are transmitted by arthropods, we still know little about the impact of their diversity on disease risk. We focused our investigation on French Guiana, a hot-spot of biodiversity, and looked at the effect of triatomine vector diversity on the risk of Chagas disease transmission, a major zoonosis in Latin American. We collected bugs in various locations and times, and quantified their infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. We showed that triatomine diversity varies between landscapes and that intermediate levels of diversity lead to minimal risks of transmission. Accordingly, losing vector biodiversity could have positive or negative effects on Chagas disease risk, depending on the pre-existing level of such diversity. A second key result emerging from this study is that highly diverse vector community can lead to biannual peaks of transmission of Chagas disease, which places populations in a "double jeopardy" each year. This calls for a better assessment and account of triatomine biodiversity in public health policy.
