Common krait bites cause muscular paralysis due to the venom disrupting communication between the nerves and muscles. This becomes life-threatening for the patient if there is paralysis of the muscles used for breathing. We studied the severity of paralysis, long term effects and the value of antivenom treatment in authenticated Indian krait bite patients from Sri Lanka. In addition to standard treatment with antivenom, the patients had single-fibre electromyography done, a sensitive neurophysiological test that detects the abnormalities of communication between the nerves and muscles. Half of the patients had severe paralysis and required mechanical ventilation, and the remainder had mild or no effects. Antivenom was given to all patients with severe paralysis and most with mild effects. However, despite antivenom binding all free venom after it was administered, it did not prevent or reverse already developed paralysis. Clinically evident paralysis resolved after a few days, but the neurophysiological abnormalities lasted for weeks. No permanent neurological damages were noted at 6 to 9 months after the snake bite.
