In spite of more than 50 years of efforts to control plague, Madagascar is one of the countries with the highest plague incidence. Bubonic plague, the most encountered form, is transmitted by flea bites. The plague control and prevention policy is based on flea control with chemical insecticides. Hence the occurrence of flea resistance is of major concern in the public health context. Our research team conducted laboratory work to assess the resistance level of Xenopsylla cheopis, the main plague vector, to 12 insecticides. The results of this study will contribute to more focused flea population control, and therefore more efficient control of plague outbreaks.
