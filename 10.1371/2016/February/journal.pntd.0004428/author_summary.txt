An important development in the study of infectious diseases is the application of mathematical models to understand the interplay between various factors that determine epidemiological processes. Vector-borne diseases are additionally complex with interactions between multiple host and vector species. Understanding the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases is an important step towards controlling outbreaks and mitigating human infection risk. Identifying the biotic and abiotic interactions and mechanisms that may contribute to disease emergence, establishment and persistence is necessary for assessing current and future disease risk, as well as developing effective control strategies. Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is found around the world and is caused by several species of Borrelia spirochetes, which are vectored by soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros. TBRF is a cryptic disease that still causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in some African countries. Here, we develop and adapt a compartmentalized mathematical model (SIR) with a relapsing component to investigate the dynamics of TBRF.
