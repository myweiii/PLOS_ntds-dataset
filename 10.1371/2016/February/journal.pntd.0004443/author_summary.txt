Plasmodium vivax has a worldwide distribution and is the second most common causative agent of human malaria. The dormant liver stage of P. vivax allows the infection to recur unless diagnosed and treated appropriately, which poses a significant challenge to the goals of malaria elimination and eradication as outlined by the WHO. Although highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tools are available in reference laboratory settings, the currently available diagnostic tools outside referral settings for the detection of P. vivax are limited to microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests, which are insufficiently sensitive for the detection of low level parasitemia particularly in asymptomatic individuals. Based on a DNA amplification technology called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), this study describes the development and validation of a colourimetric, high throughput assay (HtLAMP) suitable for the detection of P. vivax infection in non-referral settings. The sensitivity of the assay combined with its field applicability offers the potential for it to play an important role as a diagnostic tool for the purpose of malaria elimination.
