Over the past decades the Fight against river blindness, a tropical disease caused by a nematode worm, has been relatively successful, and a number of countries have been reported to be free of parasite transmission. In North Cameroon, we checked the occurrence of infective stages of Onchocerca volvulus in the transmitting black fly populations for more than three years and were able to confirm that the transmission there is low, but not yet interrupted. In a second location on a highland plateau, however, no infective stages of the human parasite were found. Instead, a closely-related parasite of cattle was present in both places. Given that the areas are not far away from each other and the biting frequencies of the black fly populations are similar, the historically earlier and higher density of cattle herds in one of the regions would explain why it is now free of the parasite due to the effects called zooprophylaxis and cross-reacting premunition. Changes in the socio-economic environment, especially the increase of human and cattle populations have a strong influence on the spread of river blindness in Africa.
