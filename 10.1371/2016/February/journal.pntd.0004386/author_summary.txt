Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infectious diseases that occur mostly in poor, warm countries. NTDs are caused by various bacteria and parasites, such as worms. They can either be cured or prevented through drugs and other interventions, such as control of insects that spread the infection. The London Declaration is a statement by various organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and pharmaceutical companies that donate the necessary drugs. The declaration endorses targets for disease reductions by 2020, as recently formulated in the WHO Roadmap, to be achieved by rigorous application of available interventions. We explore how much health can be gained if these targets are indeed achieved. We estimate that in such case 5 million deaths can be averted before 2030 and also that huge reductions in ill-health and disability can be realized. Over the period 2011â€“2030, a total health gain would be accomplished of about 600 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. DALYs are a measure of disease burden, consisting of life years lost and years lived with disability. This enormous health gain seems to justify similar investments as for e.g. HIV or malaria control.
