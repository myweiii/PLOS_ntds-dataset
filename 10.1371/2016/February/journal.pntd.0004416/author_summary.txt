Chagas disease is a parasitic disease mainly transmitted to humans by blood-sucking insects. The disease was endemic in Latin America, but it is now a global disease due to migratory movements. The disease can affect the heart and the digestive system (mainly esophagus and colon). Classically, esophageal assessment in Chagas disease is performed by X-ray and self-reported symptoms. However, they lack accuracy and detect only advanced stage of the disease. Recently, new tools, such as esophageal high resolution manometry, provide more detailed information about the motility disorders of the esophagus. We assessed the esophageal involvement in patients with Chagas disease by means of high resolution manometry and compared the findings with the X-ray and self-reported symptoms. We found a low rate of mild severity motility disorders. We did not find an association between X-ray assessment and symptoms with the high resolution manometry findings. The assessment of esophageal involvement in patients with Chagas disease may benefit from early diagnosis by high resolution manometry, although more research is needed.
