In Panama, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is due to infection with the Choclo virus, which is transmitted by the rice rat (Oligoryzomys fulvescens). Hantavirus infection is endemic in rural, Central-West Panama, an area characterized by a very dynamic combination of subsistence and industrial agriculture. This region contains one of the highest hantavirus antibody prevalence (16–62%) in humans on the continent, but with low mortality (17%) in the affected population. People become infected in and around the household area. Evidence points to the increase in and dynamic nature of agricultural activity in this region as the primary causes of increased hantavirus infection in humans in Panama. This study was conducted on a high spatio-temporal resolution that better captures how rapidly the abundances of reservoir populations shift—altering this aspect of zoonotic spillover of pathogens. Practically, the results demonstrate an important challenge in monitoring or predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations. These populations are subject to fluctuations over time (both within and among years). The populations themselves are geographically restricted, even within their broader range. Suitable habitats for rodents may change but are poorly understood. Our results are valuable to understand hantavirus dynamics in Panama and the many other countries from North to South America in which hantaviruses are endemic in host populations.
