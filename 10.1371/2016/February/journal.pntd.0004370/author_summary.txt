Effective control of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever has historically been achieved by controlling vector populations. The use of larvicides that kill the larval stages of the yellow fever mosquito is a critical component of effective control. However, larvicides may act together with other components of the environment like larval crowding and alter the biology of adult mosquitoes. The authors found that mosquitoes that survived exposure to the larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis spp. israelensis (Bti) experienced faster development, were bigger, and produced more offspring. Larval crowding, but not larvicide Bti, had a strong effect on survival of adult Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) females. Adult mosquitoes from crowded larval conditions had reduced survival compared to individuals from uncrowded larval conditions. Exposure to the larvicide Bti or larval crowding did not alter the ability of the surviving adult mosquitoes to become infected with dengue virus. Our findings suggest that larvicide campaigns may reduce the number of emerged adults, but survivors will have a fitness advantage (growth, development, enhanced production of offspring) relative to mosquitoes not exposed to the larvicide. However, under most circumstances, these effects are unlikely to outweigh reductions in the adult population by larvicide Bti and altered risk of disease transmission.
