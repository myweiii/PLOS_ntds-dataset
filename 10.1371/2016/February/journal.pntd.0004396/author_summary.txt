Neurocysticercosis is caused by T. solium, which is a neglected disease. The postoncospheral (PO) form is an intermediate form between the oncosphere, which is the larva, and the fully developed cysticercus, which is a cyst with a scolex. The morphology, development, and protein and antigen expression of the PO form have not previously been characterized. Here, we report the novel in vitro cultivation of T. solium PO forms and characterize the morphology, development, and expression of antigenic proteins. This new method will allow for better study of this transitional form, which is very difficult to study in the intermediate host. With the increased availability of secreted proteins and antigens, in vitro cultivation will help improve diagnostic assays and provide new targets for vaccine development to block transmission.
