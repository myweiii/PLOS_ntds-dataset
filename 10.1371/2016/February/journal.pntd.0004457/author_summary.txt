G6PD is an enzyme that chemically protects us from otherwise toxic substances, like some chemotherapeutic agents. About 8% of people exposed to malaria have an inherited disorder that impairs G6PD activity, leaving them vulnerable to harm by an important therapy against malaria, primaquine. This drug alone prevents repeated clinical attacks stemming from dormant parasites residing in the human liver. Absent certain knowledge of patient G6PD status, healthcare providers managing patients infected by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale malaria must choose between risk of harm caused by hemolytic toxicity of primaquine and that caused by the parasite after withholding therapy. Resolving that therapeutic dilemma requires assessment of patient G6PD status at the point-of-care in the impoverished rural tropics, where the vast majority of malaria patients live. Current technology for such screening is impractical in that setting. In this study we evaluated screening designed for practicality at the endemic tropical point-of-care: a rapid diagnostic test for G6PD (G6PD RDT; CareStart G6PD, AccessBio, USA). We found the G6PD RDT to be effective in screening volunteers living in rural eastern Indonesia. This G6PD RDT kit costs relatively little ($1.50), was simple to execute and interpret, required no specialized equipment or skills, performed well at ambient tropical temperatures (>30Â°C), and required no cold chain storage. This and similar kits may permit safe universal access to primaquine therapy against relapse of P. vivax, a vitally important step forward in mitigating the global burden of morbidity and mortality imposed by this pernicious parasite.
