Chagasic cardiomyopathy is elicited by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. T. cruzi transmission is prevalent in Latin American countries, and its transmission is also noted in Mexico and Southern parts of the United States. In this manuscript, we have utilized blood samples from human subjects that were normal healthy or were infected with T. cruzi and exhibited variable symptoms of heart disease. We have employed a highly sensitive approach of protein labeling, developed a detailed proteomic map from all samples, performed comparative analysis of gel images, and identified a panel of proteins that were changed in abundance in clinically asymptomatic (C/A) and clinically symptomatic (C/S) chagasic individuals with respect to healthy controls. Functional annotation of these proteins suggested that pathologic mechanisms in disease progression would involve hostâ€™s inability to recruit immune cells, scavenge free radicals, and prevent cell death. We also describe a panel of proteins that can differentiate C/A from C/S subjects and will potentially be useful in identifying infected individuals at risk of developing clinical disease.
