Rabies is a widespread fatal, but preventable, viral disease transmitted from animals to humans. It has been estimated that tens of thousands of people die of rabies annually, mainly in developing countries where rabies is still a neglected disease. In the Central African Republic (CAR), a poor country located at the heart of Africa, rabies is endemic, but its burden remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported a comprehensive analysis of data for 2012 from the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, the capital of the CAR. In 2012, 966 persons reported exposure to suspicious animals, mainly dogs, and 632 received post-exposure rabies vaccination. Most of these people were from Bangui area and were under 15-years of age. Meanwhile, 82 samples from suspected rabid dogs were tested and 69 were confirmed positive. Most of the rabid dogs were owned although unvaccinated. Positive samples were sequenced and we found that three different variants actively circulated in 2012. Theses variants clustered with other viruses found in surroundings countries. Our data suggested that canine rabies was endemic in the CAR with a detrimental impact on human health. We conclude that mass vaccination of domestic dogs and the improvement of the surveillance and the access to post-exposure vaccination are urgently needed to control rabies in the CAR.
