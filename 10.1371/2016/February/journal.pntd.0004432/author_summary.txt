This paper reviews ten years of rabies epidemiology in the three Baltic countries. Both surveillance efforts and oral rabies vaccination campaigns have resulted in the near eradication of the disease. Multivariate analysis assessed with generalized linear models (GLM) suggested lower oral vaccination effectiveness in raccoon dogs compared with red foxes, highlighting the importance of adapting oral vaccination strategy to each vector of the disease. Although eradication of the disease is almost achieved, the detection of some cases belonging with the Russian rabies lineage emphasizes a risk of rabies reintroduction in the Baltic States due to westward spread from bordering countries. This study show also the first vaccine-induced cases detected in non-target species (Martes martes and Meles meles).
