A major challenge of current leprosy control is the management of host pathological immune responses coined Type-1 Reactions (T1R). T1R are characterized by acute inflammatory episodes whereby cellular immune responses are directed against host peripheral nerve cells. T1R affects up half of all leprosy patients and are a major cause of leprosy-associated disabilities. Since there is evidence that host genetic factors predispose leprosy patients to T1R, we have conducted a candidate gene study to test if LRRK2 gene variants are T1R risk factors. The choice of LRRK2 was motivated by the fact that LRRK2 was associated with leprosy per se in some but not in other studies. We reasoned that this may reflect different proportions of leprosy patients with T1R in the different samples and that LRRK2 may in truth be a T1R susceptibility gene. Here, we show that variants overlapping the LRRK2 gene, reported as suggestive leprosy per se susceptibility factors in a previous genome-wide association study, are preferentially associated with T1R. The main SNP carrying most of the association signal is the amino-acid change M2397T (rs3761863) which is known to impact LRRK2 turnover. Interestingly, eQTL SNPs counterbalanced the effect of the M2397T variant but this compensatory mechanism was abrogated by Mycobacterium leprae antigen stimulation.
