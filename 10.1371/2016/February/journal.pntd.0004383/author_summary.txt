Argasid ticks are understudied vectors of significant human and veterinary pathogens. The life-cycle and feeding behavior of the tick poses challenges when attempting to understand the vectorâ€™s distribution. These ticks reside in dens, nests, and cave cavities, and are indiscriminant nocturnal feeders. They also engorge within minutes of attachment, and identifying the ticks on a vertebrate host is infrequent. To guide future surveillance studies, we predicted regions of probable occurrences for Ornithodoros turicata, a species capable of transmitting relapsing fever spirochetes and African swine fever virus. Historical databases and published literature were evaluated, and we collected ticks from regions of the United States. Environmental factors linked with known localities of O. turicata were used in a mathematical modeling program, which predicted regions in the United States and north Mexico likely to sustain the ticks. Additionally, vertebrate host ranges were associated with the predictive models, which may indicate how the tick vectors are dispersed. Collectively, these studies identified previously unrecognized regions that could sustain the ticks, and we envision that our work will help guide surveillance and additional research efforts to understand the ecology of pathogens transmitted by argasid ticks.
