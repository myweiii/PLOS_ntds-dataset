Epidemics of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are overwhelming public health capacity for diagnosis and patient care. Developing a panel of biomarkers in acute-phase serum specimens for prognosis of severe dengue disease would be of enormous value for appropriate triaging of patients for management. Metabolomics offers great potential for identification of small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) for diagnosis and prognosis of dengue virus (DENV) infections. We identified metabolites that were associated with and differentiated DHF/DSS, DF and non-dengue (ND) febrile illness outcomes, primary and secondary virus infections, and infections with different DENV serotypes. These metabolites provide insights into metabolic pathways that play roles in DENV infection, replication, and pathogenesis. Some are associated with lipid metabolism and regulation of inflammatory processes controlled by signaling fatty acids and phospholipids, and others with endothelial cell homeostasis and vascular barrier function. Such metabolites and associated metabolic pathways are potentially biologically relevant in DENV pathogenesis. The diagnostic and prognostic efficacy of differentiating metabolites is currently being investigated. Our goal is to identify the most parsimonious SMB biosignature that, when combined with laboratory diagnostic results, eg., DENV NS1 or RNA detection, will provide the most efficient algorithm for dengue diagnosis and prognosis.
