In 2004 and 2005, the occurrence of outbreaks of human rabies caused by the hematophagous bat, Desmodus rotundus in the Brazilian Amazon, highlighted the role of this bat in the transmission of the disease and the importance of further research on this zoonosis in this region. In the present study, we investigated the local knowledge and practices related to rabies, in some areas affected by the outbreaks, with the aim of identifying gaps, which may affect the preventive practices. Our results show that education influences the level of knowledge, and many residents are aware of the seriousness of the disease and the role of bats in its transmission, although less than half of the respondents knew how to prevent transmission. We also discovered that public health agents were not effective in the transfer of information on rabies, which may be an important determinant of the low levels of knowledge about it. These findings indicated a clear need to increase public consciousness with regard to the potential risk of rabies and the means of avoiding the disease, through educational initiatives directed at the local population, which should involve the public health authorities responsible for the control and prevention of the disease.
