Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a slow progressing ulcerative skin disease. The mode of transmission of M. ulcerans remains unknown and only little is known about the early stages of the disease and the nature of protective immune responses against this pathogen. Given the increasing evidence for an early intracellular growth phase of M. ulcerans, we aimed at evaluating the impact of cell-mediated immunity for immunological defense against M. ulcerans infections. By comparing wild-type and interferon-γ-deficient mice in a BU mouse model, we could demonstrate that interferon-γ is a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infections, indicative for an important role of early intracellular multiplication of the pathogen. In mice lacking interferon-γ the bacterial burden increased faster, resulting in accelerated pathogenesis. The observed differences between the two mouse strains were most likely due to differences in the capacity of macrophages to kill intracellular bacilli during the early stages of infection.
