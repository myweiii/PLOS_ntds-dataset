Recent control efforts have reduced the global incidence of Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) to <5,000 cases per year, strengthening the prospect of eliminating the disease as a public health problem by 2020. To meet this goal, new methods for identifying transmission must be explored to provide a cost-effective way of identifying hotspots and areas of re-emergence; commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) kits that detect the trypanosome subgenus, responsible for the two forms of sleeping sickness, have been developed. The LAMP kits were tested to assess their sensitivity, specificity and suitability as a method of screening the vector of the disease, Glossina, for Trypanozoon infection, in xenomonitoring campaigns. A simplified DNA extraction process that worked in conjunction with the LAMP kits on pooled samples demonstrated a faster method of processing large numbers of flies compared to other molecular tools. The kits performed well in our experiments and demonstrated the ability of detecting low levels of target DNA, equivalent to 0.1 trypanosome per ml. The lack of cross reaction with non-target species of trypanosomes makes the kits reliable in so far as they will only react with the Trypanozoon group of parasites of which the two human forms of the disease belong, however, further species-specific tests would need to be undertaken to identify HAT areas on selected samples.
