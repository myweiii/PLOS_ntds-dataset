Dengue is a febrile disease caused by the four dengue viruses (DENV-1 to 4) transmitted by mosquitoes from the genus Aedes that can also be transmitted by blood transfusion and organ transplantation. DENV is present in the blood of infected individuals without symptoms, meaning that infected donors may pose a risk to the safety of the donor blood supply. Current methods for detecting transfusion-transmitted viruses by nucleic acid testing use plasma as the testing specimen, and the number of tests that can be performed without reducing availability of blood for transfusion is limited. To determine whether blood components other than plasma could be suitable for testing, we quantified and compared the concentrations of DENV RNA in the residual components of blood collected from subjects previously identified as infected in a parallel blood safety study. Additionally, when available, samples were also evaluated for infectivity in tissue culture. The results showed that DENV RNA and infectious virions were detected comparably in all blood components, suggesting that using alternate specimens may improve sample availability but may not improve testing sensitivity.
