Neurocysticercosis is an infection of the central nervous system by the larva of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). It is a leading cause of epilepsy in the world. The disease takes many different forms, each with different optimal treatment. In this study, we focused on the treatment of solitary cysticercus granuloma (SCG), previous evidence on which is inconclusive. Since many different regimens have been compared in clinical trials of SCG, we conducted a network meta-analysis. This method is powerful as it can analyze quantitatively all of the data from all comparisons together. The result can tell us how different treatments perform against each other and how treatments should be ranked. The outcomes of our meta-analysis suggest that the combination of albendazole and corticosteroids is the most efficacious regimen to control seizures in affected patients and to promote the total disappearance of the lesion, compared with albendazole alone, corticosteroids alone, and conservative treatment.
