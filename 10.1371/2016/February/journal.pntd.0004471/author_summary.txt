Rabies is a fatal viral disease of animals and people. People usually get infected via bites from an infected animal (e.g. dog). Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has to be initiated immediately after bite wounds of suspected rabid animals in order to avoid fatalities. The situation of rabies is poorly known in Ethiopia, particularly in the pastoral context. We conducted questionnaire surveys in urban, pastoral and medical health worker communities around Awash National Park (Ethiopia) in order to capture information on dog demography, bite wound prevalence and management, potential risk factors of disease transmission and knowledge- attitude- practice (KAP) towards rabies among these communities. Disease knowledge was generally poor. Dog demography varied depending on the community which would affect control strategies. Health facilities did not keep bite records and there was poor recording and reporting of rabies cases. Delivery of PEP was inadequate. Communication and collaboration between the public and animal health sector was poor to inexistent regarding reporting and control of rabies cases.
