In the tropics, malaria is commonly attributed to be the cause of most childhood fevers, while in fact this condition is more commonly caused by other pathogens that are clinically indistinguishable from malaria. These so-called non-malaria febrile illnesses include bacterial bloodstream infections, which are associated with a higher mortality than malaria. Most health care facilities in the tropics have malaria diagnostic tests available, but tests for non-malarial febrile illnesses are extremely limited. There is the critical need for new tests that can address the question ‘if a febrile patient is not suffering from malaria, then what is it and what treatment will be effective?’ Using metabolomics, we have comprehensively screened the biochemical profile of patients with severe febrile illness for biological markers of non-malaria febrile illness. The results show that severe malaria and non-malaria febrile illness trigger a distinct metabolic response in the host. We demonstrate that this pathophysiological difference can be exploited for differential diagnosis of severe febrile illness and identification of patients with bacterial bloodstream infections.
