Carrion’s disease is an endemic illness in the Andean valleys of Peru that achieves high mortality rates in the absence of antibiotic treatment. There are three clinical manifestations, febrile acute patients, chronic patients as well as asymptomatic carriers. No effective diagnostic tool exists nowadays leading to misdiagnosis and the perpetuation of the illness. The objective of this study was to determine the detection limit of three PCR approaches both from blood samples as well as from filter papers. Furthermore, the specificity was also accessed. We found that the best PCR approach studied was the amplification of the 16S rRNA from blood samples with a detection limit of 5 CFU/μL, the same when using dry blood in filter paper, although the obtained bands were not so evident. Present results highlight the need to develop more sensitive techniques able to be used both in rural areas and in the detection of asymptomatic carriers.
