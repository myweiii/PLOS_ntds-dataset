Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is associated with maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. In addition to the clinical burden, MiP implies a significant economic burden, but the little available evidence on the economics of MiP is limited to Plasmodium falciparum malaria and to the sub-Saharan region. While an increasing interest has been recently devoted to the epidemiology and the clinical consequences of Plasmodium vivax, the economics of P. vivax malaria is neglected. P. vivax is endemic in Latin America, and Brazil is the country with the highest reported burden of MiP of the American continent. Between 2011 and 2012, we conducted a study in the city of Manaus, Brazilian Amazon, with the aim of estimating costs associated with MiP both from the health provider and the patient perspectives. Despite being an area of low transmission risk, we found that the costs of treating MiP are not negligible. In particular, both from the patient and the provider perspectives, costs underwent a remarkable increase when admission was required and when the cost of subsequent P. vivax malaria episodes during the same pregnancy occurred. The information generated may help health policy decisions for the current control and future elimination of malaria in the area.
