Due to high evolutionary divergence of trypanosomatid pathogens from other eukaryotes, accurate prediction of functional roles for most of their proteins is not feasible based on homology-based approaches. Although protein co-complex maps provide a compelling tool for the functional annotation of proteins, as subunits of a complex are expected to be involved in similar biological processes, the current knowledge about these maps is still rudimentary. Here, we systematically examined the protein co-complex membership of more than one third of T. brucei proteome using two orthogonal fractionation approaches. A high-confidence network of co-complex relationships predicts the network context of 866 proteins, including many hypothetical and experimentally unannotated proteins. To our knowledge, this study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date, providing a useful resource for formulating new biological hypothesises and further experimental leads.
