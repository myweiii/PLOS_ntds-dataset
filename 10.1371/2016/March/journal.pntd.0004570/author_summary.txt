Leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan parasites is considered a neglected disease. Leishmania mexicana can cause localized or diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. Patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis contain the parasite within granulomas, whereas patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis show uncontrolled parasite spread. The cause of this progression remains unknown. However, NK cells have been shown to play an important role since they are among the first to produce cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) that help phagocytic cells to eliminate the intracellular parasite. Previous studies had shown that NK cells of patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis are unresponsive to Leishmania, yet underlying mechanisms were unknown. The current work aims at understanding how the parasite modulates NK-cell responses through gene expression profiling between patients with localized and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. A highlight of our results is that NK cells of patients with the uncontrolled form of leishmaniasis show down-regulation patterns for genes that regulate the innate immune response through TLR receptors and JAK/STAT signaling pathways at different levels: transcription factors (NF-κB and STAT-1), cytokine receptors (IFN-γR2 and IL-12Rβ2) and cytokines (TNF-α). The alteration of expression levels for genes in immune response signaling pathways could predispose to DCL development and/or be associated with disease severity.
