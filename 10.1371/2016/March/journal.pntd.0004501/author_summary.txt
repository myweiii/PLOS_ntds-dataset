Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases and is caused by Leptospira spp. Small mammals often serve as maintenance hosts. We evaluated host-pathogen relations for Leptospira species and sequence types in different small mammal species captured at three German study sites. Leptospira spp. was detected in 5.9% of the captured small mammal species and at all investigated study sites. While a particular host association was observed for L. borgpetersenii to Apodemus spp., a broad host spectrum was detected for L. kirschneri which was the most common species detected in small mammals from this study. Besides this study is proving first evidence of L. kirschneri sequence types (ST) 110 and 117 as well as L. interrogans ST 24 in rodents from Germany. A focal occurrence of L. interrogans and L. kirschneri ST 117 was detected. In contrast, L. kirschneri ST 110 was present in most small mammal species at all three sites.
