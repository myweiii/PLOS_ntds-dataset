Recent evidences have associated P. vivax infections with clinical complications, previously only attributed to P. falciparum malaria. The interaction between host and parasite may contribute to severity of the disease, however, the specific contribution of each factor remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in Plasmodium vivax CSP may interfere in systemic reactions, response to drug treatments, leading to different symptoms as well as humoral responses. In this study, we investigate whether these polymorphisms could influence the parasite load and cytokine profile, which altogether may influence the malaria outcome. In this sense, studies have shown that subjects with high parasitic loads, responding with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines develop a more severe disease. The present data indicate that VK247 variant are associated with significant higher parasite loads and pro-inflammatory cytokine profile compared to VK210 variant. In this regard, this study demonstrates that P. vivax CSP polymorphisms have systemic effects in the host immune response, and the investigation of immunogenicity of parasite proteins may provide evidences for a better understanding of this infection.
