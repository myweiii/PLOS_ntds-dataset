Thrombocytopenia is one of the most prominent clinical features in dengue infection. This may manifest clinically as bleeding, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. For many years, clinicians have given dengue patients platelet transfusion in a bid to increase their platelet counts to prevent hemorrhagic manifestations. However, this practice has not been proven to reduce the risk of bleeding in dengue. Conversely, transfusion of blood products may be detrimental to patients as it can carry risks of fluid overload, transmission of infectious diseases and transfusion reactions. In this study, the authors found that platelet transfusion in the absence of bleeding in adult dengue patients did not prevent bleeding. Instead, this practice is associated with a slower platelet recovery and increased length of hospitalisation. These findings may contribute to better clinical management of thrombocytopenia in dengue patients and limit the use of these precious blood products.
