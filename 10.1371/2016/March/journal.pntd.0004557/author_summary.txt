Urogenital schistosomiasis represents a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in S. haematobium endemic countries. Treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) is effective at reducing or eliminating active infection, but does not prevent reinfection that remains a continuing problem in high-risk communities, especially in areas where contacts with infested water are inevitable. The efficacy of PZQ treatment is challenged by regular re-infection in high risk communities due to frequent contact with water infested with snails carrying the larvae of S. haematobium. A large number of countries have initiated schistosomiasis control and elimination programs based on repeated PZQ mass drug administration (MDA). However, little information is available on the impact of repeated treatment on S. haematobium transmission dynamics in areas where transmission occurs seasonally in temporary water bodies. This observational study assessed the effect of annual repeated cohort treatment with PZQ over 3 years on the seasonal transmission dynamics of S. haematobium in nine villages in Niakhar district, District. Repeated annual treatments have a considerable impact on the transmission dynamics of S. haematobium in Niakhar. The prevalence of S. haematobium was dramatically reduced from 57.7% in 2011 to 10.1% in 2014. The reinfection rate did not exceed 10% from 2012 to 2014. Also, the rate of infested Bulinid snails decreased from 0.8% in 2012 to 0.5% in 2013. These results suggest that it may be possible to implement urogenital schistosomiasis elimination strategies in the Niakhar district and other seasonal transmission areas in Senegal if praziquantel MDAs are carried out in combination with other measures such as health education, improvement of access to clean water and snail control.
