Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease, caused by infection with O. tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative bacterium that preferentially infects and replicates in the endothelium. Every year, approximately one million people are infected globally, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of tissue pathogenesis and immune responses in scrub typhus remain poorly understood. IL-33 is a damage-associated molecular pattern factor, which can modulate host inflammatory responses in several infectious diseases. In this study, we compared the severity of disease between wild-type (WT) and IL-33-/- mice infected with O. tsutsugamushi and used exogenous IL-33 to further examine the function of IL-33 during the infection. Our studies in mouse models, as well as in vitro studies in human endothelial cells, have revealed a pathogenic role of IL-33 in promoting endothelial cell stress, cellular apoptosis, tissue damage, and host death. This study will help us understand the pathogenesis of severe scrub typhus.
