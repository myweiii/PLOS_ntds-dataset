The Global Programme for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis has been conducting yearly treatment of entire communities in endemic countries since the year 2000. During the treatments various information is collected on the populations, number of medicine tablets distributed and remaining, the number of people treated, etc. that can be used to evaluate the performance of the lymphatic filariasis control programme. For example, information on the number of people treated in a District gives an indication of the success of the programme. In line with this, the World Health Organization in collaboration with other agencies developed a tool for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) to help national control programmes assemble and analyse their data. This study was undertaken to evaluate this tool and the information collected from some endemic communities in Ghana. Community registers were reviewed and personnel involved in drug distribution in the communities were interviewed to collect the necessary information. The results showed that more than half of the data reported in the endemic communities surveyed were inaccurate. It also revealed some weaknesses in the data management and reporting system. The tool, however, is good for identifying and quantifying the magnitude of the challenges encountered in the information management for NTD programmes, especially at peripheral levels.
