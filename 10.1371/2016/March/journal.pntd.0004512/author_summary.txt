Female mosquitoes require a blood meal to acquire the nutrients necessary for egg production. While feeding on host species, mosquitoes can transmit pathogens that cause several diseases including malaria, lymphatic filariasis and dengue. Understanding the mosquito host choice is important to better implement control strategies to reduce mosquito populations and therefore transmission of disease. Currently, the majority of methods for evaluating host species only test for the presence of pre-selected, expected hosts. Here, we describe an unbiased assay that combines amplification of any mammalian DNA with high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively characterize the composition of mosquito blood meals. We applied this approach to Anopheles mosquitoes collected in Papua New Guinea and observed that they fed on expected (humans, dogs and pigs) and unexpected hosts (mice, bats, marsupials). In addition, we show that 16.3% of mosquitoes fed on multiple hosts, from the same or different species. Overall, this approach enables unbiased characterization of mosquito blood meals and can be easily applied to significantly improve our understanding of the feeding behavior of any disease-transmitting insect.
