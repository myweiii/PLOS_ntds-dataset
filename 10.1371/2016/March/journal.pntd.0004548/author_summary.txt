Mark, release and recapture (MRR) is one of the most powerful techniques employed by field ecologists, and is used to provide relevant estimates of natural populations such as dispersal, survival rates, and population densities. A reliable, persistent and effective marking method is a sine qua non condition to conduct a MRR experiment. Despite their relevance as Chagas disease vectors in the Americas, triatomine bugs have seldom been subjected to MRR studies. So far, estimates on triatomine dispersal have largely relied on molecular/genetic approaches, which are not direct measurements of the distance between the release and recapture point. We evaluated the persistence and efficiency of trace elements, chemicals present in very low quantities in the organism of a targeted species, to mark the nymphs of three Chagas disease vectors of the Brazilian caatinga biome, Triatoma brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, and Rhodnius nasutus. At least one trace element was shown to be a good marker for each triatomine species: more than 97% of T. brasiliensis were still marked with Cr and Cu after 120 days; more than 95% of T. pseudomaculata were marked with Cu and Mn and more than 90% of R. nasutus were marked with Mn 120 days after marking. Only As-marked T. brasiliensis and Cd-marked R. nasutus nymphs had significantly shorter lifespan. We believe these findings show that trace elements are a reliable and persistent marking method for triatomine nymphs and hope this is the first step towards the development of meaningful ecological estimates through the application of the MRR methodology.
