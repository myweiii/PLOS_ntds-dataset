Rift Valley fever virus is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe disease in young ruminants and occasionally humans. The virus is largely confined to the African continent, but mosquito vectors associated with transmission of RVFV are globally prevalent. There are no vaccines fully registered for use outside endemic areas. Clone 13 is a highly effective vaccine virus that was previously reported to be safe for cattle and sheep. We here report the results of safety studies performed with young lambs and pregnant ewes according to the guidelines from the OIE and regulations of the EP. In line with these guidelines and regulations, the studies were performed with an overdose. Our results confirm that Clone 13 can be safely applied in young lambs and show that the virus does not spread to the environment or contact lambs and does not revert to virulence upon animal-to-animal passage. However, inoculation of gestating ewes resulted in transmission of Clone 13 to the fetus and was associated with malformations and stillbirths.
