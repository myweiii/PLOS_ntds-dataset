COST action CM1307 members made valuable comments on some of the approaches. We deeply thank the excellent work and help provided by the Flow Cytometry Service from the UCM in the FACS analysis and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology IV (UCM) for access to their equipment and the advice provided for the calcium measurement.
