Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most malaria cases outside Africa but remains poorly understood. Here we describe a high-throughput assay that enables genotyping more than 100 SNPs in 96 samples simultaneously. We applied this assay to characterize P. vivax genetic diversity in ~500 individual infections collected throughout Cambodia and including multiple time points. Our analyses revealed that the Cambodian P. vivax population is very diverse genetically but geographically homogenous, without any obvious boundaries. We also observed that almost all infected individuals carried more than one P. vivax parasite, though the proportion of single parasite infections tends to increase in recent years. Our study illustrates how genetic information can be generated to monitor temporal and geographical variations in parasite populations and help assess the efficacy of malaria control programs.
