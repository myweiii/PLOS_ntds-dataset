Melioidosis is an endemic tropical disease in South East Asia and Northern Australia, which is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental bacterium found in the soils of paddy fields and muddy waters across these regions. The bacterium is known to reside within the host cell for prolonged periods of time and is capable of causing long-lasting disease. Recurrent disease is common even with appropriate antibiotic treatments. The mechanisms behind the persistence of B. pseudomallei in the host are still unclear. We investigated the host cell-mediated immune responses against persistent B. pseudomallei infection in BALB/c mice. We found a reduced CD4+ T-cell frequency in mice with persistent B. pseudomallei infection, suggestive of the key role of these cells in experimental melioidosis. Moreover, we also observed significant upregulation of PD-1 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice with persistent B. pseudomallei infection, possibly indicating that the T cells were undergoing exhaustion. Based on our results, we postulated that B. pseudomallei is able to impair host immune responses, likely by facilitating the depletion of CD4+ T cells and upregulation of PD-1 on T cells, which potentially facilitates bacterial persistence in the host. Targeting T-cell responses could be an approach to develop vaccines or therapeutics against persistent B. pseudomallei infection.
