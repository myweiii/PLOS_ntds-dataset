Melioidosis is a common disease in Northern Australia and East Asia, with regional mortality rates of up to 40%. Clinical manifestations range from soft tissue infections to severe sepsis. It is caused by the Gram negative saprophytic water and soil bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which forms a variety of colony morphologies on solid agar. Various morphotypes appear after the bacterium is exposed to physiological stress conditions or underwent the process of infection, yet the physiological function is unclear. Metabolism is closely linked to virulence in many pathogens, and since metabolic data are not available so far for this bacterium, we monitored the nutrition uptake and metabolite secretion of B. pseudomallei morphotypes. Interestingly, despite typical genes responsible for gluconate production are missing in the B. pseudomallei genome, we observed high amounts of gluconate in the extracellular space. Furthermore, we were able to investigate metabolic differences among the morphotypes and identified synchronization in morphology and metabolism after infection as an adaptation to the host environment.
