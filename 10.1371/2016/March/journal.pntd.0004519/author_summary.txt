We provide evidence that sandfly-borne phleboviruses belonging to 3 distinct genetic and phylogenetic groups (Sandfly fever Naples virus [SFNV], Sandfly fever Sicilian virus [SFSV], and Salehabad virus [SALV]) co-circulate in Adana city, in Mediterranean Turkey. While Adana virus was recently described as a new member of the SALV species, Zerdali and Toros viruses are described here as new phleboviruses genetically closely related to SFNV and SFSV, respectively. In this study, isolated and characterised these two new viruses by determining their complete genome sequence and by phylogenetic analysis. This study demonstrates that 3 distinct viruses can co-circulate in the same geographic area and based on their phylogenetic relationships and association with sandflies are likely to be transmitted by these arthropod vectors. Our molecular and phylogenetic data are important for establishing group-specific molecular detection assays in order to further understand of the possible impact of these viruses in animal and human health in this region of Turkey.
