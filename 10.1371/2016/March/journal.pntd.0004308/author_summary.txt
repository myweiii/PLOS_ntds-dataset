Leishmania sp. is an obligate intracellular parasite encounter toxic oxidative and nitrosative species (ROS and RNS) during infection, yet a subset of parasites infect and replicate within mammalian macrophages and eventually lead to disease symptoms. Polyamine synthesis, which is essential to counter the toxic effect of ROS and RNS, is largely dependent on the availability of L-arginine in the intracellular milieu. Argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) plays an important role as the rate-limiting step required for converting L-citrulline to argininosuccinate to provide arginine. To assess the involvement of ASS in stress management, a cell line lacking two of three LdASS-/-/+alleles, with greatly reduced ASS activity, was generated by a double-targeted gene replacement strategy in L. donovani promastigote. The free thiol levels in the LdASS-/-/+ mutant cell line were decreased. Furthermore, in L-arginine depleted medium the viability of the mutant cell line was greatly attenuated on exposure to different stress environments. The LdASS-/-/+ mutant cell line was adversely impacted in its ability to infect mice. These findings suggest that ASS is important for Leishmania donovani to survive in stressed environments and can be exploited as anti-leishmanial drug target.
