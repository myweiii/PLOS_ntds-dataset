Dengue fever has increased dramatically over the past 50 years and today is the most widespread mosquito-borne arboviral disease, affecting nearly half the worldâ€™s population in 128 countries. Until the arrival of a vaccine, control of its Aedes vectors has been the only method to prevent dengue infection. With dengue outbreaks occurring at increasing frequency and intensity, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, to evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of vector control strategies currently available. Forty-one studies (from 5 months to 10 years duration) were included in the review. Most studies investigated combinations of approaches but only 9 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Remarkably, no RCTs evaluated effectiveness against dengue of insecticide space-spraying (outdoor fogging), the main response to dengue outbreaks used worldwide. Nevertheless, there was limited evidence indicating that house screening and to a lesser extent, community-based environmental management with water container covers could reduce risk of dengue infection. However, skin repellents, bed nets and mosquito traps had no effect while insecticide aerosols and mosquito coils were associated with higher dengue risk. However, the quality of the few studies eligible for inclusion was poor overall, and the evidence base is very weak, compromising the knowledge base for making recommendations on delivery of appropriate and effective control. Given this paucity of reliable evidence, standardised studies of higher quality must now be a priority.
