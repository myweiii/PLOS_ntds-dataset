Dengue fever is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide, affecting 50 to 100 million individuals annually. The clinical picture associated with acute dengue virus (DENV) infections ranges from classical febrile illness to life-threatening disease. The innate immunity is the first line of defense in the control of viral replication. In this article, we examine the particular role of natural killer (NK) cells in DENV infection at different time points after the onset of symptoms. This extensive study was performed in comparison with patients infected by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), another major arbovirus transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, and co-infected CHIKV/DENV-2 patients. We observed that DENV2 and CHIKV induced different signatures of NK-cell responses suggesting specific roles in the control of both infections.
