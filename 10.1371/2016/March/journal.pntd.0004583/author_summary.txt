Chagas disease is a parasitic disorder caused by the infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In Latin America, this disease represents a major public health concern, as almost 6 million people are currently infected. During the last years, great efforts have been made in health policy to control the disease; however, there is still a long way ahead to achieve this challenging goal. Most affected people remains asymptomatic after infection for the rest of their lives, but around one third of infected people may develop cardiomyopathy, a condition that reduces dramatically the quality of life and life expectancy in Chagas patients. The causes of the marked differential disease outcomes are currently unknown, but it is believed that a genetic predisposition could play a relevant role in the host. We investigated in an endemic region of Colombia whether the IL18 gene, which is involved in the immune response to intracellular pathogens like T. cruzi, is related to a higher susceptibility to infection or disease severity. Our results suggest that IL18 is a relevant gene in Chagas disease, and could represent a valuable insight that may help to better understand the disease pathogenesis and the development of more efficient therapeutic strategies.
