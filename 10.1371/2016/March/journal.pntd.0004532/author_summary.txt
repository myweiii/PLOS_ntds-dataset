Ascariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the intestinal nematode Ascaris lumbricoides that affects hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. Current methods for diagnosis of this infection are based on detecting eggs in the stool that are excreted by adult Ascaris worms. However, these methods have limited sensitivity for recent infections, and they do not detect infections with immature parasite stages that do not always result in the establishment of adult worms in the human intestine. We have previously shown that an assay for antibodies to Ascaris hemoglobin in pig serum is useful for assessing transmission of Ascaris infections on pig farms. In this study, we developed and evaluated a similar antibody assay that is based on the detection of human IgG4 antibodies to Ascaris haemoglobin (AsHb). Community antibody rates decreased rapidly following mass drug administration of the anthelmintic drug albendazole, and this decrease reflected reduced Ascaris egg excretion at the community level. This antibody test may be a useful tool for assessing the impact of control measures on the transmission of new Ascaris infections in endemic populations.
