Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) refers to skin ulcers caused by the Leishmania parasite, which is transmitted by the bite of sandflies. In Ethiopia, CL is caused by the Leishmania aethiopica parasite. CL in Ethiopia can be associated with severe and complicated disease such as diffuse CL (DCL), which presents with multiple skin lesions spread over the body. For such severe cases, topically applied treatment is not sufficient and systemic treatment (given in tablets or via injections) is required. Although the total number of patients that suffer from CL in Ethiopia is high, there are no evidence-based treatment guidelines. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies reporting on treatment outcomes of CL due to L aethiopica. We identified a total of 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL presumably due to L aethiopica. The most commonly used drugs were antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy. Most studies were case reports or case series. There were two small clinical trials and two prospective non-randomized studies. However, all studies had some methodological limitations. With cryotherapy, cure rates were 60–80%, and 69–85% with antimonials. Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, also in cases that did not improve on antimonials. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin and liposomal amphotericin B are extremely scarce. Only a few studies were available on DCL. The evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L aethiopica is extremely limited. While antimonials remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, more data on the efficacy and safety in CL are needed. High quality trials on CL due to L aethiopica are urgently needed, evaluating treatments beyond antimonials. Interesting options in the short term are drugs such as miltefosine, paromomycin and liposomal amphotericin B, as they are currently available in Ethiopia for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.
