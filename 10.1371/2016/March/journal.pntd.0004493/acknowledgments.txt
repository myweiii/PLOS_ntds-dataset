We acknowledge the valuable inputs to this systematic review of the participants of the PAHO/WHO regional meeting on schistosomiasis elimination held in San Juan, Puerto Rico (October 2014) and colleagues of the Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis Department of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (particularly LGC and MIS). ACZ worked as a PAHO consultant for this review.
