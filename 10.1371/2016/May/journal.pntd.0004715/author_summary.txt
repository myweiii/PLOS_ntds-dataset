Leishmania spp. are protozoan parasites that cause a spectrum of human diseases, and L. braziliensis causes chronic inflammatory skin lesions in residents of endemic regions of Latin America. Leishmania are obligate intracellular parasites in mammalian hosts, found in macrophages throughout infection. Nonetheless, other cell types including neutrophils also take up the parasite, but the role of neutrophils throughout chronic leishmaniasis remains unclear. We analyzed circulating neutrophils from patients in northeast Brazil with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. braziliensis, compared to healthy controls from the same region. Our data revealed that neutrophils from both infected and healthy hosts took up comparable numbers of parasites, and parasite phagocytosis induced similar degrees of neutrophil activation. However, CL patient neutrophils produced more reactive oxidants than control neutrophils, and increased amounts of the chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL9 after parasite exposure. Interestingly, according to surface markers of PMN activation (CD62L, CD66b), we found that L. braziliensis activates both infected and uninfected “bystander” neutrophils from both patients and controls. Importantly, repeated measures showed the production of reactive oxidants and chemokine release were significantly decreased after therapeutic cure of infection. These data suggest that CL promotes a heightened inflammatory state in circulating neutrophils during active infection.
