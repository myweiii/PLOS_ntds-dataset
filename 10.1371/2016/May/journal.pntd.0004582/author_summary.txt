Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread of the malaria species affecting humans. It has the ability for parasites to lie dormant in liver cells and then to relapse weeks or months later, causing further blood-stage infections and onward transmission. Relapses present a challenge to control and elimination programs. The contribution of relapses to the force of blood-stage infection is not well established. While genotyping can distinguish individual infections, the difficulty lies in the inability to distinguish primary infections (occurring shortly after an infectious mosquito bite) and relapses. This is a gap in the knowledge of the epidemiology of P vivax. We develop a statistical model to tease out and estimate the contributions of primary infections and relapses to the force of blood-stage infection. We use data from a cohort of children in Papua New Guinea with genotyped routine blood samples. The study area has both P vivax and P falciparum malaria: we use the seasonality of P falciparum to estimate the seasonality of P vivax primary infections. We also take into account infections occurring prior to the study period and their subsequent relapses during the study period. We find that approximately 80% of the force of blood-stage infection l is contributed by relapses and that primary infections and relapses have different seasonal patterns. The findings are important to the epidemiology of P vivax and for designing intervention strategies targeting different stages of the parasite life cycle.
