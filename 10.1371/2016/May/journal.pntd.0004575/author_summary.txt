Dengue infection, especially severe dengue, affected more of adults from working age groups in the society. They can present with non-specific symptoms mimicking many other febrile illnesses, or severe symptoms suggestive of sepsis, with low suspicion of dengue. The clinical progression in severe dengue can be dynamic and sometimes unanticipated, whereby patients can deteriorate rapidly in a short period of time and succumb to death. Although children tend to have central nervous system involvement, where they presented with confusion and/ or seizure, and more elderly had heart involvement, the primary cause of dengue death, dengue shock syndrome, did not differ across different age groups.
