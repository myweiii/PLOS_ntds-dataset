Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in infected humans. An effective live-attenuated vaccine, 17D, was developed in 1937 and continues to be used today. Over the past several years, a number of cases of vaccine-associated disease have been identified and linked to a compromised immune status. In the studies presented here we evaluated the susceptibility of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) to YFV infection, their cytokine response to infection and their ability to interact with and stimulate CD4+ T cells. These studies found that macrophages and DCs derived from both humans and non-human primates were susceptible to infection with either a wild-type Asibi YFV or the 17D vaccine virus, that the two viruses stimulated different cytokine responses in these cells and that human DCs infected with the 17D virus were able to stimulate CD4+ T cells while those infected with Asibi virus did not. These data demonstrate clear differences between the wild-type and vaccine viruses that may be related to the success of the 17D vaccine. These data also suggest that wild-type YFV may be able to inhibit critical components of the immune response to allow virus propagation and dissemination.
