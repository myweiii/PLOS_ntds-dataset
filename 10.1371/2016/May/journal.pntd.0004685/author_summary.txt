Ocular toxoplasmosis affects millions of people worldwide and is a cause of severe vision loss. Prospective studies on the disease are rare and require long and expensive follow-ups. A network of intricate host and parasite factors can influence its evolution and its treatment is still subject of discussion and controversy. This article describes clinical features in a series of cases prospectively followed, confirming findings of previous studies conducted in other continents, despite the probable genetic variability of the evaluated populations and parasite. In addition, brings insights into the course of the disease and causes of visual impairment that may help future studies on strategies for treatment and prevention.
