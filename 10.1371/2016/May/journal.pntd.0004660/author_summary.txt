Leishmania braziliensis is the most prevalent species isolated from patients displaying either cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in South America. In this study, we developed a transgenic luciferase-expressing L. braziliensis line. These parasites were passaged in hamsters and mice and then transformed back into promastigotes. Once inoculated subcutaneously in the footpad of young laboratory animalsâ€”BALB/c mice or golden hamsters, rapid and sustained footpad thickness increase developed. This experimental model was used to monitor the parasite load fluctuations and the response to miltefosine treatment. Mice were treated orally over a two-week period, starting at week 4 post-inoculation. Though such a regimen was shown to display efficacy, the effect was not sustained and both parasite re-expansion and delayed footpad thickness increase were noticed.
