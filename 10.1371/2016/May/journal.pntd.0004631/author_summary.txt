The asymmetry of research training between high and low and middle income countries (LMICs) and the resulting need for research capacity strengthening (RCS) in under-resourced regions has long been established. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO), through the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), launched the Career Development Fellowship (CDF) programme, in which LMICsâ€™ candidates spend one year in a pharmaceutical company to be trained in product development and clinical research and then return to their home institution. Between August 2012 and April 2013, the programme underwent an independent external evaluation from the perspectives of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and impact, and sustainability. In addition to analysis of data and documentation, programme managers, current and former fellows, home and host institutions participated in the evaluation through surveys and interviews. In the current article, the external evaluators, along with CDF programme managers, discuss the results of the evaluation in the broader context of individual and institutional RCS, underlining CDF successes, including transmitting essential skills and networks, and addressing the challenge and fundamental importance of integrating fellows, home and host institutions into an on-going relationship that solidifies and amplifies the benefits of the one-year experience.
