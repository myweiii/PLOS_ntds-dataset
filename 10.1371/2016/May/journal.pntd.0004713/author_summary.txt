Leptospirosis is one of the most relevant and spread zoonotic and neglected infectious diseases affecting humans and other mammals, and is caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira. During infectious diseases, when bacterial pathogens control and/or modulate the host response, impaired hemostasis and inflammation are frequently observed. Here we studied the effects of leptospires and their secreted products on stimulation of human intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation, showing that both coagulation cascades are modulated in response to Leptospira or leptospiral secreted proteins. We further find that activation of the coagulation cascades culminates in the release of the pro-inflammatory mediator bradykinin and noted an induction of pro-coagulant microvesicles. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the local and systemic hemostastic complications during leptospirosis. Collectively, our results show how leptospires can affect host responses, possibly leading to altered host responses during the disease and giving rise to the leptospirosis symptomatology.
