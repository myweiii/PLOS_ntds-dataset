Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of death in young children worldwide. Cryptosporidium species are responsible for a large proportion of global burden of diarrhea. This study describes the natural history of cryptosporidiosis in a birth cohort of impoverished Bangladeshi children. Children were enrolled at birth and monitored for diarrhea twice a week for two years. Stool samples were tested for enteric protozoa. Children in this cohort had significant rates of malnutrition compared to the W.H.O. reference population, and extreme poverty was common. A majority of children were infected with Cryptosporidium spp, and we found that children who had at least one infection with Cryptosporidium spp during the two year follow up period were significantly more likely to have growth faltering by age 24 months. Cryptosporidiosis is a common infection in this cohort, and is associated with poverty and reduced growth during the first two years of life.
