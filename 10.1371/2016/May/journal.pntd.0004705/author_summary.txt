This manuscript address essential issues regarding the current and future challenges of a dengue surveillance system. Dengue fever is one of the major public health threats in a large area of the world, including Brazil which represents around 70% of the cases in the Americas. The dengue surveillance system in Brazil was established in 1986, but evaluations of this surveillance system were rarely conducted. The need for accurate data is of paramount importance due to not only the increase of severe cases in the past decade, but also to monitor the impact of a vaccine as soon as it occurs. The evaluation of the sensitivity of surveillance system is a challenge, due to the lack of a gold standard. In our study, we took advantage of two very well structured and independent information systems with nationwide coverage. The hospitalization information system was defined as the gold standard for hospitalized cases in the public health system and compared to the notifiable diseases information system using a probabilistic record linkage. Therefore, we were able to evaluate the sensitivity of the dengue surveillance system in detecting hospitalized cases in ten capital cities from 2008 to 2013 in Brazil.
