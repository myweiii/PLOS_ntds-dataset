The study of malaria epidemiology and the spatial distributions of both malaria cases and vectors of malaria are essential for the elimination of this disease. Although Panama experienced a malaria epidemic in the early 2000s, this country reports fewer than 1,000 autochthonous cases each year. By understanding the risk factors for Plasmodium transmission and the locations of hot spots, vector and malaria control interventions can be targeted to both high risk individuals and regions, to maximize impact. In this research article, our results underscore the health disparities experienced by the indigenous people of Panama, as we identify them as those at greatest risk of malaria and their comarcas (indigenous reservations) as transmission hot spots. Additionally, we are able to implicate Anopheles albimanus as the primary vector of malaria in Panama through testing of collected specimens for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum infection and by calculating the odds of co-occurrence of both vectors with cases of malaria throughout Panama.
