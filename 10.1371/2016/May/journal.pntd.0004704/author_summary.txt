Dengue fever, caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, is a public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue Rapid Diagnostic Tests, in which a drop of blood is loaded onto a paper strip in a plastic cassette, are simple to use and have good diagnostic accuracy. They are becoming the test of choice for the management of dengue epidemics, especially in rural areas without laboratory facilities. However, four types of dengue virus circulate in most tropical areas and their patterns of circulation are of epidemiological importance since they play a role in the severity and propagation of the disease. We show, for the first time, that molecular amplification permitting dengue virus detection and typing can be performed directly from used positive RDTs, that can easily be transported. This novel approach has promising prospects for the collection of dengue epidemiological data from previously inaccessible tropical areas to aid surveillance and public health interventions.
