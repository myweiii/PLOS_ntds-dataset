Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease that is common throughout the tropics. Despite a long history in humans and extensive efforts to control dengue transmission in many countries, the number, severity, and geographic range of reported cases is increasing. Most control efforts have focused on controlling mosquito populations, but the main vector, Aedes aegypti, flourishes in human-disturbed and indoor environments. Because the mosquitoes prefer to bite during the day when people are active and potentially moving around high-risk locations, fixed barriers like bed nets are not effective. Several dengue vaccines are being actively developed and may become valuable tools in dengue control. Using historical dengue data from Yucatán, Mexico, we fit a detailed simulation of human and mosquito populations to project future transmission, then used efficacy data from vaccine trials to evaluate the benefit of potential vaccination deployment strategies in the region. For a durable vaccine, we find that population-level, annual vaccine effectiveness approaches 65% by the end of the 20-year forecast period. For waning vaccines, however, effectiveness is greatly reduced–and sometimes negative–unless booster vaccinations are used.
