In 2012 a comprehensive national serosurvey to assess immunity to vaccine preventable diseases such as polio, rubella, measles, and tetanus was conducted among women of child bearing age in Cambodia. We were able to test this sample set using a multiplex bead assay in order to measure specific antibody responses to the parasites that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis, lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, and strongyloidiasis. National prevalence estimates generated from the serologic data show widespread exposure (>45% positive) to the soil transmitted nematode worm, Strongyloides stercoralis. In contrast, <5% of women were positive for antibodies to P. falciparum malaria, P. vivax malaria, and lymphatic filariasis, and antibody-positive women were mainly found in the North region of the country. Women who were positive for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Taenia solium (5.8% and 2.6% of the population, respectively) were not clustered in any particular geographic region. With this study we have shown how the integration of a multiplex assay into a national serosurvey can provide useful information on the prevalence and distributions of medically important parasitic infections.
