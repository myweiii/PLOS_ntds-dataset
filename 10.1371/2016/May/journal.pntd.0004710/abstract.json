    "Background": "Previously we reported that Kala-azar patients show progressive decrease in serum cholesterol as a function of splenic parasite burden. Splenic macrophages (M\u03a6) of Leishmania donovani (LD) infected mice show decrease in membrane cholesterol, while LD infected macrophages (I-M\u03a6) show defective T cell stimulating ability that could be corrected by liposomal delivery of cholesterol. T helper cells recognize peptide antigen in the context of class II MHC molecule. It is known that the conformation of a large number of membrane proteins is dependent on membrane cholesterol. In this investigation we tried to understand the influence of decreased membrane cholesterol in I-M\u03a6 on the conformation of MHC-II protein and peptide-MHC-II stability, and its bearing on the antigen specific T-cell activation.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "M\u03a6 of CBA/j mice were infected with Leishmania donovani (I-M\u03a6). Two different anti-A\u03ba mAbs were used to monitor the status of MHC-II protein under parasitized condition. One of them (11.5\u20132) was conformation specific, whereas the other one (10.2.16) was not. Under parasitized condition, the binding of 11.5\u20132 decreased significantly with respect to the normal counterpart, whereas that of 10.2.16 remained unaltered. The binding of 11.5\u20132 was restored to normal upon liposomal delivery of cholesterol in I-M\u03a6. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies we found that there was considerable conformational fluctuation in the transmembrane domain of the MHC-II protein in the presence of membrane cholesterol than in its absence, which possibly influenced the distal peptide binding groove. This was evident from the faster dissociation of the cognate peptide from peptide-MHC complex under parasitized condition, which could be corrected by liposomal delivery of cholesterol in I-M\u03a6.",
    "Conclusion": "The decrease in membrane cholesterol in I-M\u03a6 may lead to altered conformation of MHC II, and this may contribute to a faster dissociation of the peptide. Furthermore, liposomal delivery of cholesterol in I-M\u03a6 restored its normal antigen presenting function. This observation brings strength to our previous observation on host directed therapeutic application of liposomal cholesterol in experimental visceral leishmaniasis."
