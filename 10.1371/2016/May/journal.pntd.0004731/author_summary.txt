Dengue has become the leading cause of mosquito-borne virus infections worldwide. Despite considerable effort, development of a successful vaccine against dengue virus (DENV) has been challenging due to the co-circulation of the four DENV serotypes in endemic areasâ€”to which humans develop distinct immune responses, and the increased risk of severe disease in those with pre-existing immunity to one serotype when they are infected with a different serotype. In this study, we investigated the responses in macaques to vaccination with the tetravalent, live-attenuated vaccine, TDV, by different doses and routes of vaccine administration. We identify changes in macaque gene expression that occurred in the days immediately following vaccination with TDV, a time-period that is difficult to study during natural infection. The gene expression response was characterized by features of the innate immune response to virus, notably the type I interferon response, and began the day after TDV vaccination. This response correlated with the development of neutralizing antibodies, which means that it might serve as an early indicator of a subsequent protective immune response to dengue vaccines.
