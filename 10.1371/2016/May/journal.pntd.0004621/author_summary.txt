As reported in Porcasi et al., in Argentina we are working on an integrated risk stratification system based in geospatial technologies that have moderately consolidated national scale, but need more understanding of its urban scale mechanisms. In this work, relevant results are shown on how Ae. aegypti breeding sites are distributed in dynamic spatial patterns in a small city on northern Argentina. 5 years of entomologic data were obtained by Mundo Sano Foundation, which is implementing an Aedes aegypti Surveillance and Control Program in Tartagal City (Salta Province, Argentina). The focus of this contribution is based on the difference that can found between one year data typical analysis and long term temporal evolution of spatial patterns. Although environmental sanitation activities and chemical control of breeding sites with larvicide were performed after each entomological surveillance all around Tartagal, sectors with higher densities of breeding sites remained present throughout study period. Nonetheless, the distribution of breeding sites showed a spatial dynamic with high density clusters in city outskirts.
