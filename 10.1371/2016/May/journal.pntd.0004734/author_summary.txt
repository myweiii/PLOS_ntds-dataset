Trachoma is initiated by repeated infection of the conjunctiva throughout childhood by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). Conjunctival inflammation and scarring progress throughout the lives of many adults even in the absence of Ct infection, causing the eyelashes to turn inwards (trichiasis) and damage the cornea, resulting in severe pain and eventually leading to blindness. The factors sustaining the inflammation that drives scarring are not understood and there is no treatment to halt scarring progression. We sought to define the phenotypes of immune cells infiltrating the conjunctiva during trichiasis. Eyelid tissue from 34 individuals with trichiasis and 33 control individuals was stained with dyes or specific antibodies to distinguish immune cell subsets. Increased inflammatory cells were detected in individuals with trichiasis even when clinical signs of inflammation were not apparent. Staining of immune cell types pointed to an increased infiltration of natural killer cells in tissue from individuals with trichiasis. These cells may cause tissue damage through cytokine secretion and cell lysis. Surprisingly, a large number of infiltrating immune cells lacked the classical immune cell marker CD45. The phenotype and function of these CD45 negative cells and their role in scarring trachoma warrants further study.
