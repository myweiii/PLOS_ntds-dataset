Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are debilitating diseases caused by infections with filarial nematodes. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate these infections as public health problems. Despite prolonged control efforts, including chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA), transmission and infections persist. Addition of a microfilaricide that is efficacious in a short regimen would enhance prospects for achieving elimination goals. We investigated the long-term effects of the macrofilaricidal drug, flubendazole (FLBZ), on Brugia malayi. Adult parasites were exposed in culture to FLBZ at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (100 nM—10 μM) for up to 24 hr prior to implantation into the abdominal cavity of a jird for long-term maintenance. The greatest drug effect was on embryogenesis; morphological damage was most evident in early developmental stages. There was also a decrease in the release of microfilaria (mf) from the adult. Interestingly, no damage was observed to fully formed mf. Although further studies are required to determine to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to a field setting, an exposure profile which may produce similar effects in vivo has been defined.
