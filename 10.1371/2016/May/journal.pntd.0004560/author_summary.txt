The World Health Organization (WHO) has set ambitious time-bound targets for the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Investing in NTDs is seen as good value for money and as a pro-poor policy. We analyzed 1990 and 2010 burden estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 for nine selected NTDs. These data show that the NTD disease burden is strongly concentrated in low and lower-middle income countries in 1990 and 2010. The global burden from these nine NTDs declined by 27% between 1990 and 2010, but the reduction was only 6% in the low income countries compared to 56% in upper-middle income countries, explaining the trend of increasing concentration of the burden in the poorest countries. This trend would be rectified if the WHO targets were met, supporting the pro-poor designation of public policies against NTDs.
