Chikungunya virus has caused a series of outbreaks in the Pacific from 2011, including French Polynesia. Aedes (Ae.) aegypti mosquito, which has colonized almost all Pacific Island Countries, is reasonably expected to have been involved in the chikungunya outbreaks. In addition, endemic Aedes mosquito species may have sustained chikungunya virus transmission in the less urbanized and most remote islands. In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of French Polynesian populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis to replicate, disseminate and transmit chikungunya virus under experimental conditions. Our results provide for the first time clear evidence for Ae. polynesiensis to act as an efficient chikungunya vector. These findings corroborate previous observation that endemic Aedes species, like Ae. hensilli in Yap Island, may play a critical role in sustaining chikungunya virus transmission, in place or together with the widely distributed Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. In a context where innovative vector control strategies are mostly focused on targeting the mosquito species considered as the main arbovirus vectors, the potential for endemic Aedes species to take the lead in transmitting such arboviruses should not be neglected.
