There are few validated and fully characterised targets suitable for drug discovery against African trypanosomes, causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Here we report the biochemical properties of the bifunctional enzyme, dihydrofolate reductaseâ€“thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and its susceptibility to a range of classical inhibitors normally used in the treatment of cancer, bacterial or protozoal infections. Some of these drugs are extremely potent against the isolated enzyme, but much less so against the intact trypanosome. We have found that modulating certain medium components can affect drug sensitivity, presumably by either competition for uptake and competition for the active site of DHFR-TS. In the case of one human TS inhibitor (raltitrexed) the inhibitor is more potent against the intact parasite. We propose that addition of extra glutamic acid residues not only improves retention in the cell, but also increases potency against TS, as it does in human cells.
