Chagas disease (ChD), which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately 8 million people worldwide. ChD is known as a neglected tropical disease. The disease is endemic in South and Central American countries, and is an emerging issue in North America and Europe. This study examined, for the first time, the association between genomic ancestry and T. cruzi infection, Chagasic cardiomyopathy and its ability to predict long term mortality. Our results show that persons with higher levels of African and Native American ancestries (and the reverse for European ancestry) are more likely to be infected with T. cruzi. However, genomic ancestry had no effect on either Chagasic cardiomyopathy or on its ability to predict mortality. Whether the association between T. cruzi infection and genomic ancestry is a consequence of genetic susceptibility or differential exposure to infection due to poor socioeconomic circumstances over the life course, remains to be determined.
