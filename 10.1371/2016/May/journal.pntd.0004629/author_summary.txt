Schistosome infections are a major public health problem and currently 230 million people are infected with these blood-dwelling parasitic helminths. Schistosomiasis remains the most prevalent parasitic disease in the Sudan and control of the infection relies on large-scale administration of praziquantel. Although treatment is immediately effective, it is not a cure and therefore as soon as individuals re-enter freshwater sources with infected vectors, they are at risk of being re-infected. Therefore, increasing access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation are important measures to reduce the risk of schistosome infection. During this study people from endemic areas in the Sudan were classified according to the presence of S. mansoni DNA in sera or eggs in stool samples and all analysed with regards to epidemiological and immunological parameters. In addition samples from S. mansoni infection-free individuals from the same endemic regions were used as controls. Our findings suggest that epidemiological factors and immune responses to schistosomes depend on the actual infection status (patent versus pre-patent/low egg producing). This improves our understanding of the biology of the disease which facilitates the development of techniques to identify early stages of pathology (fibrosis) which could help prevent further damage and morbidity.
