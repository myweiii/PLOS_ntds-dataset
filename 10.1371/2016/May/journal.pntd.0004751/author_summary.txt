The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is mainly transmitted faecal-orally via human-to-human contact or via environmental water sources in which V. cholerae is able to persist. West Africa, including Ghana, is regularly affected by Cholera epidemics, in particular during rainy seasons. In 2014, Ghana experienced an exceptionally large outbreak with over 20,000 cases, which raised questions about newly emerging V. cholerae strains in this region. In this study, we described the duration, the geographical spread and demographics of the outbreak using data from the National Ghanaian Surveillance system. Further, we characterized outbreak isolates from the outbreak years 2011, 2012 and 2014 by three different subtyping methods. These analyses revealed strains with different genetic background and increasing antibiotic resistance circulating during each outbreak year. These data suggest that V. cholerae has an endemic reservoir in the environment and selection pressure results in a highly heterogeneous population of V. cholerae with a few strains evolving into pathogenic clones during each outbreak period. Public health authorities must be vigilant to prevent cholera transmission through aquatic reservoirs, particularly within urban agglomerations during the start of the rainy season. The rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance has to be monitored closely.
