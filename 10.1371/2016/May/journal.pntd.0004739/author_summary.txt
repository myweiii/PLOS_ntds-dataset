Cutaneous leishmaniasis is tropical and subtropical worldwide vector-borne disease produced by protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania that include over 20 species and produce an estimated 0.7 million to 1.3 million new cases annually. The disease features are dependent on the patient immunological stage, the parasite biology and to some extent are determined by the geographic regions in which it occurs. New World cutaneous infections known as American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) are associated with metastatic sequelae and treatment failure. In the present study we found that in patients with ACL infected in the Colombian Amazon and Orinoco regions and not responding to Glucantime treatment, the predominant species was L. braziliensis. In addition 35% of these lesion-isolated parasites show some level of drug resistance. We also found that these resistant parasites display reduced competence when infecting the human monocytic cell line U-937 in “in vitro” tests and are associated with lesions of reduced size. According to our findings the indication for a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives in patients with ACL that did not respond to the first round of treatment is arguable.
