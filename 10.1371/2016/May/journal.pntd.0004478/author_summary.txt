An increased prevalence of epilepsy has been reported in many onchocerciasis (river blindness) endemic areas. In 2014, an epilepsy prevalence study was conducted in Dingila and Titule, two localities within the onchocerciasis endemic Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, both within the Bas-Uélé district. The prevalence of epilepsy was 2.9% in Dingila, and 2.3% in Titule. This is much higher than the epilepsy prevalence in non-onchocerciasis endemic regions in Africa. Epilepsy cases were clustered within and between adjacent households. Living close to a river infested with blackflies (the main vector of Onchocerca microfilariae) was found to be a risk factor for epilepsy.
