In Ecuador, leishmaniasis is endemic in Pacific coast subtropical, Amazonian, and Andean highland areas. Seven Leishmania species, Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) major-like, Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis, L. (V.) panamensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (V.) naiffi, are reported to be associated with human cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniases (MCL). Causative parasites have been studied extensively in Pacific coast and Andean areas; however, information such as prevalent Leishmania species and their vector sand fly species is very sparse in Amazonian areas. Giemsa-stained smears taken from patientsâ€™ skin ulcers and used for routine diagnosis of CL and Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) card-spotted samples were utilized as DNA sources, and causative parasites were identified on the basis of cytochrome b gene analysis. Causative parasites in 25 samples were successfully identified, and, in addition to previously reported species, L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) lainsoni was identified from two patients living in different areas situated more than 200 km apart. Sand flies were examined in areas where one of the L. (V.) lainsoni infected patient was suspected to have been infected. Although 1,104 female sand flies were dissected and examined for species identification and detection of natural infection with flagellates in the gut, human-infective Leishmania species including L. (V.) lainsoni were not detected. Further extensive investigation of sand fly fauna is necessary to incriminate the vector of this parasite in Ecuador.
