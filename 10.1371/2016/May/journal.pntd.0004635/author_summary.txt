Human angiostrongyliasis is a neurological helminthic disease caused by the lung worm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, and most cases are reported from Asia, particularly Thailand and China. In Mayotte, an overseas French Territory in the Indian Ocean, cases are rare but regular, with life-threatening clinical pictures in very young children, though the medical literature describes this disease as mild, even in children. We aimed to study this disease in the specific context of the Indian Ocean. We found that, although this disease is quite rare: 14 cases in a study period of 6 years, with evidence among children, and mainly (13/14) those less than 2 years old, and its prognosis is poor as the 1-year mortality rate was 35.7%, and neurological sequelae 42.7% of the survivors. The real time PCR performed on the CSF was a sensitive tool. The occurrence of cases was temporarily and geographically linked to rain, and 9.4% of the collected Achatina fulica, the giant African snails, were positive for the parasite with high parasitic loads. The specific epidemiology is linked to the bad habit of the young children to lick the snails, which are present everywhere on the island, and have a severe presentation due to the high parasitic load.
