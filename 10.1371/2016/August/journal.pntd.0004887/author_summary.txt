Chikungunya has reemerged as an important mosquito-borne infection with global health significance. Rapid diagnosis plays an important role in early clinical management of patients due to lack of a vaccine and effective treatment. Laboratory diagnosis is generally accomplished by blood tests to detect virus-specific antibodies but these antibodies are usually developed one week after infection, which misses the window of effective clinical management. On the other hand, although detecting the viral genome can be done in early stage of infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but it is costly to the patients. Here we utilized a fluorescent compound to improve the cost-efficiency of the molecular assay for diagnosis of Chikungunya virus infection. By testing on 77 serum samples, this improved assay has proven to be highly sensitive and specific towards Chikungunya virus. We believe that this research could benefit both clinicians and patients by providing early and accurate diagnosis.
