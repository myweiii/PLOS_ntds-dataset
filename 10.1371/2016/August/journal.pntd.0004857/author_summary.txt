Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections occur when Salmonella bacteria, which normally cause diarrhea, enter the bloodstream and spread through the body. Invasive NTS infections have become a common cause of infection and death in children with malaria and adults with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is unknown whether iNTS is as common or as severe outside sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated over 100 iNTS cases from an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam admitted between 2008â€“2013. We used hospital records to determine the clinical features of iNTS disease and to identify risk factors associated with death and performed typing of the isolated organisms. The majority of patients were HIV positive (72/102, 71%), >90% of patients were adults, 71% were male and 33% reported intravenous drug use. The mortality rate of iNTS patients was 28% (26/92), and HIV infection was a significant risk factor for fatal outcome (p = 0.039). The serovars most commonly identified were S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium; S. Typhimurium was found more frequently in HIV-positive individuals (p = 0.003). We report that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate. Similar to sub-Saharan Africa, HIV infection was a strong risk factor for death.
