Japanese encephalitis (JE) remains one of the most significant public health problems in Asia and the Western Pacific region. A JE viral infection can cause death and severe sequelae. Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing JE currently. After decades of routine vaccination, the number of JE cases declined considerably in Zhejiang Province, China. However, emergence of genotype I of JE as the most common genotype in China in recent decades has become a major public health problem. As all the currently available vaccines are derived from genotype III strains, the circulations of another genotype have caused considerable concerns about vaccine effectiveness. In this study, we found that population immunity against JE was quite low in children and adolescents. Waning of JE neutralizing antibody after JE immunization was observed. Therefore, issues about duration of protection and booster dose necessity need further research. On the bright side, evidence shows that the JE vaccine currently used is effective for both genotype I and III of wild viruses. Although clinical JE cases have reduced, the virus is still spreading in nature; therefore, we encourage children and other high-risk groups to adhere to the immunization program continuously.
