During the Ebola outbreak in 2014/2015 more than 4,800 people died of Ebola in Liberia. Health care providers in the field have assumed that closure of health facilities and mistrust in existing structures resulted not only substantial additional deaths from Ebola but also impacted on death rate of other diseases and on the way people tried to seek health care. We conducted a mobile phone survey in Monrovia to identify deaths and diseases a household had faced since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak and the kind of health care they sought. We estimated that the non-Ebola-related death rate in Monrovia was not higher than previous national estimates for Liberia. However, additional deaths occurred in the population of Monrovia directly resulting from Ebola. Of the household members that were sick of any disease during the survey period, 43% did not visit any health care facility. The high proportion among the sick household members that sought health care in pharmacies or drug stores or by health care workers among their peers but outside health facilities emphasizes the importance of ensuring access to non-Ebola-related health care as outbreak control is challenged by sick community members staying undiagnosed and untreated.
