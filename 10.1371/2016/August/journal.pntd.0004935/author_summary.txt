Rickettsia typhi causes a relatively mild disease in humans and in immunocompetent mice the bacterium does not cause clinical symptoms as it is easily controlled by the adaptive T cell response. To analyze the role of innate immune mechanisms we here infected mice deficient in T and B cells and find that these mice die within 21 days from a systemic inflammatory response. In addition to splenomegaly due to the accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils, they also show severe liver necrosis that is caused by a massive influx of neutrophils but not the cause of death. The systemic inflammatory response is remarkable, because R. typhi does not directly activate macrophages and neutrophils. Our study demonstrates a strong immunopathological role of cells of the innate immune system in this infection that may also operate in patients as liver damage is a common symptom of the human disease.
