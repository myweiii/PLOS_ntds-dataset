Intestinal parasites including hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichuria have been found to be prevalent in refugee populations. More than 50,000 refugees resettle in the United States annually. Since parasitic disease associated with these infections are rare in the United States, there may be delays in diagnosis or improper treatment of refugees, especially for strongyloidiasis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began overseas presumptive treatment programs in some refugee populations in 1999. We examined the cost and economic impact of an overseas presumptive treatment program with albendazole and ivermectin for Asian refugees. We found that the program costs about $15.12 per refugee and that the burden of intestinal parasites would be reduced by about 80% considering cases, hospitalizations, life years, and QALYs. Overall, the cost per QALY gained was $2,219 (95% CI: 600â€“29,500). Compared to an alternative program in which refugees would be screened and treated for these infections after arrival in the United States, the overseas presumptive treatment program is less expensive and at least as effective.
