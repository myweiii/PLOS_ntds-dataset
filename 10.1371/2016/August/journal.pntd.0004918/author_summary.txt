Dengue is a mosquito-borne, viral febrile disease transmitted between humans in most of the tropical and sub-tropical world. In recent years, an increasing number of cases has been widely reported. However, understanding the full disease burden remains a topic of public health research. One reason for under-reporting is that severe episodes are more likely to be captured in routine surveillance statistics, and mild episodes unreported/unrecognized. We re-analyzed data from the control arm of a dengue vaccine clinical trial in five Asian countries. The trial captured dengue incidence rates following active surveillance and virological confirmation, and we compared those with incidence rates from the passive surveillance system. As expected, the active surveillance system captured many more cases of symptomatic dengue than routine systems. Of virologically confirmed dengue in the clinical trial, only ~29% were diagnosed by investigators as dengue, indicating there is a significant disease burden excluded from existing case definitions and diagnostic practices. The analysis confirmed that dengue is under-reported, by different magnitudes, in these Asian countries. Case definition is an important determinant of burden. These findings are important when considering the health economics and public health impacts of new prevention and control tools.
