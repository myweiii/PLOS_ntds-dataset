Cystic echinococcosis (CE) remains an important health problem in many regions of the world, including those where control programs have been implemented. In Spain, available information on CE is incomplete, and its importance tends to be underestimated due to underreporting and to the lack of compulsory notification. In this paper we used hospitalized CE discharge data to describe CE main epidemiological characteristics and CE geographical and temporal trends in Spain. Although CE hospitalization rates have decreased considerably in the last years, the overall economic losses estimations due to CE were still rather high in Spain. The need for a continuous and well-defined source, with national coverage, of epidemiological data on CE is emphasized in this paper, not only to have a more accurate picture but to monitor the control activities in place.
