We assessed knowledge, attitudes and practices of diarrhea and cholera disease and prevention in two areas of the Solomon Islands near Papua New Guinea. Both areas were ‘at risk’ for cholera disease and received messages about cholera prevention. Later, one of the areas also received vaccination against cholera. This was the first time cholera vaccine was administered to a population that had never reported cholera. Our survey found that people living in the area were cholera vaccine was administered were more likely to know the signs and symptoms and treatment of cholera, as well as be aware of cholera vaccine. We think this could be related to the extra education provided with vaccination. This was the first knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey about diarrhea and cholera disease and prevention and prevention in a population that had not been exposed to cholera.
