Certain parasitic flatworms pose serious threats to human health. Understanding more about the biology of flatworms can lead to new and better drug targets. However, due to the complex life cycles of parasitic flatworms, it has been suggested that a non-parasitic flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea, be used to study flatworm biology. This worm can be used as a model to study processes that all flatworms have in common; these findings can be applied back to parasitic flatworms. Digestion occurs in all worms and relies on the activity of protease enzymes to break down protein. The authors were able to induce regurgitation in S. mediterranea and study the contents of the worm gut. These worms have several types of proteases present, although it seems that only two types, called cysteine and aspartyl proteases, are important in digestion in live worms. Furthermore, one specific cysteine protease, cathepsin B, is responsible for the bulk of the digestive capabilities in S. mediterranea. Cysteine proteases also appear to be involved in the ability of S. mediterranea to regenerate damaged body tissues. Understanding protease activity in S. mediterranea can provide insight as to the roles of these enzymes in medically relevant parasitic flatworms.
