This study explored the genetic characteristics of the ITS and four mini- and microsatellite markers and assessed the population structure and substructures in 101 E. bieneusi isolates from pigs in China. The measures of LD and recombination events supported the occurrence of clonal evolution among the isolates from four study areas of China. Three subpopulations (SP3 to SP5) with potentially varied host ranges were identified within the isolates, which were genetically differentiated from two existing primate subpopulations SP1 and SP2. Population genetic analysis indicated that the isolates in SP1 and SP5 with clonal structure might be responsible for the cross-species transmission and thus have zoonotic potential, while the isolates in SP2, SP3, and SP4 with epidemic structure or host-adapted traits might colonize specific hosts. The data revealed the presence of clonality, potential host adaptation, and population differentiation of E. bieneusi in different hosts.
