Leishmania amazonensis, a member of the Leishmania mexicana complex, is the causative agent of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) and anergic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (ADCL) [1,2]. It is widely distributed throughout the Amazon basin, where it infects a wide range of terrestrial rodents and, less frequently, marsupials. Its main vector is Lutzomyia flaviscutellata (Diptera: Psychodidae) widely distributed in South America and a recent study has predicted its expansion towards South of Brazil [3]. Moreover, Lutzomyia migonei (Fran√ßa, 1920) can also harbor the infection of this species [4,5]. Although its transmission to man is very uncommon, L. amazonensis triggers an incurable and disseminated form of cutaneous leishmaniasis [2,6]. However, most of the mechanisms involved in L. amazonensis pathogenesis are still unknown, especially those related to surface molecules. Glycoconjugates have been extensively characterized as important for the establishment of infection as they protect the parasite from the early action of the host immune system and therefore acting as invasive/evasive strategies. Consequently, we here present the role of lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of L. amazonensis in the interaction with vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.
