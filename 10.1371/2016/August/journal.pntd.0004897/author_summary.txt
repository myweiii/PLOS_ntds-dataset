Dengue fever (DF) is caused by infection with the dengue virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Although the effects of DF are usually mild, in some cases serious illness and even death may result. The average costs per case when extrapolated to society may therefore be high, particularly given the large number of people infected during an endemic year. In Mexico, relatively little is known about the average cost per case (from either the healthcare system or the patient perspective). Such information is important to guide decisions about health policy, e.g. vaccination or public education. We aimed to quantify the average cost per case of DF using a micro-costing approach, both for DF treatment according to an ideal protocol for the management of the patient (´ideal costs´) and according to current treatment practice in the health services (´real costs´). Our results were largely consistent with findings from other international studies, but showed higher ideal costs compared with real costs. We think this may point to inadequate use of laboratory tests and treatments for patients with DF in Mexico. Our cost data will be used in a subsequent publication regarding the economic impact of DF in Mexico.
