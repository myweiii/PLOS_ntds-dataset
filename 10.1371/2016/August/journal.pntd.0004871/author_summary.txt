Since 1957 Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) has caused seasonal infections and periodic outbreaks in south-west India. It is estimated that nearly 500 people acquire KFDV annually and 3–5% of those infected succumb to the disease. The vaccine strategy is complicated by the lack of coverage, compliance and efficacy, highlighted by the fact that less than half of the target population received the recommended three dose-regimen. Besides the prevention of tick bites and vaccination, there are no approved antivirals for KFDV infection. Based on these observations, the commonly-used-IFN-α2a was assessed and was not capable of limiting KFDV virus titres. Further characterization of the other IFN-α/β subtypes used at different concentrations revealed that KFDV replication was insensitive to all subtypes, even though signs of cellular damage were reduced. Thus, infectious titre, rather than monolayer staining or cytopathic effect (CPE) monitoring, is more reliable for IFN analyses. The capability of KFDV to overcome the antiviral properties of IFN was attributed to the NS5 protein. Thus, other treatment options need to be evaluated for patients suffering with Kyasanur Forest disease.
