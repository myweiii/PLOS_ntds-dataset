Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease that presents as a severe acute febrile illness. It is caused by mite-transmitted Orientia tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative, obligately intracellular bacterium. Every year, approximately one million people are infected globally; however, there is no vaccine for the control of this infection. Mechanistic studies of host immune responses have been few, partially due to the limited availability of suitable animal models and research facilities. Here, we report our development of an intradermal inoculation mouse model that mimics the natural infection. We also examined the kinetics of immune and inflammatory responses during acute and chronic stages of O. tsutsugamushi infection. As the first comprehensive report of an intradermal inoculation murine model of scrub typhus, this study improves our understanding of host immune responses following cutaneous exposure to the bacteria and opens new avenues for future vaccine-based investigations.
