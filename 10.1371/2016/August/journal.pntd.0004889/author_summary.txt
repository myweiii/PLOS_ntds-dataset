Kazakhstan is a large central Asian country that was part of the Soviet Union until 1991. The country is endemic for rabies. This study shows that there are areas of Kazakhstan such as the north and south east of the country where outbreaks of animal rabies are concentrated. Cattle, dogs and foxes are the animals most frequently confirmed with rabies. A mean of 7.1 human deaths annually due to rabies occurred between 2009 and 2015 inclusive in Kazakhstan resulting in 457 disability adjusted life years. A mean of 64,801 people each year are recorded as suffering bite injuries from animals, mainly due to dogs. Children are at higher risk of being bitten. However, the widespread use of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) prevents at least 118 and possibly up to 1184 fatalities per annum of people bitten by rabid animals. The economic costs of this disease are high: exceeding $20 million per annum. However, the widespread use of PEP is cost effective in reducing the burden of disease.
