Cryptococcus gattii, which is classically divided into four major molecular types (VGI-VGIV), and two serotypes B and C, is the second most important cause of cryptococcosis. The rising incidence of human and animal cryptococcosis cases caused by molecular type VGIII highlights the need for increased vigilance. In this study, we characterized a large set of C. gattii VGIII isolates. Genetic analysis revealed four diverging sub-populations, which were primarily associated with serotype B or C, and very likely originated from endemic regions in Colombia, Mexico and the USA. Differences in virulence and antifungal susceptibility between serotypes may result in different disease outcomes since serotype B isolates were more virulent in mice than serotype C isolates, but serotype C isolates were less susceptible to azoles, the primary treatment for uncomplicated cryptococcosis. Identification of cryptococcal serotype and molecular type in clinical practice has the potential to guide treatment regimens and hence reduce morbidity and mortality in both sporadic cases and those associated with outbreaks. Our study significantly contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology, genetics and pathogenesis of Cryptococcus and cryptococcosis.
