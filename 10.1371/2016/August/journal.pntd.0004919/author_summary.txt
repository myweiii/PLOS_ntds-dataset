Dengue fever, caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes, is regarded as one of the most important arboviral diseases globally. Guangdong Province in south China has the highest dengue infestation level in mainland China. An explosive outbreak occurred in this province in 2014, with a total of 36,837 cases and 6 deaths being notified. A community-based integrated intervention program was implemented to control this outbreak in Guangzhou, the capital city of the province, where dengue epidemic was mainly caused by imported cases. It was estimated that a total of 3.3 million people and 272 million RMB were invested in this intervention. This study used a time series generalized additive model based on meteorological factors to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention program. The analysis showed that there was significant reduction in mosquito density following the intervention (Breteau Index (BI) reduced from 10.88 to 2.11), and there was a 70.47% (95% confidence interval: 66.07%, 74.88%) reduction in the reported dengue cases compared with the predicted cases after 12 days since the beginning of the intervention. A total of 23,302 dengue cases were prevented due to the community-based intervention. This study suggests that an integrated dengue intervention program is effective to control a dengue outbreak in areas where dengue epidemic was mainly caused by imported dengue cases.
