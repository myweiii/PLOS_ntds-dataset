The molecular basis of wide differences in the ability of metacylic trypomastigote (MT) forms of different T. cruzi strains to invade host cells is not fully understood. We investigated the possibility that surface molecules gp82 and gp90, which function as mediator and down regulator of cell invasion respectively, were differentially released by different strains and affected MT internalization. Conditioned medium of poorly invasive G strain (G-CM) and highly invasive CL strain (CL-CM) was tested in MT invasion assays. Western blot analysis revealed high levels of gp82 and gp90 in G-CM, either in vesicles or as soluble molecules, and low levels in CL-CM. Invasion of human HeLa cells by MT of both strains was inhibited in the presence of G-CM, but not of CL-CM. Incubation of G-CM with anti-gp90 or anti-gp82 antibodies that do not recognize live MT counteracted the inhibitory effect of G-CM. We infer from these data that gp90 and gp82 shed into medium are as relevant as the molecules expressed on MT surface in interacting with host cells and to regulate the invasion process.
