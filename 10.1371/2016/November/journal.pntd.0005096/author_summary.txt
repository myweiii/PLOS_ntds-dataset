Aedes aegypti, the most important vector of dengue and Zika, greatly varies in body color and behavior. Two domestic forms of this mosquito, the very pale queenslandensis and the browner type, are often found together in populations around the globe. Knowing how freely they interbreed is important for the control strategies such as releases of Wolbachia and sterile males. To address this question, we used RAD sequencing to genotype samples of both forms collected in Singapore and northern Queensland. We did not find any association between the mitochondrial or nuclear genome-wide variation and color variation in these populations. Rather, “paleness” is likely to be a quantitative trait under some environmental influence. We also detected several queenslandensis individuals with the Wolbachia infection, indicating free interbreeding with the type form which has been used to introduce Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations. Overall, our data show that the very pale queenslandensis are not genomically separate, and their presence is unlikely to affect the success of Aedes control programs based on Wolbachia-infected, sterile or RIDL mosquitoes.
