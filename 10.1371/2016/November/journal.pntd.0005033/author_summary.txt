Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that primarily affects poor populations in Latin America. However, awareness of this disease in the United States has increased in recent years. In this study, we utilize data from the American Community Survey and the World Health Organization to estimate the number of cases of Chagas disease in the United States. We find that there are an estimated 238,000 cases across the United States, along with four states that each has over 10,000 cases (California, Texas, New York and Florida). We also analyze data from the United States blood donation which shows that about 1,900 cases have been identified through blood donation. We conclude that there is still a substantial burden of Chagas disease in the US, though the burden is focused in certain geographic regions. We also highlight the need for further research to better quantify prevalence and incidence in order to guide interventions to diagnose and treat patients with Chagas disease across the US.
