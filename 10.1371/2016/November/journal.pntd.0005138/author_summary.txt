Current global changes (environmental and anthropogenic) are expected to promote the spread and transmission of infectious diseases. One of the direct consequences of such changes is the modification of the geographical distribution of species, enabling natural hybridization. Such hybridization is already known to occur in schistosomes, and offspring have been shown to have superior virulence and invasive capacities. The recent outbreak of a hybrid between the human- and animal- infecting schistosomes, S. haematobium x S. bovis, in Europe (Corsica, France) clearly demonstrates this invasive capacity and raises the risk of zoonotic transmission. Therefore, it is important to study such hybrids, and experimental crosses are critical to address this issue. Here, we developed molecular sex markers for S. haematobium and S. bovis in order to distinguish gender and to be able to generate differentially introgressed hybrids, allowing us to investigate parasite fitness.
