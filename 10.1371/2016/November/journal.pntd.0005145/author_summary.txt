Dengue fever caused by the dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. To control the disease, an intracellular bacterium called Wolbachia has been introduced into Ae. aegypti where it blocks/limits success of infection of DENV. The mechanistic basis of blocking is not well understood but may involve Wolbachia activating the host immune system or competing with DENV for host resources. The strength of blocking appears to correlate with Wolbachia density. Here, we aimed to determine if any particular tissues inside the mosquito play a greater role in blocking. Tissues were chosen based on their Wolbachia density and their roles in infection and immunity. Wolbachia infected and uninfected mosquitoes were orally infected with DENV and Wolbachia density and DENV load were assessed in midgut, salivary gland, head, Malpighian tubules, fat body and carcass. Wolbachia density did not correlate with DENV loads in the same tissues nor with DENV loads in the salivary glands. We also showed that no one tissue appeared to play a greater role in blocking. In summary, these finding suggest that in the mosquito a threshold Wolbachia density may be required for DENV blocking. Our findings also suggest that blocking may involve mechanisms that are fundamental to all cells.
