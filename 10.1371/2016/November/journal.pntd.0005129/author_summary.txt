Dengue is a massive health threat worldwide. Dengue prevention is the most effective way to reduce the risk of dengue infection, especially in endemic countries like Pakistan. Evaluation of public awareness and health beliefs regarding dengue fever plays an important role in developing strategies for disease control. The present study results highlight the public awareness level, health beliefs, and actual preventive practices regarding dengue fever. We evaluated dengue knowledge and preventive practices in relation with demographic characteristics and public health beliefs. Our findings are useful for developing health messages regarding dengue prevention and control. We found that public awareness has a great impact on adoption of dengue preventive practices. We also found that dengue information should be disseminated in the population in order to increase the perception of susceptibility to contracting this disease. It is also important that health messages include information that augments public confidence that implementation of proper preventive practices can help avoid this infection.
