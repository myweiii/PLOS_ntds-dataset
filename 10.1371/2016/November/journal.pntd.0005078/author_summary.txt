The saliva from sand flies contains biologically active proteins that permit the insect to obtain a blood meal. When vertebrates are continuously exposed to these molecules, through insect biting, for example, they induce an immune response (antibody and cell-mediated immunity) in the vertebrate host. Previously, we showed that immunity to salivary proteins from Lutzomyia intermedia a vector of Leishmania braziliensis, the main species that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil, did not protect but exacerbated CL. In the present work, we investigated if immunity to Lutzomyia whitmani, another vector of L. braziliensis, induced a similar effect or not. We observed that mice immunized with Lu. whitmani saliva develop immunity to the salivary components and that this immunity protected the mice against CL development. We further observed that people residing in areas where Lu. whitmani occurs also develop antibodies to saliva and that CL patients have lower levels of these antibodies. These evidences point to differences in the protein repertoire present in the saliva of different sand flies and highlight the concept that salivary proteins should be considered as additional components of a vaccine for leishmaniasis.
