The fungal metabolite cladosporin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the malaria parasite protein translation machinery enzyme lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS). Our computational annotations of parasitic aaRSs from Loa loa and Schistosoma mansoni provide catalogs of these enzymes that drive parasitic protein translation. We have studied the drug inhibition of KRSs from two neglected tropical worm parasites L. loa and S. mansoni. Our results show that these single copy KRSs from L. loa and S. mansoni can be effectively inhibited by cladosporin with more than 60 fold better binding than for the human counterpart enzyme. Crystal structure of L. loa KRS bound to cladosporin and L-lysine shows key interacting and selectivity residues. This work hence provides a platform for structure-guided derivatization of cladosporin-based compounds for drug development against these neglected diseases.
