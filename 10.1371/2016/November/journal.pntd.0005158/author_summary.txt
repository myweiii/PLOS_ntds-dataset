Mosquito-transmitted disease severely impacts human health around the world. One novel form of control involves infecting medically important mosquito species with the naturally occurring bacterium Wolbachia, which restricts dengue and malaria transmission through a process called pathogen interference. The interference phenotype is still poorly understood, and potentially involves multiple physiological changes to the mosquito. We examined the role of nutritional stress on pathogen interference in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, in order to better understand factors that might lead to variable interference. We demonstrated that interference against malaria-causing Plasmodium gallinaceum was dependent on mosquito nutritional status, however interference against dengue was not, implying that pathogen interference operates differently for different pathogens. We then examined mosquito immune processes that had been previously correlated with pathogen interference, and demonstrated that mosquito nutrition did not affect the expression of key mosquito immune genes, but did affect levels of reactive oxygen species. Our results highlight the complexity of the phenotype, and importantly suggest that adult nutrition may not be a key determinant of interference against DENV.
