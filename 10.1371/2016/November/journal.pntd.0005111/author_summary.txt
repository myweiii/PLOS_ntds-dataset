Leprosy can lead to functional and anatomical changes in the peripheral nerves. Previous studies have shown that the anti-bacterial treatment cannot stop the progression of nerve function abnormalities; to our knowledge, there are no previous prospective studies investigating the evolution of nerve anatomical abnormalities. Seventy-three leprosy patients underwent bilateral ultrasonography of the ulnar, median and common fibular nerves before and after treatment. We analyzed thickening and asymmetry measurements, nerve architecture (echogenicity abnormalities) and vascularization (Doppler signal). We observed worsening of thickening in the common fibular nerve in the paucibacillary and in the patients without reactions. On the other hand, we observed reduction in the thickening and asymmetry measurements for some nerves in the multibacillary and in the patients with reactions. Although we observed reduction in the measurements of these two groups, they presented higher frequencies of echogenicity abnormalities, indicating that these reductions might have been due to evolution to nerve fibrosis and atrophy. The frequencies of Doppler signal were similar between the pauci and multibacillary patients. We observed association between Doppler signal and the presence of acute neuritis. Our results indicate that the nerve anatomic abnormalities assessed by ultrasonography can worsen after treatment despite the patient classification and the presence of reactions.
