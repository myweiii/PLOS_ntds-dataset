Endemic typhus caused by Rickettsia typhi usually is a relatively mild disease. However, CNS inflammation and neurological symptoms are complications that can occur in severe cases. This outcome of disease is regularly observed in T and B cell-deficient C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice upon infection with R. typhi. We show here that CD4+ T cells are as protective as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells against R. typhi as long as they are present in time. This is evidenced by the fact that neither CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell-deficient C57BL/6 mice develop disease which is also true for R. typhi-infected C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice that receive immune CD8+ or CD4+ at an early point in time. Moreover, adoptive transfer of immune CD4+ T cells still protects approximately 60% of C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice when applied later in advanced infection when the bacteria start to rise. Although CD8+ T cells are faster and more efficient in bacterial elimination, R. typhi is not detectable in CD4+ T cell recipients anymore. We further show that immune CD4+ T cells activate bactericidal functions of microglia and macrophages in the CNS in vivo and inhibit bacterial growth in infected macrophages in vitro which is in part mediated by the release of IFNÎ³. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to protect against R. typhi infection. With regard to vaccination our findings suggest that the induction of R. typhi-specific CD4+ TH1 effector T cells may be as effective as the much more difficult targeting of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.
