Neglected intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) such as soil-transmitted helminthes (STH) have been recognized as one of the main causes of illnesses especially among disadvantaged communities. The last survey of parasitic infections among migrant workers in Malaysia was conducted more than a decade ago. Although it provided useful methodological enquiries, the accrued data were not designed for policy recommendations. Over the last decade, the number of migrant workers has grown exponentially. There is an acute need for accurate information on the epidemiology of parasitic infections and infectious diseases especially as they affect urban communities in Malaysia. A particular gap has been identified in understanding the presence, persistence and epidemiology of infections among longer-term residents and immigrants who have settled in Malaysia. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study to establish the composition and transmission of parasitic infections in these communities with a view to developing effective methods of prevention, control and treatment of these infections. Therefore, this study is timely in adopting a scientific approach to address an important public health problem and to provide conclusions that can inform the design of effective public health policies.
