Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov) is a fish-borne parasite infecting humans when they consume raw or undercooked fish. Ov is endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly in rural parts of Northeast Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam. The Ov lifecycle includes three different hosts: snails, fish and humans. Transmission takes place in various environments and water habitats where many factors interact and influence Ov survival and transmissibility from host to host. Our study investigated the influences of water parameters on snail and fish abundance and Ov infection rates. We found that salinity and nitrite-nitrogen were positively correlated to Bithynia snail relative abundance and inversely correlated to snail and fish species diversity. Cyprinids were the most abundant fish family and high cyprinid abundance was found in areas with high Bithynia abundance creating ideal conditions for transmission. Ov infection in fish was consistently detected from an area with high levels of salinity and nitrite-nitrogen and characterized with high abundance of Bithynia and cyprinids. Our findings suggest that water contamination can influence freshwater communitiesâ€™ assemblages possibly creating ideal conditions for sustained parasite transmission. Sustainable Ov control may require a better appreciation of ecological systems together with wiser governance and development planning.
