Infections of humans with the protozoan parasites L. donvani and L. infantum can lead to the development of the disease visceral leishmaniasis, but also to an asymptomatic status. However, the mechanisms that result in these clinical outcomes after infection are poorly understood. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to obtain insights into the immunological processes linked to the progression of the disease or to protective mechanisms. For this purpose, we evaluated the patterns of expression for genes that code proteins from the entire human genome in the peripheral blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis, from individuals who remained asymptomatic after infections with L. infantum, from patients who were recovering from disease after treatment and from uninfected individuals. By employing computational analysis to evaluate the blood transcriptional activity of each group, we identified transcriptional signatures that correlate with previous findings obtained through different analytical methods. Moreover, our analyses uncovered hitherto unidentified molecular pathways and gene networks associated with the transcriptional profiles of individuals recovering from disease or that did not develop symptoms after infection. This suggests that activation of protective responses can be useful targets for the development of new therapies for visceral leishmaniasis.
