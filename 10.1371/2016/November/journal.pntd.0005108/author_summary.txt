Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquito bites. Globally, 36 million are disfigured and disabled by complications such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis) or scrotum (hydrocele). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons. Significant progress has been made toward eliminating LF from many parts of the world, including the Pacific Islands. Current challenges of the GPELF include identification of any residual hotspots of ongoing transmission, and effective strategies for early identification of any resurgence of infections. As humans are the only reservoirs of LF parasites and mosquitoes have short flight ranges, one such strategy is to monitor LF infection in mosquitoes as an indicator of ongoing transmission nearby. Mosquito monitoring could potentially be used to evaluate program success, provide support for decisions to stop MDA, and conduct post-MDA surveillance. Our study evaluated mosquito monitoring as a surveillance tool in American Samoa by linking village-level results of published studies of LF in humans and mosquitoes, and provides promising evidence to support the potential usefulness of mosquito monitoring in post-MDA surveillance the Pacific Islands.
