Entomopathogenic fungi have potential for use in biopesticides for control of vectors of medical importance. As they are biological agents, however, a range of factors may affect their efficacy for this purpose, including temperature and interactions with the vectored parasite. Little is known about how the infection of entomopathogenic fungi affect the interaction between vectors of Chagas disease and the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi but in other systems it is known that the efficacy of fungal pathogens can be modulated by the presence of microorganisms within the insect target. Here we screened fungal isolates as candidates for triatomine control, using as a model Rhodnius prolixus, vector of Chagas disease. We included in our screening assays of the virulences of these fungi over a range of temperatures and in insects infected with T. cruzi. Temperature affected the virulence of the fungi, indicating that some strains may be better thermal generalists than others (and so more versatile as biocontrol agents). Concentrating now on a single fungal candidate (a strain of Beauveria bassiana, we found that insects already infected with T. cruzi resisted the fungus for longer than did insects uninfected with the parasite over most of the temperature range tested. These results indicate a potential problem for the use of these fungi as biocontrol tools, as their use could generate selection pressure on the insect for greater chances of acquiring T. cruzi.
