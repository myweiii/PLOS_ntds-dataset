Lymphatic filariasis caused by thread like filarial worms involves asymptomatic to acute and/or disfiguring chronic conditions like lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Adult worms lodge in the lymphatic system and disrupt the immune system that causes the disease. Nonetheless the infection if present during pregnancy, it affects the immune system of the unborn child in such a way that they become more susceptible to infection. But how the immune system of a fetus is affected by the maternal filarial infection is not known. Since regulatory T cells are responsible for development of hyporesponsiveness, a condition that supports the active filarial infection, and develops in thymus at an early stage of the human fetal development, we hypothesized that maternal filarial infection might be affecting the development of Tregs cell. Because Tregs secret IL-10, a regulatory cytokine, we have also measured its level in children born to infected and uninfected mother and correlate it with Tregs. We have observed a significantly high as well as a positive correlation between Tregs and IL-10 levels in children born to infected mother than the children of uninfected mother at the time of birth as well as early childhood indicating that Tregs and IL-10 contribute to immune modulation during pregnancy. Since ongoing MDA excludes pregnant mothers and children below 2 years of age, hence implementation of supervised therapy at the time of adolescent through MDA may help the programme in achieving the target of global elimination of LF by 2020.
