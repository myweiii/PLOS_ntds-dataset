In the Americas, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases are notified across a wide geographic area, extending from southern United States to northern Argentina. Currently, 70â€“75% of all estimated cases of CL worldwide occur in ten countries, including four in the Americas (Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Peru) and six countries from Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. This study shows the epidemiological situation and geographical distribution of CL cases reported by passive surveillance system of endemic countries of the American Region from 2001 to 2011, collected and consolidated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Furthermore, it represents a joint effort of the National Programs of leishmaniases. Despite some limitations, the data were analyzed and discussed and this study represents the first step to understand the global epidemiological situation in this Region and it contributes to the improvement of the surveillance of leishmaniases in the Americas.
