Many tropical diseases co-occur in the same areas and have overlapping risk factors and strategies for control and prevention. Therefore, integrating several diseases in control activities can be both effective and cost-efficient. We evaluated sets of diarrhea and dengue interventions in rural primary schools in Colombia to reduce absence due to diarrheal disease among pupils and dengue risk factors. Integrating the control of these two diseases is justified because of the potential joint risk factor of water storage behavior. Stored drinking water may be contaminated with enteric pathogens and such containers also provide breeding opportunities for dengue vectors. Water storage is common in schools in many tropical countries. Although the study did not demonstrate clear evidence of a reduction in pupil absence due to diarrhea or reductions of adult mosquito densities in schools, significant reductions were detected in the number of mosquito breeding sites and drinking water quality was significantly improved. Integrated disease control interventions in school settings should be further explored to prevent diseases with overlapping etiologies amongst pupils and school staff.
