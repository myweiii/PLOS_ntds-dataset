Control and development of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) are dependent on the host immunological response. One of the key molecules in determining elimination of Leishmania parasites from the infected host cell is the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The aim of this study was to investigate which immune response genes are associated with the production of IFN-γ in the context of Leishmania infection. We identified individuals that are high- or low IFN-γ producers upon stimulation of their peripheral blood cells with Leishmania parasites. We then determined the immune gene expression profile of these individuals and we identified a set of genes that are differentially expressed comparing high- and low IFN-γ producers. The expression of these genes was also evaluated in patients with CL and in individuals with a subclinical Leishmania infection (SC). In this setting, the overall pattern of expression of this particular gene combination discriminated the CL patients x from SC individuals. Understanding the initial response to Leishmania may lead to the identification of markers that are associated with development of CL.
