Leptospirosis is a neglected infectious disease that sickens many humans and animals throughout the world. It is caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. Few leptospiral genes that contribute to the disease have been identified. We generated a library of 800 L. interrogans mutants with transposon insertions in different genes. Screening each mutant individually for the ability to cause disease in the hamster model would be laborious and requires thousands of animals. In a pilot experiment, we infected hamsters with a pool of 42 mutants to determine the role of the disrupted genes on fitness of the bacterium during infection. Out of the 12 mutants with diminished fitness in the three tissues, two had transposon insertions in the gene encoding an enzyme that may generate the small signaling molecule cAMP. When tested separately, the two mutants failed to sicken hamsters, indicating that intracellular cAMP signaling within L. interrogans could have a role in causing disease. These findings indicate that large pools of transposon insertion mutants can be screened in a limited number of animals to identify leptospiral genes that may be critical for the disease process.
