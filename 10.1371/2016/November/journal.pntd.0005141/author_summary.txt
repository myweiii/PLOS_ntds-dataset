It is generally assumed that neglected tropical diseases (NTDS) such as leishmaniasis are concentrated in poor populations. It affects as many as 12 million people, with 1.5 to 2 million new cases every year around the world. Depending on the species of Leishmania, the host can develop cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) or visceral leishmaniasis. In Mali, CL caused by Leishmania major is transmitted through the bite of infected sand flies belonging to the species Phlebotomus duboscqi. The objectives of this study were to determine the baseline prevalence of LST positivity, a test of previous exposure to Leishmania parasites, the prevalence of CL lesions, and the level of anti-P. duboscqi salivary antibodies, indicative of exposure to vector bites, in populations living in western, central and southern Mali, three ecologically distinct study sites. LST positivity was higher in the western district of Diema (85.1%) than in Kolokani (24.6%) and was much lower in Kolondieba (2.7%). All eight PCR-confirmed L. major CL cases were diagnosed in subjects below 18 years of age and all were residents of the district of Diema. Exposure to sand fly bites, measured by anti-saliva antibody titers, was established in individuals living in these three districts and antibody titers were higher in LST positive individuals (P<0.0001). The finding of this study provides an update on the prevalence of CL in these regions.
