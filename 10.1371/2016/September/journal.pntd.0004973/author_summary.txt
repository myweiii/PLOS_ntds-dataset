Aedes aegypti is responsible for global dengue outbreaks in the recent years. It is also the vector of Zika virus, which may be associated with the thousands of microcephaly cases in Latin America. At the moment, dengue prevention and control solely depends on vector control measures. Ae aegypti thrives in all types of artificial water storage containers. Countries lacking piped water systems and depending on water storage containers are required to implement preventive measures regularly. Temephos has been the mainstay of Ae aegypti larval control for 40 years in the Asian region. Temephos resistance is established in the vector population. Here in Cambodia, we assessed a bacterial larvicide, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) strain AM65-52 in communes and districts with temephos resistant mosquito population. A single dose of Bti treatment was sufficient to suppress the pupal and adult vector population for three months. Moreover, two cycles of Bti treatment over six months suppressed disease transmission in the treated districts. As this study was conducted over multiple years in multiple sites, we know that these data are reproducible. Our data confirm that Bti strain AM65-52 is an efficient ammunition, and when used with complete coverage of the target habitats it can prevent dengue outbreaks.
