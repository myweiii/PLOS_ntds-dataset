Once districts have shown that the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) in children ages 1–9 years is below 5%, they must monitor for re-emergence. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a second surveillance or “pre-validation” survey to determine if re-emergence has occurred. Using new WHO guidelines, we undertook surveillance surveys, and determined the prevalence of antibody positivity, in two districts in Nepal. 20 clusters were randomly selected within each district, 15 were randomly selected for antibody testing. In each cluster, 50 children ages 1–9 years and 100 adults ≥15 years were randomly selected. Follicular trachoma (TF) was evaluated, conjunctival swabs to test for chlamydial infection were obtained, and dried blood spots were collected to test for antibodies to pgp3 in children. Adults were evaluated for trachomatous trichiasis (TT). Only 3 cases of TF were found in the two districts, and one case of infection. Overall Pgp3 antibody positivity was low (2·4%), it increase with age, and no clustering within communities was found. TT prevalence was <1/1,000 population. Our surveillance surveys, as proposed by WHO, showed no evidence for re-emergence of trachoma in two districts of Nepal. The low level and not significant increase by age in children with positive antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis deserve further investigation as a marker of interruption of transmission.
