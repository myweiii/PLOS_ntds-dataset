The human whipworm, Trichuris trichiura is prevalent in many tropical and subtropical countries and is believed to infect more than 460 million people worldwide. Treatment with single-dose albendazole or mebendazole is the current control strategy for human trichuriasis. This strategy, however, has a poor-to-mediocre treatment effect. The reason for the low treatment efficacy has been assessed in various ways, including genetic analysis, and both in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies. However, these studies have not been conclusive and did not evaluate whether the biology of Trichuris spp. may have an impact on the inadequate treatment efficacy. To assess a possible reason for this, we here explore the absorptive function of a specialised structure, named the bacillary band. We found that glucose was absorbed by the band and accumulated within the worm independent of oral ingestion, and we speculate that anthelmintics may enter the worm by the same route. If this is the case, this new insight may be used to optimise drug formulations of current and/or future anthelmintic drugs in the treatment of human trichuriasis.
