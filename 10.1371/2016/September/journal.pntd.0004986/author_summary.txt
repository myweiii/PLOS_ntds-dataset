Parasitic schistosome worms cause morbid disease in over 240 million individuals worldwide. Acute infections with these worms can lead to Katayama fever, while chronic infections can lead to portal hypertension, enlarged abdomen, and liver damage. The infective larval stage, called cercariae, are free-swimming and can detect, seek, and penetrate human skin to enter the human host circulatory system, eventually developing into egg-laying adult worms that cause schistosomiasis. Molecular pathways associated with the initial cercarial invasion of the host, however, are largely unknown, especially with respect to the parasite-specific signals involved in host detection and subsequent decision to invade. Here, we describe a role for Hsp70 in cercarial invasion behavior. To date, only generic stimulation with skin lipid, linoleic acid or L-arginine are known to induce cercarial invasion behavior; thus, we can begin an initial investigation of molecular requirements for host invasion and environment transition for schistosomes and possibly other parasitic organisms.
