Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes a febrile illness characterized by a pronounced rash and occasional arthralgia. Serious complications from ZIKV infections were rarely reported until 2015, when Brazilian officials first reported an association between ZIKV infections and a dramatic increase in microcephaly and Guillian-Barr√© syndrome. Since then, ZIKV has been found in 39 countries in the Americas. Thus, the identification and characterization of ZIKV strains from the current outbreak are of utmost importance. In this study, we successfully isolated a ZIKV strain (ZIKV-FLR) from an individual who was bitten by mosquitoes while traveling in an area of Colombia that had ongoing dengue, chikungunya, and ZIKV transmission. Our analysis of the full genome sequence revealed that this virus strain may have originated in the Caribbean and was not directly imported from Brazil. We also discovered that this virus strain was partially resistant to inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation, when compared to dengue virus. Further work is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind this increased resistance and potential to cause more severe disease.
