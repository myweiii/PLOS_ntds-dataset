Fascioliasis is a neglected infectious disease caused by the trematode Fasciola. This parasite (liver fluke) is endemic in many parts of the world including countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. High prevalence rates of fascioliasis has been repeatedly reported in the Andean region of South America. Liver complications in infected humans by this fluke have been sporadically reported in the literature. For instance, the relationship between F. hepatica infection and liver fibrosis has been suggested but its association with cancer is unclear. In this study, we found some evidence of an association between Fasciola infection with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, but little between Fasciola and cancer. As Fasciola is highly endemic in some regions of the developing world, our study shed light on the complications of this parasitic infection which are not that different from flukes such as Schistosoma or Opisthorchis. We believe that further investigations are needed in order to elucidate the pathways in how F. hepatica infection causes liver damage.
