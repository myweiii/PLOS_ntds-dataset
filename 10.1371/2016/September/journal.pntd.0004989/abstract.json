    "Background": "Bartonella bacilliformis is the causative agent of Carrion\u2019s disease, a neglected illness with mortality rates of 40\u201385% in the absence of treatment. The lack of a diagnostic technique to overcome misdiagnosis and treat asymptomatic carriers is of note. This study aimed to identify new B. bacilliformis antigenic candidates that could lead to a new diagnostic tool able to be implemented in endemic rural areas.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "Blood (n = 198) and serum (n = 177) samples were collected in northern Peru. Clinical data were recorded. Specific 16S rRNA amplification by RT-PCR, IFA and ELISA for IgM/IgG with whole cells as antigens was done. Western blot analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing detected seroreactive proteins. ELISAs for IgM/IgG for the antigenic candidates were performed. Of the population 33.3% reported at least one symptom compatible with Carrion\u2019s disease; 25.4% (IFA), 27.1% (ELISA-IgG), 33.9% (ELISA-IgM) and 38.9% (RT-PCR) of samples were positive. Four proteins were considered potential antigenic candidates, including two new antigenic candidates, succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit \u03b1 (SCS-\u03b1) and succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit \u03b2 (SCS-\u03b2). On Western blot both Pap31 and SCS-\u03b1 interacted with IgM, while GroEL and SCS-\u03b2 interacted with IgG. The presence of specific antibodies against the antigenic candidates varied from 34.5% (IgG against SCS-\u03b1) to 97.2% (IgM against Pap31).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "RT-PCR and the high levels of positivity for specific ELISAs demonstrate high levels of B. bacilliformis exposure and asymptomatic carriers among inhabitants. The new antigens identified might be used as a new rapid diagnostic tool to diagnose acute Carrion\u2019s disease and identify asymptomatic carriers."
