B. bacilliformis is a neglected pathogen causing Carrion’s disease, a febrile illness with two distinct phases, the acute so-called Oroya fever that can be life-threatening, and the chronic so-called Peruvian wart. This illness is currently limited to poor inhabitants of Andean valleys of Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and for this reason is understudied. One of the most significant limitations is the lack of an adequate diagnostic tool able to be implemented in rural areas. It is imperative to unequivocally detect cases of Carrion’s disease as well as identify asymptomatic carriers who perpetuate the illness. The present study describes the identification of 4 antigenic candidates potentially useful in the future development of a rapid diagnostic test. Moreover, 2 of these candidates have not been described in the literature. Additionally, four post-outbreak and one endemic community were studied and characterized. The identification of new antigens is essential for the development of a cheap, sensitive diagnostic tool, able to be implemented in low-income areas.
