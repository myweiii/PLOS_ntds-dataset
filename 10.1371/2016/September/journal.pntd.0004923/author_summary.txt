Anthrax has historically been attributed to a single cluster within the Bacillus cereus complex denoted as B. anthracis. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a distinct clade of B. cereus isolates causing anthrax-like disease in a range of wild and domestic mammals in tropical Africa. These strains, designated B. cereus biovar anthracis, combine bacteriological and molecular features of B. cereus and B. anthracis. Many questions about the epidemiology, biology and impact of this cluster of anthrax causing B. cereus still remain open. On the technical side it will be important to adapt diagnostic methods for the detection of such atypical B. cereus strainsâ€“through the inclusion of molecular tools for the detection of the B. anthracis virulence plasmids that appear to be the prerequisite to cause disease. Through reliable detection of a broad range of B. cereus group isolates causing anthrax-like disease it will be possible to assess the distribution and diversity of these pathogens and their impact on public health and wildlife populations.
