The ‘Dengue Human Interaction Database’, called DenHunt, available at http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/DenHunt/ was created to catalog all interactions between dengue viral and human components published in peer-reviewed literature. There are three types of dengue-human molecular interactions in the database: direct physical interactions between dengue virus and human components, indirect interactions of human proteins affecting viral replication with no current evidence of them directly interacting with the viral components, and differentially expressed genes in dengue infected cell lines or patients. DenHunt could be used to draw network maps of human-dengue relationships which would aid in understanding dengue viral pathogenesis and such knowledge in turn can reveal new strategies for inhibiting viral replication. We also demonstrate that DenHunt could be used to compare common and diverse mechanisms of pathogenesis caused by infectious and non-infectious diseases thereby help in understanding disease mechanisms in general.
