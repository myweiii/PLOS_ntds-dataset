Rift Valley fever is a viral disease that is transmitted to livestock and humans by mosquitoes. Humans get infected mainly through direct contact with blood or aborted materials from infected animals. In Tanzania, a total of 10 RVF epidemics have been reported from 1930 to 2007. Despite the long history of RVF in Tanzania, the extent of its suitable habitat remains unclear. As a result, disease prevention measures such as vaccination of livestock are implemented without informed risk-based resource-allocation decisions. This study was therefore carried out to identify the locations in Tanzania where RVF is more or less likely to occur using an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method. Data from 193RVF outbreak locations were used together with precipitation, elevation, soil type, livestock density, rainfall pattern, proximity to wild animal protected areas as well as to forest as inputs for ENM. Our results show that locations at most risk for RVF occurrence were the northern and central-eastern Tanzania. Areas at highest risk for RVF occurrence are characterised by soils with low water permeability, high amounts of rainfall, high livestock density and two rainy seasons in a year. The findings of this study provide guidance in the design of appropriate RVF surveillance, prevention and control strategies that can be implemented cost-effectively by targeting the areas at most risk.
