Zika virus is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes and is phylogenetically related to other human pathogens (e.g. dengue virus). After the outbreak in South America, the WHO declared that the spread of ZIKV should be regarded as a public health emergency. In fact, growing evidence suggests that ZIKV infection during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital birth defects. Moreover, ZIKV can trigger Guillain- Barré syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Evolutionary studies can help identify sites that allow viral adaptation—i.e. that increase viral fitness at least in some conditions. We analyzed the evolution of the polyproteins encoded by ZIKV and by related viruses and identified several sites in nonstructural proteins that were subject to natural selection. Most of these are located in protein regions that mediate interaction with the host immune system or that may regulate viral RNA synthesis. In ZIKV isolates, the NS4B protein was the preferential selection target with three selected residues. Changes at these sites are expected to modulate some aspect of viral fitness, either in mosquitoes or vertebrate hosts. Future studies to clarify the mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenicity should address the role of these sites in the modulation of viral phenotypes.
