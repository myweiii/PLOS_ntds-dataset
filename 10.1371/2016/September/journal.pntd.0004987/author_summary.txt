Dogs are exposed to ectoparasites (e.g. ticks and fleas) and associated vector-borne infections. Among others, Leishmania infantum is a widespread protozoan of public health concern transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. The prevention of canine leishmaniosis has become a priority in many endemic areas and it includes the adoption of control strategies by preventing the infection (avoiding the vector bites) or by preventing disease through vaccination. We investigated the efficacy of two collars for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations. Also, the effect of these collars on the incidence of L. infantum infection as compared with a group of vaccinated dogs was evaluated. At the end of the study, after one transmission season, both collars proved to be effective in preventing L. infantum infection, though to different levels of efficacy. However, no significant difference was recorded in the frequency of active infections between vaccinated and control dogs. Results emphasize the importance of using repellents/insecticides as a priority measure for protection against canine leishmaniosis, while vaccination can be considered as part of an integrate control program and cannot replace anti-vectorial measures.
