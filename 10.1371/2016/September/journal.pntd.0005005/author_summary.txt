Burkholderia pseudomallei is a motile, Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia and can be fatal. In the zones of endemicity, B. pseudomallei are commonly found in soils, and the bacteria can move to the surface during the rainy season. In Thailand, rice farmers rarely wear protective footwear, and thus they are exposed to a risk of infection with B. pseudomallei by cutaneous inoculation. Biological factors such as bacteriophages (phages), viruses of bacteria, present in the same ecosystem as B. pseudomallei may affect the population dynamics of this bacterium in the environment. In order to study this, we have investigated the distribution patterns of B. pseudomallei and associated phages in nature and the impact of these phages on the bacterial culturability. This is the first study demonstrating that the presence of phages capable of infecting B. pseudomallei may affect the success of the pathogen isolation from the soil. Currently culture-based methods of B. pseudomallei appear to under-estimate the bacterial abundance.
