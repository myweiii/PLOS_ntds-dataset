Leishmania spp are intracellular protozoan parasites that replicate primarily within host tissue macrophages. In this paper we simultaneously query host and parasite gene expression in human cutaneous L. braziliensis lesions. We observe an unexpectedly prominent role for B cells and immunoglobulins in lesions in which actively transcribing parasites reside. We also observe that parasite gene expression is surprisingly conserved among L. braziliensis lesions, and the genes that are expressed in lesions are not those that have been previously associated with parasite growth in vitro. This analysis of parasite and host gene expression in lesions may lead to the identification of new parasite virulence factors and may identify host responses that promote parasite persistence in lesions.
