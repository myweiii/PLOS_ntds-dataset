Orientia (O.) tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of scrub typhus, a potentially fatal disease that is endemic in South East Asia. This bacterium replicates in the cytoplasm of its host cells. The obligate intracytoplasmic lifestyle resembles that of many viruses, but among pathogenic bacteria it is unique to O. tsutsugamushi and the closely related Rickettsia spp. CD8+ T cells are specialized on the recognition of cytoplasm-derived antigens and are therefore important in antiviral and antitumor immunity. Using two different mouse models, we show that CD8+ T cells protected against lethal outcome of O. tsutsugamushi infection. Moreover, CD8+ T cells were implicated in the development of tissue lesions in liver and lung. Mice that lack CD8+ T cells due to a genetic defect developed a massively increased macrophage response that failed to control the infection. In protected wildtype mice, the CD8+ T cell-driven immune response elicited the recruitment of macrophages to distinct locations in liver and lung. We also show that CD8+ T cells were important to prevent replication of O. tsutsugamushi many weeks after the recovery from any signs of disease. Therefore we propose that a well-balanced relation between pathogen burden and a potentially harmful CD8+ T cell-dependent immune response becomes established during infection with O. tsutsugamushi.
