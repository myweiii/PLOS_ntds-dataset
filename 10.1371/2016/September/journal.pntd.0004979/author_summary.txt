Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a challenging global health issue around the world. Impairment of kidney function with time is eminent, but indications of CKD may not be seen until considerable damage to kidney functions. Two main causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure. However recently new form of CKD has been reported among agricultural works in the tropics other than known factors. The causes for this mysterious CKD are unknown and termed as Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu). Clinical diagnosis depends on urinary markers and conventional creatinine based markers may underestimate the prevalence of the disease. Therefore, development of new sensitive markers for the early detection may certainly improve the treatment and patient management around the world.
