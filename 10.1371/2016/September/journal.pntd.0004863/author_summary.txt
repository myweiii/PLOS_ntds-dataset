Trachoma is the most common infectious cause blindness worldwide, and the target of a global elimination initiative. A package of community-wide interventions is recommended to treat trachoma, which aim to reduce transmission of the causative agent Chlamydia trachomatis. These interventions require significant, prolonged investment. Clinical observation of follicles on the underside of the eyelid is used to assess requirement for and success of intervention. However, we now know that there are nonchlamydial causes of these follicles, so the observation of this clinical sign may not be specific for chlamydial infection. A recent study showed that infection testing can be cost-effective in low infection prevalence settings, as the money spent on infection testing is more than offset by the savings from avoiding additional rounds of community-wide interventions. We show here that, despite a high prevalence of clinical signs of disease, the estimated prevalence of chlamydial infection is low. The prevalence of the sight-threatening end stage of disease is also low, so we must consider whether the costly community-wide interventions are appropriate in this setting. The use of molecular tools at the population level to guide trachoma policy is still under investigation; this study will contribute to the pool of data required to assess the utility of these tools.
