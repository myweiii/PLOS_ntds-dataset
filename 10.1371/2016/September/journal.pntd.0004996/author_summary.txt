Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with more than 1 million cases per year globally and epidemics are increasingly reported. In this setting rapid typing is essential to identify potential clusters and transmission pathways. Typing of bacteria commonly requires bacterial isolates but culturing Leptospira is difficult and time consuming and requires invasive samples, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid. We modified an existing typing scheme to lower the limit of detection and were able to amplify and sequence alleles directly from clinical specimens. Samples included blood (whole blood, serum, or buffy coat) and urine from patients diagnosed by PCR with leptospirosis between 2014 and 2015 in the United Kingdom and the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. Using the sequences in phylogenetic analysis we identified the predominant Leptospira species in both countries as L. interrogans. With its increased sensitivity the modified assay allows for typing and species determination of Leptospira directly from blood or urine. It will be of use during epidemics and outbreaks for rapid identification of clusters and can support surveillance without the need to culture fastidious isolates.
