Despite the substantial decrease in its prevalence, leprosy continues to be a worldwide challenge. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to interrupt transmission. Currently, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of leprosy. Bacilloscopy and histopathology studies are complementary exams that provide high specificity but low sensitivity. It is therefore important to seek alternative tools to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis. The state of Rio Grande do Norte, in Brazil, has municipalities’ that are considered hyperendemic for leprosy, such as Mossoró, the one included in this study. This city presented an average of new case detection rate (NCDR) of 45.4/100.000 inhabitants per year from 2001 to 2013, much higher than Brazil’s NCDR, which is currently 15.3. Here, we show that the utility of the recombinant antigens LID-1 and LID-NDO to diagnose MB patients and detect asymptomatic M. leprae infection. In addition, we showed that antibody levels were related to the clinical form of leprosy as well as to the bacillary load. Interestingly, we observed that serum levels of LID-1/LID-NDO antibodies can be used to predict leprosy development among HHC. The assays have the potential to eventually be implemented as point of care at local health centers.
