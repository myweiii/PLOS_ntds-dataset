Leprosy is now recognized as a disease curable by chemotherapy. Although the number of leprosy cases has dramatically decreased as a result of multidrug therapy, there are still more than 210,000 new cases reported worldwide every year. Recurrence is a major concern in the control of leprosy. Relapses are usually considered to result from therapeutic failure due to inadequate or incomplete treatment. Thus, patient compliance with the planned course of medication is an important factor in the treatment outcome because multidrug therapy can take as long as up to 12 months. To improve patient compliance, it is imperative to develop and apply more potent drugs that can exert effect in a shorter period of treatment. In this study, focusing on the fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobials, we examined three powerful derivatives including newly developed DC-159a for their potencies against Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy. Our results indicate that the activity of DC-159a is sufficiently high and expected to surpass that of the currently used fluoroquinolone. This is the first strong evidence of the potential of this drug as a promising candidate for new leprosy remedies.
