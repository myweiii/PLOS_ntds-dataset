The identification of genes associated with drug resistance has contributed for understanding of the mechanisms of action of compounds against Leishmania, as well as, in the identification of the resistance mechanisms mediated by the proteins encoded by these genes. Differently from the mammalian host, Leishmania is unable to synthetize purine nucleotides de novo and must rescue preformed purines from its host. Due to this metabolic difference between host and parasite, the purine metabolism can be considered as a potential target for drug targeting. TUB is a toxic adenosine analog that was already demonstrated as effective against Leishmania. Using a strategy of gene overexpression after cosmid genomic library transfection, we isolated, mapped, sequenced and identified two genes involved in TUB resistance in L. major. In one of the cosmids, we identified NUPM1-like protein, an atypical multidrug resistance protein previously described in L. amazonensis involved in TUB resistance. The other cosmid contains a novel resistance marker involved in TUB resistance, described here as the TRP. Co-localization of TRP in the ER of LmjF and in silico structural predictions indicated that TRP might be an ER lumen protein. Our findings may be useful to elucidate the purine pathway in the parasite and to understand the role of TRP in the mechanism of TUB resistance.
