Trichinellosis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses, and a serious public health issue worldwide. Developing a vaccine is an alternative approach to control the disease. TsPmy is a paramyosin expressed by Trichinella spiralis to bind and neutralize human complement and a vaccine antigen. We made a DNA vaccine of TsPmy orally delivered by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium that elicited a robust Th1/Th2 and mucosa IgA responses, and protected mice against T. spiralis infection with significant worm reduction against larval challenge. The attenuated Salmonella-delivered TsPmy DNA vaccine provides a feasible and promising approach for controlling trichinellosis in human and domestic animals.
