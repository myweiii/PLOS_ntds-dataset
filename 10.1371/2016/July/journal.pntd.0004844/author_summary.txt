In Ecuador, leishmaniasis is a major public health concern reported in 21 of 24 provinces of the country, and eight Leishmania species, Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) major-like, L. (Viannia) guyanensis, L. (V.) panamensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) naiffi, and L. (V.) lainsoni, have been identified as causative agents of human cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniases (MCL). Causative parasite species for CL have been identified as L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (V.) panamensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (L.) amazonensis in Pacific coast areas, L. (L.) mexicana and L. (L.) major-like in Andean highland areas, and L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) naiffi, and L. (V.) lainsoni in Amazonian areas. In the present study, a countrywide epidemiological survey was performed to elucidate the current geographic distribution of causative species of CL in Ecuador, by using FTA card-spotted samples and smear slides as DNA sources. Putative Leishmania in 165 samples collected from patients with CL in 16 provinces of Ecuador were examined based on the cytochrome b gene sequence analysis. From these, 125 samples were identified, of which two dominant species, L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis, were widely distributed in Pacific coast subtropical and Amazonian tropical areas, respectively. Importantly, the present study demonstrated that cases of L. (V.) braziliensis infection are increasing in Pacific coast areas.
