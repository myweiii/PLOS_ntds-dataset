Madurella mycetomatis is the most common causative agent for eumycetoma, which is a progressive and destructive subcutaneous inflammatory disease. It is a neglected tropical disease affecting the population in poor and remote endemic tropical and subtropical areas. Currently, the susceptibility and resistance to mycetoma are not well defined, and many factors can be incriminated, including immunological, genetic, or environmental ones. The current descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the Th-1 and Th-2 cytokine levels among 70 patients with Madurella mycetomatis eumycetoma and 70 healthy controls. It aimed to find out the association between the disease prognosis and the level of these cytokines. Significantly higher levels of the Th-1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-2) were found in patients treated with surgical excision compared to those treated without surgical intervention. However, the Th-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10) were significantly lower in patients treated with surgical excision compared to those treated without surgical excision. These findings suggested that, cell-mediated immunity has a prime role in the pathogenesis of eumycetoma.
