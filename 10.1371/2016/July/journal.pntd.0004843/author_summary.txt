Rickettsial infection remains relatively unexplored in South America compared to other regions of the world. For most regions of Peru (including the Amazon Basin), nothing more than broad serological characterization is available about circulating rickettsiae. Even less is known about the animal reservoirs and insect vectors involved in disease transmission. With this study we aimed to better characterize the circulating species of Rickettsia in humans in the Amazon Basin, as well as investigate their domestic animal reservoir and arthropod vectors. Out of 2054 fever patients enrolled we identified 38 individuals with serologic evidence for acute rickettsial infection. Their homes were visited in order to draw blood samples and collect ectoparasites from their domestic animals. Serology and molecular methods were used to test the animal blood samples as well as the ectoparasites. The information collected contributes to the understanding of the transmission dynamics of rickettsial diseases in Iquitos and leads to a better understanding of the exposure risk to rickettsial infection and it will guide approaches for prevention.
