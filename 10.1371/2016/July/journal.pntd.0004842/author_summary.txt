Increasing concerns about the arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito—which include dengue, Chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus—demand a better understanding for the breeding ecology of this mosquito. A common observation on mosquito-borne diseases in endemic countries is that they peak following the onset of the rainy season and increase in breeding habitats, while they trough in the dry season. On the contrary, in Singapore, which has no pronounced dry season, dengue cases decrease after a very wet monsoon. Here, we show that this monsoon is likely involved in a strong seasonal reduction of outdoor breeding of the dengue mosquito through a sequence of flushing and drying events. A flushing-drying mechanism may affect the seasonal abundance of the vector in similar eco-epidemiological settings.
