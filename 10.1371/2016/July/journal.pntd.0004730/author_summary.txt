Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the fatal infectious disease melioidosis, is endemic across parts of South East Asia and Northern Australia. Melioidosis poses a serious worldwide emerging infectious disease problem and bioterrorism threat. Of the key features of B. pseudomallei, is its ability to remain latent in the host causing recrudescent disease years after initial infection. Relapses are also commonly reported despite appropriate and prolonged antibiotic therapy, suggesting the bacteria’s ability to escape the host’s front-line immune defenses and to manipulate the host’s responses to sustain survival in the host. However, the likely underlying mechanisms of bacterial persistence still remain unclear. Thus, here we proposed to study the host responses towards early interaction of the cell with live B. pseudomallei and its secretory proteins, in order to understand the potential roles of innate responses against the bacteria.
