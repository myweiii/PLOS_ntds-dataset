    "Background": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a major public health concern in Turkey and Sanliurfa represents the most endemic city in Turkey. Although children are most commonly affected by CL, detailed studies of pediatric CL in Turkey are lacking.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "In this report we retrospectively evaluated clinical and epidemiological data of 8786 pediatric CL cases, and how children respond to antimonial therapy. CL was observed most frequently in children between 6\u201310 years old. Interestingly this group showed shorter duration of disease and smaller lesions compared to 0\u20135 year and 11\u201315 year old groups. Females were more affected in all groups. Lesion localization and types varied among groups, with 0\u20135 year old presenting head/neck and mucosal lesions, and more often suffered from recidivans type, this could be associated to the longest duration of the disease in this group. Eleven-15 year old group showed fewer lesions in the head/neck but more generalized lesions. Evaluation of treatment response revealed that intra-lesional treatment was preferred over intramuscular treatment. However, 0\u20135 year old received intramuscular treatment more often than the other groups. Furthermore, the majority of 0\u20135 year old group which received intra-lesional treatment did not received subsequent intra-lesional cycles, as did children in the range of 6\u201315 years old.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "We report an increase in pediatric CL patients within the last four years. Analysis of pediatric CL patients by age revealed significant differences in CL progression. The data suggest that children between 0\u20135 years old responded better than other groups to intralesional treatment, since they received more often a single cycle of IL treatment, although follow up observation is required since they were more prone to develop recidivans. Eleven-15 year old patients comprise the largest percentage of patients receiving two or three cycles of intralesional treatment, suggesting that this group did not respond efficiently to intralesional treatment and highlighting the need for more effective therapeutic strategies against CL."
