The authors would like to thank all representatives of responsible staff of local veterinary services in Greenland and Canadas Northern territories for obtaining rabies samples from coastal regions. Without their help this study would have been impossible. The Canadian portion of this study was inspired by the efforts of Dr. H. Whitney (former Chief Veterinary Officer for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador) to improve knowledge of the spread of fox rabies in the north. We are especially thankful for the excellent technical assistance provided by Jeannette Kliemt and Patrick Wysocki at FLI, by Helle Rasmussen at DTU, and by Emilie Falardeau at CFIA. We also acknowledge the assistance of Dr C. Fehlner-Gardiner and staff from the CFIA's Centre of Expertise for Rabies for providing rabies diagnostic and typing services. The authors also wish to thank Dr Karen Mansfield (APHA) for providing rabies virus RNA from Greenland samples recovered in 2006.
