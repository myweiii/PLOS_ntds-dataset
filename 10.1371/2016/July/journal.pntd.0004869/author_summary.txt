Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a frequent parasitic infection of the human brain in developing countries. The symptomatology of human NCC after antiparasitic treatment is generally related to inflammation. The presence and degree of enhancement after intravascular injection of the contrast agent gadolinium in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly considered an evidence of blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Experimentally, the presence and degree of extravasation of Evans blue (EB) after intravascular injection into the tissues of the brain is a direct measure of blood brain barrier leakage. The BBB leakage of gadolinium in neurocysticercosis is commonly used as an indirect measure of inflammation but has never been experimentally proven. Here we evaluated the relationship between contrast T1-MRI, EB staining and histology findings in naturally infected pigs. There was a strong correlation between EB staining, contrast MRI and histopathology findings after antiparasitic treatment. This correlation was stronger when cysts were internally located in the brain than in superficial cysts partly located in the subarachnoid space (meninges). Contrast-enhanced MRI is a non invasive tool used in diagnosis and follow up of NCC patients. This study shows that the use of EB staining allows for the same conclusions as when using MRI post-treatment, and that both techniques correlate with histopathology findings. These results support the use of EB staining to study NCC using the porcine model as well as validate MRI enhancement to assess brain inflammation in patients.
