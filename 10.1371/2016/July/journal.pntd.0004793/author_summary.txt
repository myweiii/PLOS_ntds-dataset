Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, a disease that threatens millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. During its life cycle, Trypanosoma brucei lives in either its mammalian host or its insect vector. These environments are very different, and the transition between these environments is accompanied by changes in parasite energy metabolism, including distinct changes in mitochondrial gene expression. In trypanosomes, mitochondrial gene expression involves a unique RNA editing process, where U-residues are inserted or deleted to generate the mRNAâ€™s protein code. The editing process is directed by a set of small RNAs called guide RNAs. Our lab has previously deep sequenced the gRNA transcriptome of the insect stage of T. brucei. In this paper, we present the gRNA transcriptome of the bloodstream stage. Our comparison of these two transcriptomes indicates that most gRNAs are present in both life cycle stages, even though utilization of the gRNAs differs greatly during the two life-cycle stages. These data provide unique insight into how RNA systems may allow for rapid adaptation to different environments and energy utilization requirements.
