Preventing future outbreaks of ebolaviruses in humans and other vulnerable animal populations will require identifying the natural reservoirs of filoviruses. Accumulating indirect evidence points to certain bat species as prime suspects. To guide the search for natural filovirus reservoirs, we mined intrinsic biological data on the worldâ€™s bat species to determine what features best predict filovirus hosts compared to bats at large. We report a suite of traits that distinguishes seropositive bat species from all others with an estimated 87% accuracy. We also identify several bat species not currently known to be filovirus hosts whose trait profiles indicate should be surveillance targets. Geographic regions where numerous potential filovirus hosts co-occur (potential filovirus hotspots) suggest that filovirus distribution and diversity may be greater than previously thought.
