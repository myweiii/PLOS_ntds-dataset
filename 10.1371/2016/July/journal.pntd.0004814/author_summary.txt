On the Zanzibar islands, United Republic of Tanzania, elimination of urogenital schistosomiasis, a disease caused by infection with a blood fluke (Schistosoma haematobium), locally known as kichocho, is strived for in the coming years. This study used qualitative research methods of focus groups and in-depth interviews with adults, and group discussions with school-aged children to explore (i) knowledge and perceptions of kichocho transmission, (ii) specific behaviors among children in Zanzibar that put them at risk for acquiring infections with the kichocho parasite, (iii) symptoms of kichocho along with personal health-seeking behaviors and treatment strategies, and finally (iv) ideas for preventing kichocho in children. We found that there was little available formal education about disease transmission, which contributed to myths and misperceptions about routes of transmissions, causes, and treatment of kichocho. School-aged children regularly exposed themselves to contaminated natural, open freshwater bodies through recreational and domestic activities of daily life. Kichocho was often wrongly viewed as an infection with an intestinal worm of little significance, rarely associated with severe health consequences, and with little to no disease stigma. Local primary school teachers had little to no training about the disease and no teaching tools or materials for students. The findings add valuable insights into how current knowledge, perceptions, and practices impede optimal disease prevention and control and highlight the necessity for a community tailored behavioral intervention to interrupt transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis.
