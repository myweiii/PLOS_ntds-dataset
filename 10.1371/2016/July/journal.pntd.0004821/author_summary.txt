Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection in tropical and subtropical regions of the world that causes flu-like illness and, in severe cases, death. Every year, 390 million dengue infections occur worldwide, and over 3.9 billion people are now at risk from the disease. Although mosquito control and improved care have helped reduce dengue’s impact, a vaccine is needed. CYD-TDV, a live-attenuated vaccine, has been shown to be efficacious in preventing symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue disease in children aged 2–16 years. To help establish its safety, we analyzed integrated data from available clinical trials, with emphasis on safety parameters suggested by the World Health Organization. The analysis included data for 77,234 doses in 26,356 participants aged 2–60 years who have received ≥1 dose. We found that the overall safety profile of the dengue vaccine is satisfactory. The imbalance observed for dengue hospitalization and severe dengue observed in year 3 after the first dose in children aged <9 years who had received CYD-TDV vaccine was less marked in year 4. This imbalance was not observed in participants aged ≥9 years in either year. These results have contributed to the definition of the target population for vaccination, i.e. ≥9 years old for which the CYD-TDV vaccine has a satisfactory safety profile.
