Since 2013, a major epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) spread throughout three countries in West Africa for about two years. Its scale was unprecedented since the Ebola virus was first identified. Almost all districts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were affected, but some areas observed much larger outbreaks than others. In this study, we offer insights into the geographical variation of EVD transmissibility. We estimated the epidemic growth rate for each subnational unit and used the results to calculate the basic reproduction number R0, which indicates how many secondary infections arise on average from one primary case at the beginning of an outbreak. We found that the transmissibility of EVD differed within the three countries and we identified areas of high initial transmission. We also show that socio-demographic factors related to urbanisation and crowding might have been acting as drivers of EVD spread. These findings confirm that early containment of outbreaks in large communities is crucial for the prevention of epidemics as seen in West Africa during 2013â€“2015.
