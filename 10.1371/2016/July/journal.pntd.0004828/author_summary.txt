Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The symptoms of dengue are often mild; however, severe dengue is one of the leading causes of hospitalization and death among children in Asian and Latin American countries. A symptom of severe dengue is vascular leakage, which can result in fluid accumulation, hypotension, circulatory collapse, and even death. For dengue and severe dengue, there is no specific treatment, and the only supportive treatment is to maintain a patientâ€™s body fluids at normal levels. As a result, investigating the mechanism of how dengue virus (DENV) causes vascular leakage is an important and urgent issue. In this study, we demonstrated that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induced vascular leakage through the secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and the formation of autophagy. Inhibition of MIF or autophagy formation effectively reversed NS1-induced vascular leakage both in vitro and in mice. These results provide possible therapeutic targets for treating vascular leakage in severe dengue.
