Despite the widespread prevalence of liver fluke infections and many efforts aimed at developing a preventive vaccine just one drug, triclabendazole, is effective in killing all parasite stages. This is aggravated by the increasing number of countries reporting parasite isolates resistant to triclabendazole treatment, highlighting the urgent need to develop new agents to control fluke infections. Here, we report the discovery of chalcones that effectively inhibits key cysteine proteases essential for parasite development and survival within the host. We further characterized the mode of inhibition of the most active compound against cathepsins secreted by both adult and larval stages of the parasite. This class of compounds is generally considered safe for clinical use and we showed that the most effective derivative is not cytotoxic to bovine sperm cells. Importantly, in vitro approaches showed that it reduces host penetration and larvae viability, finally leading to parasite death. These findings point at this derivative as a good starting point for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases.
