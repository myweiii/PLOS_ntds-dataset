Scrub typhus is a mite-borne bacterial infection in humans caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium, prevalent in Asia, Northern Australia, and the Indian subcontinent. The pathogenesis of O. tsutsugamushi infection is known to be not only related to the virulence of O. tsutsugamushi, but also to the host immune response. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial MR1-restricted T cell subset. Upon antigen recognition, MAIT cells rapidly produce proinflammatory cytokines, maintain an activated phenotype throughout the course of an infection, and have the potential to directly kill infected cells; thus, playing an important role in controlling the host response. However, little is known about the role of MAIT cells in Orientia tsutsugamushi infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the levels and functions of circulating MAIT cells in scrub typhus patients and to examine the clinical relevance of MAIT cell levels. The present study demonstrates that circulating MAIT cells are activated and numerically deficient in patients with scrub typhus. Notably, impairment of TNF-Î± production represents the susceptibility of individuals to O. tsutsugamushi infection. These findings provide important information for predicting the prognosis of scrub typhus infection.
