Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a dermal disease of public health concern in Israel. The typical skin lesions are caused by single celled Leishmania parasites that are transmitted by the bite of an infected female sand fly. In the last years, the disease has been spreading and emerged in Urim, a small cooperative community, surrounded by agricultural fields in southern Israel. In this area the transmission cycle of leishmaniasis involves rodents as reservoir animals. For the purpose of experimental intervention against the reservoir animals, it was necessary to find out from what areas and distances infected sand flies arrived to the residential areas. The research in 2013 was based on integrated methodical monitoring of sand flies using CO2 baited traps and on marking. The results indicated the existence of dense and mobile sand fly population around Urim. The agricultural fields seemed to be the major source for sand flies. Sand flies apparently moved in all directions to distances typically of at least 0.75km. The risk of exposure to Leishmania-infected sand fly females had a distinct seasonal peak in September. The information was used to determine the "cordon sanitaire" in which actions against the reservoir had to be carried out.
