A live-attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has been shown to provide protection against dengue disease in two large-scale, placebo-controlled, phase III efficacy studies. Continued surveillance of study participants was subsequently undertaken to better define longer term vaccine efficacy and safety. A yet unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue disease was observed among children aged <9 years in year 3 of follow up. While the clinical outcome of the hospitalized cases was similar between CYD-TDV and placebo recipients, it was important to further investigate whether the immune profile induced by breakthrough infection differed between the two study groups. We compared the profile of 38 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in acute phase sera collected from participants with breakthrough disease in the two groups. No difference in overall profile was observed between CYD-TDV and placebo recipients. Similarly, no difference in the cytokine profile for breakthrough dengue was observed between those aged <9 years and those aged â‰¥ 9 years. Based on these analyzed factors, our study shows that CYD-TDV does not induce an overall altered immunological profile with breakthrough disease compared with placebo, in agreement with the similar clinical pictures and viremia observed in the two groups.
