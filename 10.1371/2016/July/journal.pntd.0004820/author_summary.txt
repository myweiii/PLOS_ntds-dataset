Cryptosporidium attributable morbidities in malnourished children are increasingly recognized. Exactly how malnutrition interferes with host mucosal immunity to diarrheal pathogens and mucosal vaccine responses remains unclear. Dissecting these interactions in an experimental model of cryptosporidiosis can uncover new insights into novel therapeutic approaches against a pathogen for which effective therapies and vaccines are currently unavailable. We demonstrate that although malnutrition diminishes baseline (primary) Th1-type mucosal immunity these deficits can be partially overcome via non-specific mucosal strategies (S. Typhi and CpG) and completely restored after a sub-clinical (low-dose) exposure to viable C. parvum. These results add insight into preventive strategies to help alleviate Cryptosporidium-specific diarrhea in children in low-resource settings and abrogate prolonged post-infection sequelae.
