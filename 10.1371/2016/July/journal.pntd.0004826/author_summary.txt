Parasitic nematodes pose a global threat to human health and severely impact livestock animals and crops. Most anthelmintic drugs paralyze worms, targeting pentameric neurotransmitter receptors in the neuromuscular synapse. A detailed understanding of this signaling allows the most effective use of existing drugs and the best opportunities for developing new treatments. The model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans has allowed major advances in our understanding of neurotransmitter receptors, including acetylcholine receptors targeted by the drug levamisole. Characterization of equivalent receptors in parasitic nematodes has revealed changes in receptor composition, the consequences of which are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms that produce new receptor subunits and characterize changes in receptor function that arise. We identified multiple duplications of unc-29, a subunit of the levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptor in parasitic nematodes closely related to C. elegans. We show the parasite, Haemonchus contortus, meets the criteria for a good model of this process and demonstrate that new copies of unc-29 experience selective pressure to rapidly acquire new functional properties, leading to the possibility of new drug targets. An evolved change in compatibility between receptor subunits appears to play a major role in determining the changes in receptor composition.
