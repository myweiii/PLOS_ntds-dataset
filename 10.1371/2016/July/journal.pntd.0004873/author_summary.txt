The proposed arbovirus biocontrol strategy of releasing mosquitoes infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia bacteria promises to reduce the transmission of dengue and Zika viruses, but its utility in the field may be limited by the local environment. We show that when Aedes aegypti infected with wMel experience high temperatures during egg and larval development, they have lower Wolbachia levels as emerging adults. High temperatures starting at the egg stage and lasting for seven days reduce Wolbachia levels in emerging females to less than 0.1% of control levels. However, partial recovery of Wolbachia occurs by 4â€“7 days of age. The spread of Wolbachia in wild A. aegypti populations and any resulting impacts on dengue and Zika transmission could be limited by periods of extreme heat, but Wolbachia levels may subsequently recover.
