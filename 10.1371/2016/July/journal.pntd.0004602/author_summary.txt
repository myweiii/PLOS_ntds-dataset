Little is known about communication patterns and social relations between health staff and long -term patients in African hospitals. An ethnography of a reference hospital treating patients afflicted with Buruli Ulcer (BU) and other chronic ulcers in Benin was conducted. Sources of psychosocial distress and communication patterns compromising quality of care were documented. Based on this research, an intervention was mounted to transform the hospital into a higher functioning therapeutic community. Question: answer education sessions were introduced to provide patients the opportunity to inquire about their illness, itâ€™s treatment and trajectory; weekly open- forums were established to give patients and hospital staff a chance to air grievances; patient representatives met with hospital staff to resolve problems in a non-confrontational manner, and psychosocial support for individual patients was provided through drop-in counseling sessions with social scientists in residence. Patients reported positive changes in the quality of their care and interactions with care providers, care providers reported that the problem solving process instituted was productive, and hospital administrators actively supported efforts to improve social relations and lines of communication. Systemic problems related to perceptions of preferential treatment for BU patients provided subsidized treatment supported by a national program remained contentious.
