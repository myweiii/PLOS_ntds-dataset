Nipah viruses cause outbreaks of severe human disease with high fatality rates. Different patterns of transmission have been associated with recurrent outbreaks caused by Nipah virus (NiV) in Bangladesh, where person-to-person transmission is a major pathway for human infection, compared to an outbreak in Malaysia, where pig-to-human transmission accounted for virtually all human infections. To date, there have been limited comparative studies that address the question of whether this difference may be attributed to differences between geographical isolates of NiV at the genome level, or to other factors in play during human outbreaks of disease. In this report, we employed the ferret, a surrogate human model, to compare features of infection and transmission of NiV isolates from Bangladesh and Malaysia. Our findings indicate that, although differences in levels of shedding are seen between the virus isolates, transmission risk is more likely determined by interactions between infected patients and at-risk individuals; factors that are driven by the social and environmental context within which human disease events occur. Our observations in the ferret have important implications for the implementation of strategies to mitigate transmission risk during outbreaks of NiV infection in people.
