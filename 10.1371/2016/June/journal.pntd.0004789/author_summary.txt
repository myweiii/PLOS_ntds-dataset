Dirofilaria repens is a filarial nematode which mainly infests the dog, but humans may be occasionally infested, too. The spread of the parasite is mediated by a number of mosquitoes species, which are well recognized as vectors of D. repens. The majority of reports of the disease come from the European Countries, especially those along the Mediterranean basin, but in the last decade several cases have been recorded also from Asian and African Countries, and this led the scientific community to consider such parasitosis an emerging disease. To date, diagnosis is based the morphologic analysis of microfilariae, isolated from the blood of infected hosts, but this may be time-consuming and the identification of parasite requires specialized parasitologists. The here described approach, based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), allows the detection of D. repens genomic DNA directly from the biological samples, and it may be easily and rapidly performed, producing unequivocal results in less than a hour. We also presented two versions of the assays. The first, a real-time LAMP, is characterized by a very high sensitivity but it requires an expensive real time PCR instrument, while the second, performed with the addition of propidium iodide, does not need such equipment, therefore being very affordable. This makes it suitable to be carried out in field and whenever expensive equipment or specialized personnel lacks.
