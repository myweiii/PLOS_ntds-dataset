Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) are endemic zoonotic infectious diseases caused by hantaviruses that belong to the Family Bunyaviridae containing negative-sense tripartite RNA genomes. Hantaviruses pose a critical emerging public health threat, with up to 200,000 clinical cases reported annually worldwide with 1â€“36% case fatality rates. In humans, hantavirus-borne diseases are contracted by the inhalation of viruses aerosolized from rodent excreta. However, there is no effective therapeutic or vaccine to prevent from the disease. Whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) were acquired from lung tissues of Apodemus agrarius captured in HFRS-endemic areas of the Republic of Korea (ROK). Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that sequences of the HTNV tripartite genomes clustered geographically, showing broad diversity of HTNV throughout the areas surveyed. Reassortment analysis first suggested a natural occurrence of the HTNV genetic exchange in the ROK. These observations contribute to a better understanding of the genetic diversity and molecular evolution of hantaviruses in HFRS-endemic regions. The complete sequences of HTNV genomes will provide a database for the phylogeographic analysis and surveillance of endemic hantavirus-borne diseases.
