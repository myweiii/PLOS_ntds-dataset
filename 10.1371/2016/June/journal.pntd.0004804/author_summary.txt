Dobrava virus (DOBV), Puumala virus (PUUV) and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) are important causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Clinical severity of Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) varies greatly from a mild, nonspecific febrile illness to a severe form of the disease with hemorrhaging and high fatality rate. In this study we investigated the role of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) as a prognostic marker for the severe form of HFRS and CCHF. The study showed high concentration of HMGB1 in HFRS and CCHF patients in comparison with healthy donors. Even more, higher levels of HMGB1 were measured in patients with the severe form of diseases. Interestingly, patients with severe PUUV infection had the highest concentration of HMGB1, although infection with DOBV and CCHFV usually causes more severe hemorrhagic manifestations. It is clear that HMGB1 has a broad repertoire of immunological functions and is involved in various pathways of immunity, inflammation and cancer progression, therefore also the induction by infection with PUUV, DOBV or CCHFV can influence different pathways. Nonetheless our research demonstrates a potential use of HMGB1 as an important biomarker for severity in PUUV and CCHFV infection.
