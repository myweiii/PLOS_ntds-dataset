Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonotic disease mainly present in Sub-Saharan Africa, transmitted by mosquitoes and primarily affecting livestock (cattle, sheep and goats). The epidemiology of the disease is not fully known, mainly because of data scarcity. In Mayotte, an island close to Madagascar, RVF has been present since at least 2004, and retrospective and prospective surveys have been conducted to collect data from livestock over 11 years. Our work uses this 2004–15 dataset to describe the past and current epidemiology of RVF on the island. Results suggest that the disease was endemic between 2004–07. An epidemic occurred between 2008 and 2010. Since 2011, the virus appears to be circulating at a low-level causing few new infections. Modelling work may be used to explain the observed epidemiological pattern, and estimate the likelihood of a potential re-emergence.
