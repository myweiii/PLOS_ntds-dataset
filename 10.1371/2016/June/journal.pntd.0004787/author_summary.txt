Eosinophils are known to mediate a protective response against several parasitic infections. This is largely accomplished by eosinophil degranulation (direct killing) and modulating effective adaptive immune responses. Consequently, eosinophils can also contribute to host pathology via a bystander effect. However, the outcome of infection varies depending upon the parasite species. In the case of neurocysticercosis (NCC), the role of eosinophils in disease progression has not been investigated despite the known eosinophilic response in patients. NCC is one of the most common parasitic diseases of the brain which is caused by the metacestode (larva) of the tapeworm Taenia solium. To determine the role of eosinophils in NCC disease outcome, we used a murine model of NCC in which wildtype (WT) or eosinophil deficient mice (ΔdblGATA) were infected intracranially with Mesocestoides corti, a cestode parasite related to T. solium. Our data show that murine NCC is characterized by a robust eosinophil response that correlates with lower parasite burden in the brain. Comparison of T cell response reveals a mixed Th1/Th2 in the WT brain, and ΔdblGATA mice showed a significant decrease in both population but in particular in the Th2 response. In addition, the strong eosinophil reaction observed in WT brains correlates with exacerbated pathology and increased morbidity. Thus, our study suggest that eosinophils act as a double-edged sword playing a role in controlling the infection but worsening the disease outcome by contributing to host pathology.
