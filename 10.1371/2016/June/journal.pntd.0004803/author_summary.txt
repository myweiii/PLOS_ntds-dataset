Scabies, a parasitic infection, and impetigo, a superficial bacterial infection, are treatable skin conditions found most commonly in resource-limited settings. Scabies is strongly associated with impetigo. Complications of impetigo include sepsis and invasive infections, and post-infective complications such as acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever. Good data on scabies and impetigo prevalence are lacking for most countries, but existing evidence suggests the Pacific region has among the highest prevalence of these conditions in the world. Our study aimed to establish the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, a South Pacific nation made up of over 900 islands and over 500,000 inhabitants. We assessed over 1900 people of all ages, and found a very high burden of skin infections, with scabies affecting one in five people, and active impetigo in one in three. Infants and children were affected more than adults. Scabies infestation was strongly associated with impetigo, supporting the hypothesis that community control strategies for scabies may be successful in reducing the burden of impetigo and its sequelae.
