Clonorchiasis and hepatitis B infection are infectious diseases that affect millions of people worldwide, especially in China. These two diseases are caused by two different pathogens, C. sinensis and hepatitis B virus, respectively. Concurrent infection between HBV and C. sinensis is often observed in some areas where C. sinensis is endemic. Both diseases share the same target organ, but there is little known on whether concomitant clonorchiasis could have an impact on HBV infection and the efficacy of antiviral treatment. In this study, we showed for the first time that co-infection with C. sinensis and HBV resulted in significantly higher liver transaminases levels as well as HBV DNA copies, indicating that co-infection with C. sinensis and HBV infection may aggravate the disease state. Combination treatment with antiviral and anti-C. sinensis drugs in co-infected patients could contribute to a reduction in viral load and help with liver function recovery. Furthermore, excretory-secretory products (ESPs) of C. sinensis may have a potential role in promoting HBV viral replication. This may explain, at least in part, the higher HBV DNA copies observed in co-infected patients. Additionally, a mixture of ESP and HBV positive sera could induce PBMCs to mainly produce Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 compared to HBV alone. A possible reason for higher HBV DNA copies and a weaker response to antiviral therapies in co-infected patients was the shift in cytokine production from Th1 to Th2 that may inhibit viral clearance.
