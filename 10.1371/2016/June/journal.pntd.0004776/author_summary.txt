Despite being preventable with adequate biologicals, rabies still causes an estimated 60,000 human deaths annually. The main burden lies on developing countries in Asia and Africa, where dog rabies surveillance is hampered by laboratory confirmation of disease due to a number of reasons, including laboratory infrastructure and logistics. Lateral flow devices (LFD) may increase surveillance and improve control efforts. Several LFDs for rabies diagnosis are available but, except for one, there are no data available regarding their performance. Therefore, we compared six commercially available LFDs for diagnostic and analytical sensitivity. With sensitivities ranging from 0% up to 100% depending on the LFD and the samples, none of the tests investigated proved to be satisfactory, and the results somewhat contradict previous studies, indicating batch to batch variation. The high number of false negative results reiterates the necessity to perform a proper test validation before being marketed and used in the field. Only when sufficient quality is assured for these alternative tests, then they can fulfil their potential. In this respect, we demonstrated that positive results in LFD can be further validated and characterized using RT-qPCR and sequencing.
