Typhoid fever continues to be a public health problem and novel more effective vaccines are needed. To gain new insights into the host-pathogen interactions, which could aid in novel vaccine design, an improved human oral challenge model with wild-type Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) was recently developed. In this model, 65% of the challenged subjects developed typhoid fever (referred here as typhoid diagnosis -TD-). B cells, whose main function is antibody production, are crucial components of the adaptive immune system. The effects that S. Typhi infection has on B cells have not been explored before. Here we demonstrate that S. Typhi induces several changes in various B cell subsets of participants that developed typhoid fever. Notable changes included upregulation of activation markers by a B cell subset that actively produces antibodies (plasmablasts). These cells also upregulated markers that guide them to the gut, the main site of S. Typhi infection. Various other changes were identified in other B cell subsets (e.g., Sm CD27+, SmCD27- and na√Øve) including upregulation of activation molecules (e.g., CD40) and downregulation of co-stimulators (e.g., CD21) that might indicate that each subset plays a different role during typhoid disease. Importantly, these changes were identified mainly in volunteers diagnosed with typhoid disease.
