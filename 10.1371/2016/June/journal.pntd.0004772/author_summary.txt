The human filarial parasites are the causative agents of two neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by the international community. The current elimination programs rely upon the mass distribution of a limited number of drugs, leaving the programs open to failure in the event that resistance develops. Thus, there is a critical need for novel chemotherapeutic agents to supplement the current arsenal. The filarial parasites are ecdysozoans, whose developmental processes are controlled by a master regulator, the ecdysone receptor. Here we validate the potential of the filarial ecdysone receptor as a chemotherapeutic target and report the development of high throughput and virtual screening assays that may be used to compounds that target it.
