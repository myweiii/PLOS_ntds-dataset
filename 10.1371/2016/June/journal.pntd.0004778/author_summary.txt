Schistosomiasis mansoni is a relevant disease affecting millions of individuals in different countries, in particular countries in Africa, and Brazil. Diagnosis performed by Kato-Katz technique for the detection of eggs in stool and a point-of-care test for circulating cathodic antigen detection in urine (POC-CCA) has been evaluated. Both methods have decreased sensitivity when diagnosing patients with low parasite burdens, which can lead to infected individuals not receiving treatment. Here, we focused on interpretation of POC-CCA results in persons with low parasite burdens. We noted a high number (49%) of indeterminate results, including false negatives and trace readings. A urine concentration step was included to improve the testâ€™s sensitivity. Important differences on sensitivity and prevalence rates were noted when comparing diagnosis by POC-CCA before and after urine concentration. Notably, indeterminate results were easily defined after introduction of this step. Cross reaction analysis confirmed the specificity of POC-CCA, with exceptions noted for individuals with hookworm infection. In conclusion, trace readings cannot be primarily defined as positive or negative cases. It is imperative to analyze each case individually by concentrating urine prior to the introduction of treatment, instead of relying on a point-of-care test with indeterminate results.
