Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent human malarial parasite outside Africa. The fact that patients can relapse due to the parasite dormant liver stages, among other biologic and epidemiologic characteristics of vivax malaria, facilitates the persistence of the disease in many endemic areas. These challenges have fueled the search for new control tools, including transmission blocking (TB) vaccines targeting the parasite sexual stages. Here we study the genetic diversity of two major TB vaccine antigens, Pvs25 and Pvs28. We show that these genes are relatively conserved worldwide but still harbor diversity that is not evenly distributed across the genes. These patterns are shared by the same proteins in closely related parasite species suggesting their functional importance. We also identify strong geographic differentiation between the circulating variants found in Asia and the Americas. Finally, evolutionary genetic analyses indicate that the observed variation in both genes could be maintained by natural selection. Thus, these polymorphisms may confer an adaptive advantage to the parasite. These results indicate that the genetic variation found in these genes and their geographic distribution should be considered by vaccine developers.
