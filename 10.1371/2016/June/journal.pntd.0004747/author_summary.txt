Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 and -2 are receptors on immune cells that act as mediators of the innate immune response. It is thought that TREM-1 amplifies the immune response, while TREM-2 acts as a negative regulator. Previously, we found that TREM-1 is upregulated in melioidosis patients. In contrast, nothing is known on TREM-2 expression and its role in melioidosis. In this study we examined the expression and functional role of both TREM-1 and -2 in a murine melioidosis model. We found that TREM-1 and-2 expression was upregulated during melioidosis. Using our experimental melioidosis model, we observed that Trem-2-/- mice were protected against B.pseudomallei-induced lethality. Trem-2-/- mice demonstrated reduced bacterial loads, inflammation and organ damage compared to wild-type mice in experimental melioidosis. Despite reduced bacterial dissemination of B.pseudomallei to distant organs in Trem-1/3-/ mice-, no differences in survival were found between Trem-1/3-/- and wild-type mice during melioidosis. Lastly, we investigated cellular functions of TREM-1 and TREM-2 and found that TREM-2 deficiency led to decreased cellular responsiveness to B. pseudomallei infection. In conclusion, we found that TREM-2 plays an important role during experimental murine melioidosis. TREM-2-deficiency reduces inflammation and organ damage, thereby improving survival.
