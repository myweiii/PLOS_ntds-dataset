The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) originates from tropical Asia, but over the last decades has invaded many regions worldwide. In several Southern Europe and US urban areas it has become the mosquito species creating the highest nuisance to the citizens, spoiling recreational outdoor activities by aggressively biting during daytime hours. Moreover, it has also become a public health concern due to its capability of transmitting to humans several exotic arboviruses. For an effective control strategy against these mosquitoes a profound knowledge of their preferences in terms of environment is mandatory in order to better understand what affects and determines their distribution. We analyzed some of these factors in the city of Rome and in its outskirts by collecting mosquitoes during an entire summer season. Results show that Ae. albopictus presence is more abundant in strongly urbanized areas compared to more green ones, but that within metropolitan Rome the highest densities are observed in small green areas within heavily urbanized settings, such as private gardens or public recreational areas, which should thus be the first target of anti-mosquito activities. Results also show that very high densities are not only observed in the warmest summer months as expected, but also in autumn, when people are less prepared to defend themselves from mosquito attacks.
