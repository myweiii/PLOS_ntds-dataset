Venomous snakes use venom proteins to capture their prey. When a human is bitten, these proteins cause severe pathology and often lead to death, disability or other serious complications. Understanding the composition of snake venom is essential not only for developing more effective snakebite treatments but also for acquiring a better understanding of the biology that underpins this extraordinary group of animals. Currently, to determine the genes expressing these venom proteins requires sacrificing the snake and isolation of mRNA from the venom gland. This is undesirable for ethical reasons and limits the scope of this type of research. Encouragingly, we and others have recently demonstrated that mRNA encoding venom proteins can be obtained from lyophilized snake venom. In this study we show that venom RNA in these samples is in fact considerably degraded. We report a protocol to improve the yield of undegraded RNA (immediate addition of TRIzol reagent to the venom). We also explored the limitations of this new protocol, in terms of time and temperature applicability. We then showed that considerable isoform diversity can be captured from snake venom RNA, and show that the isoforms identified are identical to those found in the venom gland of sacrificed snakes. Our findings provide protocols enabling researchers working in a range of fields to considerably expand the scope of their research because venom composition data can now be reliably acquired from venom which in turn can be obtained from live snakes without harming the animals.
