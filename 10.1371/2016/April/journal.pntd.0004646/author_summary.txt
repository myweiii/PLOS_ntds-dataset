Dengue and malaria are two of the most important diseases spread by mosquitoes. Clinical manifestations of both febrile diseases overlap considerably, and either can be fatal. In addition, they are co-endemic in many places throughout the world. Despite this, only a handful of reports of co-infection with dengue virus and Plasmodium species are reported in the literature. Through our febrile surveillance program in the Peruvian Amazon, we were able to retrospectively identify 17 cases of co-infection with dengue virus and Plasmodium. Our study aimed to assess whether co-infection was associated with more symptoms or a different immune response compared with mono-infection alone. To answer this question, we utilized data and blood specimens collected during the acute presentation of these 17 subjects and compared them to a matched group of subjects with either dengue virus mono-infection or Plasmodium mono-infection. Our findings indicate co-infection with both pathogens was not associated with more symptoms and the immune profile of co-infection resembled dengue virus mono-infection more than Plasmodium mono-infection.
