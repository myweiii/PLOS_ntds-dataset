In mid-2013, an outbreak of moderate-to-severe diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium was identified in the Arctic region of Nunavik, Quebec, and it predominantly affected young children. Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea in low-resource settings, but was previously unknown in this region. This is important because cryptosporidiosis has been repeatedly associated with impaired growth and development, and may interact with other challenges currently faced by children in remote Arctic communities, such as overcrowding and food-insecurity. Although animals in the Arctic have previously been found to harbour Cryptosporidium parvum, which can infect both animals and humans, we found that the Cryptosporidium identified in the stool of affected people all belonged to the species C. hominis, which is only known to infect humans. Together with the temporal and geographic distribution of cases, this suggests that cryptosporidiosis in this outbreak was transmitted person-to-person, rather than acquired from contact with animals. The emergence of Cryptosporidium infections in Arctic communities may have public health impacts beyond the occurrence of diarrhea.
