Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease of skin, subcutaneous fat and sometimes bone, mainly affecting children in West Africa. It is considered as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases but the disease occurs also in moderate climates like South East Australia and Japan where it may also affect adults. Once a patient has started antibiotic treatment, lesions may increase in size even if the antimicrobial treatment is effective; this is highly confusing for doctors and patients as they may think that treatment actually fails. The cause of Buruli ulcer is Mycobacterium ulcerans, related to other mycobacteria that cause disease in man, like leprosy and tuberculosis. Using data from two different studies in West Africa, we show that these paradoxical reactions are associated with trunk localization and that they occur more often in larger lesions. The chance to develop these reactions appeared partly inherited: carrying the homozygous ins/ins genotype of 3â€™UTR TGTG 285 polymorphism in the SLC11A1 gene increased the risk of paradoxical reactions. Vitamin D is important for the immune defense against infections by mycobacteria. Vitamin D blood concentrations were not associated with paradoxical reactions; patients generally did well, and we did not need corticosteroid immune suppression to overcome these reactions.
