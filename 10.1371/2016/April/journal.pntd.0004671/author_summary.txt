Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Because the exact trigger is still under investigation, current treatment options rely mostly on the surgical excision of the affected site. There is therefore a pressing demand for improved risk prediction and tailored treatment as well as for new drug targets. By resorting to the largest case-control study reported to date, we show that genetic variation in the autophagy-related genes NOD2, PARK2 and ATG16L1 influence the risk and course of BU disease. Thus, our results provide crucial insights into the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of BU.
