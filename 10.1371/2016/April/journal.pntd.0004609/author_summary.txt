Vaccination is a successful way to eliminate infectious diseases. The generated antibodies neutralize the invading microbe and avoid the establishment of infection. Vaccines are efficient to prevent infections by pathogens living outside rather than inside the host`s cells. This occurs because protection against intracellular pathogens requires the engagement of T lymphocytes. The discovery of receptors on innate immunity cells opened new perspectives in trying manners to stimulate effective response against intracellular pathogens. Frequently the microbial sensing by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) besides triggering immediate defense also orchestrates adaptative immunity towards T-cell response. Therefore, TLR ligands started to be assayed in new anti-infective approaches. Our laboratory has been investigating the immunomodulation induced by lectins, which are ubiquitous sugar-binding proteins. Our primary model is ArtinM, from the seeds of jackfruit, a lectin that binds to TLR2 sugar chains on macrophages and dendritic cells and promotes production of cytokines that engages T lymphocytes in a process that culminate with elimination of intracellular pathogens. Concomitantly, ArtinM activates other immune cells, including neutrophils, which contributes to the pathogen elimination, but may also account for tissue damage. This last possibility led us to investigate the lectin effects on neutrophils deeply. We analyzed neutrophils treated with ArtinM and infected with Leishmania major. We concluded that the leishmanicidal ability of ArtinM-stimulated neutrophils was due to augmented release of inflammatory cytokines, ROS production, and cell degranulation. Otherwise, host tissue integrity is favored by shortened cells lifespan and absence of NET formation. This work reinforces the idea that ArtinM can be an appropriate molecular template for the construction of an efficient anti-infective agent.
