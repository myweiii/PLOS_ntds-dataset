Anthrax is a worldwide zoonosis affecting mostly grazing herbivores, with occasional spillover to humans who have contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. We characterized the distributional patterns of both human and livestock anthrax in China from 2005 to 2013, and identified agro-ecological, environmental and meteorological factors contributing to the temporal and spatial distributions of the disease. We found that the spatial distribution of human anthrax in China was mainly driven by densities of cattle, sheep and humans, coverage of meadow, coverage of typical grassland, elevation, pH level of topsoil, concentration of organic carbon in topsoil, and meteorological factors. We also identified the regions with higher probabilities for the occurrence of human cases. Our findings provided a clear qualitative and quantitative understanding of the epidemiological characteristics and risk recognition of anthrax in China, and can be helpful for prioritizing surveillance and control programs in the future.
