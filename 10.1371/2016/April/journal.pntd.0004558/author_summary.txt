We compared the performance of the recently developed TPTest (Typhoid and Paratyphoid Test) with the Widal test, blood culture, and commercially available kits, Tubex and Typhidot in diagnosing the patients with typhoid fever. There is no acceptable gold standard; therefore, we estimated the sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic methods with Bayesian latent class modeling. We found that the sensitivity and specificity of the TPTest is higher than other commonly used methods for diagnosis of typhoid fever.
