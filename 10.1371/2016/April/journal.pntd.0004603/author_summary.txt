Buruli ulcer (BU) is a tropical skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and more than two thirds of the global cases reported in West Africa. The Offin has been considered the most endemic river valley in Ghana following a nationwide active case search conducted in 1999. Here, we present findings of an exhaustive household survey and case search of 13 selected communities along the Offin river aimed at addressing recent anecdotal accounts of unstable transmission of M. ulcerans within the river basin. We observed among the surveyed population of 20,390 inhabitants, an overall 2.3% prevalence of BU with 99.4% of the total cases detected being historical cases. We also observed a general trend of continuous and sporadic emergence of cases in mid and downstream communities, respectively. Subsequently, we detected a total of eight cases (0.04% cumulative incidence rate) in a prospective 17-month active surveillance of all 13 communities. These data confirm the recent decline in BU incidence in historically endemic communities along the Offin river basin, analogous to the observation made in recent years by the World Health Organization for West Africa.
