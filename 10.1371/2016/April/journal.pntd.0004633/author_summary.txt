Dengue transmission is a spatio-temporal process with interactions between hosts, vectors, and viruses. Its transmission also involves multiple complex or even hidden factors, such as climate, social environment, vector ecology, and host mobility. These complexities make the underlying process of dengue transmission difficult to clarify. We address how the patterns of dengue transmission can be inferred by investigating the 2014 dengue outbreak in the city of Guangzhou, China, taking the available surveillance data and applying mathematical models and computational methods. We can then estimate the distribution of dengue infections and identify the transmission mechanisms. In our study, we systematically investigate the critical factors, enabling us to estimate the real patterns and dynamics of dengue transmission beyond the surveillance data.
