Chikungunya virus is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites and causes fever and joint pain. Chikungunya was first detected in Africa, but recently became a worldwide concern with outbreaks in many (sub)-tropical countries. We report the characteristics of the first outbreak in Suriname (2014–2015). Mainly non-hospitalized patients were followed-up to study the clinical manifestations and course of the disease, after presentation in the respective clinics with the standard Chikungunya symptoms (fever and arthralgia). Twenty percent of follow-up patients could clear the disease within one week and 22% (mostly women and elderly) still had complaints about arthralgia up to 6 months after infection. This is consistent with the assumption that Caribbean Chikungunya viral infection has a less severe pathological outcome. Furthermore, more insight was gained into the symptomatology of children (≤12 years). In addition, house-to-house surveys in Paramaribo were carried out to identify suspected cases to assess the incidence. Almost 25% of the survey participants experienced symptoms consistent with Chikungunya during the nine months spanning the investigation. The launch of a governmental campaign to eliminate mosquito breeding sites coincided with a sharp decline of Chikungunya cases, suggesting that such measures may be important in the containment of future CHIKV outbreaks.
