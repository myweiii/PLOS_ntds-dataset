Environmental enteropathy is a widespread problem in adults and children in many disadvantaged populations, particularly in the tropics. It is not attributable to one specific infectious agent, but likely due to several insults of environmental origin. It is associated with growth failure in children, impaired responses to oral vaccines, and contributes to micronutrient deficiencies. Many of these problems can be related to immune activation, but the pathways of immune activation are unknown. Here we show that translocation of gut microbes and their molecular components is associated with defects in the epithelial lining of the gut, imaged using advanced endoscopic techniques. We also report evidence that these defects are associated with failure of endocrine and paracrine repair mechanisms which in health should restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier. These observations may open up new approaches for therapy for a neglected tropical disorder which impairs the health of millions of adults and children.
