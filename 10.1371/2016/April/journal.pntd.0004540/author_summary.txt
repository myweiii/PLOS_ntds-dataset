Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a chronic illness endemic to Latin America. In recent years, this neglected infectious disease has also become a global health concern due to the intense migratory flow of chronically affected individuals to nonendemic regions such as the U.S. and Europe. The only available drugs against this disease have important disadvantages, such as, high toxicity, strain resistance, and variable efficacy, underscoring the urgent need for new anti-T. cruzi agents. N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the attachment of myristic acid, a fatty acid, to many proteins. In T. cruzi, this enzyme appears to be essential, highlighting its potential as a drug target. In this study, we show that NMT is expressed in all stages of the parasite and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. We also evaluate eight NMT inhibitors as anti-T. cruzi agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of three of these compounds as anti-proliferative agents in this intracellular parasite, while showing very low toxicity against mammalian cells. In addition, we provide evidence of the on-target effect of these compounds, thus demonstrating their specificity and validating NMT as a drug target. These inhibitors hold great potential for further exploration as anti-Chagas disease agents.
