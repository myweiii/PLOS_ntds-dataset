It is well known that children are the population most susceptible to Japanese encephalitis (JE), and the incidence of JE among children in China has been greatly reduced by extensive promotion of vaccinations aiming at children. The incidence of JE among adults, however, has increased in some parts of China. Due to a dearth of studies on JE among adults, the spatio-temporal pattern of adult JE cases is poorly understood. Here, we explore and describe the spatial and temporal distribution of JE cases observed among different age-groups in China from 2004 to 2014. The results indicate that the JE cases of 0â€“15-year-old group are distributed mainly in the area south of the Yangtze River; while, the adult cases, especially in the >40 age-group, are concentrated in the area north of the Yangtze River. Further cluster analysis reveals six provinces north of the Yangtze River are hotspots for adult JE cases. And the incidence of adult JE cases in these provinces is significantly higher than the national average. The increasing JE incidence among adults has become an imperative public health issue and should be attached sufficient attention.
