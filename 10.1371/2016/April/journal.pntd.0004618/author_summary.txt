Parasite infections and HIV show large geographical overlap in sub-Saharan Africa and could hence potentially interact in co-infected individuals. In a general-population study conducted in Southwest Tanzania, we found high prevalence of both, lymphatic filariasis and HIV, with 42.5% of the adult population infected with Wuchereria bancrofti and 16.8% infected with HIV. Seven percent of the adults were infected with both pathogens. When adjusting for age, there was no statistically significant difference in initial prevalence or worm burden between HIV-positive and negative participants. For 798 individuals test results for both diseases were available in 2009, before and in 2011, after 2 rounds of treatment against lymphatic filariasis. Between 2009 and 2011, a significant drop of prevalence and worm burden in infected individuals were observed, which was more pronounced in the HIV co-infected subgroup. Hence, HIV co-infection does not seem to negatively affect lymphatic filariasis treatment programmes.
