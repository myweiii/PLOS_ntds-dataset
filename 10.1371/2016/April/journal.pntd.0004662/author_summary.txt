The Diseases Neglected by the Media (DNMs) are those diseases without media visibility due to their low newsworthiness level. In most cases, these diseases affect deprived social groups. This study analyses the DNMs by comparing the space achieved by the most important health problems for the population of Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil, in the local print media and the perceptions key journalists have of the media exposure in this social context. The major DNMs were poverty-related diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trachoma and helminths. In addition, diseases with outbreaks during the analysed period, such as whooping cough and meningitis, along with some types of neoplasms, respiratory diseases, and ischaemic and cerebrovascular heart disease, were identified. It is believed that public authorities should count on a broader media space concerning diseases recognized as political issues. Therefore, the media visibility of health and political topics, as well as that of economics or any other subject, is strategic in regard to the legitimization of priorities and the contextualization of overlooked realities.
