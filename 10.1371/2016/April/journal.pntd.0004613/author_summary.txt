Identifying the infectious diseases in developing nations could assist in clinical response, disaster response, and in assessing the need for specific public health infrastructure and therapeutics. Here we tested serum from patients in Sierra Leone who sought treatment for fever (and which remained undiagnosed) for immunological reaction to dengue viruses 1â€“4. We used a plaque reduction neutralization test, where patient antibodies will neutralize virus and reduce the number of plaques formed by virus. We report both the typical 50% reduction as well as a more stringent 80% reduction in our cohort. We show that over 77% of patients in this study had moderate reaction (PRNT50) to at least one dengue virus type and many patients reacted to more than one dengue virus. We conclude that dengue is circulating in the region and may be a thus far undiagnosed etiology of fevers of unknown origin in the region.
