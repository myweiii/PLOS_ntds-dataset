Trypanosoma (T.) evansi causes surra in various animal species in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Despite inducing important animal suffering, economic losses and being a World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) notifiable disease, surra is severely neglected in terms of awareness, control interventions and research into improved control tools. Most serological tests can only detect T. evansi type A, while molecular tests rely on detection of highly variable genes or on fragile kinetoplast DNA. Even more, the obscure T. evansi type B, first isolated decades ago in Kenya, totally escapes surveillance due to absence of reliable diagnostic tools. In the present study we isolated new type B stocks from Ethiopia, thus suggesting that this type of T. evansi is probably more widely distributed than previously thought. We further report on an alternative molecular marker for both types of T. evansi and present data on the drug sensitivity of the Ethiopian isolates.
