Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified in 2015 in Brazil for the first time, causing outbreaks of an illness characterized by skin rash and absent or low grade and short-termed fever. It is difficult to distinguish ZIKV from Dengue (DENV) or (CHIKV) based on the acute clinical presentation. The virus is closely related to DENV, and therefore antibody tests also have problems distinguishing between the two viruses due to cross-reactivity. Recent findings suggest that in a minority of ZIKV cases neurological disease can develop, and that babies born from mothers reporting a ZIKV-like illness during pregnancy may suffer from congenital abnormalities, in many cases a small head or brain. Here we report about an outbreak of ZIKV disease in Rio de Janeiro in the first half of the year 2015, which reached its peak in May/June 2015. This is the first published description of a ZIKV outbreak in Latin America. It is interesting to note that confirmed cases appeared as early as January 2015. Cases were confirmed based on the detection of the viral genome in the blood of the patients. The clinical characterization of the confirmed cases and unconfirmed cases proved to be very similar. Itching or itching rash has been suggested to be added to the case definition issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
