This study is about occupational therapy and we focus on the autonomy of patients with disabilities due to leprosy. Our purpose was to analyze the repercussions of assistive technology on the autonomy of care of the self in patients with sequels of leprosy We performed a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory study between November 2014 and February 2015 at a university hospital in Rio de Janeiro, and interviewed eight patients. Analysis was conducted by the hermeneutic approach. The following categories were studied: contribution of the adapted devices for the care of the self and feelings and sensations provoked by the use of self-help devices. The reports revealed feelings, perceptions and meaningful contents about the social, familiar and individual dimensions, also the stigma coupled with leprosy. Assistive technology is an approach with a powering potential that provides tools for the subject's care of the self and promotes social inclusion.
