Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a disease of the female genitalia caused by a water-borne parasite. The parasite lays eggs that may be found in the genital organs and these eggs cause local inflammation and subsequent lesions. These lesions are called sandy patches and they are often accompanied by abnormal blood vessels. Sandy patches can be hard to see and clinicians have suggested that the typical blood vessels may serve as supporting or independent diagnostic indicators of FGS. Clinicians have described the specific features of the vessels as: appearing as circular shapes, forming a network and having branches. In this study, we examined the shape and appearance of cervical blood vessels by computer image analysis. We found that the blood vessels in women with FGS appear more often as circular shapes, at higher density and with more complex shapes compared to those in healthy women and in women with inflammation of the cervix for other reasons than FGS. Our findings suggest that cervical vessel appearance can contribute to the diagnosis of FGS. It could also be used in a future diagnostic tool using computer analysis. Further research is needed to determine if FGS can be diagnosed objectively.
