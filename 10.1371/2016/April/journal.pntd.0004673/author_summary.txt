Coinfection with malaria and intestinal parasites are common in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in impoverished and poor sanitary settings. The interaction between intestinal parasites and malaria in coinfected children is still not clear. Some published papers suggest intestinal parasites, especially Ascaris lumbricoides, may attenuate the severity of malaria in the presence of coinfection. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the effect of intestinal parasitic infection on the severity of malaria, malaria parasite density and the haemoglobin concentration in children coinfected with malaria and intestinal parasites in Cameroon. We did not observe any significant association between intestinal parasitic infection and severe malaria or malaria parasite density or haemoglobin concentration. Stratification of severe malaria according to the degree of severity revealed a significant association with intestinal parasitic infection, in which prevalence of intestinal parasites was higher in children with mild severe malaria. Analyzing the different species of intestinal parasite did not yield any significant association either. These findings are contrary to many research publication on the subject. Several factors could have contributed to our observation, including the regular deworming campaign organized by the Cameroon Ministry of Public health, accounting for the lower prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection, and also the geographical setting.
