Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by the bite of sandflies that produces skin ulcers. The severe, disfiguring form of the disease is characterized by parasite dissemination to the mucosa of the nose and palate. Current diagnosis is based on microscopy which has low sensitivity in chronic cases. Molecular methods (PCR) that detect parasite DNA are highly sensitive but costs and personnel training make it impossible to implement it in resource-limited areas. We developed a novel molecular method (RPA-LF) that could be applied in the field because it does not require sophisticated equipment. It is also very sensitive and specific to detect the principal Leishmania species that produce cutaneous leishmaniasis in Latin America. Future field implementation of RPA-LF could have a positive impact on disease management and control.
