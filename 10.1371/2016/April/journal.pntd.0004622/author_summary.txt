Our study is the first to quantify sources of infection and describe risk of transmission of Ebola to young children. We found that the risk of a child under three developing Ebola disease was low unless their mother had EVD, and that the risk was particularly high if their mother died of EVD. But we found no additional risk from breastfeeding. WHO recommends separating asymptomatic breast-fed infants from their mothers if they develop Ebola, and using formula feeding. We support the need for separation because of the high risk related to proximity, but more research is needed to more fully understand this, particularly given the importance of breast-feeding in preventing other childhood illnesses. We also found young children in Ebola-affected households whose mothers were not ill had a surprisingly low risk of developing EVD which was not all explained by low exposure to the virus. Many children stayed well despite having direct contact with EVD patients with diarrhoea, vomiting or bleeding who are considered the most infectious. We hope these findings will provide impetus for more detailed studies into age-related response to the Ebola virus.
