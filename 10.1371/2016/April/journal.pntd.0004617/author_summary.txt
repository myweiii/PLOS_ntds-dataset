Parasites from the genus Trypanosoma and Leishmania are etiologic agents for a group of neglected diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates in the developing world. Inasmuch as vaccine development is hampered by the successful mechanisms employed by the pathogens to evade the host immune response, chemotherapy remains as a safe option to fight these diseases. However, new drugs with better pharmacological performance (i.e. safety, efficacy and ease of administration) than those in current use are urgently needed. The thiol-redox metabolism of trypanosomatids offers an excellent opportunity for the development of more selective and efficacious medicines because it depends on a molecule, trypanothione (a bis-glutathionyl derivative of spermidine), unique and indispensable to the pathogens. Here we report the identification of novel inhibitors of trypanothione synthetase from three major trypanosomatid species of medical and veterinary relevance. Although highly conserved in sequence, trypanothione synthetases display significant species-specifity towards compounds, pointing to structural differences as determinants of ligand selectivity. Most of the active compounds presented two-digit Î¼M inhibitory activity and serve as primary scaffolds to develop more potent inhibitors. Among them, N,N'-bis(benzyl)-substituted diamine and paullone derivatives are interesting candidates because of their potent and/or selective anti-trypanosomal and anti-trypanothione synthetase activity.
