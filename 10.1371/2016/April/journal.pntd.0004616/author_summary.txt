Typhoid fever is an important cause of avoidable mortality in regions without adequate access to safe water and sanitation. Highly immunogenic typhoid conjugate vaccines are now licensed and under consideration as a public health intervention in India. The decision about whether and how to introduce a public vaccination programme needs to be based on an understanding of disease burden, and the age-groups and geographic areas at risk. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting typhoid and paratyphoid incidence and prevalence in India between 1950 and 2015. The estimated prevalence of laboratory-confirmed typhoid and paratyphoid among individuals with fever across all hospital studies was 9.7% (95% CI: 5.7–16.0%) and 0.9% (0.5–1.7%) respectively, with a significant decline in prevalence of the former over time. We found only three population-based studies that reported incidence. Pooled estimates were 377 (178–801) and 105 (74–148) per 100,000 person years for typhoid and paratyphoid respectively, with incidence being highest in in children between 2 and 4 years. Despite an apparent decline in prevalence, typhoid remains a significant burden in India, particularly among young children. Studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of infant immunisation with conjugate typhoid vaccines.
