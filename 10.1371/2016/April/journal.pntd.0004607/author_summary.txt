Dengue, an acute arboviral disease has emerged globally, inflicting debilitating symptoms in 96 million people. The early prediction of severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) is challenging due to varied and late-presenting symptoms, requiring frequent monitoring for signs of disease progression. An often used parameter to monitor disease progression is decrease in platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, which is a feature of DHF. However, whether platelet-derived compounds are useful as early biomarkers predictive of DHF has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the utility of serum metabolites as predictive biomarkers. We developed quantitative and high-throughput tools and discovered circulating serotonin, conceivably platelet-derived, that showed a nearly two-fold decrease in DHF patients compared to mild dengue fever. Because immune mediators may increase the predictive ability, we measured them in blood and identified interferon-gamma as an important cytokine in DHF. When serotonin is used in combination with IFN-Î³, this dual-panel predictive panel provides accurate prognosis of DHF within 96 h from fever onset. These findings may have important clinical implications not just in early dengue prognostication but also in the design of therapeutic strategies against dengue infections.
