Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic filariasis (LF) are debilitating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Practical challenges in implementation of mass drug administration (MDA) such as prolonged treatment regime requirements and the possible emergence of drug resistance will likely impede the elimination of these NTDs. Hence, the availability of an efficacious prophylactic vaccine would be an invaluable tool. The objective of the present studies was to use the B. malayi-gerbil model of filariasis as a surrogate system to test the efficacy of filarial molecules as vaccine targets for an onchocerciasis vaccine. The vaccine efficacy of Onchocerca volvulus recombinant proteins Ov-RAL-2 and Ov-103 was recently demonstrated using a mouse diffusion chamber model. In this communication, we provide encouraging results on the vaccine efficacy of Bm-RAL-2 and Bm-103, individually or in combination. Our data demonstrate that vaccination with Bm-RAL-2 and Bm-103 concurrently and as a fusion protein confers not only a consistent and significant protection against B. malayi infection in gerbils, but also reduces the fecundity of female worms as demonstrated in embryogram analyses. Our results support the contention that Ov-RAL-2 and Ov-103 are excellent onchocerciasis vaccine candidates and that further investigations leading to their development as a vaccine are warranted.
