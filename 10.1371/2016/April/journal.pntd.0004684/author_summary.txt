Schistosomiasis is a persistent but neglected parasitic disease, afflicting more than 200 million people worldwide. Complex gene regulatory mechanisms are equipped by its causative reagents, parasites of the genus Schistosoma. Dissecting these mechanisms thus will be beneficial for better control of the disease. DNA microarrays are flexible tools for profiling gene expression. Here, a custom printed microarray with a comprehensive coverage of the Schistosoma japonicum transcriptome, was utilised to decipher gender-associated genes of that species. A total of 685 and 430 mRNA transcripts were shown to be highly expressed in adult males and females, respectively. Genes enriched in the male adults were associated with cytoskeleton, motor and neuronal activities, whereas genes expressed more highly in female parasites were involved in amino acid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, glycosylation, cell cycle processes, DNA synthesis and genome fidelity and stability. A general scenario on how miRNAs potentially modulate these gender-associated genes is provided. The results here further highlight the transcriptomic differences between male and female parasites and provide a stepping-stone for identifying new vaccine and drug targets.
