We present the first comprehensive phylogenetic study aiming to understand the geological events that led to Triatominae diversification. We gathered the most diverse sampling of Reduviidae and Triatominae to construct a robust and accurate phylogeny and to be able to use more than the two Triatominae fossils as calibration points for our time estimates. The possible role of geological events in several of the major cladogenetic events within Triatominae is tested for the first time in the present study. We were able not only to correlate the geological changes in the Neotropics with Triatominae evolution but also to add to an old discussion: Triatominae monophyly vs. paraphyly.
