Chronic infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a common neurotropic pathogen, affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide. There is marked variation in the human response to infection. Epidemiological studies indicate that virulent strains of T. gondii are associated with increased frequency and severity of human toxoplasmosis. However, animal studies on the pathogenic effect of chronic infection have focused on relatively avirulent strains because they can easily establish latent infections in mice. Employing a murine model of chronic infection with virulent strain, we found that mice displayed variable outcomes ranging from aborted to severe infections. Parasite burden, as measured serologically, was found to be the critical determinant of behavioral and pathogenic changes in chronically infected mice. This study demonstrated the predictive value of serologically determined parasite burden to the levels of chronic infection. Our finding highlights the critical role of parasite burden in a range of disease severity during chronic infection. Our finding may have important implications for understanding the heterogeneous effects of T. gondii infections in human.
