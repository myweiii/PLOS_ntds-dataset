Humans become infected with E. multilocularis through oral ingestion of the eggs. Untreated alveolar echinococcosis has a fatality rate of >90% in humans, causing great public health concern in the northern hemisphere. The genome databases of E. multilocularis have been recently published, but still there is no available data about transcriptomic profile datasets of the early larval stages (non-activated and activated oncospheres and immature metacestodes). In this study, the gene expression profile of E. multilocularis oncospheres and metacestodes were tested using the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach. The expression level of hundreds genes was significantly different between oncospheres and metacestodes. Some known tapeworm-specific antigen family like diagnostic antigen gp50, antigen Eg95, and antigen B are predominated in oncospheres and metacestodes, respectively. Furthermore, within the tapeworm-specific antigen family, some antigen subunits or variations were stage-specific expression. The identification of genes expression profile during the parasite development stages, especially the stage of oncospheres, will give fundamental information for choosing candidate genes used in vaccination and early diagnosis.
