Leprosy infection is cured with multi-drug therapy (MDT), but patients may develop immune mediated skin and nerve lesions. These immunological reactions lead to disability and deformity secondary to neuropathy. Prednisolone is the main drug used to treat reactions but is only partially effective and patients have a high rate of side effects. Identifying better agents for treating leprosy reactions is an important clinical goal. We tested the safety and efficacy of ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant used in many inflammatory conditions, in Type 1 reactions (T1R) in leprosy patients in Ethiopia. A double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and adverse event profiles of ciclosporin and prednisolone was conducted in patients presenting with acute T1R. Patients on ciclosporin and prednisolone had similar improvements in clinical outcomes which were measured as skin and nerve function improvement. Both groups had a high rate of T1R recurrence (85%) and the patients on ciclosporin required more additional prednisolone to treat recurrences. We assessed patient quality of life and this was significantly improved with both treatments. This is the first assessment of patient quality of life in a leprosy patients trial. Ciclosporin may be a useful alternative in the treatment of T1R, but that the need for additional steroids decreases its value.
