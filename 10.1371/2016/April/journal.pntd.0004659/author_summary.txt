Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects an estimated 600 million people in developing countries. Treatment is currently dependent on a single drug which is only active against the adult form of the disease. Treatment of infected patients eliminates adult worms but leaves any juveniles to survive and develop, thus continuing the infection. A drug acting equally against adult and juvenile worms is likely to be more effective at eliminating the disease. We have identified quality chemical leads with balanced activity against all life stages of the parasite and with a good window over cytotoxicity, which could form the basis of an exciting new drug discovery project.
