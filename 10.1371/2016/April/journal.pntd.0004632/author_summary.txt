Despite the long recognition that skunks are an important reservoir host for rabies, the control of this disease among this host has not been achieved, and the disease is currently only passively monitored in North America. The need for rabies control among striped skunks is, however, well acknowledged, and reports of occasional spill-over of skunk variant rabies viruses to non-reservoir species, including some domestic animals, remains a cause for public health concern and a major roadblock for eradicating rabies from North America. An understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of diseases is important in management and for setting future research agendas, and such knowledge could assist in effective striped skunk rabies control. In this study, we evaluated whether rabies among striped skunk cases submitted for testing in the North Central Plains exhibit discernable spatial and temporal patterns, and if there are any eco-climatic factors that influenced such patterns. Our findings indicate that the year-to-year and spatial origins of rabies incidences in the states of Kansas and Nebraska in the North Central Plains are currently stable, and certain physical environment (developed low-intensity areas and patch fragmentation) and climatic (diurnal temperature range) factors play an important role in determining such temporal and spatial patterns.
