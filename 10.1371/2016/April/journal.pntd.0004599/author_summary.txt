The local pathology induced by viperid snakes is characterized by a complex of alterations as consequence of direct and indirect effects of the toxins present in the venom, as well as the host response to tissue damage, and constitutes a dynamic process of degenerative and reparative events. The pathogenesis of local effects induced by Bothrops asper venom has been studied by traditional methodologies. Recently, proteomic analysis of wound exudates collected in the vicinity of affected tissue has become a powerful tool to study the pathogenesis of local envenoming from a more integrative perspective. Thus, in the present study we analyzed the dynamics of the local effects induced by B. asper venom in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice through a proteomic and immunochemistry approach in order to identify biomarkers of tissue damage and repair during the course of envenoming. Our results showed an early presence of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in exudates as compared to cytoskeletal proteins, which reflect the rapid cytotoxic effect of venom, followed by the action of endogenous proteinases in the cytoskeleton of damaged muscle fibers later on in the course of envenoming. On the other hand, the early presence of extracellular matrix components and the increment of some of them in exudates, reflect the rapid microvascular damage and hemorrhage induced by the venom, followed by the action of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) during tissue remodeling as part of the inflammatory response. Overall our study allowed the identification of key biomarkers of tissue damage and repair as part of the pathological effects induced by B. asper venom in skeletal muscle, which offer relevant insights for a better understanding of the complex dynamics of local pathology induced by viperid snakebite envenoming.
