Melioidosis is an underdiagnosed and underreported disease in India with protean clinical manifestation and high fatality. Causative agent B. pseudomallei, after environmental exposure, may cause disease or survive unnoticed for a long time in human and animal hosts. Individuals with diabetes and renal disease develop melioidosis with greater intensity and fatality. Recent increase in case reports of melioidosis in India might only be a tip of iceberg and represent small portion of a larger public health problem in the background of large number of diabetic population in the country. The paucity of data on disease prevalence has prompted us to undertake this sero-epidemiological study in a site located along the west coast of south India with heavy rainfall and rice farming as predominant agricultural activity. This site serves as a catchment for Kasturba Medical College and Hospital, Manipal, where nearly 20 to 30 cases of melioidosis are diagnosed each year. This first ever population-based seroprevalence study in India demonstrated a 29% seropositivity that is comparable with other endemic regions in Southeast Asia and Australia. Non-farmers were as likely to be seropositive as farmers. We also found a uniform seropositive status across various age groups and skill level of jobs. Females demonstrated higher seropositivity. Activities exposing the individual to environment such as gardening emerged as risk determinants of seropositivity.
