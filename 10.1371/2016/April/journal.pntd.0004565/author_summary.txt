Antivenom is the most effective treatment modality for snake envenoming. However, they are specific and effective against only one or a few snake venoms. Production of antivenom against many snake species covering a wide geographic area of some countries or regions e.g., Asia and Africa, is not yet possible. This study aimed to use a simple procedure to produce horse antiserum which could neutralize many or all medically important elapid (neurotoxic) snakes (cobras, kraits) of Asia. The venoms of 6 elapid species were obtained from 12 different regions/countries of Asia. Nine of these venoms were ultra-filtered to remove high molecular weight, non-toxic proteins to obtain the toxin fractions (TFs) for use as immunogen and thus enable inclusion of greater variety of elapid venoms. The 9 ‘toxin fractions’ together with the remaining 3 crude venoms were used to immunize 3 horses. The antisera of the horses obtained were shown to neutralize, in mice, the lethal effects of the venoms used in the immunization and 16 other Asian/African elapid venoms not used in the immunization. Thus, the simple strategy could broaden the neutralizing capacity of the resulting antiserum. The antiserum could be processed into antivenom with wide paraspecificity and effective against many elapid snakes of Asia.
