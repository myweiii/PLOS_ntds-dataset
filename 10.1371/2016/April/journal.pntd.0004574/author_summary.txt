Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever, caused by a tick-borne phlebovirus. Studies have found that a variety of domestic and wildlife animals can be infected by SFTS virus (SFTSV), but the natural reservoir host for the virus remains unclear. Although the SFTSV-RNA was identified in certain species of ticks or their larvae, contamination from their host animals cannot be excluded to be the source. We analyzed 9,984 ticks collected from vegetation or feeding mammals in 2013â€“2014 in Jiangsu province, an endemic area in China, and detected SFTSV-RNA in both parasitic and questing ticks. Interestingly, SFTSV-RNA was identified in larvae of Haemaphysalis longicornis, collected in vegetation without being blood fed, indicating a possibility of a vertical transmission of SFTSV in H. longicornisis in nature. We also detected SFTSV-RNA in four mammal species which may serve as natural amplifying hosts for SFTSV. In addition, we identified antibodies against the virus in two migratory bird species, suggesting wild birds, exposed to infected ticks, could spread the virus through flyways for long-distance transmission. These findings provide novel insights for understanding SFTSV ecology and transmission mechanism and help develop new measures to halt its rapid spread.
