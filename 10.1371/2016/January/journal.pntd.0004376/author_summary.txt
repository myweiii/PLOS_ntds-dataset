We present the population genetics of malaria vivax parasites in a large area of the Peruvian Amazon. Our results showed that the parasite population had a predominant clonal propagation, reproducing themselves with identically or closely related parasites; therefore, the same genetic characteristics are maintained in the offspring. The clonal propagation may favour the higher levels of genetic differentiation among the parasites from isolated areas compared to areas where human migration is common. The patterns of gene flow have been established, finding Iquitos city as a reservoir of parasite genetic variability. Moreover, a recent reduction of the parasite population was observed in areas where recent control activities were performed. This research provides a picture of the nature and dynamics of the parasite population which have a significant impact in the malaria epidemiology; therefore, this knowledge is crucial for the development of efficient control policies.
