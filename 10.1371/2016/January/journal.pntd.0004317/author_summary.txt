Strongyloides stercoralis is a common intestinal parasite affecting about 50–100 million people worldwide. It is characterized by a complex lifecycle involving both free- living and parasitic stages and the clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure. It has the propensity to cause disseminated disease and death in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, an in depth understanding of the immune responses to this helminth parasite is warranted. However, what we know about the immunity to this infection is mostly derived from animal studies. Th9 cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells producing the cytokine—IL-9. Since Th9 cells are increasingly recognized as being important in immunity to intestinal infection with helminths, we examined the induction and regulation Th9 cell responses to Ss infection utilizing infected and uninfected individuals from an endemic area in India. We show that Ss infection is characterized by profound alterations in the Th9 compartment and that this response is mainly regulated by the cytokines—IL-10 and TGFβ. In addition, we also demonstrate that active infection is a pre-requisite for this regulation and anti-Ss treatment can dampen enhanced Th9 responses.
