Visceral leishmaniasis causes fever, enlargement of internal organs like the liver and the spleen, and leads to death if no treatment is given. It is caused by a microbe called Leishmania and affects children and adults in warm and temperate regions of the world. Antimony in different forms has been used to treat Visceral Leishmaniasis for almost one century and is still in use in several countries despite the fact that it sometimes displays toxic effects, especially in patients with underlying health problems. Because it is better tolerated and at least as effective as antimony, liposomal amphotericin B is now used as the first treatment for Visceral Leishmaniasis in Southern Europe. We observed that a small proportion of patients—especially those with an impaired immune system—do not cure even after several courses of liposomal amphotericin B. In 4 such patients with “unresponsiveness” to liposomal amphotericin B, antimony provided a sustained cure without major side effects. We conclude that when multiple failures or relapses occur after treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, antimony is a reasonable, potentially life-saving treatment option. These observations also suggest that “unresponsiveness” to amphotericin B results from unusual resistance mechanisms.
