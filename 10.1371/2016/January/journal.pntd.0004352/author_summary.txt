Trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness world-wide, is targeted for elimination by 2020. The World Health Organization advises districts to undertake surveillance for trachoma when follicular trachoma (TF) is less than 5% in children 1–9 years. In a trachoma-endemic district that stopped its program four years ago, we undertook a surveillance survey, adding to the assessment of TF a test for C. trachomatis infection, and a dried blood spot which was processed for antibodies to C. trachomatis antigen pgp3; antibody status may indicate cumulative past exposure to infection. The prevalence of TF was 0.4%, below the 5% cut-off indicating that trachoma elimination had been achieved with no re-emergence. The antibody positivity overall was low, 7.5%, and increased with age from 5.2% in 1–3 year olds, to 9.3% in 7–9 year olds (p = 0.015). In 16 of the 30 hamlets, no children ages 1–3 years had antibodies to pgp3. The antibody status of the 1–3 year olds indicated low cumulative exposure to infection during the surveillance period. In summary, four years post -program, there is no evidence for re-emergence of trachoma using any indicator sufficient to cause re-emergence.
