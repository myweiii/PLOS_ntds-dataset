Macrophages play critical roles in modulating Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) infection. In this study, we investigated the immune status of macrophages stimulated with live M. leprae or killed M. leprae. We found that live M. leprae-infected macrophages polarized toward the regulatory M2-type, preferentially primed Treg responses, and downregulated Th1 and cytotoxic T cell responses. Furthermore, our ex vivo data confirmed these findings. These results revealed novel mechanisms of M. leprae infection.
