Detecting parasite eggs in stool by the Kato-Katz (KK) stool smear is the standard diagnostic test for infection with the flatworm parasite, Schistosoma mansoni. However, the test can miss those who have low burdens of infection, i.e., with few eggs in their feces. These misdiagnosed individuals, therefore, do not receive drug treatment and can continue to transmit the parasite into the environment putting the community at risk of infection. As an alternative diagnostic approach, the circulating cathodic antigen immuno-chromatographic test (CCA-ICT) is a simple-to-use handheld device (similar to a pregnancy test) that only needs urine to provide a quick and visual indication of whether one is infected or not. The consensus from studies in Africa is that the CCA-ICT could replace the KK test in those areas where people are more likely to harbor moderate to high worm burdens (i.e., more eggs in stool), but, like the KK test, it can miss those harboring light infection intensities. We evaluated the CCA-ICT performance in urine samples from 130 individuals living in areas non-endemic and endemic for schistosomiasis mansoni within the municipalities of Governador Valadares and Manhuaçu, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The CCA-ICT performance characteristics, chiefly, sensitivity and specificity, depended on whether a ‘trace’ visual reading of the test was considered as a positive or negative diagnosis. We noted a positive correlation between the CCA-ICT scores and egg counts. However, the CCA-ICT misdiagnosed as negative about 15% of KK positive individuals, predominantly those with light infections. The CCA-ICT, nonetheless, had better discriminating power than commonly used antibody-based tests. We conclude that the CCA-ICT offers reasonable performance to diagnosis S. mansoni infection. However, in areas where infections intensities are light, the test lacks the sensitivity to be used as standalone diagnostic tool.
