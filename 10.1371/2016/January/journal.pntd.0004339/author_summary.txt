Only a limited number of therapeutics for human African trypanosomiasis also known as African sleeping sickness is available today, and it narrows the choice of the drugs to escape from the side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei is the causative reagent of African trypanosomiasis, and is infective to various mammalian species. T. brucei and its mammalian hosts share almost the same metabolic machinery, and therefore it is important to understand the differences in biochemical properties of the metabolic enzymes between T. brucei and its hosts. Here we report that guanosine 5â€™-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) of T. brucei showed apparent differences in its primary structure and biochemical properties from those of its host counterparts, and was more sensitive to purine nucleotide analogs such as monophosphate forms of ribavirin and mizoribine than were the host GMPRs. Furthermore, ribavirin prevented the proliferation of trypanosomes in vitro. Our present findings may imply the availability of ribavirin and/or its derivatives in a treatment of African trypanosomiasis.
