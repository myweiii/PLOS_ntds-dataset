The role of intestinal parasitic infections in allergy is of great interest since it has been suggested that they suppress the development of allergy. Urbanization has also been claimed to cause allergy because of air pollution and higher exposure to allergens. The present study took advantage of the special opportunity presented by the recent Ethiopian immigration to Israel in order to study this question. A cohort of newly arrived Ethiopian immigrants to Israel, highly infected with parasites, was studied prospectively for the presence of allergy and response to allergens on arrival and after a year of follow up in Israel. The results showed clearly a significant inverse association between the presence of parasitic infections and allergy on arrival, while after a year of living in Israel, accompanied by a lowered parasitic infection load, a general increase of allergy was observed in all immigrant groups, and not only in those that had parasitic infections on arrival. These results lend support to the suppressive effect of intestinal parasites on allergy, but suggest that additional factors, most probably environmental, also play a role in the generation of allergy.
