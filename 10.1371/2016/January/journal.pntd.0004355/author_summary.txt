Previous studies on rodent malarias and mathematical models have postulated a link between multiclonal infections and disease severity. This association has been tested in Plasmodium falciparum mostly in Africa with limited information on P. vivax. Furthermore, there is a paucity of information from areas with low transmission. Here, we used samples available from a passive surveillance carried out in Colombia, South America. We found an association between multiclonal infections and disease severity in P. vivax but not in P. falciparum. Although the number of complicated malaria cases is low, the contrasting pattern between these two species emphasizes their epidemiological differences. We discuss how this pattern could be the result of a higher divergence among the P. vivax lineages co-infecting a patient. We hypothesize that low levels of acquired immunity may play a role in the association between multiclonal infections and disease severity.
