We would like to express our most sincere thanks to the children and parents participating in this study. We also extend our thanks to all the staff from the Complexe Pédiatrique de Bangui and the Institut Pasteur in Bangui and its director Dr Mirdad Kazanji who made this work possible despite the difficult conditions, particularly Ernest José Gbao and Natacha Zato. We would also like to acknowledge Kathleen Victoir from the Institut Pasteur of Paris for her support as administrative program manager.
