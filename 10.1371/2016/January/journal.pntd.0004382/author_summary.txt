Human ascariasis caused by the helminths Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum, is the most prevalent neglected tropical disease in the world, affecting more than 800 million people and mainly school-aged children. The parasite life cycle may be divided in two distinct phases after the initial infection: (i) migration of parasitic larval stages through several tissues (intestinal mucosa, blood circulation, liver and lung/airways), namely larval ascariasis; and (ii) establishment of adult worms in the lumen of the small intestine, causing the despoilment of nutrients and secretion/excretion of parasitic products, which down modulate the immune response of the host and characterizing the chronic infection. Over the past decades special focus has been dedicated to chronic Ascaris infection with the assessment of immunopathological aspects of the disease in chronically infected individuals from endemic areas. However, knowledge about larval ascariasis still remains scarcedue the limitations of diagnostic techniques and the need for an experimental model that would mimic natural infection. Indeed, many aspects of the immunobiology of the early Ascaris infection are still poorly understood. In this context, single and multiple infections in mice were performed in order to characterize the parasitological, histopathological, tissue functional and immunological aspects of larval ascariasis.
