Schistosomes are human parasites that cause severe hepatic disease in their host. They cause chronic inflammation when their eggs become trapped in small hepatic vessels. Most subjects from areas in which schistosomes are endemic display lifelong infection, and liver inflammation progresses to advanced hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension and hypersplenism in 10 to 20% of infected subjects. The mechanisms controlling inflammation and limiting severe hepatic disease in most infected subjects remain unclear. We evaluated the role in this control of FOXP3+ Tregs, which exert strong control over inflammation. We found that activated FOXP3+ Treg levels were high in the blood of subjects with severe disease, probably due to the production of large numbers of these cells by the hyperactive spleen. We also found that the proportion of CXCR3+ effector FOXP3+ Tregs was lower, resulting in potentially lower migration rates and an aggravation of liver disease.
