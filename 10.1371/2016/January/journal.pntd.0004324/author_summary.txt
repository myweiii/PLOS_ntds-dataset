Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major parasitic disease on the Indian Subcontinent, with 85% of the disease incidence in India. DDT is being used to control the sandfly vector of VL, but the quality of indoor residual spraying (IRS) is not routinely assessed due to a lack of practical assays. Here we have developed a simple DDT insecticide quantification kit (IQK) for measuring the amounts of DDT being applied to surfaces during large scale vector control operations. We demonstrate that the IQK provides equivalent data to the gold standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Being truly point-of-care, this test is able to immediately inform the management of spray quality. Integration of the IQK will allow non-laboratory staff such as spray team supervisors to establish robust quality assurance procedures for DDT dosing that are vital to support the South Asian VL elimination efforts.
