The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) has gained increased attention in public health because it is a globally spreading, highly invasive mosquito species that may transmit several viruses. Outside of its original range in Southeast Asia it has been increasingly implicated in local transmission of chikungunya and dengue fever in many places including La Réunion, continental Europe, the Americas and Japan. The Asian tiger mosquito lays eggs that are adapted to desiccation and colder climate. This, together with the mosquito’s ability to breed in almost any small, stagnant water body, makes its control extremely difficult, and there is much debate as to what interventions would be effective. This motivated us to compare the occurrence of the Asian tiger mosquito in southern Switzerland, where a mosquito surveillance and control programme is in place, with its neighbouring Italian districts where no such programme exists. The Swiss programme is based on public awareness campaigns to remove breeding sites and the use of insecticides against larvae. Using specialised traps that collect eggs from egg laying female mosquitoes, we found 2.26 times more A. albopictus eggs in the non-intervention area. The results support the hypothesis that targeting larval sources does have a significant impact.
