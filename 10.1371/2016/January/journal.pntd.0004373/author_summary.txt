Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of Indian Visceral Leishmaniasis, resides in the gut of the insect vector and the macrophages of their mammalian host and avail nutrients for survival. Nutrient deprivation such as glucose or amino acid alters redox balance in mammalian cells as well as some lower organisms. However, the role of L-arginine, in regulation of redox balance and L. donovani survival yet not properly elucidated. In the present study, we found that L-arginine deprivation from the culture medium hinders growth and proliferation of Leishmania promastigotes. Starvation of L-arginine downregulates the expression of polyamine biosynthetic and thiol metabolic pathway enzymes leading to decreased production of polyamines in Leishmania parasites. Moreover, deprivation of L-arginine alters redox balance in Leishmania promastigotes characterized by the concomitant increase in ROS and decreased antioxidant level. Furthermore, L-arginine deprivation triggered phosphatidyl serine externalization, alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, release of intraellular calcium and cytochrome-c followed by DNA damage. In summary, the growth and survival of Leishmania depends on the availability of extracellular L-arginine, in absence of which the parasite undergoes ROS mediated, caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death. Therefore, targeting L-arginine metabolism pathway could be an alternative approach for controlling Leishmania growth and hence disease outcome.
