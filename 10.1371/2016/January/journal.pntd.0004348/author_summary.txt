Tick borne rickettsial diseases may have similar clinical characteristics, yet epidemiologically and etiologically different diseases. To date, no studies have been conducted to detect potential tick vectors of rickettsiae in the West Bank. Therefore, we aimed to identify tick species and to determine the presence of Rickettsia pathogens in naturally infected ixodid ticks. The overall prevalence of SFG rickettsiae detected in ixodid ticks in nine Palestinian districts was 17%. Our results document for the first time the finding of two important human pathogens carried by ixodid ticks in the West Bank: R. massiliae and R. africae, the agent of African tick bite fever. Genetically, the detected Rickettsia spp. clustered into 3 different groups: R. massiliae, C. R. barbariae and C. R. goldwasserii. Most of Rickettsia-infected ticks were collected from dogs, camels and sheep, increasing the risk of transmitting rickettsial infections to animal owners, shepherds and farmers. These findings highlight the importance of hard ticks and their potential hazard for human health in the West Bank.
