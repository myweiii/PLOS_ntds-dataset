Hematophagous animals express a repertoire of anti-hemostatics which target enzymes involved in proteolytic reactions. These molecules are present in the salivary glands or midguts and target components of both coagulation and complement cascades, in addition to cells involved in hemostasis and immune system. These inhibitors are critical for development and survival of mosquitoes and ticks, and might also contribute to parasite transmission and completion of their life cycle. While much is known regarding sialomics and functional genomics of the salivary glands components, comparatively less information has been gained over the years with respect to midgut anti-hemostatics and their mechanisms of action. The vector of Babesiosis and Q fever, Rhipicephalus microplus, expresses Boophilin, a midgut thrombin inhibitor with low specificity, which contributes to tick development. Notably, we reported that Boophilin targets FXIa, kallikrein, and neutrophil enzymes elastase and cathepsin G, which play a direct or indirect role in the contact pathway of the coagulation cascade. Boophilin also abrogates platelet aggregation by cathepsin G and plasmin, and attenuates Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor cleavage by elastase. In vivo, Boophilin inhibits thrombosis and promotes bleeding in mice. It is concluded that Boophilin redundantly down-modulates host biochemical reactions involved in mounting and sustaining pro-inflammatory events which are detrimental to tick development.
