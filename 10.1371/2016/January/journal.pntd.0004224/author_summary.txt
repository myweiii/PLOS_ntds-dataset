Organised control of Buruli ulcer (BU), the third most common mycobacterial disease, began in Cameroon in 2002. We used 2001â€“2014 data and activity reports from the National BU Control Programme, to describe the onset, evolution, achievements and challenges of BU control in Cameroon, and make suggestions for improvement and expansion of programme activities. A cumulative number of 3700 BU cases have been detected and treated free-of-charge in five functional BU diagnostic and treatment centres. Sixty-four BU-endemic districts are now confirmed in Cameroon. Furthermore, Cameroon has actively participated in several BU research activities. However major challenges regarding demanding and costly surveillance, education, diagnostic and treatment activities remain to be addressed. Capitalizing on experiences and lessons learned in the past 14 years of activities, the National BU control programme should however be prepared to move forward.
