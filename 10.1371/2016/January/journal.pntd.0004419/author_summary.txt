Amebiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, is the second leading cause of death from protozoan diseases. Vaccination is considered as an effective strategy against amebiasis; however, clinical vaccines have yet to be developed. We previously reported that the intermediate subunit of Gal/GalNAc lectin (Igl) of E. histolytica is a key factor related to the adherence and cytotoxicity of this parasite to host cells. This study focused on the immune efficacy and immunological characterization of recombinant Igl and its fragments. Highly effective protection was observed in the hamsters immunized intramuscularly with the C-terminal fragment of Igl (C-Igl). C-Igl was further assessed to determine the immunological basis of protection. The immunized hamsters generated high levels of specific antibodies; these hamsters also showed an enhanced complementary-mediated lysis. The spleen cells from the immunized hamsters produced the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 after these cells were stimulated by C-Igl in vitro. These results demonstrate that recombinant Igl, particularly the C-terminal fragment, is a candidate vaccine for amebiasis. Nevertheless, further studies on Igl should be conducted to explore the preliminary steps of the development of vaccines for human amebiasis.
