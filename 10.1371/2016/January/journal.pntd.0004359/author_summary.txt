Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagasâ€™ disease, the most common parasitic disease in the Americas, but due to migration movements it has become relevant in non-endemic countries. T. cruzi, as other trypanosomatids responsible for human diseases (T. brucei and Leishmania spp.), lacks the enzymes for heme biosynthesis. However, it presents several heme-proteins involved in essential metabolic pathways, like biosynthesis of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids and mitochondrial cytochromes in its respiratory chain. In this work, we used different fluorescent compounds, which are structurally similar to heme (heme analogs), to explore the heme uptake in T. cruzi. The treatment of the different forms of T. cruzi with these compounds shows that this parasite is able to import heme during the replicative stages: epimastigote in the insect vector and intracellular amastigote in the mammalian host. We also characterized a T. cruzi protein, TcHTE, located in the flagellar pocket, where the transport of nutrients takes place in trypanosomatids. We propose TcHTE as a protein that improves the efficiency of the heme uptake. Considering the critical role of heme as an essential cofactor in T. cruzi, the identification of proteins involved in heme transport and distribution might result in the discovery of new molecular targets that may inhibit parasite proliferation.
