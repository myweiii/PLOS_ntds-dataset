Polarized T cell response (Th1/Th2 biased) to Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) is believed to be a critical element in the pathogenesis of leprosy and its varied clinical manifestations. However, immune response at the pathologic sites of leprosy is an extremely complex process, particularly in the light of recently evidenced heterogeneity of T cell subsets. FoxP3 positive regulatory T cells (Treg) are one of the most potent hierarchic cell types suppressing the effector T cell function with eventual regulation of immune response elicited by the host during intracellular infections. This study shows the recovery of the cell mediated response by CD4+ T cells by inhibiting the suppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-Î² and also by blocking of the Programmed Death-1 pathway in cells isolated from lepromatous leprosy patients. Reversal of IL-17 immune response was also achieved by modulating the cytokine milieu of in vitro cell culture and hence provides us cues to counter the M. leprae unresponsiveness in leprosy patients.
