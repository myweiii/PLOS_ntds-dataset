Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a systemic, and the most severe, form of leishmaniasis. VL has high morbidity and leads to death if not properly treated. The interactions between the parasite and the host immune response lead to different clinical manifestations (either asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic or symptomatic). A comprehensive understanding of the immunological factors associated with VL outcome is critical for the development of immunotherapeutic or immunoprophylatic approaches to control this disease. In this study, we observed the correlation of IL-6, IL-27 and sCD14 levels with the pathogenesis of VL.
