Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection transmitted from animals to humans, and many outbreaks are associated with flooding. Globally, leptospirosis is responsible for at least a million cases of severe illness each year, and many deaths. The bacteria are excreted in the urine of infected animals; humans can become infected through direct contact with animals or through contaminated water and soil. In Fiji, two successive cyclones and severe flooding in 2012 resulted in 576 cases and 40 deaths. We conducted this study to improve our understanding of the factors that increase the risk of leptospirosis transmission, so that public health control measures can be improved. Our study found that infection risk is related to many factors including individual demographics and behaviour, contact with animals, living conditions, poverty, and flooding risk. With global climate change, flooding is expected to become a bigger problem in the South Pacific. Population growth could lead to more intensive livestock farming; and urbanization in developing countries is often associated with slums with high risk of infectious diseases. Climate change, flooding, population growth, urbanization, poverty and livestock farming are important factors for leptospirosis transmission; these factors may combine to increase the risk of leptospirosis in Fiji and other Pacific Islands in the future.
