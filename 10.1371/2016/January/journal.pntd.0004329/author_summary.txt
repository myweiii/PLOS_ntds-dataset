Schistosomiasis is a parasitic worm disease that is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. To better understand how to gain and sustain the control of schistosomiasis and how to eliminate this disease in different epidemiologic settings, the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) has launched several multi-year studies that are being implemented in East and West Africa. This article highlights how the Schistosoma mansoni infection levels changed one year after an initial treatment with the anti-worm drug praziquantel given to children aged 5–15 years in western Côte d’Ivoire. Infection and treatment data at school level were available from more than 4,600 children in 50 schools. One year after the treatment that had been received by more than 80% of the children, the overall S. mansoni prevalence decreased from 19.7% to 12.8%, while the intensity of infection among S. mansoni-positive children slightly increased. In several schools, the S. mansoni intensity and, particularly the prevalence, increased unexpectedly. Our findings show that the dynamics of schistosomiasis transmission varies from one village to another. It will be interesting to monitor changes over longer time periods as this SCORE study unfolds.
