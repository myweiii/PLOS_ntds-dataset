In the south of France, the parasite Leishmania infantum is responsible for diseases that primarily affect dogs but can also impact humans. Several endemic areas have been clearly identified in the south of France including the Pyrénées-Orientales, Cévennes (CE), Provence (P), Alpes-Maritimes (AM) and Corsica (CO). In this study, 270 L. infantum isolates from four endemic areas, AM, P, CE and CO, were assessed using Multi-Locus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT), a tool applied for population genetic studies. MLMT revealed a strong genetic differentiation between the Leishmania populations from AM and P with exchanges observed between these two endemic areas. For four patients, the occurrence of disease relapses and re-infections was examined. These findings shed light on the transmission dynamics of parasites in humans. This study represents the most extensive population analysis of L. infantum isolates using MLMT conducted in France.
