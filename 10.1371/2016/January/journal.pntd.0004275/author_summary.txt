Leptospirosis is a rat-borne infectious disease that occurs worldwide, predominantly among vulnerable populations, such as urban slum communities with poor sanitation infrastructure. However, urban slums are complex local settings, where transmission of the disease varies over space and time, and the factors that influence this risk difference are unknown. An improved understanding of the environmental and social factors that modify the risk of this infection is needed in order to guide interventions to reduce the disease burden. We recruited a cohort of 2003 community residents of a high- risk urban slum in Salvador, Brazil. We followed them for a four-year period to understand yearly variation in individual and spatial risk factors for infection using spatiotemporal statistical modeling techniques. Our findings suggest that environmental factors related to topology such as household elevation and inadequate sewage drainage systems increase the risk of transmission in the slum microenvironment by promoting contact with mud contaminated with the pathogenic leptospiral bacteria, and that individual characteristics such as age and gender increase risk through behaviors that lead to increased exposures to a contaminated environment. Through this technique, we also identified local geographic areas where the risks are not well explained by these factors. This will help generate new hypotheses and identify intervention strategies for targeted prevention of leptospirosis in urban slum populations.
