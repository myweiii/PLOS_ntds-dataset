We express thanks to local officials and members of the public for their support of the fieldwork undertaken as part of this study. We would also like to thank John Hargrove, of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), for discussions with respect to entomological survey methods and trap biases.
