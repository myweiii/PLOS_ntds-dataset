Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem. Its control is based on detection and culling of positive dogs, treatment of human cases and vector control. Canine cases often precede the occurrence of human cases; hence, disease control in dogs is important. Use of accurate diagnostic tests is required to avoid culling false-positive dogs and to minimize the number of false-negative dogs that are maintained in endemic areas. In December 2011, the Brazilian Ministry of Health changed the diagnostic protocol for canine VL (CVL). In the present study, the accuracy of this current protocol was compared to the previous one using serum samples of 780 dogs from an endemic area of VL. The findings revealed that the current protocol performed better than the previous protocol primarily by reducing false-positive results. Considering different theoretical prevalence values, the current protocol misdiagnosed fewer dogs than the previous one.
