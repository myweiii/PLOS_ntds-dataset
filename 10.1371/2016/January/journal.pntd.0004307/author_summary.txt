Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes an estimated 3â€“5 million cases every year and more than 100,000 deaths. The highest disease burden is reported from Africa, however, the epidemic potential and transmission patterns among circulating strains is scarcely understood. The challenges of disease surveillance are constrained by the costs associated with laboratory confirmation and sample preservation. To improve the ability to identify the cholera disease burden, to subsequently understand the molecular epidemiology of circulating cholera strains, and to elucidate transmission patterns, we applied simplified collection methodologies to facilitate timely molecular characterization of V. cholerae isolates from Cameroon, Mozambique and the Philippines. Enriched specimens as well as cultured isolates were examined, demonstrating that enriched specimens provide sufficient material for genetic analysis. The results of the genetic analyses did not suggest significant genetic diversity within two distinct outbreaks in Cameroon. The study detected a possible relationship between isolates present in Cameroon and two isolates from Mozambique, two geographically distant nations in Africa. Whole genome sequencing can test whether this hypothesis is correct. Our findings set the stage for surveillance and molecular characterization in these areas to elucidate more fully the relationship and disease transmission patterns.
