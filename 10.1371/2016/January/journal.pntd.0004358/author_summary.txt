Mass drug administration (MDA) is an important tool in elimination efforts for several neglected tropical diseases, including lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH). The success of control and elimination programs depends upon achievement of target coverage levels during MDA. Community-based surveys can be used to verify coverage after an MDA, but recall accuracy in post-MDA coverage surveys has rarely been formally tested. To test recall accuracy, we compared survey responses among members of a population that received an integrated MDA for LF, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and STH in a series of coverage surveys to verified MDA treatment records. Coverage estimates based on survey responses were highly consistent between samples surveyed at 1, 6, and 12-months (range 88â€“91%) and concordance for any ingestion of MDA drugs was >86% in all surveys. Furthermore, respondents were able to identify which of the three MDA medications they took with up to 80% accuracy. These findings suggest that in some settings coverage surveys can provide consistent information up to a year following an integrated MDA and should be considered as a tool for primary assessment of coverage as well as for validating reported coverage.
