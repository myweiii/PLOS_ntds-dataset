Snake envenoming has long been a serious public health problem in underdeveloped and developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of bites can be as high as 400,000 and result in up to 32,000 deaths. As accidents involving snakes are most common among young men in rural areas, complications and amputations can mean the loss of livelihood. Specific antivenoms are the most effective treatment available, but the only African antivenom producer can only supply 25% of the continentâ€™s demand. In this study, we have developed antivenoms against the most important snakes commonly found in Mozambique: Bitis spp. (puff adders), Naja spp. (cobras) and Dendroaspis spp. (mambas). The experimental antivenoms were made by immunizing horses with the specific venoms, then collecting and processing their plasma to purify the antibodies. The experimental antivenoms were compared to the commercially available anti-Crotalic (rattlesnake) antivenom. The antivenoms produced had high titers, showed affinity for the specific venoms, were able to cross-recognized similar venoms and provide in vivo protection. The data in this study indicates that the antivenoms would be effective in treating B. arietans, B. nasicornis, N. melanoleuca and N. mossambica envenomations. We propose the development of monospecific antibodies as a strategy to increase antivenom quality, and as the basis for the production of two polyspecific antivenoms, anti-Bitis and anti-Elapidae.
