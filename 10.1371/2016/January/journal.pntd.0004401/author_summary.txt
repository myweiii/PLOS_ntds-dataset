We have developed and validated a yeast-based high-throughput screening assay for the identification of specific inhibitors of filarial targets. We engineered yeast strains to functionally express parasite and human enzymes, labeling these with fluorescent proteins and growing them in competition in the presence of test compounds. These strains express different target proteins from Brugia malayi (as well as their human orthologs) and our results demonstrate that it is possible to identify compounds that can discriminate between filarial and human enzymes. Accordingly, we are confident that we can extend our assay to novel targets from Brugia malayi and other worms of medical and veterinary importance, and perform high-throughput screens to identify new drugs against different parasitic worms.
