Trypanosoma brucei is an uni-cellular parasite transmitted to humans and cattle by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. Once swimming in the mammalian bloodstream, it causes the devastating African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. During its complex life cycle, it undergoes many cell shape changes, which are important for efficient parasite transmission. Here, we have studied a cell structure intrinsically involved in shape acquisition during division of the T. brucei life cycle form that multiplies in the fly midgut. Using electron tomography we show the 3D architecture of a motile cellular junction that slides with the tip of the growing new flagellum along the side of the old flagellum. This enables the new flagellum to zip in to the cell body structure alongside the old flagellum after which the cleavage furrow is established between these two flagella, producing two daughter cells of similar cell shape. We present here a detailed architectural overview of this junction; we show that it matures with time and pushes the old flagellumâ€™s axoneme sideways as it passes. This structural map enables insight into the function of this extraordinary mobile cellular junction.
