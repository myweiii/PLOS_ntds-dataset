Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and dogs and may eventually lead to mortalities related to cardiac failure. This parasite is most frequently transmitted by triatomine bug vectors, commonly called “kissing bugs.” Although Chagas disease is predominately acquired in Latin American countries, T. cruzi exists in wildlife and vectors in some parts of the United States of America (US), including regions of California. Within the US, occasional cases of locally acquired Chagas disease have been reported, and recent serological surveys indicate that T. cruzi exposure may be occurring more commonly than previously realized. However, relatively little molecular research has been performed on the T. cruzi strains present in the US, especially within California. In this study, we collected nearly 100 kissing bugs from regions of northern and southern California to determine the T. cruzi prevalence and genetic diversity for each region’s kissing bug population. We compared DNA sequences obtained in this study to those of several T. cruzi strains found in Latin America and the southeastern US. Based on our data, we conclude that Californian T. cruzi samples are closely related to strains found in Latin America known to be associated with human infections.
