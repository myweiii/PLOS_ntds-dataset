Buruli ulcer is a debilitating skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Although the understanding of this enigmatic pathogen has improved after decades of research, the mode of transmission is yet to be fully elucidated. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an underrepresentation of Buruli ulcer cases in children below the age of four as compared to older children. In order to investigate the different exposure of children to M. ulcerans and to several other pathogens with diverse modes of transmission, we conducted a sero-epidemiological study of 1,352 residents within a five kilometer radius along the Offin River of Ghana. While our results show early exposure of children to the mosquito transmitted malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as well as to soil transmitted helminths of the genus Strongyloides, a later onset of immune response was observed at an age of around four and five years for M. ulcerans and the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, that is transmitted by contact with infested water. Similarities in age-dependent exposure of these two pathogens suggest that transmission may take place outside of the very young childrenâ€™s movement range when they come into contact with the environment at the periphery of their villages.
