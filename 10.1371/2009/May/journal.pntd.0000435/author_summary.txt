Human African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) remains a serious threat to many of the poorest people in Africa. The trypanosomes causing the disease are transmitted by tsetse flies. There are no vaccines or prophylactic drugs to prevent people from contracting the disease. So the disease is dealt with after it has been contracted using often ineffective curative drugs with unpleasant and sometimes fatal side effects. Prospects for the development of effective vaccines or prophylactic drugs are poor. One certain means of preventing disease transmission is to remove tsetse flies, either at a local level (e.g., a group of villages) or regionally (covering large parts of a country or region). However, a major problem is the cost and logistical difficulty of implementing such fly control programmes. To overcome this, we are trying to develop cost-effective insecticide-treated targets by identifying chemicals that will increase the numbers of tsetse that will be lured to a target and killed. Here we show that two major vectors, G. f. fuscipes and G. f. quanzensis, are attracted to the odour of monitor lizards and pigs, respectively. This opens the way for further work to identify the attractants present in these natural odours which can be simply and cheaply incorporated into targets to reduce the cost of control.
