Chronic infections with helminths have been suggested to induce suppressor cells by a variety of mechanisms. The published immunological and epidemiological data on hookworm infection in humans and animal models suggest that these parasites are particularly successful in establishing chronicity and modulation. We have demonstrated that the recombinant form of a hookworm tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (Ac-TMP-1) induces bone marrow-derived DCs to downregulate MHC Class I and II and release anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-Β. More importantly, DCs pulsed with Ac-TMP-1 promote the development of regulatory CD4+ and, especially, CD8+ T cells from naïve T cells, which are able to suppress proliferation of naïve and activated splenic CD4+ T cells; this suppression is mediated by TGF-Β for CD4+ suppressor cells, but it is independent of the cytokine for CD8+ suppressor cells. These studies initiate the first steps to investigate the relevance and nature of suppressor T cells in hookworm infections and their mechanism of suppression.
