The molecular characterization of 181 serotype 1 Dengue fever (DENV-1) viruses collected regularly during the 2001–2006 period in French Polynesia (FP) from patients experiencing various clinical presentations revealed that the virus responsible for the severe 2001 outbreak was introduced from South-East Asia, and evolved under an endemic mode until a new epidemic five years later. The dynamics of DENV-1 epidemics in FP did not follow the model of repeated virus introductions described in other South Pacific islands. They were characterized by a long sustained viral circulation and the absence of new viral introduction over a six-year period. Viral genetic variability was not observed only during outbreaks. In contrast with conventional thinking, a significant part of DENV-1 evolution may occur during endemic periods, and may reflect adaptation to the mosquito vector. However, DENV-1 evolution was globally characterized by strong purifying selection pressures leading to genome conservation, like other DENV serotypes and other arboviruses subject to constraints imposed by the host-vector alternating replication of viruses. Severe cases—dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)—may be linked to both viral and host factors. For the first time, we report a significant correlation between intra-host viral genetic variability and clinical outcome. Severe cases were characterized by more homogeneous viral populations with lower intra-host genetic variability.
