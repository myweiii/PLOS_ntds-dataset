Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection of worldwide occurrence transmitted to humans by dogs. After infection cysts develop, mainly in the liver and lung. Ultrasound-based staging of cysts into active, transitional, and inactive has opened new venues for treatment and follow-up. Currently four treatment modalities are in use: (1) surgery, (2) percutaneous sterilization techniques, (3) chemotherapy with benzimidazoles, and (4) watch and wait for inactive cysts. However, evidence is insufficient for these four modalities, and determining individual treatment options for patients remains controversial. Medical treatment with benzimidazoles started in the 1970s. Important questions remain unanswered, however, such as efficacy stratified by cyst type and the duration of treatment. We therefore initiated EchinoMEDREV, a collaborative effort to collect individual patient data from patients treated with benzimidazoles and to analyze cyst outcome after initiation of benzimidazole therapy using a common analytical strategy across treatment centres. We found that the efficacy of benzimidazoles has been overstated in the past. Additionally, natural cyst decay has not been taken into account. Evidence from randomized controlled trials is urgently needed to determine the true efficacy of benzimidazoles. Our analysis will help to design benzimidazole trial arms on the basis of the currently available best evidence.
