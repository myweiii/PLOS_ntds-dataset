Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) has been responsible for hundreds of thousands of human and equine cases of severe disease in the Americas. In 2005â€“2007, cases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) were diagnosed for the first time in residents of Bolivia; the patients did not report traveling, suggesting endemic circulation of VEEV in Bolivia. In 2001 and 2003, VEE cases were also identified in Ecuador. We characterize recent VEEV from Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru and compared their relationships to strains from other parts of South America. We found that most VEEV from Peru grouped within a particular genetic lineage known to circulate in Panama and Peru whereas the VEEV circulating in Ecuador belong to a genetic lineage that circulates in Colombia and Venezuela. Importantly, the VEEV from Madre de Dios, Peru and Cochabamba, Bolivia belong to a new genetic lineage. This finding could aid in the understanding of the emergence and evolution of VEEV in South America and underscores the need for continuous monitoring for VEEV activity.
