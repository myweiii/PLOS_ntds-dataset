Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, infects over 10 million people in Latin America. Six major genetic lineages of the parasite have been identified with differential geographic distributions, ecological associations and epidemiological importance. With the advent of the T. cruzi genome sequence, it is possible to examine the micro-epidemiology of T. cruzi using high resolution genetic markers that assess diversity within these major types. Here we examine the genetic diversity of TcIIc, a poorly understood T. cruzi genetic lineage found predominantly among wild cycles of parasite transmission infecting terrestrial mammals and triatomine vectors, but also a potentially important emergent human disease agent. Amongst a number of findings, we show that TcIIc genetic diversity is comparable to other ancient T. cruzi lineages, highly spatially structured, and that a stringent co-evolutionary relationship with its principal reservoir host can be ruled out. Additionally, TcIIc is one of the two parents of hybrid lineages TcIId and TcIIe, which cause most of the Chagas disease that occurs in the Southern Cone of South America. The system we have developed will help to clarify the ecological circumstances around the emergence of these epidemiologically important hybrids, and perhaps help predict similar events in the future.
