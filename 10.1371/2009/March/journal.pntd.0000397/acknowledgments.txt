It is with deep regret that we record the sudden and tragic death of Richard Suswillo during the course of this study. Richard, a parasitologist much respected for his proficiency in field work, led the collection of the parasite material in East Africa. His commitment, good will, and boundless energy are sorely missed by the whole team.
