Pyrethroid is one of the most successful insecticidal chemicals for controlling insect pests and vectors of household and public health importance. However, extensive treatment of photo-stable and highly effective pyrethroids sometimes causes resistance to insect populations. Resistance to pyrethroids belonging to the knockdown agent groups that have been used as the spatial repellents, such as mosquito coils and related products, is the most serious concern. Since this is a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids and the first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. Our study concluded that Aedes aegypti, the most important vector of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever, demonstrated the prominent reduction in susceptibility against d-allethrin, one of the most popular pyrethroids for spatial repellents. The extensive treatment of photo-stable pyrethroids for malaria control seemed to be one of the attributable factors. In order to effectively manage pyrethroid resistance, the establishment of a feasible insecticide management system and a regular monitoring system of pyrethroid susceptibility will be essential.
