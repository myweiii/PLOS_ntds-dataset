Transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), causing febrile illness and joint pain, is widespread in Africa and Asia. Recent outbreaks in the Indian Ocean islands, its rapid expansion across continents, and its unusual clinical acute pattern have shed light on and brought awareness of this re-emerging virus. However, late rheumatic manifestations of this infection remain poorly examined. Thus, we have evaluated over a 15-month period the evolution and assessed potential risk factors of CHIKV-related rheumatic manifestations in a cohort of Reunion Island residents infected with CHIKV during the initial phase of the epidemic in 2005. Eligible adult patients were identified through a surveillance database. We found that rheumatic symptoms lasted for at least 15 months in 57% of the participants. Of these, 63% reported permanent trouble while 37% had recurrent symptoms. Factors such as age â‰¥45 years, severe initial joint pain, and presence of underlying osteoarthritis comorbidity were associated with nonrecovery over the 15-month period. Our findings suggest that long-term CHIKV rheumatic manifestations seem to be a hidden, frequent, post-epidemic condition. These findings should be considered in the development of preventive measures.
