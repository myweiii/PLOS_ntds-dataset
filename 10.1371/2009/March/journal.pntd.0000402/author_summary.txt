Almost one in every two people in the developing world is infected with one or more types of intestinal nematode worms. When fewer than 50% of people are infected, most carry only a few worms; but when more than 50% are infected, the number carrying moderate to heavy numbers increases markedly, as does the risk of disease. The WHO recommends annual mass deworming of children when 20% or more are infected and twice a year if 50% or more are infected. We estimated the cost of this to treat children with 10+ worms, an arbitrary moderate to heavy infection. We concluded that it is not cost-effective to mass treat children when fewer than 40% are infected because the majority are uninfected and few are likely be diseased. We propose annual treatment when 40% or more children are infected, twice a year at 60%, and three times a year at 80% or more. This would cost USD 224 million annually to treat all children aged 2â€“14 years in 107 developing countries compared with USD 276 million using current WHO guidelines. The new three-tier guidelines also treat a larger proportion of infected children and treat children with moderate to heavy worm burdens more often.
