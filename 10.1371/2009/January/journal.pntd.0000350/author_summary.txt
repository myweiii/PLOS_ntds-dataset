Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is caused by an infection with a parasitic worm and affects over 200 million people. The treatment and control of schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, praziquantel. This drug is increasingly used, and hence there is mounting concern about the development of resistance to praziquantel. Here we report that mefloquine, a marketed drug for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, shows promising antischistosomal properties in laboratory studies with mice. When mefloquine was orally administered at a single dose of 200 or 400 mg/kg to mice infected with young or adult stages of the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum, we found very high worm burden reductions. We also found high worm burden reductions when mefloquine enantiomers were given to mice infected with adult S. mansoni. Further studies are needed because our results might be of public health relevance. Indeed, mefloquine is widely used for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, often in areas where both malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist. In such areas, it might be possible that the use of mefloquine against malaria reduces the burden of schistosomiasis.
