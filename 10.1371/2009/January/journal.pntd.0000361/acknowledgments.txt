We would like to thank all the Blantyre district education managers, school committees, parents/guardians and all pupils who participated in this study. We are grateful to all HSAs, community nurses and Mr J. Bitilinyu for the data collection, and Mr Madeya, Mrs Nyakamela and Bongani Kaimila for data entry and checking. The mapping exercise for this study would have been impossible without the expertise and insight of Mr Costly Chanza, the Urban Planner and GIS specialist at Blantyre City Assembly, thank you for working on the maps for the manuscript as well. We are heavily indebted to the Blantyre District Health Management team; Dr Minyanga Nkhoma, Dr Amos Nyaka, Mr Aaron Mhango, Mrs Sabbina Mlusu, Mrs Paulina Mwasigala, Mrs Mhone, Mrs Nyokase Kaimila and the District Commissioner, Mr Charles Makanga, for their overwhelming logistical support during the implementation of this project.
