It is estimated that approximately 17 million people are currently infected with fish-borne flukes worldwide. The fish-borne liver flukes Opisthrochis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis cause hepatic and biliary disease in humans. The minute intestinal flukes are widely distributed in southeast Asia and are increasingly recognised as an emerging pathogen associated with diarrhoea and gastritis. The most significant finding of this study is the discovery and first report of a C. sinensisâ€“endemic community in Thailand. This finding was aided by the development and application of a new PCR-based technique capable of specifically detecting and characterising O. viverrini, C. sinensis and the minute intestinal flukes, directly from eggs in faeces. Since the eggs are morphologically similar, the fish-borne flukes cannot be differentiated on basis of microscopic examination of stool. This publication also questions the presumption that the distribution of fish-borne liver fluke species in Asia closely parallels the distribution of the snail intermediate hosts. The PCR provides a useful diagnostic tool for further large-scale epidemiological surveys to be carried out in Southeast Asia, which will shed further light on the distribution of these liver flukes in human and snail intermediate hosts with the advantage that targets for more arduous anthelmintic flushing confirmations can be carried out.
