Schistosomiasis, or Bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by flatworms, which affects about 200 million people worldwide. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug compound of choice in the control and treatment of this disease. Only half of the drug dose currently administered actually has activity against schistosomiasis, whereas the other half has no activity. Therefore, the WHO has assigned the low-cost preparation of the pure active component a key priority for future PZQ research and development. PZQ has two major administration drawbacks, the first being the high dose needed, the second its well documented bitter taste. Attempts of masking the unpleasant taste have not been successful. We hypothesized that the non-active component in PZQ would be the main contributor to the unpleasant taste of the drug. We determined the extent of bitterness for regular PZQ compared to the pure active component in a taste study in humans. We found that the pure active component alone is significantly less bitter than regular PZQ. This new finding should serve as an additional incentive for the PZQ research and development community to provide a low-cost, large-scale preparation route to the pure active component of PZQ.
