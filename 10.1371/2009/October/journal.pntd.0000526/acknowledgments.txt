We wish to thank the children and adults who participated in the study. We are also grateful to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar for their support during the “Kick out Kichocho” programme and the field staff of the Helminth Control Laboratory, Unguja. We would like to acknowledge Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) for lending the portable-ultrasound machine, courtesy of Nicolas Lwambo. This field study provided a convenient platform for further hands-on experience and additional on-the-job training of four ultrasonographers from Unguja (Mr. Khamis Adulrahman Simai and Mrs. Salma Suleiman Seif) and Pemba Islands (Mr. Mahmoud Badru Ali and Mr. Masoud Hassan Juma), who had previously attended the SCI ultrasound workshop in Mwanza earlier in 2005. Some of the work presented in this paper formed part of the MSc in ‘Modern Epidemiology’ final dissertation of JCSF at Imperial College London. M-GB thanks the Medical Research Council, UK, for a Career Establishment award.
