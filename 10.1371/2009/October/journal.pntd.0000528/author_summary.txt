Schistosomiasis is caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma with over 200 million people infected across 76 countries. The parasitic larvae (called cercariae) infect mammalian hosts via the skin, but the exact mechanisms by which dermal cells interact with molecules released by invading larvae are unclear. A better understanding of the infection process and stimulation of the early immune response would thus enable a targeted approach towards the development of drugs and vaccines. Here, we have used the fluorescent tracer CFDA-SE to label infectious cercariae and, together with confocal microscopy, have for the first time tracked in real time the parasite infecting via the epidermis and depositing excretory/secretory material in its wake. Phagocytic macrophages and dendritic cells in the skin internalised excretory/secretory molecules released by the larvae, and both cell types were subsequently located in the draining lymph nodes where priming of the acquired immune response occurs. In vitro studies determined that macrophages were slower to process released parasite material than dendritic cells; they also secreted lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines but greater quantities of regulatory IL-10. The relative abundance of macrophages versus dendritic cells in the skin infection site and their differential rates of antigen processing may be crucial in determining the success of adaptive immune priming in response to infection.
