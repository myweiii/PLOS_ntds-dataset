Visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar in Brazil, caused by a parasite protozoon, is transmitted to humans by sandflies and has wild and domestic dogs as reservoirs. The disease can become chronic, characterized by fever, weight loss, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. However, the infection in humans can be asymptomatic, and the importance of this phase is unknown. The low levels of immune response and the small number of circulating parasites in the blood are the main problems in identifying the asymptomatic phase. In this study we evaluated the performance of the serology tests compared with molecular tests to identify asymptomatic infection in individuals identified in an urban area of Brazil. Also included were non-infected individuals (healthy controls) and patients (diseased controls). Blood was collected and examined by different serological methods and compared with molecular techniques. The presence of the parasite was confirmed by all molecular techniques and should be the method used to identify true infection. The serology methods showed low sensitivity in detecting the infection. We concluded that the serologic methods are inaccurate in identifying asymptomatic infection when compared to molecular techniques and could underestimate the infection in population studies.
