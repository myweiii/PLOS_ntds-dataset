Cystic hydatid disease (CHD), caused by the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus, is hyperendemic in western China. However, until recently the disease had been grossly neglected there due primarily to a weak economy and the primitive control measures used. The situation is now changing because of China's growing economy and the availability of the cheap and effective drug praziquantel (PZQ), which makes control programs practicable through mass preventive treatment of dogs in these endemic areas. In this study, we used a strategy to prevent parasite eggs from being released into the environment by dosing dogs monthly with baited PZQ and culling unwanted and stray dogs, as a result of which infection in humans and domestic animals can be reduced considerably. We undertook a pilot control study in two counties involving a population of 255,504 in 52,300 households and 30,380 dogs in Xinjiang, China, and showed that monthly PZQ treatment of dogs is an efficient, practicable, and affordable control method for communities to reduce considerably hyperendemic CHD. As a result, the Chinese Ministry of Health has extended the control measure to 117 counties in western China.
