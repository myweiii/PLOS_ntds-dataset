Prevention of dengue disease relies predominantly on controlling the mosquito Aedes aegypti. A new control strategy is being developed based on the use of a life-shortening strain of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which has been microinjected into Ae. aegypti in the laboratory. This strategy aims to eliminate the older and epidemiologically significant individuals from Ae. aegypti populations and thus eliminate dengue transmission. However, designing an intervention strategy involving the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes requires detailed knowledge of the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti at potential release sites. We can then calculate how many mosquitoes need to be released for Wolbachia to spread through the wild population. We examined the abundance and distribution of the Ae. aegypti population over a 14 month period in a Vietnamese village identified by the Vietnam government as a potential pilot release site. We found considerable spatial variability because the houses that produced high numbers of mosquitoes were different in each survey. We estimated that the adult Ae. aegypti female population could be as high as 43 individuals per house. This suggests suppression of the wild Ae. aegypti population prior to a release will be necessary, and multiple releases will be required to counteract unpredictable spatial heterogeneity.
