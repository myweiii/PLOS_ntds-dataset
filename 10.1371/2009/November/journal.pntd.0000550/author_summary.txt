Species of the human blood fluke Schistosoma are estimated to infect approximately 200 million people worldwide, resulting in loss of health, vitality and productivity mainly among the world's poorest inhabitants. Since snail intermediate hosts represent an essential part of the flukes' life cycle, an understanding of the strategies used by the intramolluscan schistosome larvae to survive within this host may provide novel approaches for disrupting larval development and thus transmission to humans. Anti-oxidant enzymes produced by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni are believed to play a critical role in the maintenance of cellular redox balance, contributing to larval survival in their snail host, Biomphalaria glabrata. In this study, we have incorporated a RNA interference approach attempting to knock down specific anti-oxidant enzymes, including gluthatione-S-transferases 26 and 28 (GST26 and 28), gluthatione peroxidase (GPx), peroxiredoxins 1 and 2 (Prx1/2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and to evaluate their endogenous anti-oxidant function in the sporocyst stage of S. mansoni. Results clearly demonstrated a significantly higher susceptibility of antioxidant double-stranded (ds)RNA-treated larvae to in vitro H2O2 treatment or hemocytic encapsulation compared to GFP dsRNA controls. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that endogenous expression and regulation of larval antioxidant enzymes serve a direct role in protection against external oxidative stress, including immune-mediated cytotoxic reactions.
