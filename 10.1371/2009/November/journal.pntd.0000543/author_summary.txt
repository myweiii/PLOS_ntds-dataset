Despite the implementation of focused and well-funded chemotherapeutic control initiatives over the last decade, schistosomiasis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality within countries of the developing world. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the rapid translation of genomic information into viable vaccines or new drug classes capable of eradicating the parasitic schistosome worms responsible for this neglected tropical disease. In our effort to identify potential targets for novel chemotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic interventions, we detail a combined bioinformatics approach, comprising exploratory statistical and network analyses, to thoroughly describe the transcriptional progression of Schistosoma mansoni across three environmental niches. Our results indicate that, although schistosomes are masters at host deception and survival, there are numerous exploitable candidate molecules displaying either differential or constitutive expression throughout the parasite's lifecycle. Importantly, some of these transcripts represent gene families not commonly found outside—or expanded within—the phylum Platyhelminthes, and thus represent priority targets. Many of the candidates identified herein will be subjected to ongoing and future hypothesis-led functional investigations. The completion of such specific examinations ultimately will contribute to the successful development of novel control strategies useful in the alleviation of schistosome-induced immunopathologies, morbidities and mortalities.
