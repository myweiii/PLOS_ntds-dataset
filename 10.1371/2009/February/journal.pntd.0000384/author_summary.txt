Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and affects 16 million people in South and Central America. The disease starts with an acute phase where the parasite replicates rapidly and, if it remains untreated, is followed by a chronic phase, which can induce severe pathologies including cardiac insufficiency and megacolon, leading to death. Only two drugs with high toxicity exist to treat the acute phase of the disease and no drug is available for treatment of the chronic stage. We have screened a chemical library containing 2000 compounds to find molecules that inhibit the infection of host cells by T. cruzi in vitro. We found three different families of compounds that inhibit the parasite infection very efficiently, with low toxicity to host cells in vitro. We found that two of the compounds inhibit replication of the parasites, but the third one induces complete disintegration of the parasites inside host cells. This is especially interesting for the development of new drugs against the chronic stage of the disease, where parasites are intracellular and do not replicate actively.
