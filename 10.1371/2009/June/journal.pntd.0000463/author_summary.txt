Leptospirosis is a common bacterial infection in many tropical regions of the world that causes serious and often fatal disease in humans. The infection is transmitted by carrier animals, especially rats and other rodents, that release the leptospire bacteria from their kidneys into their urine. Humans are infected through exposure of broken skin or mucous membranes to contaminated water. Little is known about how or why the bacteria traffic from these sites specifically to the kidneys. The zebrafish embryo is a popular model organism for studying embryonic development, in part because of the ease with which living cells within the transparent embryos can be studied under the microscope. In this study, we use leptospire-infected zebrafish embryos to examine early leptospirosis by microscopy. In the first days of infection, the embryos appear normal. We find that leptospires are readily ingested (but not killed) by white blood cells called phagocytes. Later, infected cells are found specifically in a tissue near the dorsal aorta. This site may be a tissue that produces new blood cells and may represent a conduit for subsequent tissue targeting of the organisms. Our findings suggest that the zebrafish model may be useful for studying the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
