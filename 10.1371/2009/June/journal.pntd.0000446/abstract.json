    "Background": "Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication.",
    "Methodology/Principal Finding": "We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted \u03b11-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of \u03b11-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific \u03b11-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different \u03b11-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by S1P is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies."
