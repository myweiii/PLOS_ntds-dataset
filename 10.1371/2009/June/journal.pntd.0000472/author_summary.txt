Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has caused major epidemics in many parts of Latin America and has even spread into Texas on one occasion. These epidemics result from spillover to humans of a horse-mosquito-horse amplification cycle that has occurred periodically since the 1920s. However, between these equine-mediated epidemics, little attempt is typically made to detect VEE in humans. Here, we show that VEE virus strains that typically circulate in a mosquito-rodent cycle, termed enzootic strains, also produce many cases of severe and sometimes fatal disease in Panama in the absence of apparent epidemics. These endemic infections are probably rarely detected because they are difficult to distinguish clinically from dengue fever, another mosquito-borne viral illness common in the tropics. Our findings underscore endemic VEE as an important but usually neglected arboviral disease of Latin America.
