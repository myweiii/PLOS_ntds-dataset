Schistosomes are parasitic worms responsible for important human diseases in tropical and developing nations. There is urgent need to develop new drugs and vaccines to augment current treatments for this disease. In recent years, concerted efforts by many laboratories have led to extensive genetic sequencing of the parasites, and the publication of genome sequence for two agents of schistosomiasis appears imminent. This genetic information has revealed many molecules expressed by the schistosome parasites for which no functional information is available. This lack of information extends to ignorance of where in the complex multicellular schistosome parasites the genes are expressed. We integrated two molecular and cellular techniques to address these knowledge gaps. We used laser microdissection microscopy to dissect small but highly important tissues involved in nutrition and reproduction from sections of female Schistosoma japonicum. From these dissected tissues we then used a broad molecular biology method to identify the multiple genes active in these tissues. Our approach has allowed us to formulate the basis of a “gene atlas” for schistosome parasites, defining the expression repertoire of specific tissues. The better understanding of the roles of tissues in parasite biology, especially in development, reproduction and interactions with its human hosts, should promote future investigations into pathogenesis and control of these significant parasites.
