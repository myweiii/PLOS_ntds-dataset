Schistosoma mansoni is the major causative agent of schistosomiasis in the Americas. This parasite takes advantage of host signaling molecules such as cytokines and hormones to complete its development inside the host. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is one of the most important host cytokines involved in the inflammatory response. When cercariae, the infective stage, penetrates the human skin the release of TNF-α is started. In this work the authors describe the complete sequence of a possible TNF-α receptor in S. mansoni and detect that the receptor is most highly expressed in cercariae among all life cycle stages. Aiming to mimic the situation at the site of skin penetration, cercariae were mechanically transformed in vitro into schistosomula and exposed to human TNF-α. Exposure of early-developing schistosomula to the human hormone caused a large-scale change in the expression of parasite genes. Exposure of adult worms to human TNF-α caused gene expression changes as well, and the set of parasite altered genes in the adult parasite was different from that of schistosomula. This work increases the number of known signaling pathways of the parasite, and opens new perspectives into understanding the molecular components of TNF-α response as well as into possibly interfering with parasite–host interaction.
