Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne RNA viruses that cause a spectrum of illness from mild disease to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue viruses exist in two separate cycles in nature, circulating in either non-human primates or humans. The viruses that are endemic in humans today most likely evolved from non-human primate dengue viruses a few hundred years ago and have since established themselves as four distinct serotypes in human populations, causing periodic epidemics and severe disease. During the course of routine surveillance for dengue transmission in Malaysia during 2008, a sylvatic dengue virus type 2 was isolated from a young human male with DHF. The complete genome sequence of the virus was determined and found to be closely related to that isolated from a monkey in a similar region of Malaysia in 1970. This is the first sylvatic dengue virus isolated in Asia for more than 30 years.
