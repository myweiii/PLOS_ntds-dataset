Human lymphatic filariasis caused by the nematode parasites Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti are a major cause of concern in tropical countries. Studies over several decades have identified various proteins of these parasites that have highlighted their role in host–parasite interactions and possible chemotherapeutic and prophylactic interventions. The availability of the parasite genome facilitates the identification of all of the proteins of the parasite that could interact with the host. In this study, we have attempted to identify the excretory-secretory proteins of the various stages of the parasite that could be maintained in vitro for a limited period utilizing a high-throughput proteomics approach. We observe and report that the parasites expend resources to secrete out various molecules that they utilize to evade the host immune system and modulate its responses. Further, this study also provides information on the predicted hypothetical proteins to be bonafide proteins and thus a catalogue of the excretory-secretory proteins towards a better understanding of the host–parasite interactions.
