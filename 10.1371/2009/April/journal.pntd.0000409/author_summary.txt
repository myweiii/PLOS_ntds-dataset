Proliferating eukaryotic cells regulate their DNA synthesis, chromosome segregation, and cell division with great precision so that daughter cells are genetically identical. Our study demonstrates that in proliferating cells of the protist pathogen Entamoeba histolytica re-duplication of DNA followed by segregation on atypical and diverse microtubular structures is frequently observed. In this parasite, cell division is erratic, so that each daughter cell may contain one or more nuclei and sometimes no nuclei. This uncoupling of cell cycle events and survival of daughter cells with unequal DNA contents leads to genetic heterogeneity in E. histolytica. Our study highlights the inherent plasticity of the Entamoeba genome and the ability of this protist to survive in the absence of strict regulatory mechanisms that are a hallmark of the eukaryotic cell cycle.
