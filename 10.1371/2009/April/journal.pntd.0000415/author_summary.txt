Infection with Entamoeba histolytica can result in disabling diarrhea or even death, while the morphologically identical and genetically similar Entamoeba dispar harmlessly colonizes the human intestine. Understanding the molecular differences between these two organisms by comparing their protein repertoire may help us to understand why E. histolytica invades into colonic tissue, while E. dispar remains a benign passenger. Here, we identify four proteins that appear to be differentially expressed between the two species and show that a metabolic enzyme, which would appear to be an unlikely candidate for a role in disease, is expressed at much higher levels in the pathogenic organism.
