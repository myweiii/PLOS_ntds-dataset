Lymphatic filariasis afflicts over 120 million people worldwide. While the infection is mostly clinically asymptomatic, approximately 40 million people suffer from overt, morbid clinical pathology, characterized by swelling of the scrotal area and lower limbs (hydrocele and lymphedema). Host immunologic factors that determine susceptibility of this subset of individuals to clinically apparent disease is unknown. We addressed this issue by comparing the immunologic response of helper T (Th) cell subsets in lymphedema patients and clinically asymptomatic individuals. Four important subsets of Th cells (CD4+ T cells) are: Th1 cells, characterized by production of cytokines IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α; Th2 cells, characterized by production of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13; Th17 cells, characterized by production of cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22; and regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by the expression of transcription factor Foxp3, as well as other molecules such as GITR, TGFβ, and CTLA-4. We determined that Th1 and Th17 responses are significantly enhanced and Treg responses significantly impaired in lymphedema patients. This is accompanied by increased expression of pattern recognition receptors of the Toll and NOD family. Thus, approaches toward downregulating Th1 and Th17 responses and enhancing Treg responses would be beneficial in protecting against development of lymphatic disease.
