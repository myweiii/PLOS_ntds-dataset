RNA editing ligase 1 (TbREL1) is required for the survival of both the insect and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for the devastating tropical disease African sleeping sickness. The type of RNA editing that TbREL1 is involved in is unique to the trypanosomes, and no close human homolog is known to exist. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics of TbREL1, both with and without the ATP substrate present. The flexibility of the active site, dynamics of conserved residues and crystallized water molecules, and the interactions between TbREL1 and the ATP substrate are investigated and discussed. During the apo simulations, a significant structural rearrangement of the enzyme's active site opens an additional cavity adjacent to the ATP binding site that could be exploited in the development of effective inhibitors against this protozoan parasite. State-of-the-art electrostatics calculations reveal a novel putative RNA binding site, a discovery that has previously eluded scientists. Ultimately, we use the insights gained through the MD simulations to make several predictions, which we anticipate will help direct future experimental studies and structure-based drug discovery efforts against this vital enzyme.
