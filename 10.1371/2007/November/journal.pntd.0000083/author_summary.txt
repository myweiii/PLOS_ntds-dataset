Mycobacteria are organisms responsible for animal and human infections comprising tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections. Such infections require specific antibiotic treatment and prevention of secondary cases in the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. The accurate diagnosis of mycobacteria infection is therefore of prime importance. Isolation and culture of mycobacteria from diseased clinical specimens is the gold standard for diagnosis. It relied for decades on the use of specific isolation media, resulting in most laboratories not attempting such diagnosis. Alternatively, specific automates and culture broths are available only in developed countries. We herein demonstrate that blood agar, a basic medium widely and routinely used in laboratories worldwide, is suitable for the isolation and culture of mycobacteria encountered in human pathology, including tuberculosis. It performed at least as well as reference culture broth. Morever, using blood agar was cost-effective. Blood agar should be recommended as a routine medium for the isolation of most pathogenic organisms, including mycobacteria, both in developing and developed countries.
