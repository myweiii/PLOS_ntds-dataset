An estimated 30 million to 100 million people are infected with the parasitic worm Strongyloides stercoralis, the causative agent of strongyloidiasis, and yet this is a neglected tropical disease. The diagnosis of this parasite requires specialized techniques (e.g. Baermann and Koga agar plate method), but these are rarely employed in epidemiologic studies. We assessed the occurrence of S. stercoralis in a rural part of southern Yunnan province, China, and compared different diagnostic methods. At least two stool samples were obtained from 180 randomly selected individuals, and examined with four diagnostic approaches, including the Koga agar plate and the Baermann technique. Twenty-one individuals were infected with S. stercoralis (prevalence: 11.7%). Males were more often infected than females (18.3% versus 6.1%, p = 0.011). Infections were absent in children below the age of 15 years. The Baermann technique showed a higher sensitivity than the Koga agar plate method, and the examination of multiple stool samples improved the diagnostic performances of both methods. The use of a mathematical model suggested a ‘true’ S. stercoralis prevalence of 16.3%. There is a need to further study the epidemiology of strongyloidiasis in other parts of China, and control measures are required in settings with high prevalences as observed in this area.
