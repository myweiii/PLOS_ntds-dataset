In contrast to the perception that DNA content of an organism is stable and maintained during different conditions and life cycle stages, new evidence shows that many organisms display changes in their DNA content at different stages of their life cycle. We have earlier identified intra-cellular and inter-cellular differences in DNA content of the protist pathogen Entamoeba histolytica and established that this organism can tolerate large variations in DNA content during axenic culture. In this study we have made an important advancement in the understanding of amoeba biology where we have shown that changes in growth conditions and life cycle stages are accompanied by large differences in DNA content involving gain or loss of whole genome copies. This property may well regulate the outcome of infection and subsequently the disease.
