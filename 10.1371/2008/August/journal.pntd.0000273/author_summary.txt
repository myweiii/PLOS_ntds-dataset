Toxocara canis (Nematoda: Ascaridida) is the common roundworm of canids. This parasite is transmissible to humans as well as a range of other accidental or paratenic vertebrate hosts, in which (after the oral ingestion of infective eggs) the larvae of Toxocara canis invade the tissues and can cause different forms of clinical disease (toxocariasis). Although some aspects of the biology of T. canis are well understood, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of areas including the molecular genetics, systematics, ecology and epidemiology of this and related parasitic nematodes. The present study elucidates the sequence, structure and organization of the mitochondrial genome of T. canis and provides mitochondrial gene markers for studies in these areas using molecular tools. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of species of Toxocara would improve the prevention and control of toxocariasis in humans and other animals.
