Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical areas, threatening over 2.5 billion people. It causes a wide range of symptoms and has severe forms. In reference laboratories, dengue disease is confirmed by virus isolation or genome detection during the acute phase, and by serological methods during the early convalescent phase. The viral NS1 protein circulates in the sera of infected patients throughout the clinical phase of the disease. Novel diagnostic tests based on NS1 detection have been recently developed and marketed. We compared the performance of two tests for detecting dengue NS1 protein during the clinical phase of dengue infection (an immunochromatographic test (ICT) from Bio-Rad allowing rapid detection of the NS1 antigen and a two-step sandwich-format ELISA from Panbio) with the one-step sandwich-format microplate ELISA (Bio-Rad). The ICT test performed better than the ELISA test from Panbio. This study confirms that diagnostic tests based on NS1 could be used in routine clinical practice in poorly equipped laboratories and that dengue diagnosis could therefore be confirmed without the need for testing in reference laboratories. This represents a crucial step towards the control of dengue disease in the human population.
