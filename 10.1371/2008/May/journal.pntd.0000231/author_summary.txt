Mycobacterium leprae (ML) causes a disabling and stigmatizing disease that is characterized by distinct immune responses. ML produces a spectrum of illness in humans, and several lines of evidence indicate that host genetic factors influence susceptibility and clinical manifestations. Leprosy can occur as the lepromatous or tuberculoid forms, which are associated with different clinical manifestations, histopathology, T cell cytokine profiles, and bacterial burden in affected sites. Leprosy is also associated with unique immunologic reactions, such as reversal reaction, which is characterized by the rapid development of a Th1 T cell cytokine response that can cause substantial morbidity. We and others recently discovered a common human polymorphism in TLR1 (T1805G, I602S) that regulates cytokine production in response to lipopeptide stimulation, influences the cellular innate immune response to Mycobacteria, is associated with altered localization, and is present in 50% of individuals worldwide. Here, we show that in humans the 1805G variant does not mediate an inflammatory response to ML in vitro and that this polymorphism is associated with protection from reversal reaction. These data suggest that a common variant of TLR1 is associated with altered adaptive immune responses to ML as well as clinical outcome.
