Contrary to the traditional view that immunity in invertebrates is limited to non-specific mechanisms, recent studies have shown that they have diverse, specific immune receptors. An example is provided by the FREPs of the mollusk Biomphalaria glabrata, polymorphic members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This capacity for an individual or population-based polymorphic immune response raises the question of whether a corresponding polymorphism exists in parasites of invertebrates, as would be expected in an “arms race” between host and parasite. We have indeed identified such polymorphic molecules in Schistosoma mansoni, a flatworm parasite of B. glabrata, by comparing two strains of schistosome that are respectively compatible and incompatible with the same mollusk host strain. However, in contrast to antigenic variation in protozoan parasites that is based on an extensive gene repertoire, we show here that a high level of polymorphism in these S. mansoni polymorphic mucins (SmPoMucs) is generated from a low number of genes by a complex cascade of mechanisms, a “controlled chaos”.
