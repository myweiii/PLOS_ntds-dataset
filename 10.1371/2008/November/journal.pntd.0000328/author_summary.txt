Mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited sensitivity and specificity. We describe the use of real-time PCR to provide a rapid, objective and consistent enumeration procedure for M. leprae. The procedure is specific for M. leprae, has a dynamic range of approximately 6 logs and yields results in only a few hours, including processing time. The procedure was applied to M. leprae growing in mouse and armadillo tissues showing excellent correlation with microscopic counting. The benefits of this technique for experimental characterization of leprosy infections and vaccine trials are substantial, and potential applications to clinical specimens could impact patient management by simplifying the assessment of bacterial burden prior to and during drug treatment.
