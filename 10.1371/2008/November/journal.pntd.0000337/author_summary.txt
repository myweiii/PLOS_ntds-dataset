Schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with regard to the number of people infected and those at risk. Schistosoma japonicum is the species that causes human and animal disease in China, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent, Indonesia. Recent evidence of schistosomiasis re-emergence in China has reinforced the need for active disease surveillance in these areas. Schistosomiasis infection occurs through contact with water contaminated with S. japonicum cercariae, the free-living stage of the parasite shed from intermediate host snails. Current practice of detecting cercariae in the environment uses sentinel mice, a method with serious limitations in which mice are exposed to environmental water and then maintained for 6 weeks before being dissected to count worms. The method is labor intensive and costly in terms of time and resources, making it logistically prohibitive to monitor water contact sites regularly or comprehensively. Here we develop a quantitative PCR assay to measure S. japonicum cercariae concentration in water, providing a potential method for rapid and reliable data collection in the field, potentially replacing the use of live animal models.
