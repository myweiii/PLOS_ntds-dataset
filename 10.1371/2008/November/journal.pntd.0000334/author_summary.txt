Adult schistosomes live within portal veins of their human hosts. Their offspring, laid as eggs within the venous system, escape by traversing the tissues between the blood vessel and the gut or bladder lumen. Eggs voided into the external environment hatch spontaneously on contact with freshwater, and the hatched larva escapes in search of a snail, which acts as intermediate host of the parasite. In this study, we used correlative microscopy techniques to examine hatching of the larvae of Schistosoma japonicum. This species has an exquisite hatching behaviour, which allows us to trace the cellular changes in the egg that lead to hatching. By using a correlative microscopy approach, incorporating video microscopy, electron microscopy of eggs prepared by high pressure freezing and lectin immunocytochemistry, we were able to describe the pre-hatching state of the eggs, and trace changes that occur during hatching. The insights gained from these direct biological studies will be of value in understanding the hostâ€“parasite interplay of schistosome eggs in their hosts.
