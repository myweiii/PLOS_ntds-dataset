Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-transmitted diseases in Latin America. Many patients with Chagas go undiagnosed for years, and because symptoms of the chronic condition are similar to those of other cardiac conditions, the burden of the disease is not evident. This leads to underestimation of the burden that Chagas disease places on healthcare resources, which in many cases translates into inadequate prioritisation for prevention. This study assessed the cost of Chagas disease in Colombia in comparison to the cost of prevention. Measuring the cost of treatment for Chagas disease is challenging. In this study we used a method that combines retrospective review of costs for prevention activities and for treatment of chronic Chagas disease patients, and we estimated utilisation of services using experts' consensus. We found that the cost of treating Chagas disease is substantial, even though many people are not receiving appropriate care. On the other hand, we show that preventing Chagas disease transmission through insecticide spraying activities is affordable in Colombia and therefore should be conducted more systematically. This study provides the basic inputs to conduct a full economic evaluation of Chagas disease prevention.
