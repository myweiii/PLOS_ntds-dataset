African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is caused by the single-cell parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei). Two parasite-derived enzyme proteins have been hypothesized to play an important role in the viability of the parasite or its ability to produce disease in the human host. Utilizing RNA interference that blocks the production of these proteins in the parasite, we show that elimination of parasite cathepsin B cures infection in mice. RNAi of the second enzyme protein, brucipain, results in the prolongation of life of half the infected mice, but does not cure. Further experiments carried out in a culture system show that brucipain facilitates the migration of parasites across a model of the bloodâ€“brain barrier. This suggests that while brucipain is not necessary for the viability of the organisms, it may play a role in infection by allowing parasites to reach the central nervous system and produce the severe second stage of sleeping sickness.
