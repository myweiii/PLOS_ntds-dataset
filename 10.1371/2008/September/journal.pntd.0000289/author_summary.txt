Actinomycetoma is an infectious disease of tropical and subtropical regions produced by actinobacteria of the genera Nocardia, Streptomyces, and Actinomadura. Therapeutic alternatives are scarce and include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, diaminodiphenylsulfone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and amikacin. Oxazolidinones are a new class of antimicrobials with a completely different cellular target; the first compound in the market, linezolid, was introduced in the year 2000. It is active against many species of Nocardia and other aerobic actinomycetes; however, the long-term application in human subjects produces side effects including peripheral neuropathy and mielossupression. Therefore, it is important to screen other oxazolidinones with higher activity and less toxicity. In the present work, we tested DA-7867, a new oxazolidinone, in an experimental mouse model. The drug is active in vivo and decreases the production of lesions using only one dose a day in contrast to linezolid, which needs to be injected three times a day. Although it was tested on N. brasiliensis, it can possibly be active (once it is accepted for its use in humans) against Actinomadura spp and Streptomyces spp, which are frequently found in places of Africa and India where actinomycetoma is also an important consult in dermatology.
