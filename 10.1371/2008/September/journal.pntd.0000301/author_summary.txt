Excretory-secretory (ES) proteins are an important class of proteins in many organisms, spanning from bacteria to human beings, and are potential drug targets for several diseases. In this study, we first developed a software platform, EST2Secretome, comprised of carefully selected computational tools to identify and analyse ES proteins from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). By employing EST2Secretome, we analysed 4,710 ES proteins derived from 0.5 million ESTs for 39 economically important and disease-causing parasites from the phylum Nematoda. Several known and novel ES proteins that were either parasite- or nematode-specific were discovered, focussing on those that are either absent from or very divergent from similar molecules in their animal or plant hosts. In addition, we found many nematode-specific protein families of domains “transthyretin-like” and “chromadorea ALT,” considered vaccine candidates for filariasis in humans. We report numerous C. elegans homologues with loss-of-function RNAi phenotypes essential for parasite survival and therefore potential targets for parasite intervention. Overall, by developing freely available software to analyse large-scale EST data, we enabled researchers working on parasites for neglected tropical diseases to select specific genes and/or proteins to carry out directed functional assays for demystifying the molecular complexities of host–parasite interactions in a cell.
