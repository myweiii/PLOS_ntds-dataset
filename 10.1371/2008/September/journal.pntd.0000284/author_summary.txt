Taenia solium cysticercosis is a parasitic disease that severely affects human health in underdeveloped countries and has re-emerged in North America. The adult parasite lives in the intestines of humans, where it thrives and sheds packages (proglottids) loaded with thousands of eggs that are, in turn, expelled upon defecation. Cysticercosis occurs after tapeworm eggs are ingested by an intermediate host (pig or human) and then hatch, migrate, and lodge in the host's tissues, where they develop onto larval cysticerci. Deficient hygiene, inadequate feces disposal, outdoor defecation, freely roaming pigs, and inadequate meat inspection promote transmission. Success in lowering transmission is limited by the complex network of biological and social factors that maintain the endemia. Effective control will require social development and powerful, sustained interventions targeted at the transmission cycle's crucial nodes. Rural pigs are obligate intermediate hosts and thus prime targets for control through vaccination and treatment. It has been proposed that pigs be used as sentinels to monitor environmental T. solium contamination. We conducted a spatial study of cysticercotic pigs among 13 neighboring villages in rural Central Mexico, constituting the first step of an attempt to discover a cost-effective and accurately targeted control intervention. Cysticercotic pigs were not found clustered in specific households, suggesting that the risk of infection is widely dispersed in the area and indicating that extensive and inclusive control measures are needed.
