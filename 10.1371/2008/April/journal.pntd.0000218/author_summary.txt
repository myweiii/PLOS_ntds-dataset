Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a disease caused by the larval form of a tapeworm parasite that preferentially migrates to the brain. It is characterized by a long asymptomatic period thought to result from the parasite's ability to evade host immunity. To date, the mechanisms of hostâ€“parasite interaction before symptoms develop remain unknown. In this study we evaluate by multiple immunofluorescent techniques distinct stages of the infection, making use of a murine model that closely resembles the disease process observed in humans. We discovered that the array of molecules secreted by the parasite varies according to the phase of infection studied. Early in infection, the parasite permanently sheds distinct molecules, allowing a rapid establishment in the brain. As the infection ensues, the continuous release of different molecules appears to facilitate the persistence of the parasite by downregulating molecules involved in its recognition and destruction. Loss of such molecules when the parasite dies after drug treatment may explain sudden inflammatory responses in patients. Characterization of these molecules will lead to advances in our understanding of the complex immunoregulatory mechanisms used by parasites and to new approaches for therapeutic strategies.
