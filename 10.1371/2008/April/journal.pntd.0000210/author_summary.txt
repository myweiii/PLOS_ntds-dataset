Chagas disease is spread by blood-feeding insects (triatomine bugs) that colonise poor-quality houses. Disease control relies primarily on killing domestic bugs by spraying dwellings with residual insecticide. In Venezuela, sustained control has proved difficult despite four decades of campaigns. Considered the main vector in Venezuela, the bug Rhodnius prolixus may also infest palm trees and might repeatedly recolonise houses from palms. A complication is that a morphologically similar species, R. robustus, also infests palms but is of minor medical importance. Therefore, confusion exists as to the true identity of palm bugs and their importance in disease transmission.
We applied two molecular methods (sequencing DNA of the cytochrome b gene, and analysing microsatellites) to triatomines collected in Venezuela so that we could identify unequivocally the species of palm-dwelling Rhodnius and establish their role in maintaining house infestations. We demonstrated that R. prolixus is indeed present in palms, and that such silvatic populations can colonise houses and are a threat to the successful control of Chagas disease in Venezuela. This finding resolves a longstanding controversy of fundamental epidemiological importance. It is also an example of the application of molecular epidemiology to correct vector identification and successful disease control.
