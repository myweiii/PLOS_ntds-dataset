The parasite Entamoeba histolytica can cause serious disease by invading the lining of the large intestine and spreading to other organs of the body. However, most infected individuals never develop symptoms, and it is not clear what determines the different outcomes of infection. Factors that might be having an effect range from the immune response of the infected individual, to concurrent infections with other organisms or genetic differences among the parasites. In the present study we investigated the role of the latter by comparing parasites in the intestine with those that have invaded the liver of the same patient. In all 18 pairs of samples we could detect genetic differences among the parasites. Interpreting the findings is difficult, as we cannot distinguish at present between mutations that have occurred during tissue invasion and genetic diversity that was already present in the population of parasites in the intestine. However, our results strongly support a role for the parasite in determining the outcome of infection with E. histolytica.
