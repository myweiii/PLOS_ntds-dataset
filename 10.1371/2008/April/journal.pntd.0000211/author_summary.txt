During the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the use of mass drug administration to reduce the disease caused by parasitic worms. With so many people regularly receiving treatment, there is a risk that drug resistance may develop. As a result, the number of studies looking for genetic markers of drug resistance has increased noticeably. In this paper we analyse the results of one such study that investigated the presence of genes associated with drug resistance in parasites responsible for elephantiasis. This study, like many other studies of human parasitic infections, relies on analysing parasite immature stages (such as eggs) because the adult worms are often inaccessible within the human body. Using computer models we show how the gene frequency in the immature stages may vary from that in the adult worm population. Parasites with these markers for drug resistance might also be unevenly distributed across the host population even prior to treatment. This may increase the spread of drug resistance and make it harder to detect. We suggest that studies conducted only on parasite immature stages should be interpreted with caution and should carefully consider the number of people and the number of parasites they analyse.
