We are grateful to the people who are agreed to be study subjects in this study, attending every month, despite the inconvenience of extensive testing and repeated blood sampling. The staff at the TLM hospitals in Naini and Faizabad and in the BPRC and Stanley Browne laboratories in Hyderabad and Miraj have been invaluable. We also gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Follereau Luxembourg, LEPRA UK and TLMI, without which this study would have been impossible. We wish to thank the staff of the LEPRA offices in Hyderabad and Colchester and the TLM offices in Delhi and London for their administrative support. We are especially indebted to Dr. Shubhada S. Pandya, who has spent many hours training and supervising the staff who performed the nerve conduction tests. Besides the authors mentioned already, the INFIR Study Group also included Prof. W. Cairns S. Smith, Dr. P.S.S. Sundar Rao, Dr. Rupendra Jadhav, Dr. Sujai Suneetha, and Dr. Lavanya Suneetha.
