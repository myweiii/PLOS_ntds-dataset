Data presented derive from LF elimination programs operating in all endemic regions of the world. Many thousands of dedicated individuals working within communities and at state and national levels have contributed to the generation of this information. Whilst it is impossible, practically, to thank each and every one, the authors take this opportunity to extend their gratitude to all of these individuals, without whom there would be no effective Global Programme. The authors wish also to thank the following individuals who have personally and directly contributed to this manuscript by provision of both insight and information: Dirk Engels, Dominique Kyelem, Deborah McFarland, David Molyneux, Alexei Mikhailov, Lani Stephenson, and Andy Wright.
