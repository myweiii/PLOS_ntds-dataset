Infection with parasitic schistosome worms causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease currently affecting millions of individuals living in the developing world. A virtually unique characteristic of the schistosome life style in comparison to other members of the Phylum Platyhelminthes is that schistosomes are dioecious, having both male and female individuals. While much is known about the adult dioecious state, virtually nothing has been established with regard to the dioecious larval stages such as the snail-infective miracidium and the human-infective cercaria. To shed some light on this under-studied area of schistosome biology, we first developed a new long-oligonucleotide DNA microarray and used this tool to perfect an indirect hybridization strategy utilizing schistosome genomic DNA for large-scale transcription investigations. Second, we used this tool and strategy to characterize the gene expression profiles of infective male and female cercarial life-stages. This led to the identification of several thousand differentially expressed transcripts and demonstrated that gender-associated patterns of transcription (some associated with adult-specific activities) are surprisingly already established in this short-lived larval life-stage. Further functional interrogation of these transcripts will generate a more complete picture of factors and processes underlying the schistosome's dioecious state, which may help in control strategies attempting to prevent sexual maturation, inhibit maleâ€“female interactions and limit the production of tissue-damaging eggs.
