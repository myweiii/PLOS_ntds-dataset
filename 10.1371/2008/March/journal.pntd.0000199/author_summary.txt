Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease characterized by deep, ulcerating skin lesions, particularly on arms and legs, that are provoked by a toxin. BU is caused by a microbe belonging to the same family that also causes tuberculosis and leprosy. The disease is emerging as a serious health problem, especially in West Africa. Vaccines are considered to be the most cost-effective strategy to control and eventually eradicate an infectious disease. For the moment, however, there is no good vaccine against BU, and it is still not fully understood which immune defence mechanisms are needed to control the infection. The identification of microbial components that are involved in the immune control is an essential step in the development of an effective vaccine. In this paper, we describe the identification of one of these microbial components, i.e., antigen 85A, a protein involved in the integrity of the cell wall of the microbe. Our findings obtained in a mouse model now need to be extended to other experimental animals and later to humans. Combination with a vaccine targeting the toxin may be a way to strengthen the effectiveness of the vaccine.
