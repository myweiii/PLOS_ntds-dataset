Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a flatworm that disproportionately affects the world's poorest populations. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting over 207 million people in 76 countries. Current international estimates indicate that schistosomiasis has a minimal impact at the population level. This has contributed to its low prioritization in global health and subsequent resource allocation for disease control. However, recent studies indicate that these measures underestimate the extent of neglected tropical diseases, including schistosomiasis. Despite World Health Organization recommendations, the burden of schistosomiasis has not been re-examined in over a decade, and there are no established estimates for different types of schistosomiasis. The impact of symptoms associated with the Asian strain, Schistosoma japonicum, remains controversial. This study was conducted to provide an alternate measure of the burden of S. japonicum. We reviewed the literature and calculated a summary estimate for S. japonicum which was seven to 46 times greater than current measures for schistosomiasis. Findings suggest that current measures severely underestimate the extent of schistosomiasis, and urgently need to be revised. Further research is needed to examine the burden of schistosomiasis and other forgotten tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people in endemic countries.
