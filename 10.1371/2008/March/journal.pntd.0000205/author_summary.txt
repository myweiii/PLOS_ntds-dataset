Buruli ulcer is an ulcerative skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Though usually not fatal, ulceration can cover up to 15% of the body, with treatment being costly and sometimes painful. Primary risk for Buruli ulcer in Africa is exposure to stagnant water, but the route of transmission is unknown. Detection of M. ulcerans in aquatic insects in endemic sites suggests the presence of aquatic reservoirs. This article reports results from the first investigation into the ecology of M. ulcerans based on random sampling of both endemic and non-endemic aquatic sites. Development of a method for discriminating M. ulcerans from closely related mycobacterial pathogens made it possible to determine the distribution of M. ulcerans in aquatic environments. This article demonstrates the presence of M. ulcerans DNA in both endemic and non-endemic sites within aquatic insects, water filtrate, and glass-slide biofilm communities. This article provides data suggesting that M. ulcerans is more broadly distributed than the human disease it causes. This study provides an initial step for future work on whether certain M. ulcerans strains are particularly successful human pathogens and suggests that research on specific human water contact factors may provide insight into the transmission of M. ulcerans.
