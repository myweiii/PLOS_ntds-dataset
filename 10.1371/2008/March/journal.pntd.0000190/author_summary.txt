Toxoplasmosis is a neglected tropical disease, an emerging disease as well as a significant problem in developed countries causing a substantial health burden. Better medicines with less toxicity are greatly needed. Herein, we found that a novel triazine currently being advanced to clinical trials for malaria, JPC-2067-B, is highly effective against T. gondii. We demonstrate that JPC-2067-B inhibits T. gondii growth in culture (IC50 20 nM), inhibits the purified enzyme (IC50 6.5 nM), is more efficacious than pyrimethamine, and is cidal in vitro. JPC-2067-B administered parenterally and the orally administered pro-drug (JPC-2056) are also effective against T. gondii tachyzoites in vivo. A molecular model of T. gondii DHFR-TS complexed with JPC-2067-B was developed. We found that the three main parasite clonal types and isolates from South and Central America, the United States, Canada, China, and Sri Lanka have the same amino acid sequences preserving key binding sites for the triazine. Toxicology data are presented. JPC-2056/JPC-2067-B have potential to be more effective and less toxic treatments for toxoplasmosis than currently available medicines.
