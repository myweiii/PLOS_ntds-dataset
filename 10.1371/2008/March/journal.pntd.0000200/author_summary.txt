Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. In the lower Mekong river, schistosomiasis in humans is called Mekong schistosomiasis and is caused by Schistosoma mekongi. In the past, Mekong schistosomiasis was known only from the lower Mekong river. Here DNA-sequence variation is used to study the relationships and history of populations of S. mekongi. Populations from other rivers are compared and shown to be S. mekongi, thus confirming that this species is not restricted to only a small section of one river. The dates of divergence among populations are also estimated. Prior to this study it was assumed that S. mekongi originated in Yunnan, China, migrated southwards across Laos and into Cambodia, later becoming extinct in Laos (due to conditions unsuitable for transmission). In contrast, the dates estimated here indicate that S. mekongi entered Cambodia from Vietnam, 2.5â€“1 Ma. The pattern of genetic variation fits better with a more recent, and ongoing, northwards migration from Cambodia into Laos. The implications are that Mekong schistosomiasis is more widespread than once thought and that the human population at risk is up to 10 times greater than originally estimated. There is also an increased possibility of the spread of Mekong schistosomiasis across Laos.
