Although an estimated 30–100 million individuals are infected with the parasitic roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause strongyloidiasis, it is a so-called neglected tropical disease. There are only very few drugs available for treating strongyloidiasis. We evaluated the strongyloicidal properties of the anthelmintic compound tribendimidine in vitro and in an animal model. Larvae from S. ratti incubated in PBS buffer containing 10–100 µg/ml tribendimidine died within 24 hours. Tribendimidine showed a significant activity against adult S. ratti harbored in rats: oral administration of tribendimidine at single doses of 50 mg/kg and above resulted in a complete elimination of larvae and adult worms. A single 50 mg/kg oral dose of tribendimidine was less effective against the migrating tissue stages, in particular the 1- and 2-day-old S. ratti. In view of our findings, the effect of tribendimidine against S. stercoralis infections in humans should be assessed.
