Understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which parasites invade their host is key to rational vaccine and drug development. The proteins released by larvae of a parasitic blood fluke as they invade human skin were identified using high-resolution protein identification equipment and software. In addition, the proteins in human skin that serve as mechanical or biochemical barriers to parasite invasion were also identified. Among the proteins released by the parasite larvae were enzymes that degrade host tissue and immune defense molecules and other factors that protect the larvae from host defense mechanisms. Analysis of specific host proteins in skin invaded by cercariae served to highlight both the tissue degradation that facilitates cercarial invasion, and the host defenses that attempt to arrest or retard invasion. Proteins abundant in other skin diseases or UV and heat-stressed skin were not abundant in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that results did not reflect general stress in the surgically removed skin specimen. Abundant immune response proteins in human skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis. The fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immune response proteins and overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.
