We thank the authors of the many software tools we have used during this work, colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Dr Matt Berriman and colleagues), the Washington University of St Louis Genome Sequencing Center (Dr Makedonka Mitreva, Dr Jim McCarter, and colleagues) and elsewhere for nematode EST data, and the sequencers and curators of WormBase for access to C. elegans genome annotations. Dr John Parkinson wrote the first version of NEMBASE, and offered advice throughout, Dr David Martin assisted in the use of his GOtcha program, and Dr Asher Cutter provided critical insight in the invention of the faux proteome methodology for prot4EST.
