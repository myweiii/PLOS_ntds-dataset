Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. This disease is a public health problem in countries bordering the Mediterranean, in China, and South America. Until now, isoenzyme analysis, a method with several advantages but also some limitations, is the gold standard for typing the causative agent L. infantum. We have developed a new method based on hypervariable DNA markers, the microsatellites. Its higher discriminatory power, genotype-based analysis, the possibility to use biological material instead of parasite cultures, and the fast analysis are the major improvements. We could demonstrate for the first time that there exist different geographically determined populations within the predominant zymodeme of L. infantum, which has important epidemiological implications. We also tested for relationships between genotype and clinical picture and/or host background. Leishmania is considered to reproduce mainly clonally; however, we found some indication for recombination in our study. Our work constitutes a solid basis for further population and epidemiological studies of L. infantum by completing the existing microsatellite database by analysing strains from other endemic foci.
