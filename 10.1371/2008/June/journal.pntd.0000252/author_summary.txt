Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially fatal vector-borne infectious disease that leads to a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic disease. In northeast Brazil, the etiological agent of VL is the protozoan Leishmania chagasi/infantum. Active VL is characterized by fevers, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and eventually immune suppression. Without treatment, most symptomatic patients die from secondary bacterial or viral super-infection. We hypothesized that a unique immune response to L. chagasi is initiated early during the initial interactions between the immune system cells that first encounter the parasite. These include macrophages and T-cells, elements of the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively. We studied an in vitro model of these interactions in which human monocyte-derived macrophages were challenged with L. chagasi, and subsequently cultured with Leishmania-na√Øve, autologous T cells. Using microarray chips, we examined changes in global gene expression induced by these early interactions. Infection did not elicit a classical inflammatory program in macrophages. However, co-culture of infected macrophages and autologous T cells exhibited a pattern of gene expression, including many markers of acute inflammation or a type 1 immune response. These data suggest that early changes at the site of parasite infection would be conducive to the development of a protective type 1 response, followed by modulation of this same response.
