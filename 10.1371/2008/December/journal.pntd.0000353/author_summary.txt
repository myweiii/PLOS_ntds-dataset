The emerging human disease Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is of increasing challenge for public health systems in many countries, mainly in West and Central sub-Saharan Africa. Genetic differentiation of patient isolates, a prerequisite for scientific studies on and intervention of disease transmission and dispersal, is hampered by an exceptional lack of genetic diversity within this species. Comparative genomics on M. ulcerans of worldwide geographical origin has already allowed for distinguishing several haplotypes separated into two distinct lineages. Differences in prevalence and incidence of Buruli ulcer were already suspected, but biological relevance for this was unclear. Here, we show newly identified hot spot regions of genomic instability, a biased silencing of coding sequences belonging to distinct functional groups, and a differential gene repertoire across M. ulcerans strains. Gene inactivation mediated by different mechanisms in M. ulcerans adds to the concept of anti-virulence genes observed in an increasing number of bacterial species. According to this concept, loss of such genes—in addition to gain of function—may confer a selective advantage for a pathogen radiating into a new niche. In the case of M. ulcerans, a distinct set of disrupted genes may enhance virulence, particularly in the classical lineage.
