Trypanosomiasis is a major health threat in Africa, but vaccine development has long been hampered by the extraordinarily diverse surface proteins of these parasites. However, Serengeti lions show an asymptotic age prevalence of the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma congolense in contrast to a strong peak and decrease in age prevalence of the pathogenic T. brucei s.l.. This pattern suggests that lions may gain cross-immunity to T. brucei from repeated exposure to the more genetically diverse T. congolense. Although lions may gain more effective cross immunity than other host species owing to their frequent consumption of infected prey animals, these findings suggest possible strategies for designing effective vaccines against sleeping sickness in livestock and humans.
