Chagas disease is an important parasitic disease that has no cure. The pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely understood. Studies using candidate genes are important to better understand the differences between individuals that lead to such heterogenous disease. TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in the control of parasitemia during the acute phase and in cardiac injury during the chronic phase. The TNF-alpha gene is located in an important region of the MHC and its polymorphisms are associated with many parasitic and infectious diseases such as cerebral malaria and leishmaniasis. These studies are important since they were conducted in the same regions and involved populations leaving in the same conditions. The present study shows that patients with the indeterminate form produce higher levels of TNF-alpha than cardiac patients. The data suggest a control mechanism between inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. In addition, the presence of the TNF-238G allele contributes to the development of negative serology. We show that CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages are the main cells producing TNF-alpha. This study is an important contribution to explain the pathogenesis of Chagas disease.
