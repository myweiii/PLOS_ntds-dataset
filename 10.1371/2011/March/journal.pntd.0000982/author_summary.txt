Rapid delivery of post-exposure vaccination is essential for preventing the fatal onset of rabies in persons bitten by rabid animals. But for communities most at risk of exposure to rabies (in resource poor countries where domestic dog rabies is still common), post-exposure vaccines are often not affordable and are only available in limited quantities. Several safe and effective regimens for delivery of these vaccines are recommended by WHO, but these are inconsistently implemented and there are no clear recommendations as to which is the best regimen for specific settings. We developed a framework for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different vaccination regimens, including existing approved regimens and new candidates subject to approval, in terms of costs per death averted. We demonstrate that post-exposure vaccination is an extremely cost-effective public health intervention and that changing delivery from intramuscular to intradermal vaccination has considerable benefits. Large savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients could potentially both mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce delays in delivery, enabling wider vaccine distribution, and thus improving the accessibility and affordability of these life-saving vaccines. We also present financing mechanisms that could help subsidize the cost for those most in need, and even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs, without compromising existing healthcare budgets.
