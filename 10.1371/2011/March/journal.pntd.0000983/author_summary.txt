Over 11 million individuals are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, which kills >50,000 people annually. Although recent vector control efforts and increased use and effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs including benznidazole have reduced infection rates and mortality, a safe, effective vaccine is needed. Vaccination with the T. cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) has been used effectively in mice to reduce mortality and chronic disease, however, the establishment of vaccine-induced long-term protective immunity remains elusive. Co-immunization strategies utilizing immune regulators such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-15 (IL-15) can be used to enhance antigen-specific T cell responses and prolong protective immunity. In the present report, we show that genetic vaccination of BALB/c mice with plasmid DNA encoding both TS and IL-15 compared with plasmid DNA encoding TS alone significantly enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses including increased TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2 production, and long-term protection against lethal systemic parasite challenge.
