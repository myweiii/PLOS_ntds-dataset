Leishmaniasis is considered a neglected disease with 1.5 million new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) occurring each year. In the Amazon region and in the Americas in general, ML is caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, though in rare cases it has been related to other species. ML, which is associated with inadequate treatment of CL, normally manifests itself years after the occurrence of CL. Clinical features evolve slowly and most often affect the nasal cavity, in some cases causing perforation, or even destruction, of the septum. Diagnosis is made using the Montenegro skin test, serology and histopathology of the patients' mucosal tissues, or by isolation of the parasites. PCR is the best way to identify the species of leishmaniasis and is therefore the diagnostic method of choice. This paper describes 46 cases of ML and their geographical origin, 30 cases associated with L. (V.) braziliensis and 16 with L. (V.) guyanensis. The species of leishmaniasis was identified using mucosal biopsies taken from Amazonian patients who were diagnosed and treated for ML in the tertiary care unit, in Manaus, Amazonas state, Brazil. This is the highest number of ML cases caused by L. (V.) guyanensis that has ever been reported.
