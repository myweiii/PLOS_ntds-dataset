    "Background": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness due to conjunctival\n                        infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The presence of\n                        active trachoma and evidence of infection are poorly correlated and a strong\n                        immunologically-mediated inflammatory response means that clinical signs\n                        last much longer than infection. This population-based study in five\n                        Aboriginal communities endemic for trachoma in northern Australia compared a\n                        fine grading of clinical trachoma with diagnostic positivity and organism\n                        load.",
    "Methods": "A consensus fine grading of trachoma, based on clinical assessment and\n                        photograding, was compared to PCR, a lipopolysacharide (LPS)-based\n                        point-of-care (POC) and a 16S RNA-based nucleic acid amplification test\n                        (NAAT). Organism load was measured in PCR positive samples.",
    "Results": "A total of 1282 residents, or 85.2% of the study population, was\n                        examined. Taking the findings of both eyes, the prevalence of trachomatous\n                        inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1\u20139 years was\n                        25.1% (96/383) of whom 13 (13.7%) were PCR positive on the\n                        left eye. When clinical data were limited to the left eye as this was tested\n                        for PCR, the prevalence of TF decreased to 21.4% (82/383). The 301 TF\n                        negative children, 13 (4.3%) were PCR positive. The fine grading of\n                        active trachoma strongly correlated with organism load and disease severity\n                        (rs\u200a=\u200a0.498,\n                        P\u200a=\u200a0.0004). Overall, 53% of\n                        clinical activity (TF1 or TF2) and 59% of PCR\n                        positivity was found in those with disease scores less than the WHO\n                        simplified grade of TF.",
    "Conclusion": "Detailed studies of the pathogenesis, distribution and natural history of\n                        trachoma should use finer grading schemes for the more precise\n                        identification of clinical status. In low prevalence areas, the LPS-based\n                        POC test lacks the sensitivity to detect active ocular infection and nucleic\n                        acid amplification tests such as PCR or the 16S-RNA based NAAT performed\n                        better. Trachoma in the Aboriginal communities requires specific control\n                        measures."
