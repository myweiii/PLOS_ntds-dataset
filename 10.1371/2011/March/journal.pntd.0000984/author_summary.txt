Chagas disease is a major health problem in Latin America and it is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The genome sequence of the T. cruzi strain CL Brener (TcVI) has revealed a genome with large repertoires of genes for surface antigens, among other features. In the present study, we sequenced the genome of a representative member of TcI, the predominant agent of Chagas disease North of the Amazon and performed comparative analyses with CL Brener. Genetic variation between strains can potentially explain differences in disease pathogenesis, host preferences and aid the identification of drug targets. Our analysis showed that the two genomes have very similar sets of genes, but contain large differences in the relative size of several important gene families. Moreover, an abundance of allelic sequence variation was found in a large fraction of genes, and an evolutionary analysis indicated that many genes have evolved at different rates.
