We thank Baptiste Wy and Raymond Aï, the custom chiefs of the tribes Buiru and Pötê respectively for welcoming us and contributing to make this survey possible on custom land. We similarly thank Raphaël Moainao for accepting the sampling on his private cattle pasture. The authors would also particularly like to acknowledge the contribution of the Southern Province mediators, Sonia, Edna and Roselina Bouearan under the authority of Nathalie Lemagne. We also appreciated the contribution and the good mood of Rodolphe Boi, Franck-Teva Flores, Frédéric Wamo and Jean-Pierre Wy during field work. The cartography data for the Geographic Information System used was kindly provided by the New Caledonian Direction des Infrastructures, de la Topographie et des Transports Terrestres (DITTT). Meteorological data was kindly provided by Météo France. Sequence reads on the ABI 3730 xl were made at the regional genomic core research facilities for life science in New-Caledonia “Plate-Forme du Vivant de Nouvelle-Calédonie: PFV-NC” under the direction of Dr Clarisse Majorel. Thanks are also due to Dr Eric D'Ortenzio for validating the statistical analysis and fruitful scientific discussions of the results. Warm thanks are also due to CG's beloved brother Cedric for helpful English suggestions. IPNC authors also want to thank Pr S. Chanteau, director, for her continued and invaluable support of leptospirosis research programs.
