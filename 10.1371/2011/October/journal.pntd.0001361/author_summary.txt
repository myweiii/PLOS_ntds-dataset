In this study, we surveyed rodents and their Leptospira carriage in an area where human leptospirosis is hyper-endemic. We evidenced the well-known associations between specific rodent species and particular leptospires in both mice and rats. Overall, the observed Leptospira prevalence was in the range 18â€“47% depending on species, similar to other descriptions. However, significant variations were observed both in the abundance of rodents and their Leptospira carriage, one hot period with heavy rain being associated with both a highest abundance and an increased prevalence. Similar meteorological conditions could lead to increased leptospires dispersal by the rodent reservoir and increased exposure of humans to risk situations (e.g. flood, mud). Because rodent control measures were demonstrated elsewhere to be cost-effective if correctly planned and implemented, this contribution to a better knowledge of rodent and leptospires dynamics provides useful information and may in turn allow to develop relevant rodent control actions aimed at reducing the burden of human leptospirosis.
