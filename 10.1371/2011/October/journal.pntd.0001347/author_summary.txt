Melioidosis is a bacterial disease caused by percutaneous inoculation, aspiration or ingestion of the soil bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis is primarily found in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, and, to a lesser degree, nearby regions. A recent case of melioidosis in Southwestern United States (Southern Arizona) prompted a detailed epidemiological and molecular investigation to discover the source of infection. The authors describe the use of multiple genomic analysis tools to aid in this investigation. The results of these analyses uniformly identified Southeast Asia as the source of the strain that infected the patient, however the epidemiological investigation had determined the patient had no international travel or known exposures to Southeast Asian products. New cutting edge technologies, such as next generation sequencing, are quickly being adapted into epidemiologic investigations, particularly for cases and outbreaks of unknown origin, although older, mature technologies with larger existing databases will still be needed for appropriate comparative analyses.
