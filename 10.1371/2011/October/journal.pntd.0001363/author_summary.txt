Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans, an often fatal condition affecting at least 8 million people. The clinical outcome of Chagas disease is variable, which is probably partially attributable to genetic differences between T. cruzi strains. Differences between T. cruzi strains can arise by gradual accumulation of mutations in independent lineages (clonal reproduction) or by recombination between strains, which generates new combinations of existing alleles (sexual reproduction). Although sex has been observed experimentally, and epidemiologically important T. cruzi subgroups (TcV TcVI) originated via hybridisation events, active recombination is considered to be extremely rare. Our aim was to determine when recombination events have occurred during the evolution of T. cruzi. We analysed differences within and between T. cruzi subgroups in DNA sequences that evolve at different speeds. We found multiple recombination events, several of which were very recent in evolutionary terms. We show that TcV and TcVI most likely originated as a result of human activities that promoted mixing between subgroups, suggesting a continuing risk for emergence and spread of new genotypes generated by sexual reproduction. We also found evidence that sexual reproduction in T. cruzi could involve mechanisms different from those seen in multi-cellular eukaryotes.
