Parasites kill millions of people every year and leave countless others with chronic debilitating disease. These diseases, which include malaria and sleeping sickness, mainly affect people in developing countries. For this reason, few drugs have been developed to treat them. To make matters worse, many parasites are developing resistance to the drugs that are available. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs, but this is hampered by the fact that most parasites are difficult or impossible to grow in the laboratory. To address this, we have engineered baker's yeast to be dependent on the function of enzymes from either parasites or humans. In all, our engineered yeast constructs encompass six parasites (causing malaria, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease) and three different enzymes that are known or potential drug targets. Further, we have increased yeast's sensitivity to drugs by deleting the gene for its major drug efflux pump. Because yeast is robust and easy to grow in the laboratory, we can use a robot to screen for drugs that will kill yeast dependent on a parasite enzyme, but not touch yeast dependent on the equivalent human enzyme.
