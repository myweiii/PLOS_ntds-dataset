Visceral Leishmaniasis is well known as a public health problem in North-Indian Bihar state and adjacent districts in Nepal, with about 300.000 new cases per year. As not all infections with L.donovani lead to disease, the impact of control programs should not only be measured in numbers of VL cases, but also in number of new infections. So far there have been little or no data on the infectionâˆ¶disease ratio for this region, and the evolution of these latent infections. Using DAT seroconversion as a marker of infection, we found incident asymptomatic infection to be nine times more frequent than incident VL disease in high-endemic villages in India and Nepal, and about 1 in 50 of these latent infections lead to VL in the next 18 months, while over 80% turn seronegative again within a year. Asymptomatic DAT-positivity detected through screening in a person with no history of VL, and especially in case of documented recent seroconversion, is a risk factor for ultimately developing VL. Further studies on transient and persistent asymptomatic L. donovani infection are needed to better understand their immunological patterns and serokinetics, their level of infectivity, and their potential for later progression to VL.
