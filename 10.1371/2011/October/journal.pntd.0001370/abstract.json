    "Abstract": "The murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus is a convenient experimental model to study immune responses and pathology associated with gastrointestinal nematode infections. The excretory-secretory products (ESP) produced by this parasite have potent immunomodulatory activity, but the protein(s) responsible has not been defined. Identification of the protein composition of ESP derived from H. polygyrus and other relevant nematode species has been hampered by the lack of genomic sequence information required for proteomic analysis based on database searches. To overcome this, a transcriptome next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) de novo assembly containing 33,641 transcripts was generated, annotated, and used to interrogate mass spectrometry (MS) data derived from 1D-SDS PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis of ESP. Using the database generated from the 6 open reading frames deduced from the RNA-seq assembly and conventional identification programs, 209 proteins were identified in ESP including homologues of vitellogenins, retinol- and fatty acid-binding proteins, globins, and the allergen V5/Tpx-1-related family of proteins. Several potential immunomodulators, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor, cysteine protease inhibitors, galectins, C-type lectins, peroxiredoxin, and glutathione S-transferase, were also identified. Comparative analysis of protein annotations based on the RNA-seq assembly and proteomics revealed processes and proteins that may contribute to the functional specialization of ESP, including proteins involved in signalling pathways and in nutrient transport and/or uptake. Together, these findings provide important information that will help to illuminate molecular, biochemical, and in particular immunomodulatory aspects of host-H. polygyrus biology. In addition, the methods and analyses presented here are applicable to study biochemical and molecular aspects of the host-parasite relationship in species for which sequence information is not available."
