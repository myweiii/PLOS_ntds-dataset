Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is transmitted to humans through tick-bite or contact with infected blood or tissues from livestock, the main vertebrate hosts in a peri-domestic natural cycle. With numerous outbreaks, a high case fatality rate (3%â€“30%) and a high risk for nosocomial transmission, CCHFV became a public health concern in Europe and Asia. However virus surveillance in Africa is difficult due to the limited sanitary facilities. Especially, CCHFV occurrence in Central Africa is very poorly described and seems highly in contrast with the temperate to dry environments to which the virus is usually associated with. We described a single human infection that occurred in Democratic Republic of the Congo after nearly 50 years of absence. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that CCHFV enzootic circulation in the area is still ongoing despite the absence of notification, and thus reinforces the need for the medical workers and authorities to be aware of the outbreak risk. The source of infection seemed associated with a forest environment while no link with the usual agro-pastoral risk factors could be identified. More accurate ecological data about CCHFV enzootic cycle are required to assess the risk of emergence in developing countries subjected to deforestation.
