The work presented in this paper is the result of an effective collaboration between many people and organizations at national and international levels. The Ministries of Health of the 11 countries (Angola, CAR, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Nigeria and Sudan) were responsible for organizing and implementing the RAPLOA surveys.
