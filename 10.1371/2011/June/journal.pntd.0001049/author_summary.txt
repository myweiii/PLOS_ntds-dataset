The single-celled parasite Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in animals and insect vectors in the Americas. When transmitted to humans it causes a major public health problem, Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis). T. cruzi is genetically diverse and currently split into six groups, known as TcI to TcVI. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a method used for studying the population structure and diversity of pathogens. MLST involves sequencing the DNA of several different genes and comparing the sequences between isolates. MLST has not yet been developed and systematically applied to T. cruzi. He, we sequence nine T. cruzi genes, selecting a panel of four for lineage assignment and six for higher resolution studies of genetic diversity. Our results showed that one of the T. cruzi genetic groups is further subdivided into North and South American subpopulations. Furthermore, comparative analyses of the gene sequences gave new evidence of genetic exchange in T. cruzi. Application of MLST for assigning field isolates of T. cruzi to genetic groups and for detailed investigation of diversity provides a valuable approach to understanding the taxonomy, population structure, genetics, ecology and epidemiology of this important human pathogen.
