Trypanosomiasis due to Trypanosoma evansi is a widely distributed disease of livestock, affecting especially camelids and equines and is transmitted by biting flies. The disease is of great concern to many developing countries such as Sudan, where its large camel population estimated at over 4.6 million heads is at risk. It is generally believed that T. evansi has evolved when camels infected with T. brucei moved to tsetse-free areas, but only a few studies have been carried out to elucidate the genetic make-up of T. evansi. Therefore, in the current study, 15 microsatellite markers from non-coding loci on 38 isolates of T. evansi originating from different locations in Sudan were analyzed. Three reference strains from Sudan and Kenya were additionally analyzed and compared to the recent isolates. The results of this study revealed a highly significant isolation by distance pattern with rather small neighborhood sizes. It also suggested that T. evansi is either purely clonal with numerous problems of allelic dropouts or that it often sexually recombines without the need of the definitive host, the tsetse fly, or as the result of recurrent immigration from sexually recombined T. brucei brucei mutants.
