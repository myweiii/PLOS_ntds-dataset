Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly pathogenic virus, capable of causing Ebola hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. Five species of EBOV have been identified. To examine whether infection with one EBOV species results in antibodies that cross-react with other EBOV species, we selected groups of human diagnostic samples from four outbreaks, which were each due to a different EBOV species, and compared IgM and IgG responses by ELISA to each of the five EBOV species. For samples from an individual outbreak, we found limited IgM reactivity to species of EBOV other than the virus species the individual was infected with. In contrast, for all groups of outbreak samples we observed strong cross-reactive IgG antibodies to all EBOV species. Our study demonstrates that IgG antibody responses tend to be more cross-reactive than IgM antibody responses in people infected with EBOV, a finding that has implications for the development of diagnostic assays and vaccines to EBOV.
