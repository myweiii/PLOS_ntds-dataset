Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted through the bites of infected insects called sand flies. The World Health Organization has estimated that leishmaniases cause 1.6 million new cases annually, of which an estimated 1.1 million are cutaneous or mucocutaneous, and 500,000 are visceral, the most severe form of the disease and fatal if left untreated. The development of a more natural model is crucial for the evaluation of new drugs or vaccine candidates against leishmaniases. The main aim of this study was to quantify the number of Leishmania infantum parasites transmitted by a single sand fly female into the skin of a vertebrate host (mouse). Two L. infantum strains, viscerotropic IMT373 and dermotropic CUK3, were compared in two natural sand fly vectors: Phlebotomus perniciosus and Lutzomyia longipalpis. We found that the parasite number transmitted by individual sand flies ranged from 4 up to 4.19Ã—104. The maximal natural infective dose found in our experiments was about 250 times lower than the experimental challenge dose used in most previous studies.
