Control of urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis is based on mass administration of praziquantel at the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dose of 40 mg/kg, though some countries use 60 mg/kg. This multi-country randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy (cure and egg reduction rates three weeks post-treatment) and safety of these two doses for treating intestinal schistosomiasis in 856 patients in Brazil, Mauritania and Tanzania (Schistosoma mansoni), and The Philippines (S. japonicum). Transmission and infection intensities varied across the sites, but there was no bias or heterogeneity in efficacy outcomes. The two doses are equally effective in curing intestinal schistosomiasis; the higher dose may be less well tolerated, though effects are generally mild and transient. In endemic areas people can be re-infected; one year post-treatment patients on 60 mg/kg had fewer re-infections but this finding is difficult to explain. This study was conducted to respond to the demand for evidence about the dose of praziquantel when deployed in endemic countries. The results, along with those of systematic reviews, support the current WHO recommendation for using praziquantel at 40 mg/kg and should inform policy decisions in countries. The Philippines has already changed from 60 to 40 mg/kg after this study.
