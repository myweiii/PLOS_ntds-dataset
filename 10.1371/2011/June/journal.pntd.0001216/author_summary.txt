Chagas disease is a leading cause of cardiac failure and the most important parasitic disease in terms of morbidity and mortality in Latin America. After an acute parasitaemic phase, infection naturally evolves to a long chronic phase. If the currently available trypanocidal drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are effective in recent infection, they have to be administered during months and induce side effects. AmBisome, an already safe patented lipid formulation of amphotericin B, has been previously shown efficient using short time administration in treating human and experimental Leishmania (another Trypanosomatidae parasite) and fungal infections. This report evaluates the effect of AmBisome in mice infected with T. cruzi. Besides parasitologic evaluation, quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the parasite loads in tissues. Injections of AmBisome in acute infection allowed survival of all animals and drastically reduced the parasite loads in most tissues, whereas its administration in chronic phase strongly decreased the parasite loads in heart and liver, without completely curing the animals. Such results should encourage investigations on using AmBisome in association with standard drugs in order to improve the treatment of T. cruzi infection.
