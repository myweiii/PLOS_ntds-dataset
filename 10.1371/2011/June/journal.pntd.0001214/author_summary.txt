Anisakiasis is a worldwide re-emerging disease produced by the consumption of raw, lightly cooked, smoked or marinated fish containing live Anisakis larvae. In acute anisakiasis, mucosal lesions generated by the larvae may provoke upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). However, the effect of past unnoticed Anisakis infections as a risk factor for UGIB, and a possible synergism with other risk factors such as NSAIDs intake, have never been investigated. In this case-control study we observed that: i) prior Anisakis infections and NSAIDs intake are two independent risk factors for UGIB, and ii) that both risk factors act synergistically to the extent that their joint effect is 3 times higher than the sum of their individual effects. We concluded that, in countries where Anisakis infections are frequent, it would be wise to determine parasite-specific IgE antibodies and to conduct a closer follow-up of patients who consume raw or lightly cooked fish and who are prescribed NSAIDs for long periods.
