Although age at dengue virus (DENV) infection is recognized as playing a key role in characterizing the risks of clinical attack and disease severity, the contributions of age to disease development have yet to be quantified in detail. We estimated the age-specific risk of clinical attack (i.e., the risk of symptomatic dengue among the total number of DENV infections) during primary and secondary DENV infections in Vietnam, by employing a simple epidemiological modeling approach in which two pieces of epidemiological data sets were used, i.e., (i) age-specific seroprevalence and (ii) age-specific frequency of clinical attack of dengue during primary and secondary infections. We showed that those at higher age are more likely to develop symptomatic dengue than younger individuals for both primary and secondary infections; the estimated proportion of symptomatic patients among the total number of infected individuals was below 7% for those aged younger than 10 years of age for both primary and secondary infections, but was shown to be elevated as the patients become older, reaching to 8â€“11% by the age of 20 years. Age as an important modulator of clinical dengue attack explains recent increase in dengue notifications in ageing countries in Southeast Asia, and moreover, poses a paradoxical problem of an increase in adult patients resulting from a decline in the force of infection, which may be caused by various factors including time-dependent variations in epidemiological, ecological and demographic dynamics.
