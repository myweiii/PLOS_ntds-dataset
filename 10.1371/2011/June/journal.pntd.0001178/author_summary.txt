Schistosomiasis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropical world although its true burden has been historically underestimated. Millions of people currently endure severe pathology as a result of schistosome infections, although some individuals appear to be less susceptible to infection despite constant parasite exposure. A similar range of disease susceptibility is evident in different strains of inbred mice infected with schistosomes, thereby mirroring the clinical situation. Granuloma formation in the liver of both humans and mice is a characteristic manifestation of chronic schistosomiasis, and is largely controlled by gene signalling pathways. Certain genes expressed in particular cohorts of mice and humans may be associated with the development of severe pathology, or may confer a protective phenotype. This murine study highlights some key molecular aspects of chronic schistosomiasis which may be responsible for the development of both mild and severe pathology, and provides a bench mark for studying the mechanisms of schistosome-induced disease in humans.
