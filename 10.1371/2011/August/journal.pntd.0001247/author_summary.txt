During infection, pathogens are exposed to different environmental stresses that are mostly the consequence of the host immune defense. The most studied of these environmental stresses are the response of pathogens to nitric oxide and to hydrogen peroxide, both produced by phagocytes. In contrast, the overall knowledge about the response of pathogens to metabolic stresses is scanty. Amebiasis is caused by the unicellular protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, and has a worldwide distribution with substantial morbidity and mortality. During its journey in the host, the parasite is exposed to the host immune system and to variations in nutrient availability due to the host nutrition status and the competition with the bacterial flora of the large intestine. How E. histolytica responds to glucose starvation (GS) has never been investigated. Here, the authors report that the parasite virulence is boosted by GS. Paradoxically, two well accepted virulence factors, the amoebapore A and the cysteine protease A5 are less abundant in the glucose-starved parasites. This Accordingly, these proteins are not required for the boosting of the E. histolytica virulence, in contrast to KRiP1 and LgL1 that seem to be involved in this phenomenon.
