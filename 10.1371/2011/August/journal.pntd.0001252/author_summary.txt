Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic necrotizing skin disease presenting with extensive tissue destruction and local immunosuppression. Standard treatment recommended by the WHO includes 8 weeks of rifampicin/streptomycin and, if necessary, wound debridement and skin grafting. In some patients satellite lesions develop close to the primary lesion or occasionally also at distant sites during effective antibiotic treatment of the primary lesion. We performed a detailed analysis of tissue specimens from lesions that emerged in two BU patients from Benin 12 to 409 days after completion of chemotherapy. Histopathology revealed features of tissue destruction typically seen in BU and degenerated acid-fast bacilli. In addition, lesions contained organized immune infiltrates typically found in successfully treated BU lesions. Secondary lesions emerging many months after completion of chemotherapy may have been caused by immune response-mediated paradoxical reactions. However, the late onset may also indicate that they were associated with new infection foci spontaneously resolved by adaptive immune responses primed by antibiotic treatment of the primary lesions.
