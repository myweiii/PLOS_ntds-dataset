Infections with parasitic worms such as hookworm and threadworm (Strongyloides stercoralis) are widespread throughout the developing world. However, the symptoms caused by parasitic worms are unspecific and little is known about clinical presentations in endemic countries, and hence doctors' awareness of these diseases is usually low. Many infections therefore remain undetected and untreated over long time periods. As a consequence, parasitic worms can impair the well-being of infected individuals and cause harmful, sometimes even fatal health outcomes. To improve the knowledge about clinical signs and symptoms caused by parasitic worms, we administered a questionnaire to 292 children and adults in rural CÃ´te d'Ivoire, examined them clinically, and looked at their stool for parasitic worm infections. We found that people with parasitic worms reported some symptoms, especially disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, more often than those without worms. Our clinical examination showed a trend toward worse health conditions in worm-infected people, particularly in those with S. stercoralis. Our results are important to improve patient management and control measures, and to better estimate the true health impact of parasitic worm infections.
