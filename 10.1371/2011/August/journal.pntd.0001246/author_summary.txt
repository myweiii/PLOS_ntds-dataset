Because of weak health surveillance infrastructures in poor countries, estimates of the burdens (numbers of infections) of many tropical diseases may be inaccurate. In particular, current estimates for the global burden of Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness, HAT) vary widely. Most of the reported HAT cases occur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where many barriers to surveillance exist. The best way to generate accurate burden estimates is to use a survey sampled to be representative of the general population. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are a widely used tool to obtain nationally representative health data and have been conducted hundreds of times in developing countries, In this report, we use samples from the 2007 Democratic Republic of the Congo DHS to estimate the burden of HAT. ELISA tests were conducted on 7,769 leftover dried blood spots followed by confirmatory trypanolysis and PCR tests. Our data suggest that there are approximately 18,592 cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) in the DRC, close to WHO estimates.
