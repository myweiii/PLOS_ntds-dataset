Effective targeting of mass drug administration for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) requires reliable, up-to-date maps that indicate where prevalence exceeds the 20% intervention threshold recommended by the World Health Organization. We present a new approach for mapping the prevalence of STH in Kenya, incorporating observed prevalence data from 945 cross-sectional surveys undertaken between 1974 and 2009. The distribution of each species was modelled using model-based geostatistics; models included information on environmental factors, the spatial distribution of existing surveys and when these surveys were conducted. Resulting risk maps were combined and linked with population data enabling estimation of the population at risk of any STH infection and requiring treatment in 2009. In most areas, there was high certainty that combined STH prevalence was below the 20% intervention threshold, with areas of high prevalence located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. Results also suggest that observed prevalence decreased over time and emphasise the importance of continued surveillance in areas where observed prevalence was historically high. We show how spatial modelling can be used to develop up-to-date maps of STH risk to help improve the precision of decision making in disease control.
