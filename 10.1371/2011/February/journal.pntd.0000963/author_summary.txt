The parasites that cause malaria and human lymphatic filariasis are both transmitted by mosquitoes, and often times in areas where these two diseases are co-endemic, mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles transmit both parasites. Currently, it is unknown how parasite transmission is effected when malaria and filarial worm parasites share the same vector. Here, we show that when these two parasites share the same mosquito host, there is a significant reduction in the intensity and prevalence of Plasmodium infections. This reduction occurs regardless of the mosquito having a melanization-based immune response activated by filarial worms or when filarial worms successfully develop within the mosquito host. We also observed that filarial worm penetration of the mosquito midgut was necessary for malaria parasite reduction to occur. Our study provides new insight into the relationship between malaria and filarial worm parasites with their mosquito host, which could impact transmission dynamics in areas where both parasites are transmitted by the same mosquito species.
