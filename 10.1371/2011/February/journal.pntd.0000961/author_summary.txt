Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) across sub-Saharan Africa is traditionally split into three subspecies: T. b. gambiense (Tbg), causing a chronic form of human disease in West and Central Africa; T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr), causing an acute form of human disease in East and Southern Africa; and T. b. brucei (Tbb), which is restricted to animals. Tbg is further split into Tbg group 1 and Tbg group 2. Better understanding the evolutionary relationships between these groups may help to shed light on the epidemiology of sleeping sickness. Here, we used three different types of genetic markers to investigate the phylogeographic relationships among the four groups across a large portion of their range. Our results confirm the distinctiveness of Tbg group 1 while highlighting the extremely close relationships among the other three taxa. In particular, Tbg group 2 was closely related to Tbb, while Tbr appeared to be a variant of Tbb, differing only in its phenotype of human infectivity. The wide geographic distribution of the gene conferring human infectivity (SRA) and the fact that it is readily exchanged among lineages of T. brucei in eastern Africa suggests that human-infective trypanosomes have access to an extensive gene pool with which to respond to selective pressures such as drugs.
