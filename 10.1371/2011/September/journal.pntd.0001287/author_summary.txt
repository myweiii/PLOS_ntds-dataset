The sub-species of Trypanosoma brucei are important pathogens of humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. T. b. brucei is not able to infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanosome lytic factors (TLF) containing the lytic protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). T. b. gambiense is the most prevalent human infective sub-species, although there are two distinct sub-groups of T. b. gambiense that differ genetically and in terms of their human serum resistance phenotype stability. How they resist lysis by TLF is unknown. Previous data indicates that some group 1 T. b. gambiense parasites are able to avoid lysis due in part to reduced expression and activity of the gene encoding a TLF receptor (HpHbR). The authors showed that despite group 1 T. b gambiense displaying avoidance of some TLF particles, this sub-species group is resistant to the lytic protein of TLF, APOL1. This suggests that avoidance is not the complete story in this sub-species, as previously theorised. Group 2 T. b. gambiense is also innately resistant to APOL1 and there is no evidence of avoidance of TLF in resistant parasites. Group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays the human serum resistance phenotype that does not appear to correlate with expression of HbHpR.
