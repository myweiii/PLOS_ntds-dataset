Sand flies are tiny insects widely distributed in peri-Mediterranean countries where they can transmit Leishmania parasite and Toscana virus (TOSV). Since those microorganisms have a common vector, an epidemiologic link has been assumed for a long time. However, there is no scientific evidence of such a link between human leishmaniosis and phleboviral infections. To identify a possible link, we investigated the presence and distribution of antibodies to both Leishmania and TOSV in 500 sera of individuals living in Marseille, France. Antibodies are markers of past infections and reflect the exposition of population to pathogens. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seropositivity to one of these pathogens was significantly associated with seropositivity to the other pathogen. This result provided first robust evidence for an epidemiological relationship between Leishmania infantum and TOSV. Home addresses of tested patients were geolocalized in order to test spatial relationship between the two pathogens. This spatial analysis did not allow identifying either a spatial clustering or co-location, most probably because the sample was not powerful enough. Risk-factors of infection by TOSV (or Leishmania) would be investigated in seropositive patients' neighbourhood, in a range inferior to the mean of distance between patients in our study (245 meters).
