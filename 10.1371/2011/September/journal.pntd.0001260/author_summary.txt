The drug praziquantel (PZQ) is used very widely in both animal and human medicine, where it is the mainstay of the treatment of the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. The drug is currently manufactured and administered as a racemate (1∶1 mixture of enantiomers) but for various reasons the large-scale production of PZQ as the single active enantiomer is very desirable. We describe here the preparation of praziquantel as a single enantiomer using classical resolution. The protocols are experimentally simple and inexpensive. One method was found and validated by an unusual research mechanism—open science—where the details of the collaboration (involving academic and industrial partners) and all research data were available on the web as they were acquired, and anyone could participate. The other route was found in parallel by a contract research organisation. Besides being possible routes by which praziquantel may be produced in large quantities for the affected communities, it is also hoped that these methods can be used for the production of smaller quantities of enantiopure PZQ for pharmacological studies.
