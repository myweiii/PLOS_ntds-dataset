Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic parasitic disease and occurs predominantly in Southeast Asia and China. Using a simple, cheap, yet efficient oral method to deliver the vaccine antigen would benefit to control its transmission in that the oral vaccine could be made into a preparation and mixed with feedstuffs of livestock hosts. In this study, we used an attenuated S. typhimurium strain VNP20009, whose safety has been demonstrated in phase I clinical trial, to express the bivalent Schistosoma japonicum antigen Sj23LHD-GST by an intracellular activated promoter (nirB) and deliver it to host cells through type III secretion system. After oral vaccination of this recombinant strain, efficient protection against S. japonicum challenge was induced in mice. Mean while, granuloma formation in the liver was improved significantly in the immunized mice. This protective immune response was Th1 specific type as evidenced by increase in the production of IL-12 and IFN-Î³. This work provides an alternative S. japonicum vaccine for livestock and humans.
