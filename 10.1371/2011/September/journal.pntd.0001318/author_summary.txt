Amebiasis is usually transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water in developing countries. Recently, however, increased risk for amebiasis among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to oral-anal sexual contact was reported in developed countries, resulting in growing concern on amebiasis in HIV-1-infected MSM. The recommended treatment of amebiasis is metronidazole or tinidazole, followed by a luminal agent to eliminate intestinal cyst colonization. However, the efficacy of luminal treatment in preventing recurrence has not been assessed yet. In this study, we analyzed the medical records of 170 patients with amebiasis and HIV-1 co-infection. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was excellent whereas luminal treatment did not reduce the frequency of recurrence of amebiasis. Recurrence was more frequent in those MSM with signs of sexual activity such as syphilis infection. Luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high risk populations.
