Pathogenic nematodes currently infect billions of people around the world and pose serious challenges to the economic welfare and public health in most developing countries. At present, limitations of existing therapies warrant identification of new anti-parasitic drugs/drug targets to effectively treat and control neglected tropical diseases [NTD] caused by nematode pathogens. The current gold standard for measuring/screening drug effectiveness against most helminth parasites is in-vitro assessment of motility of parasites/larvae and larval development assays which fails to provide any conclusive idea about the precise mechanism of death of parasitic worms or their larval stages. Given the huge load of parasites or their larval stages in an infected host, a compound which shows promise in in-vitro/motility screening assays but induces necrotic death in parasites/larvae will be of limited use, as it may elicit severe inflammatory response in infected hosts. In this context, the present study, which demonstrates induction of apoptotic death in developing embryos of a pathogenic nematode as a potential drug target for the first time, and provides scope for high throughput screening of pharmacological agents for their apoptogenicity against nematode embryos, is a step forward to develop novel anti-parasitic measures to challenge NTD caused by nematode pathogens.
