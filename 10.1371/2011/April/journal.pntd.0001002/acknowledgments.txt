We thank Nicholas E. Sherman (University of Virginia) for helping us in the analysis of proteomics data with modern tools, Pascal Roux (Imagopole, IP) for its advice on imaging living cells and Sherri Smith (BCP, IP) for critical reading of the manuscript and advice. The immunofluorescence and living cell videomicroscopy studies were performed in the Imagopole at the Pasteur Institute.
