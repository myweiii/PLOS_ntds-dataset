Uropods are membrane folds formed at the rear of moving cells, e.g. lymphocytes during immune responses and the amoebic parasite Entamoeba histolytica during amoebiasis. Previous studies showed some surface receptors of E. histolytica, e.g. the Gal/GalNAc lectin, which is involved in adhesion, undergo capping and accumulate at the uropod, and these processes are driven by the activities of the actin-rich cytoskeleton. These uropods are then discarded to the extracellular medium, suggesting the components of uropods may induce anti-amoebic responses from the host. In this study, we showed that the serum from patients infected with E. histolytica, but not serum from healthy individuals, is able to induce uropod formation. To characterize the proteome of these induced uropods, we performed a proteomic analysis of the discarded complexes. In addition to the presence of several proteases and novel cytoskeleton factors, our proteomic results highlight the presence of important surface components including the Gal/GalNAc lectin, calreticulin, several adhesion molecules and the immunodominant antigen M17. Finally, we derived two important conclusions from further cellular analyses. Firstly, cysteine proteases are not involved in uropod formation in E. histolytica. Secondly, M17 was confirmed to be recruited at the uropods induced by serum from infected patients.
