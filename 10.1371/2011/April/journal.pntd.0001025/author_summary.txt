Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is still a major public health problem in central Africa. Melarsoprol is widely used for treatment of patients where the parasite has already reached the brain. In some regions in Angola, Sudan, Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, up to half of the patients cannot be cured with melarsoprol. From previous investigations it is not yet clear what causes these high relapse rates. Therefore we aimed to establish a parasite collection isolated from cured as well as relapsed patients for downstream comparative drug sensitivity profiling. From 360 sleeping sickness patients, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected before treatment and along the prescribed 24 months follow-up. Blood and CSF were inoculated in thicket rats (Grammomys surdaster), Natal multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis) and immunodeficient laboratory mice (Mus musculus). Thus, we established a unique collection of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense type I parasites, isolated in the same disease focus and within a limited period, including 12 matched strains isolated from the same patient before treatment and after relapse. This collection is now available for genotypic and phenotypic characterisation to investigate the mechanism behind abnormally high treatment failure rates in Mbuji-Mayi, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
