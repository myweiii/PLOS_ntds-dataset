There is currently only one drug available for treatment of
                        schistosomiasis mansoni and no vaccine. The searches for
                    possible new drug and vaccine candidates remain two major areas of current
                    research in schistosomiasis. There are considerable amounts of data available on
                    the genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics of Schistosoma
                        mansoni from which useful candidates for future drug and vaccine
                    development can be identified. Arranging these data into a biologically relevant
                    context through the characterisation of gene expression profiles of the
                    different tissues of this complex metazoan parasite, is an essential step in
                    identifying molecules with potential therapeutic value. We have used laser
                    microdissection microscopy and microarray analysis to show that many
                    tissue-specific genes are up-regulated in the digestive and reproductive tissues
                    of S. mansoni. This new knowledge provides an avenue to
                    investigate the molecular components associated with fundamental aspects of
                    schistosome biology.
