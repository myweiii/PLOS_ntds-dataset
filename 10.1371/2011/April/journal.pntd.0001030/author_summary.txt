The retrovirus, Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects 10â€“20
                    million people worldwide. The majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic;
                    however, approximately 3% develop the debilitating neurological disease,
                    HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). There is
                    also currently no cure, vaccine or effective therapy for HTLV-1 infection. The
                    precise role of CD8+ killer T cells in the control or contribution of
                    HTLV-1 disease progression remains unclear. The T-cell immunoglobulin mucin
                    domain-containing (Tim) proteins are type 1 transmembrane proteins. Three human
                    Tim proteins (Tim-1, -3, and -4) exist and display markedly diverse expression
                    patterns and functions. Tim-3 is upregulated on CD8+ T cells
                    during chronic viral infections leading to a population of poorly functioning T
                    cells. We investigated the expression of Tim-3 on T cells from patients with
                    asymptomatic and symptomatic HTLV-1 infection and compared this with HTLV-1
                    uninfected donors. Patients diagnosed with HAM/TSP down-regulated Tim-3
                    expression on T cells when compared to asymptomatic patients and uninfected
                    controls. Our study provides evidence of a novel mechanism for the persistent
                    inflammation observed in HTLV-1 infected patients with neurological deficits and
                    significantly advances our understanding of how the Tim-3 pathway functions.
