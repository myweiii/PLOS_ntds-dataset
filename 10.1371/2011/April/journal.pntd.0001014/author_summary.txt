Blindness from trachoma is caused by the abrasive effect of trichiasis (in-turned eyelashes). Surgery is performed to correct this anatomical abnormality, and prevent blindness. Despite the progress made in many regions in controlling the active/infectious stages of this disease, the global prevalence of trichiasis remains about the same. Current surgical activity is barely keeping abreast of incident trichiasis; this is undermining all the other efforts to control trachoma. We examine staff retention and productivity in Amhara Region, Ethiopia, where many hundreds of health care workers have been trained to perform the surgery. We found that the majority of people trained to do the surgery are now not in a position to do so. Amongst the sub-set that is still active within the programme, surgical productivity is low, with most surgery performed during “outreach campaigns” Insufficient surgical instruments and consumables were frequent problems. Strengthened health-systems management can overcome many of the problems that are holding back the delivery of an effective trichiasis surgical service.
