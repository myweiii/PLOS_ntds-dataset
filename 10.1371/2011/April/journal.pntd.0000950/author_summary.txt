The Rose Bengal Test (RBT) for brucellosis serological diagnosis was adapted to test serum dilutions and its usefulness evaluated using sera of Brucella culture positive patients, persons with contact with Brucella but no symptoms, veterinarians accidentally injected with vaccine Rev 1 who had not developed the disease and normal persons. Using the standard protocol, RBT was not outperformed by more sophisticated and expensive tests (serum agglutination, Coombs, competitive ELISA, Brucellacapt, and lateral flow immunochromatography for IgM and IgG detection) in identifying Brucella infected patients. All tests failed to discriminate with total specificity the sera from contacts or Rev 1 injected individuals. However, none of these sera was positive in the modified RBT adapted to test serum dilutions at titers higher than 1>4. When there is suspicion of brucellosis, RBT is recommended as the first test and, depending upon the titer, a positive result does not need confirmation by other (usually more expensive, sophisticated and time consuming) tests.
