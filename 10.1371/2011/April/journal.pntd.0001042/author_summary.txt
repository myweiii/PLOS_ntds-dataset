Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by a parasite of the Leishmania species, but infection does not always lead to overt clinical disease. To detect infection, the Montenegro test or Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is used along with serological markers. The LST is a test of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response read 48–72 hours after intradermal injection of leishmanin antigen. LST has many drawbacks, as complex administration and reading, boosting of anamnestic immune responses and difficult sourcing of GMP-compliant product and alternative tools for epidemiological research are badly needed. We evaluated whether a Interferon-γ Release Assay based on the QuantiFERON-TB test format, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a test for detecting latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, could become an in vitro diagnostic aid for the measurement of cell-mediated immune reactivity against L.donovani. We obtained good results with one of five of the antigens we evaluated and confirm the potential of this assay.
