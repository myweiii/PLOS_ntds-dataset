    "Background": "In areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a large number of infected individuals mount a protective cellular immune response and remain asymptomatic carriers. We propose an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-\u03b3RA) as a novel marker for latent L. donovani infection.",
    "Methods and Findings": "We modified a commercial kit (QuantiFERON) evaluating five different leishmania-specific antigens; H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA) and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA) from L. donovani with the aim to detect the cell-mediated immune response in VL. We evaluated the assay on venous blood samples of active VL patients (n\u200a=\u200a13), cured VL patients (n\u200a=\u200a15), non-endemic healthy controls (n\u200a=\u200a11) and healthy endemic controls (n\u200a=\u200a19). The assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a54.81\u201392.95) and specificity of 100% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a74.12\u2013100).",
    "Conclusion": "Our findings suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The positive IFN-\u03b3 response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active VL was contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and needs further research."
