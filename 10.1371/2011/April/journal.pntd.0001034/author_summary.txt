Undiagnosed and untreated parasitic infections can have severe consequences for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide are infected with soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis, yet there are few data on the prevalence in HIV-infected immigrants to more developed countries. This information could help clinicians determine what testing is needed and what signs or symptoms to expect. We performed serologic, stool, and urine testing for selected parasites in 128 foreign-born persons receiving care at an HIV clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. We found that 26% had serologic evidence of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis and 29% had serologic evidence of schistosomiasis. Because these were likely chronic processes, symptoms and signs were often absent; only weight loss was significantly associated with strongyloidiasis. High eosinophil counts were also associated with parasitic infection. This study suggests the need for targeted screening of foreign-born, HIV-infected persons for parasitic infections (mainly strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis) or the use of empiric antiparasitic therapy, particularly among those with unexplained eosinophilia. Although there are established guidelines for screening of refugees, health care providers should consider the risk of these organisms in patients who have entered the United States through other pathways.
