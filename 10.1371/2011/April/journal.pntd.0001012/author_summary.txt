Fasciola hepatica is a helminth parasite that causes liver fluke disease (fasciolosis) in domestic animals (sheep and cattle) and humans worldwide. In order to infect their mammalian hosts, F. hepatica larvae must penetrate and traverse the intestinal wall of the duodenum, move through the peritoneum and penetrate the liver. After migrating through the liver, causing extensive tissue damage, the parasites move to their final niche in the bile ducts where they mature and feed on host haemoglobin to support the production of eggs. To achieve these tasks, F. hepatica secretes a number of distinct cathepsin L cysteine peptidases (FhCL). Thus, the infective larvae that penetrate the host gut secrete cathepsin L3 (FhCL3), the migrating liver-stage juvenile parasites secrete both FhCL1 and FhCL2 while mature bile duct parasites that feed on host blood secrete predominantly FhCL1 but also FhCL2. Here we show that the major cathepsin L peptidases secreted by F. hepatica (FhCL1, FhCL2 and FhCL3) display differential ability to degrade host collagen (an important component of host tissues) and investigate this phenomenon at the molecular level.
