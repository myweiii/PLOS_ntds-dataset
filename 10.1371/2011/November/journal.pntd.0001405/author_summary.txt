Visceral Leishmaniasis is a neglected, life-threatening disease affecting the poorest of the poor. It has received more attention in light of the regional VL elimination program. A deterministic compartmental model was developed to estimate parameters for L. donovani transmission and to optimise intervention success. Our simulation results show that transmission of L. donovani is predominantly driven by asymptomatically infected hosts who are not eligible for treatment. Treatment can reduce the prevalence of symptomatic disease, but the incidence of KA remains on similar levels because of an unchanged intensity of transmission. In contrast to treatment-related interventions, vector-related interventions have the potential to reduce the prevalence of asymptomatic infections and thus are the intervention of choice from an epidemiological perspective. Vector control, however, should be combined with treatment, as PKDL cases can act as reservoirs of infection. This reservoir function originates from the long period of nearly two years on average during which putatively recovered KA patients develop PKDL.
