Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) cause significant physical debilitation, lowered economic productivity, and social ostracism for afflicted individuals. Five NTDs with available preventive chemotherapy: lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and the three soil-transmitted helminths (STH); have been targeted for control or elimination, but resource constraints in endemic countries have impeded progress toward these goals. We have developed an integrated mapping protocol, Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) for use by Ministries of Health to decide where public health interventions for NTDs are needed. We compared this protocol to the World Health Organizations disease-specific mapping protocols in Mali and Senegal. Results from both methodologies indicated the same public health interventions for trachoma, LF and STH, while the ITM methodology resulted in a more targeted intervention for schistosomiasis. Our study suggests that the integrated methodology, which is also less expensive and logistically more feasible to implement, could replace disease-specific mapping protocols in resource-poor NTD-endemic countries.
