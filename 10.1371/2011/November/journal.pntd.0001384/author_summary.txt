We aimed to assess the accuracy of a commercially available rapid diagnostic test for the detection of an infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni in urine. In total, 446 school children from three different settings of south Côte d'Ivoire provided three stool and three urine samples. Stool samples were examined with the widely used Kato-Katz technique and analyzed with a microscope for S. mansoni eggs. Urine samples were examined with a filtration method for S. haematobium eggs and with a rapid diagnostic test for S. mansoni that is based on detecting circulating cathodic antigens (CCA). We used a commercially available test (designated CCA-A) and an experimental formulation (CCA-B). Examination of nine Kato-Katz thick smears per child revealed a prevalence of S. mansoni in the three settings of 32.9%, 53.1%, and 91.8%. The sensitivity of triplicate Kato-Katz from the first stool sample was comparable to a single CCA-A (47.9–94.2% vs. 56.3–89.6%), and significantly higher than the sensitivity of a single CCA-B test (10.4–75.0%). CCA-A showed a considerably lower specificity than CCA-B (76.9–84.2% vs. 96.7–100%). In the settings studied in south Côte d'Ivoire, the CCA-A test holds promise for the diagnosis of S. mansoni, whereas results with CCA-B were suboptimal.
