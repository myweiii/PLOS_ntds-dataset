Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes transmit arboviral disease like dengue and chikungunya that are of international concern. Control of dengue and chikungunya presently focuses on eliminating freshwater larval development habitats of the two mosquitoes in urban surroundings. We investigated the ability of the two mosquito species to lay eggs and undergo development into larvae, pupae and adults in brackish water, and examined brackish water collections in the peri-urban environment for the presence of larvae. The results confirmed their ability to lay eggs and for the eggs to develop into adults in brackish water. Their larvae were found in brackish water in discarded food/beverage containers and abandoned boats as well as disused wells. Such brackish water collections with larvae in Jaffna city, Sri Lanka were found near areas of high dengue incidence. This hitherto unappreciated potential contribution to arboviral disease transmission in urban areas is of global significance. National and international health authorities need to take these new findings into consideration in developing appropriate strategies for controlling diseases transmitted by the two mosquito species.
