The emergence and spread of insecticide resistance compromise the control of mosquito borne diseases such as dengue or malaria, which are responsible for millions of deaths every year in tropical and subtropical areas. There are currently no easily implemented methodologies to quantify the strength of selection for resistance occurring in nature. Using field data from Mexico on the frequency of an allele mutation conferring resistance in the mosquito Aedes aegypti we use maximum likelihood (ML) to estimate the selection and dominance coefficients driving the evolution of resistance. We explored the impact of poor data collection, data that combine information from different locations and the consequences of selection and dominance coefficients varying over the sampling time period. The ML method can accurately estimate these parameters with simulated data in ideal sampling situations but it is difficult to recover true values when spatial and temporal heterogeneity occurs. The analysis highlighted factors relevant to field work such as the need for frequent surveillance in discrete sentinel sites.
