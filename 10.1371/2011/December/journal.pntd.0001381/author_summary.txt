Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil-dwelling bacterium that can infect a large range of hosts. In humans, B. pseudomallei causes melioidosis, and typical routes of entry include open wounds, inhalation, or ingestion. Clinical features are diverse, although pneumonia and abscess formation are common. High rates of recombination within the genome of this bacterium have confounded attempts to match clinical samples to geographically defined populations. Here we provide a reference that simplifies source attribution issues. We applied population assignment software to previously generated sequence data from seven B. pseudomallei genes to define the major geographic populations within this species. We evaluated the robustness of our results by comparison with two additional population assignment programs. We present the likelihood that each variant is assigned to a particular geographic population. This information can be used to assign novel B. pseudomallei isolates to a geographic population without needing to learn and run cumbersome population assignment applications. This method can also be used for other bacteria that are difficult to source-attribute due to high levels of genomic variation and recombination.
