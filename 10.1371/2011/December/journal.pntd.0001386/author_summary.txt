Intestinal amoebiasis, caused by Enatmoeba histolytica continues to be a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries and is considered to be the third principal parasitic disease responsible for mortality in the world. In addition to the mutagenic ability and known toxicity of conventional anti-amoebic drugs, there are reports indicating the emergence of treatment failures to these drugs. Therefore, there has been a considerable interest in exploring the potential of various antimicrobial peptides having higher efficacy and lower toxicity to combat such parasitic infections. Herein, we present the amoebicidal efficacy of cryptdin-2, a Paneth cell alpha-defensin against E. histolytica. Cryptdin-2 was found to decrease the number of trophozoites of E. histolytica in a concentration dependent manner. By and large, cryptdin-2 could retain its amoebicidal activity in the presence of cations, bile salts and at various pH values. Microscopic analysis and N-phenyl napthylamine (NPN) uptake assay revealed membrane dependent amoebicidal action of the peptide. It was also demonstrated that cryptdin-2 has the potential to target the intracellular macromolecular synthesis machinery of Entamoeba. Based on these results, cryptdin-2 seems to be a promising agent for the development of novel therapeutics against amoebiasis or at least may act as an adjunct to conventional antibiotics against E. histolytica.
