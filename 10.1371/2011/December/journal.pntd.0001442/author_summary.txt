Giardia is a unicellular intestinal parasite that infects millions of people worldwide each year. Colonization of the small intestine is a critical stage in Giardia infection. Giardia colonizes the intestinal wall using a specialized suction cup-like structure, the ventral disc. Little is known about the protein composition of the disc or about how the disc functions during attachment. We identified and confirmed eighteen new ventral disc proteins in a preparation of isolated discs using modern genomic methods for analyzing protein composition. We imaged these disc proteins in Giardia cells by labeling the proteins with fluorescent tags. A number of these proteins were present on the rim of the ventral disc, a region that appears necessary for the disc to form a seal during attachment to the host. These new ventral disc proteins form the building blocks of the ventral disc structure. Future studies of the roles of the ventral disc proteins either in the assembly of the ventral disc during cell division, or in the functioning of the disc during attachment will enable a better understanding of Giardia's colonization of the host.
