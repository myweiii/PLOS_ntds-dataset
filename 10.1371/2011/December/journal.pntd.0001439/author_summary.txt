Dengue virus infections are a major concern in developing countries, affecting approximately 100 million people/year. The virus has four immunologically related serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) associated with human disease. The virus is widespread in tropical and Sub-Tropical areas of Asia, Africa and Americas. The virus is transmitted by mosquito bites, and is primarily associated with Aedes aegypti as its main vector. To understand the reemergence of DENV-4 in Brazil in 2010â€“2011 we carried out a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene sequences sampled in Brazil in 2011. Our results indicate that the studied samples are close related to strains circulating since 1981, when DENV-4 was first introduced in South America, but have gone trough recent evolution for at least 4 to 6 years. Our results also suggests that the virus may have penetrated Brazilian population earlier than 2010, indicating that the virus could have been present but not detected due a higher prevalence of DENV-1 and DENV- 2 and the failure of the surveillance system to locate the milder disease commonly associated with DENV-4.
