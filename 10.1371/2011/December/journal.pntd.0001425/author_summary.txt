Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that are the causative agents of schistosomiasis, a major tropical disease. As adults, schistosomes reside within the host vasculature, taking up nutrients, evading host defenses, and expelling wastes and toxins. Multidrug resistance transporters are involved in removal of toxins and foreign compounds, including drugs, from cells. These transporters have broad selectivity, and when upregulated or mutated, can confer resistance to a wide spectrum of drugs against mammalian tumor cells. They are also associated with drug resistance in various parasites, including helminths. In this report, we have used knockdown of expression of these proteins and pharmacological inhibition of their transport function to dissect their physiological role in the schistosome life cycle. We find that either reducing transporter expression or pharmacologically inhibiting transporter function leads to disruption of egg production by adult worms. Eggs deposited within the host are the major cause of disease pathology, and eggs excreted by the host are the means of continuation of the life cycle and transmission of the disease. The capability to interfere with schistosome egg production could have major implications for development of new treatment strategies.
