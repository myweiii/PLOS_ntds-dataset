Buruli ulcer (BU), which is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an important disabling skin disease. However, BU has been neglected in many endemic African countries, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The province of Bas-Congo contains one of the most important BU foci of the country, i.e. the Songololo Territory in the District of Cataractes. In 2004 a specialized BU control program was launched in that area. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of the above-mentioned program, by comparing clinical profiles and outcomes of the group of patients admitted at the General Reference Hospital (GRH) of the “Institut Médical Evangélique” (IME) of Kimpese 3 years before the start of the project (2002–2004) with those admitted during the 3 years after the start of the project (2005–2007). The project implementation was associated with a strong increase in the number of admitted BU cases at the GRH and a fundamental change in the profile of those BU patients. Despite these encouraging results, our study provides some limitations of such program, and highlights the need of considering new strategies to better improve BU control in a low resources setting.
