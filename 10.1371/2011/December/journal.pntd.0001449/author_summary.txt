Dengue fever and its severe forms, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, are the most prevalent mosquito-borne diseases on Earth. It is caused by one of four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV-1–4). At present, there are no vaccines or specific therapies for dengue and treatment is supportive. Host response to infection is also poorly understood. Here, using a DENV-2 strain that causes a disease that resembles the severe manifestations of Dengue in humans, we demonstrate that IFN-γ production is essential for the host to deal with infection. We have also shown that IFN-γ production during DENV infection is controlled by the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18. Finally, we show that one of the mechanisms triggered by IFN-γ during host response to DENV infection is the production of Nitric Oxide, an important virustatic metabolite. Mice deficient for each of these molecules present marked increase in DENV replication after infection and more severe disease. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the IL-12/IL-18-IFN-γ-NO axis plays a major role in host ability to deal with primary DENV infection. These data bear relevance to the understanding of antiviral immune responses during Dengue disease and may aid in the rational design of vaccines against DENV infection.
