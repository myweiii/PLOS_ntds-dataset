Trypanosoma vivax is a major parasite of domestic animals in Africa and Americas. Most studies on this parasite have focused on gathering epidemiological data in the field. Studies on its biology, metabolism and interaction with the host immune system have been hindered by a lack of suitable tools for its maintenance in vitro and its genetic engineering. The work presented herein focused on determining axenic conditions for culturing and growing insect (epimastigote) forms of T. vivax and prompting their differentiation into metacyclic forms that are infectious for the mammalian host. In addition, we describe the development of appropriate vectors for parasite transgenesis and selection in vitro and their use in analyzing genetically modified parasite lines. Finally, we report on the construction of the first T. vivax recombinant strain that stably expresses a foreign gene that maintains its infectivity in immunocompetent mice. Our work is a significant breakthrough in the field as it should lead, in the future, to the identification of parasite genes that are relevant to its biology and fate, and to work that may shed light on the intricacies of T. vivaxâ€“host interactions.
