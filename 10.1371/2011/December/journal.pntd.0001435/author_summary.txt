Infection with the cestode Taenia solium causes cysticercosis in humans and pigs. Neurocysticercosis is a severe manifestation of T. solium infection that constitutes an important health concern in developing countries. Studies in humans living in areas of endemic disease and in pigs experimentally infected have suggested a large spectrum of permissiveness to T. solium multiplication, with the possible contribution of genetic factors. In the present report, we have used an experimental mouse model of intraperitoneal infection with Taenia crassiceps to study the potential role of genetic factors in regulating replication of this parasite. Our study focused on two inbred mouse strains A/J and C57BL/6J that are respectively permissive and non-permissive to intraperitoneal multiplication of T. crassiceps. We have used a set of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains of mice along with standard F2 crosses to decipher the complexity and nature of the genetic component of the A/J vs. C57BL/6J interstrain difference in permissiveness. Our results point to a major role of the complement component 5 (C5) in early response and protection against T. crassiceps infection.
