Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a public health problem in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Dogs are the main infection reservoirs for transmission by sand flies of Leishmania infantum to humans, many of whom may become infected without developing disease. Since majority of cases are in children we were interested to know the rate of infection in children and in dogs living within the area where cases of VL have been found, and what factors may affect the risk of infection. Using a test that detects the presence of antibodies in blood as a marker of infection, 7.3% of 4,250 children examined were positive at the baseline survey, and 6% became positive after one year. Overall, 18.2% of domestic and 15.3% of stray dogs were seropositive. The infected children were more apt to live in areas where clustered flying insects and stray dogs were observed, and were far more likely to have experienced a persistent fever in the 6 months before the survey. We conclude that there is very active transmission of L. infantum to both humans and dogs in Tbilisi, and that children remain at high risk of developing clinical disease and sub-clinical infection.
