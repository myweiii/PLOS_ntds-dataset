Phleboviruses have a worldwide distribution and are usually represented by their prototype Rift Valley fever virus that can have a great impact on health and economy in Africa. The genome of phleboviruses is a segmented negative strand RNA that is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein. The structure of the monomeric nucleoprotein has been recently published but it's not sufficient to decipher a convincing mechanism for the nucleoprotein oligomerization. In order to understand this key step in the virus life cycle, the purification of oligomers homogeneous in size would be a key step to launch structural studies. To that aim, a procedure relying on recombinant protein production in both denaturing and non-denaturing conditions was applied to three phlebovirus nucleoproteins. Although the best production pipeline differs for each protein, pure and homogeneous solutions of Rift Valley fever virus and Toscana virus nucleoproteins were successfully obtained. Both proteins, behaving as apparent trimers in solution, lead to protein crystallization, a starting point to understand the genome encapsidation through structural studies.
