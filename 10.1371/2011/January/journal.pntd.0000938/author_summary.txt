In sub-Saharan Africa, intestinal schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease caused by a worm infection. To arrest disease progression, de-worming medications are given out, often en masse, to school-aged children. In Uganda, however, much younger children can be infected, and in lakeshore communities both infants and pre-school children can already show signs and symptoms of intestinal schistosomiasis. To change de-worming practices, further information on the occurrence of infections in these younger is needed for evidence-based decision making. Our study applied current methods of disease diagnosis to better define the ‘age of first infection’ and estimate general infection prevalence within a disease-endemic village. Up to 50% of young children were clearly shown to have schistosomiasis and could likely wait up to 3–4 years before obtaining first treatment if present de-worming policies are not changed. In the context of identifying future treatment needs, we propose that antigen detection methods are most suitable.
