    "Introduction": "New world cutaneous leishmaniasis resulting from infection with Leishmania mexicana is under different genetic and immunoregulatory controls to those controlling L. major infection [1]. Also, unlike L. major, the majority of mouse strains are susceptible to L. mexicana infection [2]\u2013[3]. As with the other Leishmania species, protective immunity against L. mexicana is the result of a STAT-4 dependent type-1 immune response, although this can be generated independently of IL-12 [4]. While the immunological pathways resulting in non-healing L. major infections in susceptible BALB/c mice remain somewhat controversial, IL-4 plays the major role in promoting non-healing L. mexicana infections in this mouse strain [5]\u2013[7]. Thus, mice lacking IL-4 develop small lesions that heal while those lacking IL-4R\u03b1 fail to develop lesions [6]. This also indicates some input from IL-13 in the non-healing response to L. mexicana infection as IL-4 and IL-13 receptors share the IL-4R\u03b1 sub unit [6]. However, IL-4 and IL-13 are pleiotropic cytokines and numerous cell types of both the innate and adaptive immune responses produce these cytokines as well as express their receptors.\nIn order to better differentiate both the cellular sources and targets of IL-4/IL-13 initiating lesion growth and facilitating progressive non-healing disease, we have previously examined parasite growth in SCID mice reconstituted with IL-4\u2212/\u2212, IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, or wild type splenocytes [5]\u2013[6]. These studies indicated that non-lymphocyte sources of IL-4/IL-13 may contribute to early lesion growth during L. mexicana infection. However, the non-healing disease phenotype was dependent on a lymphocyte source of IL-4 and, in its absence, IL-4-deficient splenocyte-reconstituted SCID mice generated a healing response [5]. In addition, SCID mice reconstituted with IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 splenocytes demonstrated that initial lesion development was also dependent upon cells from this source responding to IL-4/IL-13 [6].\nIn order to better differentiate the specific role of IL-4/IL-13 responding cells from global effects in vivo, tissue specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice have been produced. So far macrophage/neutrophil specific (LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) [8] and CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) [9] IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice have been generated and the consequences for L. major infection studied. In contrast to susceptible BALB/c mice, BALB/c LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice showed a significantly delayed disease progression after infection with L. major, concomitant with normal Th2 and type 2 antibody immune responses but with improved macrophage leishmanicidal activities [8]. These results suggest that alternatively activated macrophages were contributing to the susceptible phenotype in non-healer BALB/c mice. Furthermore T cell-specific LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox BALB/c mice infected with L. major were significantly more resistant than global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice and developed a disease phenotype and clinical immunity similar to genetically resistant C57BL/6 mice [9]; not only showing the importance of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via CD4+ T cells in the non-healing BALB/c phenotype but paradoxically indicating a protective role for IL-4R\u03b1 signaling in a non-CD4+ T cell population.\nIn the present study we demonstrate that in contrast to L. major infection [8], macrophage/neutrophil signaling via IL-4R\u03b1 has minimal effect on the outcome of L. mexicana infection in BALB/c mice. In addition, unlike global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with L. mexicana that display no lesion growth, infected CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice initially develop lesions indicating that early susceptibility to L. mexicana is dependent on an IL-4 responsive non-CD4+ T cell population. However, subsequent lesion growth is significantly curtailed in infected CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice, and a strong Th1 response generated in the presence of significant elements of Th2 activity. Despite reduced susceptibility in all CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, a dichotomy between the sexes was identified during L. mexicana infection and while lesions in female CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice healed they persisted in male mice associated with elevated IL-4 production in this sex compared with females. Together, our results suggest that initial development of the L. mexicana lesion is dependent on an IL-4/13-responsive non-T cell population, whilst progressive infection is dependent on CD4+ T cells responsive to IL-4.",
    "Methods": "Mouse model\nLysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, IL-4R\u03b1lox/lox mice were generated and maintained as previously described [9]\u2013[10]. Cell-specific gene disruption in macrophages/neutrophils or T cells was achieved through an intercross between either LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 or LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 and IL-4R\u03b1lox/lox mice. Transgene-bearing LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox, were identified by PCR genotyping as described [9]\u2013[10]. The mice were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions. Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the UK Home Office Animal [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986 (licence number 60/3929) with approval by the University of Strathclyde Ethical Review Panel.\n\n\nL. mexicana parasites and infection\nL. mexicana (MYNC/BZ/62/M379) was maintained by serial passage of amastigotes inoculated into the shaven rumps of BALB/c mice. Amastigotes for use in infections were isolated from lesions and enumerated as described below. Two sites of infection were examined and either 5\u00d7106 L. mexicana amastigotes in a final volume of 50\u00b5l were inoculated subcutaneously into the shaven base of the tail, or 2\u00d7105 L. mexicana amastigotes in a final volume of 25\u00b5l were inoculated subcutaneously into the hind footpad. 6\u20138 week old male or female LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice were used in each experiment, with age and sex matched cre negative IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox littermates used as controls. The lesion diameter was measured using a sliding gauge micrometer at weekly intervals.\n\n\nEnumeration of parasites\nLesions were excised from L. mexicana infected LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox, LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice and disrupted through a metal mesh with 5mL of RPMI 1640 (Cambrex Bio Science Verviers, Belgium). The parasites were washed twice at 350g in RPMI and then enumerated using an improved Naubauer haemocytometer. Alternatively parasite numbers were quantified by limiting dilution, as previously described [11].\n\n\nSplenocyte stimulation and cytokine detection\nSplenocytes were isolated from infected mice and cultured for 72 hours in 96-well plates (Corning-Costar, NY, USA) in the presence or absence of L. mexicana antigenic lysate, as previously described [6]. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were detected in the supernatants by capture ELISA. Briefly the wells of Immulon 1B flat-bottomed microtitre plates (ThermoLabsystems, MA, USA) were coated with 50\u00b5L of 1\u00b5g ml\u22121 purified anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 capture antibody R4-6A2 (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) or 500ng ml\u22121 IL-4 capture antibody 11B11 (BD Biosciences) in PBS (pH 9.0) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were then added to the individual wells and either 30\u00b5L recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) or recombinant mouse IL-4 (Genzyme, Cambridge, UK) added to individual wells in duplicate in a doubling dilution with a solution of pH 7.4 PBS supplemented with 10% v/v FCS (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd., Crawley, UK), ranging form 20ng mL\u22121 to 0.01ng mL\u22121 (IFN-\u03b3) or 2ng mL\u22121 to 0.977pg mL\u22121 (IL-4). The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. The bound cytokines were incubated with either biotinylated rat anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody XMG1.2 or biotinylated rat anti-mouse IL-4 antibody BVD6-24G2 (both BD Biosciences) and detected with either conjugated streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase or conjugated streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences). The appropriate substrate was then added to the wells, p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) or tetramethylbenzidine in pH 5.5 sodium acetate buffer, containing 0.0003% hydrogen peroxide (BDH, Poole, UK). Finally the plates were read at an absorbance of 405nm for IFN-\u03b3 or at 450nm for IL-4.\n\n\nDetection of Leishmania mexicana specific -IgG1, -IgG2a and total IgE\nL. mexicana specific-IgG1 and -IgG2a were detected in the plasma of infected mice by ELISA, as previously described [12]. Briefly, Immulon 1B flat-bottomed microtitre plates were coated with 100\u00b5L of 10\u00b5g ml\u22121 Leishmania mexicana lysate (lysate preparation previously described [13] in PBS (pH 9.0) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Plasma samples were serially diluted in duplicate, followed by a 1 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C. Bound Leishmania specific antibodies were detected with a 1 hour incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., AL, USA). The substrate tetramethylbenzidine in pH 5.5 sodium acetate buffer, containing 0.0003% hydrogen peroxide, was then added to the wells and, following colour development, the reaction stopped by the addition of 10% sulphuric acid, absorbance measured at 450nm using a SOFTmax PRO (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and the endpoint dilution was determined. Total IgE was detected in the plasma of infected mice by capture ELISA as previously described [12], using R35\u201372 capture IgE mAb (BD Biosciences) and biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgE (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.).\n\n\nFlow cytometry\nDraining lymph node cells were activated for 4 hours with 50 ng ml\u22121 PMA and 500 ng ml\u22121 Ionomycin (both Sigma-Aldrich) along with GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences). Following stimulation, cells were harvested and washed, resuspended in FACS Buffer containing Fc Block (2.4G2 hybridoma supernatant) together with the appropriate combinations of the following antibodies: CD4-APC, CD8-PerCP or B220-FITC (all from BD Biosciences). Intracellular cytokine staining was carried out using PE-conjugated anti-mouse IL-4 or IFN-\u03b3 with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (all from BD Biosciences). Data was obtained using FACSCanto (BD Bioscience) and analysed using FlowJO (Tree Star Inc., CA, USA).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nAntibody analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and all other analysis used an unpaired Student's t test.",
    "Results": "IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via macrophages/neutrophils plays little role in the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to L. mexicana\nTo compare the progression of L. mexicana lesion growth in LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox with IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox littermate control and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, animals were infected with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes into the shaven base of the tail. While no discernible lesions were identified in infected global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, as previously demonstrated [6], rapidly growing non-healing lesions were observed in both LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (Figure 1A). Parasite burdens were also similar in LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox, and IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice and significantly higher (p<0.0001) than those recorded from global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 animals (Figure 1B). In line with the non-healing progressive disease phenotype displayed by macrophage/neutrophil IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, parasite antigen induced spleen cell IFN-\u03b3 production was similar to IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice and significantly less (p<0.01) than that of global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 1C). Antigen induced splenocyte IL-4 production was similar in all 3 strains (Figure 1D), demonstrating once again that IL-4 induction can be independent of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling [6], [14]\u2013[16]. Further studies demonstrated that the close similarities in the disease phenotypes of LysMCreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice were independent of site, dose of inoculum, and life cycle stage initiating infection (data not shown). These data suggest that the expression of IL-4R\u03b1 by a macrophage/neutrophil population is not important in determining susceptibility to L. mexicana infection.\nMean lesion growth (Figure. 1A), parasite burdens (Figure. 1B), and L. mexicana antigen induced (25 \u00b5g/ml) splenocyte IFN-\u03b3 (Figure. 1C), and IL-4 (Figure 1D) produced from IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox), macrophage/neutrophil specific (LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected sub-cutaneously with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes of L. mexicana. At 12 weeks post infection parasite burdens were significantly less in IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice than IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox or LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (****p<0.0001) and IFN-\u03b3 production significantly greater (**p<0.01). Results are mean +/\u2212 s.e. 5 mice. Representative of 3 independent experiments.\n\n\nIL-4R\u03b1 signaling via CD4+ T cells is essential for progressive non-healing disease following infection with L. mexicana\nIn subsequent studies, infection of CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice with 5\u00d7106 L. mexicana amastigotes into the shaven base of the tail resulted in control of the lesion growth observed in control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (wild-type equivalent). Interestingly, in one experiment using male mice, lesions in LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice did not heal completely, while experiments utilizing female mice fully resolved (Figure S1). Consequently, to confirm and further investigate this apparent gender-dependent difference in control of L. mexicana infection male and female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox, control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected in parallel with 5\u00d7106 L. mexicana amastigotes into the shaven base of the tail (Figure 2A\u2013D). While infected global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a non-lesion growth phenotype, lesion growth was progressive in control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (Figure 2A and B). These disease phenotypes were independent of gender. By comparison L. mexicana infected female CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed lesions which completely healed after 4\u20135 weeks (Figure 2A), while male CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 developed lesions which failed to fully heal (Figure 2B). Indeed in agreement with lesion size parasite burdens up until week 6 were similar in both male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (Figure S2).\nMean lesion growth (Figure 2A and B) and parasite burdens at week 12 (Figure 2C and D) in female (Figure 2A and C) and male (Figure 2B and D) IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox), CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected sub-cutaneously with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes of L. mexicana. Results are mean +/\u2212 s.e. 5 mice. Representative of 4 separate experiments. Parasite burdens in IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 male and female mice were significantly less than IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice (****p<0.0001) for both male and female mice. Parasite burdens were also significantly less in male and female CD4+ T cell specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice (****p<0.0001) for females and (**p<0.01) for males. Male CD4+ T cell specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 had significantly higher parasite burdens than females on the same background (p<0.001).\nParasite numbers at the termination of the study at week 12 were of a similar order of magnitude in both female and male control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice while global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice of both sexes were equally able to control infection with L. mexicana (Figure 2C and D). By contrast while infected CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice of both sexes were able to significantly control parasite growth (p<0.0001 and p<0.01 respectively for female and male mice), male mice (Figure 2D) were significantly limited in this ability and had significantly higher parasite burdens (p<0.001) than female mice (Figure 2C).\n\n\nIL-4R\u03b1 signaling via CD4+ T cells inhibits the production of a specific Th1 response following infection with L. mexicana\nL. mexicana infection of CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in an enhanced Th1 response in both male and female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice compared with control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice, as demonstrated by significantly enhanced antigen induced splenocyte IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 3A and B; p<0.025 for females; p<0.01 for males). As previously described, antigen stimulated splenocyte IFN-\u03b3 production from infected global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly higher than for wild-type equivalent (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) mice and this was true whether examining female or male mice (p<0.02). Antigen stimulated splenocytes from infected female but not male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice produced significantly more IFN-\u03b3 than antigen stimulated splenocytes from infected global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 animals. An expanded Th1 response was also indicated by enhanced antigen specific IgG2a production compared with control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice, and in magnitude similar to that generated by global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3C and D). However, while specific IgG2a production in the absence of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via CD4+ T cells in female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice was significantly greater (p<0.025) than in infected control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice as early as week 6 post-infection (Figure 3C) it was not until week 12 post-infection that male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice were producing significantly more IgG2a (p<0.025) than their infected control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox counterparts (Figure 3D). Similar results were recorded in 3 separate experiments.\nL. mexicana antigen induced (10 \u00b5g/ml) splenocyte IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 3A and B), and 6 and 12 week serum IgG2a levels (Figure 3C and 3D) produced from female (Figure 3A and C) and male (Figure 3B and D) IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox), CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected sub-cutaneously with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes of L. mexicana. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice. Representative of 4 separate experiments.\n\n\nIL-4R\u03b1 signaling via CD4+ T cells promotes the induction of a Th2 response following infection with L. mexicana differentially in male and female mice\nA clear dichotomy in antigen-induced splenocyte IL-4 production was identified between infected female and male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice both compared with each other and compared with their wild-type equivalent counterparts (Figure 4A and B). Splenocyte IL-4 production was barely detectable in female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice, and significantly less than IL-4 production by male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (p<0.01). On the other hand, antigen induced splenocyte IL-4 production was similar in all infected male mice, independent of IL-4R\u03b1 expression (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained with another Th2 cytokine, IL-5 (Figure 4C and D), as well as IL-10 (Figure 4E and F), with production of both cytokines significantly lower in female but not male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox compared with similarly infected sex matched control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice. Similarly, Th2 associated antigen specific IgG1 production was significantly less in infected female (p<0.05 week 12) but not infected male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice compared with their respective control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox counterparts (Figure S2). Minimal IgG1 production was detected in the serum of infected global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Total IgE levels in infected female and male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice were similar to each other and intermediate between those induced in control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox and the absence of IgE in infected IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S3).\nL. mexicana antigen induced (10 \u00b5g/ml) splenocyte IL-4 (Figure 4A and B), IL-5 (Figure 4C and D) and IL-10 (Figure 4E and F) produced from female (Figure 4A, C and E) and male (Figure 4B, D and F) IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox), CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected sub-cutaneously with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes of L. mexicana. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice. Representative of 4 separate experiments.\nAnti-CD3 and ConA stimulation (Figure 5A and B) of spleen cells from 12 week infected mice demonstrated quite clearly that not only was IL-4 production from female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice significantly less than that of female control IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (p<0.003 for ConA and p<0.01 for anti-CD3 respectively), but also significantly less than similarly treated male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (p<0.02 for ConA and p<0.05 for anti-CD3 respectively). Conversely male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice splenocytes produced similar quantities of IL-4 to control male IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice with either treatment. Examination of draining inguinal lymph node cells indicated a significantly lower (p<0.05) percentage of IL-4 and greater (p<0.05) percentage of IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD4+ T cells in infected female but not male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice compared with control sex-matched IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (Figure 6 A\u2013D).\nConA and anti-CD3 induced (10 \u00b5g/ml) splenocyte IL-4 produced from female (Figure 5A) and male (Figure 5B) IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox), CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, and global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected sub-cutaneously with 5\u00d7106 amastigotes of L. mexicana 12 weeks previously. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact mice. IL-4 production from female LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice was significantly less than similarly treated male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice (p<0.02 for ConA and p<0.05 for anti-CD3 respectively). Results are mean+/\u2212 s.e. 5 mice.

    "Discussion": "We have previously demonstrated that signaling via IL-4R\u03b1 plays the major role in the non-healing response of BALB/c mice following infection with L. mexicana [6] and that IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, unlike their wild-type counterparts that produce progressively growing non-healing lesions, display a non-lesion growth disease phenotype associated with an enhanced type-1 response. In the course of the present study using macrophage/neutrophil specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) we failed to identify any significant role for IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via macrophages/neutrophils in the normal non-healing response of BALB/c mice infected with L. mexicana. In contrast, following early lesion growth, CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were able to inhibit disease progression. However, while lesions in female CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice healed those in male CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice persisted. Furthermore, although both female and male CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly enhanced type-1 responses compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact (IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) mice, male CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice maintained strong type-2 responses compared with their female counterparts.\nAlthough signaling via IL-4R\u03b1 plays a significant role in the outcome of infection with L. mexicana as well as L. major [6], [8]\u2013[9], [15] the cell targets for IL-4/IL-13 activity and whether they promote or inhibit the disease process differ significantly between species. Thus, while IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via macrophages/neutrophils promotes early lesion growth in L. major infected BALB/c mice and macrophage/neutrophil specific (LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice display delayed lesion growth [8], we have failed to identify any contributory role for IL-4R\u03b1 signaling via macrophages/neutrophils during L. mexicana infection. The control of L. major early in infection in LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox mice has been identified as being due to enhanced macrophage microbicidal NO mediated activity in the absence of alternative macrophage activation. What may be critical in this regard is that L. amazonensis parasites, which belong to the \u201cmexicana\u201d complex of parasites, have been shown to be more resistant to macrophage-mediated control than L. major requiring higher levels of NO to induce killing [16]\u2013[17]. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that, unlike L. major, there is in fact enhanced replication of the amastigote stage of L. amazonensis in IFN-\u03b3-stimulated murine macrophages [18], reportedly due to the induction of a novel L-arginine pathway independent of iNOS or host arginase [19]. In addition it has been demonstrated that arginase null-mutant L. mexicana have attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo with the indication that the parasite arginase has a potential role in depleting host L-arginine available for iNOS activity [20]\u2013[21]. Furthermore, the authors suggest that there could be different roles of arginase between L. mexicana and L. major as the Th2 response is blunted in animals infected with arginase null mutant L. mexicana parasites while pharmacological inhibition of arginase during L. major infection did not inhibit the Th2 immune response [22].\nCD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice are more resistant than global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice to infection with L. major, indicating that in the absence of a polarized Th2 response, there is a role for an IL-4/IL-13 responsive non-CD4+ T cell in early resistance to infection [9]. Conversely CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible than global IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice to infection with L. mexicana, indicating a role for an IL-4/IL-13 responsive non CD4+ T cell population in early susceptibility. We have now studied the course of L. mexicana infection in newly generated iLckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox female and male mice that have IL-4R\u03b1 deleted on all T cell populations [23]. These produce the same disease and immunological phenotypes as CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). Consequently IL-4 responsive CD8+ T cells do not play a role in early susceptibility or the non-healing response following infection with L. mexicana. Studies utilizing macrophage specific BALB/c IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice have demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 operates through this population to enhance L. major parasite growth via alternative macrophage activation [8] and consequently these are unlikely to be the population driving a Th1 response in CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, IL-4 treatment of BALB/c mice prior to T cell priming has previously been demonstrated to instruct dendritic cells to produce IL-12 and facilitate a protective Th1 response against L. major [24] and is required for protective type-1 responses to Candida [25]. In addition IL-13 is able to prime monocytes for IL-12 production[26], which is also observed in listeriosis [27]. Furthermore both IL-4 and IL-13 promote CD40L-induced IL-12 production by macrophages and dendritic cells [28]. This would indicate that dendritic cells may be the IL-4/IL-13 responsive cells facilitating protection against L. major in the absence of IL-4R\u03b1 responsive CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. As no distinct disease phenotype could be discerned in macrophage/neutrophil specific (LysMcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with IL-4R\u03b1 intact animals infected with L. mexicana, no IL-4/IL13 responsive non-T cell population can easily be ruled out in promoting early infection against this parasite. While a role for B cells and antibody production in the non-healing response to L. mexicana is well established (as reviewed in [29]\u2013[30]), the fact that IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 BALB/c mice are more resistant to this parasite than IL-4\u2212/\u2212 mice suggests that IL-13 responsive cells and consequently non-lymphoid cells via IL-4R\u03b1 signaling play a role in disease susceptibility during L. mexicana infection [6].\nUnlike the epidemiological and experimental reports on L. major and L. tropica which identify females as more susceptible, females are more resistant than males to cutaneous infection with L. mexicana (humans and mice) [5], [12], [31]\u2013[33] and visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani (humans) [34]\u2013[35] or L. infantum (dogs) [36]. Female DBA/2 mice infected with L. mexicana develop much stronger Th1 responses, as measured by IFN-\u03b3 production, delayed\u2013type hypersensitivity and IgG2a antibody levels, than similarly infected male mice [12], [32]. Similarly, in humans infected with L. mexicana, females generally have increased Th1 responses as measured by DTH reactions and decreased Th2 responses as measured by IgE production than males [33]. The present studies using CD4+ T cell specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 BALB/c mice have revealed a previously undetected, underlying male susceptibility to L. mexicana involving T cells. Thus, unlike female mice, male mice were unable to resolve infection and overall had a less polarized Th1 response and more polarized Th2 than their female counterparts. This was associated with IL-4 production independently of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling in male but not female CD4+ T cell specific (LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox) IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 BALB/c mice. The L. mexicana induced IL-4 producing Th2 phenotype in male LckcreIL-4R\u03b1\u2212/lox BALB/c mice was not the result of differential Cre-mediated deletion efficiency of IL-4R\u03b1 in male mice as compared with female mice, as no CD4+ T cell population expressing IL-4R\u03b1 was detected from either gender (data not shown). While IL-4 production independently of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling has been observed in a number of immunological models previously [6], [14]\u2013[15] this is the first time a sex associated influence on this ability has been identified. How significant this could be with regard to the numerous gender related differences observed in inflammatory and infectious diseases is an intriguing question but outside the scope of the present study.\nTo conclude in this study utilising tissue specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice we demonstrate that upon infection with L. mexicana initial lesion growth is dependent on a non-CD4+ T cell population responsive to IL-4/IL-13, while progressive infection is dependent on CD4+ T cells responsive to IL-4. Furthermore whether lesions heal or not is gender determined, suggesting a subtle but significant effect of sex hormones on CD4+ T cell function whereby infected male but not female CD4+ T cell specific IL-4R\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice can drive IL-4 production independently of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling."
