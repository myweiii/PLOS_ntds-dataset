In humans, the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis (also called clone Rhinoscleromatis, as it evolved from a single Klebsiella pneumoniae ancestral strain) causes rhinoscleroma, a chronic infection of the nose and throat. Identification of the bacterium from biopsies or nasal secretions is essential for diagnosis, and currently relies on the biochemical characteristics of clone Rhinoscleromatis and on detection of its capsule of antigenic type K3. Our aim was to develop two identification tests based on amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of specific portions of the genome of clone Rhinoscleromatis. We established the sequence of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis cluster and identified one gene sequence that was unique to K3 strains. A PCR test that targets this gene was shown to be specific for K3 strains. We also exploited unique DNA signatures of clone Rhinoscleromatis to develop a second PCR test, which is specific for this clone, thus allowing distinction from other K. pneumoniae K3 strains. These novel and simple identification tests should help to diagnose rhinoscleroma and to understand the epidemiology of this disease.
