Leishmania is a group of parasites (Protozoa, Trypanosomatidae)
                    responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical forms. Among the factors explaining
                    this phenotypic polymorphism, parasite features are important contributors. One
                    approach to identify them consists in characterizing the gene expression
                    profiles throughout the life cycle. In a recent study, the transcriptome of 3
                        Leishmania species was compared and this revealed
                    species-specific differences, albeit in a low number. A key issue, however, is
                    to ensure that the observed differences are indeed species-specific and not
                    specific of the strains selected for representing the species. In order to
                    illustrate the relevance of this concern, we analyzed here the gene expression
                    profiles of 5 clinical isolates of L. braziliensis at seven
                    time points of the life cycle. Our results clearly illustrate the unique
                    character of each isolate in terms of gene expression dynamics: one
                        Leishmania strain is not necessarily representative of a
                    given species.
