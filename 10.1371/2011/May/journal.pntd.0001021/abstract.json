    "Background": "Most of the Leishmania genome is reported to be\n                        constitutively expressed during the life cycle of the parasite, with a few\n                        regulated genes. Inter-species comparative transcriptomics evidenced a low\n                        number of species-specific differences related to differentially distributed\n                        genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes. It is of uppermost\n                        importance to ensure that the observed differences are indeed\n                        species-specific and not simply specific of the strains selected for\n                        representing the species. The relevance of this concern is illustrated by\n                        current study.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "We selected 5 clinical isolates of L. braziliensis\n                        characterized by their diversity of clinical and in vitro\n                        phenotypes. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on promastigote and\n                        amastigote life stages to assess gene expression profiles at seven time\n                        points covering the whole life cycle. We tested 12 genes encoding proteins\n                        with roles in transport, thiol-based redox metabolism, cellular reduction,\n                        RNA poly(A)-tail metabolism, cytoskeleton function and ribosomal function.\n                        The general trend of expression profiles showed that regulation of gene\n                        expression essentially occurs around the stationary phase of promastigotes.\n                        However, the genes involved in this phenomenon appeared to vary\n                        significantly among the isolates considered.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Our results clearly illustrate the unique character of each isolate in terms\n                        of gene expression dynamics. Results obtained on an individual strain are\n                        not necessarily representative of a given species. Therefore, extreme care\n                        should be taken when comparing the profiles of different species and\n                        extrapolating functional differences between them."
