Scrub typhus, a life-threatening disease that occurs in the Asia-Pacific region, is a public health problem since a billion of people are at risk and one million new cases arise each year. Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causal agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that mainly infects endothelial cells. We demonstrated here that O. tsutsugamushi grew in monocytes isolated from healthy donors and altered the expression of a large number of genes including interferon-related genes, genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages and apoptosis-related genes. Importantly, these data were related to the transcriptional changes detected in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus. Indeed, the microarray analyses revealed the upregulation of numerous genes, which included interferon-related genes, and some features of M1 polarization. This is the first report demonstrating that monocytes are clearly polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to O. tsutsugamushi. These results improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of scrub typhus and may give us a clue of new tools for the diagnosis of patients with scrub typhus.
