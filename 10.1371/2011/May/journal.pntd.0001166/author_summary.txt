Schistosoma mansoni tetraspanin 2 (Sm-TSP-2) is considered a lead target for vaccine development against schistosomiasis mansoni because: (1) It is located in the schistosome tegument and is involved in tegument formation; (2) It is strongly recognized by IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies from individuals putatively resistant to schistosome infection, but not chronically infected people, and (3) It induces high levels of protection against challenge infection in the mouse model. We amplified 211 homologous TSP-2 sequences from male and female S. japonicum worms, which revealed 7 different cDNA subclasses. We expressed in E. coli a region of one of the clusters which exhibited a high frequency of transcription in female worms, and showed the purified recombinant protein (Sj-TSP-2e) was recognised by 43.1% of sera obtained from confirmed schistosomiasis japonica patients. Vaccination of mice with the recombinant protein induced high levels of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies, but no consistent protective efficacy against challenge infection was elicited in three independent trials. The highly polymorphic nature of the Sj-TSP-2 gene at the transcriptional level may limit the value of Sj-TSP-2 as a target for future S. japonicum vaccine development. Further analysis of the distribution of the different subclasses/alleles of the Sj-TSP-2 gene in S. japonicum populations from different endemic areas would be informative.
