Rational design of novel therapeutics relies on the knowledge and understanding of potential drug targets. Historically, the majority of therapeutics have not been rationally designed, but empirically discovered. Paromomycin, an aminoglycoside with antibacterial activity, has been found to show considerable activity against leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. However, the mechanisms of aminoglycoside action against protozoan parasites have in part remained unclear. In this study we demonstrate that the cytosolic ribosome is the preferred drug target, and that the mitochondrial ribosome does not contribute to the antiprotozoal activity of aminoglycosides. As the cytosolic ribosome of Trypanosoma, the causative agent of sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, resembles that of Leishmania, we tested the efficacy of paromomycin against Trypanosoma. We found that paromomycin not only inhibits the growth of Trypanosoma in culture, but also suppresses trypanosomiasis in a mouse infection model. Our results point to the cytosolic ribosome as a promising drug target for antiprotozoal drug development.
