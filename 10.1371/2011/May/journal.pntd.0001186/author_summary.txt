Bartonella spp. are bacteria that infect the red blood cells and that are associated with several diseases in humans and animals all over the world. They are transmitted by arthropod vectors including fleas, lice and sand-flies, but new potential vectors are suspected and in particular ticks. Diseases transmitted by ticks, currently in emergence, have diverse etiology (viral, bacterial, parasitic) and are responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates around the world. The potential for involvement of ticks in transmission of Bartonella spp. has been heartily debated for many years because of the numerous but indirect proofs of its existence. In this study, the authors used a murine model to assess the ability of the tick Ixodes ricinus to transmit Bartonella bacteria to mice. Results of the study confirm the vector competence of I. ricinus and represent the first in vivo demonstration of a Bartonella sp. transmission by ticks. Consequently, bartonelloses should be now included in the differential diagnosis for patients exposed to tick bites.
