Recently, we discovered that 4-[5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]morpholine (compound 1) and its derivatives exhibit specific antitrypanosomal activity toward T. b. rhodesiense, the causative agent of the acute form of HAT. We found that compound 1 would target the parasite adenosine kinase (TbrAK), an important enzyme of the purine salvage pathway, by acting via hyperactivation of the enzyme. This represents a novel and hitherto unexplored strategy for the development of trypanocides. These findings prompted us to investigate the mechanism of action at the molecular level. The present study reports the first three-dimensional crystal structures of TbrAK in complex with the bisubstrate inhibitor AP5A, and in complex with the activator (compound 1). The subsequent structural analysis sheds light on substrate and activator binding, and gives insight into the possible mechanism leading to hyperactivation. Further structure-activity relationships in terms of TbrAK activation properties support the observed binding mode of compound 1 in the crystal structure and may open the field for subsequent optimization of this compound series.
