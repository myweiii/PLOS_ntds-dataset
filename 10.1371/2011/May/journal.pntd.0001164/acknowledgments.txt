We gratefully acknowledge the excellent support by Clemens Schulze-Briese, Claude Pradervand, Takashi Tomizaki and Armin Wagner from the protein beamline X06SA at the SLS, Villigen, Switzerland, and Dr. William Bisson for pKa calculations and fruitful discussions. The coordinates of these crystal structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with the entry codes 3OTX and 2XTB along with the observed structure factors.
