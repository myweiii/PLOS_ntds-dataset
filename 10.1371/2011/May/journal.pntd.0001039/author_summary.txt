Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth that
               affects an estimated 30–100 million people worldwide. Chronically infected
               persons who are exposed to corticosteroids can develop disseminated disease, which
               carries a high mortality (87–100%) if untreated. Despite this, little is
               known about the fundamental biology of this parasite, including the features that
               enable infection. We developed the first DNA microarray for this parasite and used it
               to compare infective third-stage larvae (L3i) with non-infective first stage larvae
               (L1). Using this method, we identified 935 differentially expressed genes. Functional
               characterization of these genes revealed L3i biased expression of heat shock proteins
               and genes with products that have previously been shown to be immunoreactive in
               infected humans. Genes putatively involved in transcription were found to have L1
               biased expression. Potential chemotherapeutic and vaccine targets such as
                  far-1, ucr 2.1 and hsp-90 were
               identified for further study.
