Leprosy is still a public health problem in Brazil, and low adherence to multidrug therapy against leprosy (MDT) is an important obstacle of disease control. This may lead to remaining sources of infection, incomplete cure, complications, and multidrug resistance. We performed a study in 78 municipalities in central Brazil, and interviewed leprosy-affected individuals. In total, 3% of patients defaulted, and 18.2% interrupted MDT. Risk factors for interruption of treatment include: reduced number of rooms per household (OR = 1.95; p = 0.04); difficulty in swallowing MDT drugs (OR = 1.66; p = 0.02); temporal non-availability of MDT drugs at health center (OR = 1.67; p = 0.01); and moving residence after diagnosis (OR = 1.58; p = 0.03). Defaulting MDT was significantly associated with: reduced number of rooms per household (OR = 3.43; p = 0.03); moving to another residence (OR = 2.90; p = 0.04); and low family income (OR = 2.42; p = 0.04). Our study shows that defaulting and interruption of MDT against leprosy are associated with some poverty-related variables such as family income, household size, and migration. Intermittent problems of drug supply need to be resolved, mainly on the municipality level. MDT producers should consider drug formulations that are more easily accepted by patients. An integrated approach is needed for further improving control, focusing on most vulnerable population groups and the local health system.
