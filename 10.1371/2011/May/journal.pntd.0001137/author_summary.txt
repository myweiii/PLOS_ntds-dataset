It remains unclear how arenavirus infection causes disease; however, for other hemorrhagic fever viruses, infection has been linked to over-production of numerous cytokines by macrophages that can then affect vascular integrity. In order to determine if a similar mechanism might contribute to arenavirus pathogenesis, we have examined the infection and subsequent cytokine production in human monocytes and macrophages by two closely related arenaviruses: the apathogenic Tacaribe virus (TCRV) and the hemorrhagic fever-causing Junin virus (JUNV). We found that both viruses infected primary monocyte and macrophage cultures; however, only, in the case of TCRV was infection accompanied by the production of cytokines. These cytokines would have the potential to stimulate an antiviral response to infection, including the production of antibodies, which are known to be protective during infection. Surprisingly, in contrast to what is observed in other viral hemorrhagic fevers, we found that JUNV infection did not have any effect on the expression of these cytokines. This suggests that an early, strong immune response by infected macrophages may be critical for the control of infection by apathogenic arenaviruses and the prevention of subsequent disease.
