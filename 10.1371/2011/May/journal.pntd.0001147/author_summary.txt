Dengue manifestations may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal
                    complications. With an increasing number of Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and
                    fatal cases, the availability of new approaches useful for cases confirmation
                    plays an important role for the disease surveillance. The diagnosis of fatal
                    cases in frozen and fixed tissues from autopsies can be determined by techniques
                    such as viral RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, viral proteins detection by
                    immunohistochemistry and NS3 specific immunostaining. We aimed to assess for the
                    first time the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as a diagnostic technique to
                    demonstrate DENV antigens in human tissue specimens. The highest sensitivity was
                    obtained by a rapid ICT which was also the most sensitive in liver, lung,
                    kidney, brain, spleen and thymus. Despite a number of studies demonstrating the
                    usefulness of DENV NS1 antigen detection by different ELISAs in plasma and/or
                    sera of dengue patients, no research has been done previously to demonstrate NS1
                    presence in tissues of fatal dengue cases. Moreover, the application of NS1 kits
                    to demonstrate the presence of DENV may provide a better understanding of viral
                    tropism in fatal cases and may be useful for studies of pathogenesis in vivo and
                    in experimental animals.
