Immunization of dogs with DNA-prime/DNA-boost vaccine (TcVac1) enhanced the
                        Trypanosoma cruzi-specific type 1 antibody and
                        CD8+ T cell responses that resulted in an early control of
                    acute parasitemia and a moderate decline in pathological symptoms during chronic
                    phase. Further improvement of vaccine-induced immunity would be required to
                    achieve clinical and epidemiological benefits and prevent transmission of
                    parasites from vaccinated/infected dogs to triatomines.
