Lung fluke (Paragonimus) infection causes similar symptoms to pulmonary TB and is an important differential diagnosis in endemic areas. Standard diagnosis is wet film (WF) microscopic examination of sputum samples. For the last fifty years, Ziehl-Neelsen stain (ZNS) has been believed to destroy Paragonimus eggs. However, our investigation of stored ZNS slides and our prospective comparison of wet film, ZNS, and formalin-ether concentration technique of sputum of chronic cough patients in Laos showed that (1) similarly to wet film and FECT, Paragonimus eggs were hardly fragmented by ZNS; and (2) ZNS had a higher nominal sensitivity for detection of Paragonimus eggs than WF at lowest costs. Examination of bloody sputum parts revealed more eggs; while on the other hand, ZNS with continuous heating of the slides reduced the quantity of eggs compared to the current heating technique. Further, ZNS should also be investigated with the 10× lens for Paragonimus eggs, in addition to the 100× lens for TB, to reduce misdiagnosis of sputum-negative TB. Finally, the ZNS methodology appears to diminish biosafety risks of the standard wet film procedure. ZNS could be a valuable technique in epidemiological research on paragonimiasis.
