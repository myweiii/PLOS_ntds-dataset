Reduced physical fitness, which is a manifestation of the body's inability to maintain adequate oxygen supply to the tissues, can have many causes. In developing countries, a person's low physical fitness is often the result of anemia and undernutrition, which have multifactorial etiologies including poor diet and chronic infections such as malaria, hookworm and schistosomiasis. In past surveys, exercise tolerance has been measured using non-standardized tests that were poorly-suited to young children. In this study, we implemented a well-validated and reliable 20-meter shuttle run test in a low-resource area of Kenya. Results for 1950 children, aged 5â€“18 years, showed that impaired fitness was common and associated with anemia and poor growth with boys being more affected than girls. The 20 mSRT is a feasible and low-cost tool that can be easily delivered in low-resource settings to identify children who manifest the disabling but often sub-clinical manifestations of their disease. We propose its implementation as a standard fitness test in less developed areas to allow comparisons across morbidity studies assessing the impact of different interventions.
