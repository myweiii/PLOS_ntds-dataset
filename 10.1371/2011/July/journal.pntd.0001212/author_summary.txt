Freshwater snails are important in the transmission of schistosomiasis. As part of an integral control effort to combat the spread of schistosomiasis new intervention tools are being sought. One method is to interrupt the transmission of the causative schistosome parasite during the intra-molluscan phase of its development. Gene-silencing technology involving the use of dsRNA have used an injection route to disrupt gene translation in the Schistosoma mansoni snail host, Biomphalaria glabrata in an effort to investigate how inhibition of various transcripts can affect the dynamics of the snail/parasite interaction. These studies have been helpful in showing us that a gene-silencing pathway that uses dsRNA indeed exists in snails but the injection method previously utilized is impractical, especially when working with juvenile snails. To make the use of gene silencing technology more widely applicable to functional gene studies in snails, we have developed a more convenient soaking method that uses a cationic carrier polyethylene amine (PEI) to deliver dsRNA or siRNA into juvenile snails. Using this method we show the successful knockdown at both RNA and protein levels of the B. glabrata peroxiredoxin (Prx) gene. The method was also evaluated for silencing the Cathepsin B (CathB) gene in the snail.
