Bartonellosis (Carrion's disease) is caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis and is encountered across the Andean cordillera, particularly in Peru. B. bacilliformis is transmitted by arthropods, probably sandflies, and exploits humans as a reservoir host, establishing chronic infections characterized by intra-erythrocytic bacteremia. It this thought that asymptomatic infections are common among the residents of bartonellosis-endemic regions. However, several thousand cases of B. bacilliformis-induced severe haemolytic anaemia are reported each year, frequently among visitors to endemic regions but also among inhabitants of an increasing number of new foci of disease. To better understand the epidemiology of bartonellosis, a clearer understanding of how B. bacilliformis strains circulating in endemic regions and in new foci are related to one another is required. Here, we describe the development and application of a new genotyping tool for addressing this shortfall, namely multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We applied MLST to 43 B. bacilliformis isolates of varying provenance, delineating eight distinct genotypes, some of which had obvious epidemiological correlates. Surprisingly, one genotype exhibited profound divergence from the other seven, and the extent of this divergence suggested that some bartonellosis may be caused by a Bartonella species specifically related to, yet distinct from, B. bacilliformis.
