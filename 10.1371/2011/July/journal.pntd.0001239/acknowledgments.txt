We are indebted to Prof. Bassirou Bonfoh, Director-General of the Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Côte d'Ivoire, Dr. Kouassi B. Crépin, Departmental Director of Agboville, and Dr. Akaffou Rofu, Head of Health Services at School and University for their support and facilitation of this study. Many thanks are addressed to Mr. Laurent K. Lohourignon for his help in field and laboratory, and to Mr. Adrian Egli, who supported us in creating figures in MATLAB. Furthermore, we thank the primary school teacher team of Grand Moutcho II and III without whose excellent cooperation such a smooth study flow would not have been possible. Last but not least we are grateful to the children for their enthusiastic participation.
