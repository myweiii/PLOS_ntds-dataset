Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne disease in tropical regions. The clinical manifestation may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome. Early laboratory confirmation of dengue diagnosis is essential since many symptoms are not specific. Dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) may be used in simple antigen-capture ELISA for early detection of dengue virus infection. Our result demonstrated that the Platelia NS1 antigen detection kit had a quite low overall sensitivity. However, sensitivity rises significantly when used in combination with MAC-ELISA. When taking into account the various forms of dengue infection, the NS1 antigen detection was found relatively high in patients sampled during the first 3 days of fever onset, in patients with primary infection, DENV-1 infection, with high level of viremia and in mild form of dengue fever. In asymptomatically infected individuals, RT-PCR assay has proved to be more sensitive than NS1 antigen detection. Moreover, the NS1 antigen level correlated significantly with high viremia and low level of NS1 antigen was associated with more severe disease.
