The malaria epidemic and endemic in tribal areas of KPK, Pakistan is a present and constant threat to public health. It has been a great challenge in monitoring the incidence of malaria in tribal districts of KPK because of the military conflict. We report an epidemiological, clinical, and household assessment of malaria endemicity in the six tribal districts of KPK, Pakistan, which is the most neglected area due to militancy and war in Afghanistan. The study sample comprised of1,127malaria-suspectedpatients. Their blood samples were collected for microscopy, nPCR and biochemical analysis. Of the samples collected, 78% were identified as Plasmodium-positive by microscopic analysis, whereas, 38% were determined as Plasmodium-positive by nPCR. Then PCR analysis detected 87% (n = 373 out of 429) and 13% (n = 56 out of 429) P. vivax and P. falciparum cases, respectively. Cases were noticeably higher in males (74%). We found poor hygiene conditions in all the districts we examined, probably caused by low socioeconomics settings. Hyperpyrexia (27%) was the prominent clinical feature among all the cases infected by both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Our findings have substantial implications for both malaria control and public health in the tribal districts of Pakistan.
