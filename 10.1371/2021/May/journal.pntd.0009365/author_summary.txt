Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, which can invade several organs including the brain, lungs, and liver. Liver involvement through hepatic cystic echinococcosis has been reported in up to 75% of CE cases. Although it is a rare disease in Europe, migrations from endemic regions to European countries have increased the prevalence of hepatic CE. Several medical and surgical treatment options have been introduced for hepatic CE. Of these, endocystectomy is a conservative approach which avoids radical surgeries and liver resections. In this systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis, we synthesized evidence on the short- and long-term outcomes of endocystectomy in treating patients with hepatic CE. We searched for relevant articles in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases that were published until May 2020 without any language restriction. Of 3930 articles, 54 were included in the systematic review. A summarized analysis of the study findings suggested that endocystectomy is an effective and safe alternative to radical resection or the PAIR procedure in hepatic CE patients.
