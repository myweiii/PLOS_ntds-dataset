Leishmaniasis is a neglected vector borne disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania and is endemic in over 98 countries globally. Two broad categories of leishmaniasis exist: visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The first report of CL in Ghana was from a cluster of cases in 1999â€“2003 in the Ho municipality of the Volta Region [which has since the year 2019 been divided into Volta and Oti Regions]. However, information on the prevalence of Leishmania infection in the affected communities of Ghana is limited. Using a cross-sectional study design, this study described prevalence of exposure to Leishmania in three communities of the Oti Region based on the leishmanin skin test (LST), following reports of potential cases of CL in that area. In addition, factors associated with an increase in the odds of exposure to Leishmania were also investigated. Demonstration of exposure to, as well as factors associated with Leishmania infection in communities of the Oti Region of Ghana suggests a need for further investigation of other related factors such as prevalence of CL and possible vectors and reservoirs of the disease.
