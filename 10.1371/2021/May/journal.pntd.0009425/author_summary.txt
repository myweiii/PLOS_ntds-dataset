Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus transmitted horizontally between humans through mosquito bites, and sexual intercourse generally inducing a mild disease. ZIKV is also transmitted vertically from mother-to-child producing congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZVS) in neonates. CZVS leads to severe microcephaly associated with neurological, ocular, musculoskeletal, genitourinary disorders and other disabilities. Although numerous studies have been performed on ZIKV infection of brain cells, we are still far from understanding how ZIKV infection leads to dysregulation of host genes, virus-induced cytopathicity and consequent pathology. Micro (mi)RNAs are small noncoding RNAs encoded and processed by the host cell. They regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a process called RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we evaluated the relationship between ZIKV infection and the level of mRNAs and miRNAs expressed in the cell. ZIKV infection of mouse embryo neurons downregulated several neural immediate-early genes (IEG). Moreover, we revealed that ZIKV infection led to aberrant regulation of several miRNAs, and identified one whose cognate target was a neural IEG. Our work identifies novel genes and miRNAs that are modulated upon ZIKV infection of fetal murine neurons, therefore linking neuronal dysfunction to transcription and the RNA interference pathway.
