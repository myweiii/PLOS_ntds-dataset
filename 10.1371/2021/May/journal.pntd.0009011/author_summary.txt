When infected by onchocerciasis worm parasites, people can eventually develop blindness or severe skin morbidity. Over the past decades, in most places with high onchocerciasis prevalence, annual mass drug administration has become freely available for all inhabitants, regardless of their infection status. This policy has been highly successful in decreasing morbidity. For the next aim, to eliminate onchocerciasis, this intervention is now being expanded to lower prevalence locations. We have adapted an existing simulation model of the spread of onchocerciasis to allow us to model settings where multiple villages are connected, through movement of either humans or blackflies, the intermediate host. By this connection, worms could spill over from a high prevalence village to neighbouring villages with lower prevalence. For such situations, we have examined the impact of implementing treatment only in the high prevalence village, or also in one or two lower prevalence villages. We conclude that for elimination of onchocerciasis transmission, treatment in the lower prevalence villages may not actually be needed, but the total duration of mass drug administration in the entire area can be significantly decreased by expanding treatment to these villages.
