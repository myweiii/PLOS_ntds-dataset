Infections with Schistosoma parasites are commonly classified by the presence and concentration of excreted Schistosoma eggs. Guidelines put forward by the World Health Organization (WHO) include classifications of S. haematobium infections assessed by urine filtration into light and heavy infections and S. mansoni infections assessed by Kato-Katz thick smears into light, moderate, and heavy infections. Past evidence has demonstrated an association between intensity of infection with morbidity for severe morbidities, but this was before recognition of the effect of light-intensity infections on morbidity and was done in treatment naïve populations. In these analyses, we assessed the associations between the WHO classifications for infection intensity and a wide array of S. haematobium and S. mansoni morbidity indicators in school-age children ascertained in monitoring and evaluation cohorts before and after initiation of deworming. Our analyses found a high correlation with S. haematobium intensity categories and morbidity indicators, especially microhematuria, but weaker correlation between S. mansoni intensity categories and morbidity indicators. The results indicate that, on the aggregate, the intensity categories represent a person’s S. haematobium-related morbidity but are poor at representing a person’s S. mansoni-related morbidity.
