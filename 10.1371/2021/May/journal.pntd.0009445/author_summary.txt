With the rise in dengue infection worldwide, dengue fever remains an important diagnosis among patients presenting with fever in the community. We conducted a passive surveillance study in a large community clinic in southern Malaysia. Adults with fever who met the WHO 2009 criteria for probable dengue infection underwent blood tests that were able to detect dengue fever accurately, including rapid diagnostics tests, serology, and molecular tests. Nearly half (45.4%) of the patients were confirmed to suffer from dengue infection in which the widely-used rapid tests were negative in a considerable proportion of dengue-infected patients. This underlines the importance of recognizing clinical and laboratory features suggestive of dengue fever. We found that a history of family or neighbours with dengue infection in the past week, skin rash, a higher temperature, leucopenia (white cell count < 4,000/μL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/μL) were significantly associated with dengue fever whereas runny nose and arthralgia were features that suggest non-dengue conditions. These features in addition to rapid diagnostic kits are useful to guide community based health care workers in the diagnosis of patients presenting with undifferentiated fever.
