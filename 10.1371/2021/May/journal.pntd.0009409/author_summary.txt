Legally, participants of clinical trials must sign an informed consent form prior to the start of a trial. To be truly informed, participants (or their caregivers, if underaged) need to understand the trial objectives, procedures, benefits, potential risks and their rights throughout the study. However, in regions where literacy and health literacy are still quite low, delivering information exclusively in written format using an informed consent form is not the best way to convey information. A previous study on Pemba Island, Tanzania, found that a spoken information session in addition to the informed consent form alone, significantly improved the clinical trial-related knowledge of the caregivers of participants. However, not all questions could be answered correctly. In the current study, we explored the addition of two further modes of information to the information session: a slideshow or a theater show. Caregivers’ understanding was measured using a questionnaire. We confirmed that having an oral information session is significantly better than only receiving the informed consent form. However, adding a slideshow and theater did not further improve caregivers’ knowledge. We conclude that future studies should work on improving these modes of information or explore new ones.
