In Senegal, as in most African countries, the arbovirus epidemics control policy relies on the control of the main vector Ae. aegypti though insecticide applications. Vector control strategies have been largely adopted without information on the vector populationsâ€™ insecticide resistance mechanisms. We profiled here the resistance status of nine Ae. aegypti populations from Senegal to four classes of insecticides and their related mechanisms. Our findings revealed high resistance to carbamates, a relative susceptibility of southern populations to pyrethroids and a variable efficacy of organophosphates. Resistance to pyrethroids was driven by a significant overexpression of detoxification genes linked to insecticide metabolism. Our results contribute towards a more targeted and efficient control of Ae. aegypti populations and thus of arbovirus epidemics in Senegal.
