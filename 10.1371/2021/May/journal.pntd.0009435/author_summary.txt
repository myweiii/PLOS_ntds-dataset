Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This silent illness is endemic in Latin-American countries and is conventionally transmitted to humans by insects from the Reduviidae family. In its passage from the insect vector to the mammalian host, and vice versa, the parasite must overcome abrupt changes in environmental conditions in order to survive.
The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by environmental stresses that cause imbalances of the intracellular AMP:ATP ratios. Thus, AMPK is regarded as a “fuel gauge”, functioning both as a nutrient and an energy sensor to help maintain energy homeostasis and protect cells from death by nutrient starvation.
In the present study we report the characterization of AMPK complexes for the first time in T. cruzi and describe the function of AMPK as a novel regulator of nutritional stress in epimastigote forms. We demonstrate that this complex possesses specific AMPK kinase activity, is inhibited by Compound C and is modulated by carbon source availability.
Together, these results point to a role of AMPK in autophagy and nutrient sensing, key processes for the survival of this parasite and for its life cycle progression.
