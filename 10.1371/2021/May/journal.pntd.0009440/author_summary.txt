Aedes mosquitoes and the viruses they transmit are major public health concerns for over half of the global human population. However, the quantitative relationships between virus transmission and vector mosquito infestation remain unclear despite numerous indicators used to estimate transmission risk and predict dengue outbreaks. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of a salivary biomarker to assess the small-scale variation in human exposure to Aedes bites and the risk of dengue infection in the context of a vector control intervention in northeastern Thailand. A cohort of 539 persons visited every four months, including 161 individuals visited monthly, were recruited for routine serological and concurrent household entomological surveys during 19 consecutive months follow-up. Antibody response to Aedes bites was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to assess the mosquito exposure index (MEI) and association with the Aedes adult and immature abundance as well as the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in adult mosquitoes (transmission risk). Additionally, the individual (cohort), climatic, and vector control intervention risk factors associated with MEI are explored. This study demonstrates that the MEI was strongly related to household adult Aedes density, particularly indoors resting mosquitoes. Additionally, the MEI was influenced by individual characteristics (i.e., person age, gender, staying indoors), and varied according to seasons and intervention. Nonetheless, no clear relationship between MEI and dengue transmission risk (i.e., vector infection) was detected. This study demonstrated the potential usefulness of the MEI to assess heterogeneity in adult Aedes infestation indices that could assist public health authorities to rapidly identify mosquito “hot spots” and the timeliness of effective vector control interventions.
