Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) has greatly impacted the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria because of the red blood cell destruction in what is known as hemolysis. Primaquine, used to clear dormant liver parasites that cause relapses of the disease, is a well-known trigger that may lead to life-threatening complications in patients with this condition. Although there are several G6PDd diagnostic tests available to guide the decision of weekly or daily primaquine treatment, they are not yet routinely used: questions on how, when, where and who is going to perform the test remain unanswered. This study revealed that, although G6PDd was not previously known by most of the healthcare workers, they were able to perform the test after a single training session. The test performed well in the field, differentiating patients that cannot use daily primaquine from the others, but some expected limitations require further action to be taken into consideration. This research provides an important overall understanding that may aid policy makers in the process of recommending proven interventions, such as G6PDd screening, to implement them pragmatically.
