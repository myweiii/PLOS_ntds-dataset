Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania and is transmitted by various species of female sandflies. CL usually begins as painless nodules and is usually characterized by skin ulcers which may be single or multiple. Although ulcers due to CL are often self-healing, they may become painful and result in scarring after healing. Typically, CL occurs on exposed parts of the body such as the neck, limbs, and face, which may be easily accessible to sandflies. Although cases of CL had previously been reported in some parts of the Volta region of Ghana, no previous case of CL had been reported in the Oti region. This study was initiated following reports of skin ulcers which were suggestive of CL in some communities of the Oti region. This study confirmed Leishmania infection in 150(25.5%) out of 595 skin ulcer samples obtained from 426 study participants. Given that 445(74,8%) of the skin ulcers tested negative for Leishmania parasite suggests a need for investigation of additional causes of skin ulcers such as yaws and Buruli ulcer in the study area.
