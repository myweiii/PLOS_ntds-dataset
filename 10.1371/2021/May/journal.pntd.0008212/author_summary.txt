In Colombia, little is known about the Asian mosquito distribution, Aedes albopictus, potential vector of arbovirus in América. Therefore, this work searched to estimate its current and future geographical distribution (under the climate change scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) for 2050 and 2070, using ecological niche models. We worked with models in MaxEnt, using A. albopictus occurrences and 8 bioclimatic variables. From its invasion to Colombia, this vector was reported in 15 departments until 1800 m. Our estimations for the currently suggest that this vector could be distributed in 96% of continental Colombia until 3000 m (≈48 million of people in infection risk). Also, for 2050 and 2070, under the RCP 2.6 scenario, its distribution could cover about near to 90% of continental Colombia until 3100 m (≈55 million of people in risk), while under RCP 8.5 scenario, could decrease below 60% of continental Colombia until 3200 m (<38 million of people in risk). In Colombia, the vigilance and vectorial control programs should focus its attention on this vector to avoid complications at the national public health level.
