Rabies is a fatal yet vaccine-preventable zoonotic disease. Domestic dog populations are known to constitute the predominant reservoir of rabies in developing countries, causing 99% of human rabies cases. Despite valuable efforts to control rabies spread, the last two decades have seen only a limited reduction in the global rabies disease burden. Dog rabies is still endemic in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, in part due to remaining knowledge gaps on dog rabies dynamics. We conducted an in-depth review of phylodynamic approaches and mathematical models used to study the spread and control of rabies in domestic dogs. We identified 59 relevant studies which used mathematical models (30), phylodynamic approaches (22), or interdisciplinary approaches (7). Our study revealed that these approaches disentangled different aspects of rabies spread and control. Mathematical models support the role of dog population heterogeneity as a key driver of rabies spread, and the overwhelming efficacy of dog vaccination campaigns to control rabies. Phylodynamic studies confirm the role of frequent reintroduction events and human-mediated transportation over long distances in rabies maintenance. Interdisciplinary studies represent a powerful tool to generate and test hypotheses on rabies spread. Finally, we identified new avenues which represent a promising opportunity for canine rabies research to achieve more impactful public health outcomes.
