In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized Chagas Disease as a neglected tropical disease. Meanwhile the serological tests, recommended by WHO, can be performed for chronic disease diagnosis, the nucleic acid amplification tests must be performed for the detection of the acute phase of the disease. Although the existing laboratory diagnosis tests for Chagas Disease are sensitive and highly reproducible, they cannot be performed in rural, low infrastructure environments, where this disease prevails. In this sense, the use of simple and portable analytical devices may be able to offer an affordable solution to this problem, allowing fast sampling, diagnosis and treatment prescription in one simple and fast intervention, as the performed by short term medical missions. In this study we show for the first time a diagnosis test comprising low cost materials and employing a contactless and label-free conductivity detection system that is used to read the result of a nucleic acid amplification reaction. The test showed high sensitivity for Chagas Disease diagnosis showing the potential to be used in rural and low income places.
