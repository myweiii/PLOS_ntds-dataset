In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) for rabies virus (RABV) isolates from seven samples, five of which were of stray dogs, and the other two were from foxes. Specimens were collected from animals across Jordan, including Balqa, Amman, Irbid, Tafilah, and Madaba governorates. Six out of the seven isolates were belonging to the Cosmopolitan ME2 clade, which related to the Iranian and Turkish sequences. This is not the case previously, where the majority of the Jordanian isolates belong to Cosmopolitan ME1a clade and closely related to the sequences from Israel. This shift might be due to the applied regulations across borders between Jordan and Israel. Besides the growth in travel and trade movement between Jordan and Turkey, where the latter is a border country with Iran. These collected data, where such studies are not common in the Middle East countries, will enhance our understanding of the RABV evolution and epidemiology in the region for rapid and effective response for rabies virus outbreaks.
