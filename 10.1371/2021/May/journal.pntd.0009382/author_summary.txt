People affected by Hansen disease that have many skin patches or lumps receive twelve-dose multibacillary multidrug therapy. After the fixed-dose regime, they are released from treatment and are considered cured. However, some of these people may have a recurrence of skin lesions or peripheral nerve problems after several years. Clinicians, scientists, and the World Health Organization are concerned about this problem, known as relapse, which seems to be increasing in countries where Hansen disease is common, especially in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. It is important to demonstrate regular proof that the therapy remains effective to treat people affected by Hansen disease. In this study, we showed that the recurrence of signs and symptoms of Hansen disease after the twelve-dose multibacillary treatment is rare. These findings are good evidence of the success of the current multibacillary scheme.
