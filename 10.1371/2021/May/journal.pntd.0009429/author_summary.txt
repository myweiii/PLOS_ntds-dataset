Leishmaniasis is an important health problem in Latin American countries and worldwide. In some places, notification is limited and underreported hindering correct assessment of existing data. In Brazil, ATL is mainly caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. It is transmitted by sand fly vectors Nyssomyia whitmani and Nyssomyia intermedia. ATL comprises different clinical manifestations including cutaneous leishmaniasis, muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis and atypical leishmaniasis. The objective is to present the spatial distribution of cases of ATL notified by the Public Health System of Caratinga between the period of 2007 and 2018. This city is one of the most important endemic areas in the State of Minas Gerais and compose the panel of knowledge on epidemiological aspects of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis. This information will be important for developing strategies for ATL control in the affected areas. There is strong evidence that supports ATL urbanization in the city of Caratinga and increase of cases in two rural districts (Sapucaia and Patroc√≠nio de Caratinga).
