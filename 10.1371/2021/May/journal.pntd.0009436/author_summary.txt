Although leprosy remains a public health problem in many parts of the world, several countries have successfully controlled the Mycobacterium leprae transmission over recent decades and the case characteristics have been shown to change during periods of declining incidence. However, the potential for certain groups of individuals, such as untreated or relapsed leprosy patients with more severe forms of the disease, to act as sources of ongoing transmission remains unclear. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate leprosy case characteristics in low endemic settings, to identify possible sources of transmission and to describe the different control measures implemented. Together with socioeconomic improvement over time, the main strategies shared by many of the countries who achieved a substantial reduction in incidence over recent decades included BCG vaccination, active case finding, adherence to MDT and continued surveillance following treatment. By collecting information on cases in these settings, we found that the number of new cases reported remained low with no indication of a rise in new secondary cases, despite a high proportion of multibacillary disease and the presence of persistent cases of suspected relapse. This evidence suggests that such cases do not represent a large ongoing source of human-to-human transmission.
