    "Abstract": "Species usually develop reproductive isolation mechanisms allowing them to avoid interbreeding. These preventive barriers can act before reproduction, \u201cpre-zygotic barriers\u201d, or after reproduction, \u201cpost-zygotic barriers\u201d. Pre-zygotic barriers prevent unfavourable mating, while post-zygotic barriers determine the viability and selective success of the hybrid offspring. Hybridization in parasites and the underlying reproductive isolation mechanisms maintaining their genetic integrity have been overlooked. Using an integrated approach this work aims to quantify the relative importance of pre-zygotic barriers in Schistosoma haematobium x S. bovis crosses. These two co-endemic species cause schistosomiasis, one of the major debilitating parasitic diseases worldwide, and can hybridize naturally. Using mate choice experiments we first tested if a specific mate recognition system exists between both species. Second, using RNA-sequencing we analysed differential gene expression between homo- and hetero-specific pairing in male and female adult parasites. We show that homo- and hetero-specific pairing occurs randomly between these two species, and few genes in both sexes are affected by hetero-specific pairing. This suggests that i) mate choice is not a reproductive isolating factor, and that ii) no pre-zygotic barrier except spatial isolation \u201cby the final vertebrate host\u201d seems to limit interbreeding between these two species. Interestingly, among the few genes affected by the pairing status of the worms, some can be related to pathways affected during male and female interactions and may also present interesting candidates for species isolation mechanisms and hybridization in schistosome parasites."
