Melioidosis is caused by a soil dwelling bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is a potentially fatal disease even if appropriate antibiotics are given. The disease was first described in Rangoon (now Yangon) in 1911 but it has rarely been reported in Myanmar over the past century even though it is now known to be a common cause of community-acquired infection in neighbouring countries in South and Southeast Asia. The true melioidosis burden in Myanmar is obscured by a lack of awareness among clinicians and limited diagnostic facilities to identify the causative organism. To explore this issue, we conducted a nationwide study to assess the presence of B. pseudomallei in soil samples collected from all fifteen states and regions of Myanmar. Our study revealed a widespread distribution of the organism in the Myanmar environment. This finding contributes to the understanding of the global distribution of B. pseudomallei and should alert clinicians throughout Myanmar to consider melioidosis as a potential cause of fever, sepsis, pneumonia and abscesses.
