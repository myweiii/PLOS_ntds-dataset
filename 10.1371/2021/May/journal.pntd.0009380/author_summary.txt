In this study, we utilised data collected from a previous study that investigated schistosomiasis among primary school children in four regions (NBR, LRR, CRR and URR) of The Gambia, to assess the prevalence and risk factors of the disease. Our analysis revealed that urinary schistosomiasis was the most prevalent (10.2%) form of the disease and intestinal schistosomiasis was very rare (0.3%) among the school children. Urinary schistosomiasis was found in all study regions except NBR. CRR had the highest prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis and all the schools sampled in the region had at least on student with the infection. Fifty percent of schools in URR had urinary schistosomiasis infection and just one school in LRR had the infection. Presence of blood in urine was a good indicator of urinary schistosomiasis. While being male increases the chance of getting urinary schistosomiasis, playing, bathing and swimming in water bodies unexpedly turned out to pose less risk for infection, indicating the true water contact activities of the children were probably underrepresented in the data. The study provides vital information for the schistosomiasis control efforts of The Gambia. Further studies are required to know the real status of intestinal schistosomiasis in the country.
