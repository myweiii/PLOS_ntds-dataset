Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease of poverty currently estimated to infect over 220 million people. It is caused by parasitic worms (blood flukes) that live for, on average, 5â€“7 years inside the blood vessels of infected hosts and produce hundreds of eggs daily. Whether egg production is regulated in a density-dependent manner, and if so under what conditions, has been controversial for schistosomiasis, and investigation is hampered due to the inaccessible location of adult worms. Resolving this fundamental question is important because density dependencies determine the resilience of helminthiases to interventions. Here, we have revisited this longstanding and unresolved question of density-dependent fecundity in human schistosomes using a novel statistical modelling approach that combines information from molecular and parasitological data. We report the first clear evidence of density-dependent fecundity in S. haematobium, the causative agent of millions of cases of urogenital schistosomiasis. Our findings are of critical importance both to mathematical modellers predicting the impact of interventions and to public health policy makers striving to meet the 2030 elimination targets for schistosomiasis. This study also serves to illustrate a new biostatistical approach that could be applied to investigate density dependencies in other helminthiases where adult parasites are inaccessible.
