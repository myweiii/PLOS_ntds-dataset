Effective strategies to control and eliminate canine rabies (and thus dog-transmitted human rabies) are uninterrupted mass dog vaccination campaigns and surveillance for rabid dogs. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these vital control activities have been diminished or suspended due to restrictions implemented to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and redirection of funds. Almost a year after Peru’s response to COVID-19 began, canine rabies cases in Arequipa, a city with ongoing rabies virus transmission, are increasing rapidly. In recent months, reported canine rabies cases have surpassed previous years’ averages despite lower than average sample submissions. A mathematical model describes the mechanisms that might have created this rising trend: COVID-19-associated disruptions of mass dog vaccination campaigns and surveillance activities. As the COVID-19 pandemic is presenting obstacles to rabies elimination programs across Latin America, it is very likely that the region will face an increased canine rabies burden in the coming months to years if control efforts continue to be delayed, diminished, or suspended.
