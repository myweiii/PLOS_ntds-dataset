Schistosomiasis is one of the most important tropical diseases that yearly causes millions of morbidities and mortalities. Several researchers are interested in trying variable chemical and herbal drugs for treating the disease. This research introduced a trial for prophylaxis and treating schistosomiasis mansoni in mice using ginger-derived nanoparticles (GNPs). GNPs have antischistosmal, antioxidant and hepatoprotective features. The nano-formulation of ginger provides a safer therapeutic and restorative enhancer to etiological treatments. GNPs may reduce infection complications, reduce required therapeutic doses of Schistosoma-standard drugs, and may help mitigate the side effects of and resistance to standard drugs; hypotheses which require further studies.
