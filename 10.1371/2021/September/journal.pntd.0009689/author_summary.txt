Chagas disease is a chronic infection with Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) that affects approximately 8 million people worldwide and may cause chronic heart inflammation. The vaccine candidate Tc24-C4 is a recombinant version of the Tc24 protein, which is a flagellar calcium-binding protein expressed by T. cruzi. While animal challenge studies have shown that targeting Tc24 is very promising, it is not fully understood how Tc24 is presented to the immune system. Here, we were able to localize Tc24 in flagellated T. cruzi parasites using a novel Tc24-specific monoclonal antibody. The results showed that Tc24 is not exposed on the outside of the parasite, which suggests that antibodies against Tc24 could not bind parasites during the infection. Then, by analyzing Tc24 expression in T. cruziâ€”infected host cells over time, we observed that Tc24 expression is reduced after the parasite enters the cells but is restored when parasites escape the host cell again. Our study provides more insights on the location and presence of Tc24 in T. cruzi during infection in the host, and we discuss our current understanding on the mechanisms of how the Tc24 vaccine may work.
