Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. If left untreated, it could lead to deformity and resultant disabilities. The number of new cases has remained stagnant for the past decade. Additional interventions are required tailored to the level of endemicity and burden of an area. Currently, measuring and classifying endemicity and burden in leprosy lacks a standardized uniform approach, making program planning and evaluation difficult. We did a systematic literature search and Delphi survey, a method to elicit (group) opinion from a panel of experts, to take an inventory of indicators, classification levels and cut-offs that were used to measure and classify endemicity and burden of leprosy. This study highlights the variation in usage of indicators, levels, and cut-off values to determine the endemicity and burden of leprosy across regions and countries. There was agreement that endemicity and burden should be measured separately using multiple indicators, and that the classification levels ‘high’ and ‘low’ were most important. Our findings contribute to establishing a standardized uniform approach to measure and classify leprosy endemicity and burden at (sub)national level, which would allow effective communication and planning of intervention strategies.
