Blastocystis is a genus of microscopic parasites able to infect the human colon. Whether it plays a role in disease has been a topic of debate in the scientific community since its discovery. Some evidence links infection with the parasite to an increase in biodiversity in gut bacteria, which is associated improvements in health. Other evidence links Blastocystis to symptoms of the common gut disease irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. This study shows that Blastocystis interacts with the amino acid tryptophan in an unexpected manner, which may shed light how it might cause disease. We show that it uses an enzyme known as tryptophanase in reverseâ€“in other organisms, tryptophanase converts tryptophan into another molecule known as indole, while Blastocystis converts indole to tryptophan. Cells in the gut called enterochromaffin cells convert tryptophan into the neurotransmitter serotonin. This molecule can influence the behaviour of the gut, and has been linked to symptoms of IBS. We believe that, under some circumstances, an infection with Blastocystis may cause an increase in tryptophan in the gut, which is then converted to serotonin. The excess serotonin would then cause symptoms of the disease.
