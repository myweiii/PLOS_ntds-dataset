    "Abstract": "Intestinal schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, causing morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. Despite the frequent implementation of mass drug administration with praziquantel, the reinfection with Schistosoma mansoni is still common in Yemen. In addition, there is a scarcity of information on the impact of S. mansoni on nutritional status and anemia among schoolchildren. The present study aimed to determine prevalence and risk factors of intestinal schistosomiasis and investigate its impact on nutritional status and anemia among schoolchildren in Sana\u2019a Governorate, Yemen. It was conducted in 2018 on 445 schoolchildren aged 5\u201315 years. Biodata, socio-economic, demographic, behavioral and environmental data were collected using a standard questionnaire. S. mansoni was identified and quantified by microscopic examination of Kato-Katz fecal smear. Hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric measurements were estimated using standard methods. The prevalence of S. mansoni was higher in Al-Haimah Al-Dakheliah (33.9%) than Bani Mater (1.4%). Household without tap water (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.9, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.12, 7.55, P = 0.028) was the independent risk factor of the infection. The prevalence of wasting and stunting was 25.0% (95%CI: 21.2%, 29.2%) and 45.8% (95%CI: 41.2%, 50.5%), respectively. The prevalence of underweight among schoolchildren aged 5\u201310 years was 27.3% (95%CI: 21.9%, 33.4%). The prevalence of anemia was 31.7% (95%CI: 27.5%, 36.2%) with 0.5%, 21.1% and 10.1% being severe, moderate and mild anemia, respectively. S. mansoni (AOR = 4.1, 95%CI: 2.16, 7.84, P < 0.001) and early adolescence (AOR = 6.8, 95%CI: 4.26, 10.82, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of stunting among schoolchildren. The early adolescent schoolchildren (AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.86, 4.97, P < 0.001) and children from families with low (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.01, 4.15, P = 0.046) or moderate wealth (AOR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.11, 4.77, P = 0.026) were significantly more wasted."
