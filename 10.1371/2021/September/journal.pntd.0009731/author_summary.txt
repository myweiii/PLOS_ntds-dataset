There is a high incidence of snakebite in the rural areas of Eswatini and victims often seek traditional remedies or visit traditional healers as the first treatment step. This can cause a delay in the administration of antivenom needed for serious bites, leading to traditional healers often being held responsible for tissue damage, amputation or even death. Interviews with different rural community groups were conducted to investigate why people would initially choose the traditional rather than the conventional treatment route to treat snakebite. No gender bias was found and results indicated that powerful beliefs are the main reason, enhanced by myths and superstitions which suggest snakes are of supernatural origin. They are also regularly used in witchcraft and any snake related illness is believed to require supernatural healing. Such strong beliefs are consistent throughout Eswatini illustrated by the black mamba being considered the deadliest species even in areas where it is rarely seen. Logistical issues such as transport, cost and inadequate healthcare facilities together with poor education further contribute to the choice of a traditional treatment route. Snakebite management could be aided by improvements in these areas and as healers are both respected and accessible, collaboration and integration between the two treatment systems would further improve the outcome of victims.
