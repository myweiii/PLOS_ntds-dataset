Envenomation by snakebites is a major burden to tropical and subtropical areas in the world. Many snake species produce venoms that, when injected into victims, cause bleedings and other associated symptoms and signs. This work aimed to understand the mechanisms that lead to a fall in blood platelet counts after bites by a snake that inhabits in southeastern Brazil, the lance-headed snake Bothrops jararaca (popularly known as jararaca). We used experimental approaches to understand the involvement of a protein from jararaca venom, called botrocetin, and a protein present in our blood (von Willebrand factor) in the fall of platelet counts. We observed that botrocetin alters von Willebrand factor, but this mechanism in not important for the decrease in platelet counts. We show that jararaca snake venom disturb blood platelets in a complex and intricate way, and that other venom compounds are involved in the decrease of platelet counts during snakebite envenomation.
