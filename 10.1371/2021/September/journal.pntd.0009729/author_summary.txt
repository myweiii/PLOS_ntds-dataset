In the vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease, approximately 150 species of triatomine bugs are potential vectors for the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. A competent vector must fulfill several features such as the ability to host, amplify, and differentiate the parasite, allowing T. cruzi persistence within the insect vector. Our aim was to describe the dynamics of T. cruzi infection in a competent triatomine species collected in two contrasting seasons—with different environmental temperatures—of 2017 and 2018. We used a follow-up procedure including T. cruzi detection right after collection and 40 days later; both detections were performed after laboratory feeding. Most infected bugs were T. cruzi positive on both occasions. However, infected bugs from winter 2018 presented switches from T. cruzi negative at collection to T. cruzi positive 40 days later. The results suggest infections with T. cruzi attached to the hindgut wall as the colonization site, caused by infections that persist there after a fasting event, are released after a second feeding.
