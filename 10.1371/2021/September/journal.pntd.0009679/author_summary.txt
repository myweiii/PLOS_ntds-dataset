We describe how information collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) can be combined with data from other sources to understand risk factors for dengue during an epidemic that occurred in a small town in Ecuador. The sources we used included data from the Ministry of Health, from entomological surveys, and from community surveillance and questionnaires. We found that people of Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicity were at higher risk for dengue during the outbreak than people of Indigenous ethnicity. This seemed to be because Afro-Ecuadorian households had more nearby vegetation and lived closer to a football field, which may have been a key site for transmission.
