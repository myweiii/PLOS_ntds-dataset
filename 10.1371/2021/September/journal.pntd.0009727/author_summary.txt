Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and can result in blindness if left untreated. The World Health Organisation devised the SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial Cleanliness and Environmental Improvements) to combat this disease. In Tanzania, many trachoma control interventions are implemented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The disease still persists in areas with marginalised, including Maasai, despite repeated interventions. These communities are often difficult to reach due to their livelihoods and local beliefs. This study investigates the facilitators and barriers to implementing interventions within hard to reach communities from the perspectives of NGOs. Findings will provide insight on how NGOs implement and ensure their programmes are effective, whilst being mindful of the intrinsic factors important to the community, which will inform improvements and alterations in trachoma interventions.
