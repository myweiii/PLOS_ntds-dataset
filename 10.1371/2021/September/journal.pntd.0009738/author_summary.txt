Most researchers who study protist parasites work with an extremely limited number of laboratory-adapted isolates that were obtained from the field decades ago. For example, the vast majority of studies of Trypanosoma brucei biology have concentrated on just two strains, Lister 427 and EATRO1125, which were taken from the field over half a century ago and have since have undergone innumerable passages in rodents and culture. The effects of this laboratory maintenance have been little studied. We here describe two new Trypanosoma brucei brucei strains. MAK65 and MAK98, which have undergone only 3 rodent passages since isolation from Ugandan cattle. We found that adaptation of the parasites to culture was accompanied by changes in gene copy numbers. T. brucei has so far been considered to be uniformly diploid, but we also found trisomy of chromosome 5 not only in one Lister 427 culture, but also in the MAK98 field isolate. Trisomy of chromosome 6, and increased copies of other chromosome segments, were also seen in established cultured lines. The two new T. brucei strains should be useful to researchers interested in trypanosome differentiation and pathogenicity.
