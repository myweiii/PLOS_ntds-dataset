Pain has been shown to be a significant problem for leprosy patients and may be of nociceptive origin due to tissue inflammation, which occurs during reactional episodes mediated by the immune system, or neuropathic due to leprosy affecting the somatosensory system. It is important to differentiate neuropathic pain from chronic neuritis pain because the clinical implications and treatment are different. Multidrug therapy does not seem to prevent the occurrence of neuropathic pain, which is associated with low indices of quality of life and the general state of health. Infrared thermography is a complementary imaging test that is still growing and can be used in monitoring and determining the prognosis of patients in the health area. The thermographic examination records the abnormal thermal distribution and temperature differences in circulation alterations, which are not noticeable in the subjective evaluation of pain. We believe that the use of thermography as a complementary exam in the study of pain in leprosy neuropathy can assist in the definition of conduct protocols, which will enable the tracking and referral of patients to specific sectors in specialized health units, thereby changing the direction of the disease.
