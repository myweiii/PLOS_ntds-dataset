Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis remains a challenge since the drugs used are quite toxic. Currently, there is a global effort to reduce the morbidity associated with the treatment of this disease and life-threatening complications due to drugs or treatment approaches. Meglumine antimoniate (MA) in different regimens was evaluated in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Effectiveness and toxicity were compared among the groups: standard regimen (SR) [intramuscular (IM) MA in the dosage of 10 to 20 mg of pentavalent antimony (Sb5+)/kg/day]; alternative regimen (AR) [IM MA in the dosage of 5 mg Sb5+/kg/day]; and intralesional route (IL) [patients treated with MA through the infiltration of the lesion]. AR and IL regimens demonstrated good effectiveness, with reduced abandonment rate and toxicity. Total adverse events were higher in the SR group, which frequently led to treatment interruptions. AR and IL showed less toxicity especially in CL cases with comorbidities, although SR treatment was more effective than AR and IL regimens. IL was an effective and safe treatment and may be used as a first therapy option as well as a rescue scheme.
