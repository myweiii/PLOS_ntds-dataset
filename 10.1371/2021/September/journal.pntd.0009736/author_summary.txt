Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira bacteria. The main reservoir hosts of Leptospira are the brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are chronically colonized in the kidneys. Leptospires form biofilms, which are communities of microorganisms embedded in an extracellular polysaccharidic matrix. Leptospira pathogenesis in reservoir hosts is poorly understood. We captured 87 brown rats from an impoverished urban community that is endemic for leptospirosis. To investigate the biofilm in the rats’ kidneys, we co-localized leptospires and saccharides of the biofilm extracellular matrix in the renal tubules, using immunohistochemistry anti-Leptospira and carbohydrate staining, respectively. We quantified Leptospira using molecular tools and characterized the biofilm using electron microscopy. We analysed demographic data to identify variables correlated with renal carriage. We found that Leptospira infected 78 rats. From those, 65 were positive for immunohistochemistry in the kidneys and 24 (37%) were biofilm-positive. We found significant positive correlation between the intensity of colonization and the presence of biofilm in the kidneys. The intensity of colonization was also associated with the rats’ gender and age. Biofilm formation by Leptospira in the kidneys of natural reservoir rats fills a gap into the knowledge of leptospirosis pathogenesis.
