Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by Brucella spp., which compromises to organs and systems, causing non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, sweating, fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia. Similarly, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may also have the above non-specific symptoms. It is precisely because of the non-specificity and similarity of symptoms that brucellosis patients were easily misdiagnosed and failed to receive timely treatment, resulting in neurosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, endocarditis and other adverse outcomes. However, rheumatoid factor (RF) is an essential indicator of RA, and the RF in brucellosis patients is significantly higher than healthy people. In order to strengthen the recognition of physicians for brucellosis patients with RF positivity, we conducted this research and found that the prevalence of positive RF in brucellosis patients with arthralgia was common and critical. Elderly men brucellosis patients with arthralgia, wrist joint pain and elevated CRP were at high risk of positive RF. It is reminded that physicians should pay attention to the possibility of brucellosis during clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially in brucellosis-endemic regions, which had certain clinical significance.
