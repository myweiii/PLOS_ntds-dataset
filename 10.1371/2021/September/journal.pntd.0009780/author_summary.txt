Despite the scale-up of surgical services to eliminate blinding trachoma, the current surgical activity is not effectively tackling the backlog. There are limited studies done previously that explore barriers on implementation of trachomatous trichiasis surgery in Ethiopia. Therefore, understanding barriers is fundamental for instituting measures to increase surgical uptake. Hence, reliable population-based data on barriers towards trichiasis surgery implementation is very crucial for planning effective trachoma control programs, for the country like Ethiopia where trachoma ranks the first in the list of high burden countries. Our finding showed that post-surgical trichiasis, lack of commitment from government officials and negative perception of patients towards the disease were considered as the reported barriers for implementation of trachomatous trichiasis. Closely supervising the integrated eye care workers would be the first task for district health offices to increase the uptake and improve the quality of service. Logistics and supplies should be made available and adequate to address all affected people in the community.
