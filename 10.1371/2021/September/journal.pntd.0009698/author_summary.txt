Mosquitoes represent a nuisance as well as public health risk due to their ability to transmit pathogens to humans. The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive species nowadays established in all Mediterranean countries, reaching highest abundance in Italy. Innovative control approaches have been proposed to complement conventional ones and to increase the success of the fight against this aggressive day-biting species, but still need to be validated in the field. Small islands are ideal places for these validation experiments as they are naturally protected by the spill over of mosquitoes from neighbouring untreated areas. The island of Procida, in the gulf of Naples (Italy), has the right ecological characteristics (e.g., homogeneous landscape and high densities of human and Ae. albopictus populations) to represent an ideal experimental site. In collaboration with the Municipality and the residents we obtained relevant data on the mosquito distribution and seasonality on the island and performed preliminary experiments, creating an instrumental baseline information which will facilitate the effective testing of novel control schemes.
