Leishmania infantum is the major agent of canine and human leishmaniasis being endemic throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Italy. The protozoan is transmitted through the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies mainly represented by the species Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi as proven vectors in Italy. The sand fly fauna in this country includes, among others Sergentomyia minuta, considered herpetophilic vectors of Leishmania tarentolae. This species non-pathogenic to mammalians has recently been detected in human blood donors and in sheltered dogs. Our data demonstrate the occurrence of both L. infantum and L. tarentolae in humans and animal population living in leishmaniasis endemic area opening new perspectives into the study of this human disease. Therefore, the ecology of L. tarentolae highlights the need of a more comprehensive study on the spread of this parasite and on its potential beneficial role in public health through a cross-protection that could occur against pathogenic Leishmania spp. when L. tarentolae occurs in sympatry.
