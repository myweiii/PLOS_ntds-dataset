Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) causes an early systemic and a late encephalitic infection characterized by sleep alterations. In rodent models, brain invasion by T.b. brucei (T.b.b.) is strictly dependent on T cells. However, an in-depth characterization of T cell functions and phenotypes in the outcome of T.b.b. infection is still lacking.
Here we found that during the early stage of infection of mice, most brain T cells differentiated into memory cells, and acquired a tissue-resident memory phenotype during the encephalitic stage. CD4 and CD8 T cells were redundant for the invasion of other T cells and parasites into the brain. Early after infection T.b.b. and leukocytes invade different circumventricular organs (brain areas that lack a blood-brain barrier) including the median eminence (ME) located close to sleep-regulating arcuate nucleus (Arc). T.b.b. infection induced the expression of immune and metabolic molecules in this area. Lymphocytes modulated 1) the levels of invading parasites and leukocytes in the ME; 2) the structure of the blood/ hypothalamus interphase and 3) the expression of IFN-Î³ in the ME/Arc early after infection. Lymphocytes may also be involved in the regulation of sleep alterations observed in African trypanosomiasis.
