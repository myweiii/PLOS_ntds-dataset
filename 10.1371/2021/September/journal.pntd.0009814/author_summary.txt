African trypanosomes are relevant pathogens and a cause of great morbidity and economic burden in endemic countries. Anemia during infection by African Trypanosomes is one of the most common pathologies associated with the disease, but the mechanisms leading to it are poorly understood. Here, we report evidence of autoimmunity, particularly autoantibodies against the lipid phosphatidylserine that are secreted by autoimmune/atypical B-cells, in Trypanosoma brucei infected mice and that are also found in Human African Trypanosomiasis patients and correlate with levels of anemia. These findings point to a relation between autoimmunity and anemia during infection with African Trypanosomes, possibly through the secretion of autoantibodies against phosphatidylserine.
