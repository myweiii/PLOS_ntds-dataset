Giardia lamblia causes the most common enteric disease called Giardiasis worldwide in humans and animals. Giardia is an intriguing model organism to study molecular evolutionary processes owing to its peculiar position, at the transition of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Previous studies from our lab have shown a unique mode of expression of the Hsp90 gene, which is fragmented into two halves and remotely spaced in the Giardia genome. We showed that pre-mRNAs arising from the distant genes undergo molecular stitching by trans-splicing to generate the mature message. This process of molecular stitching of Hsp90 at the RNA level is unique to Giardia and is ill explored. The current study sheds light on the mechanisms of this molecular jugglery unique to this neglected parasite. In this study, we describe the role of nuclear architecture in bringing the fragmented genes, which are otherwise far apart, in close proximity to facilitate their molecular stitching. In addition, we highlight the role of protein factors in orchestrating this molecular feat. Our results point to the unique mechanism(s) which can serve as potential targets to develop specific treatments against this important pathogen.
