Progress is being made to eliminate schistosomiasis, a tropical disease that remains endemic in the tropics and neotropics. In 2020, WHO proposed controlling the snail population as part of a strategy toward reducing schistosomiasis, a vector borne disease, by 2025. The life cycle of the causative parasite is, however, complex and in the absence of vaccines, new drugs, and access to clean water and sanitation, reduction of schistosomiasis will remain elusive. To break the parasite’s life cycle during the snail stage of its development, a better understanding of the molecular basis of how schistosomes survive, or not, in the snail is required. By examining changes in the transcriptome at the host-pathogen interface in the snail Biomphalaria glabrata and Schistosoma mansoni, we showed that early stress response, manifested by the induction of Heat Shock Proteins (Hsps) and the RT domain of the non-LTR retrotransposon, nimbus, were critical for snail susceptibility. Subsequently, juvenile B. glabrata BS-90 snails, resistant to S. mansoni at 25°C were observed to become susceptible by the F2 generation when maintained at 32°C, indicating an epigenetic response. This study confirms these earlier results and shows an interplay between PIWI and nimbus in the anti-schistosome response in the snail host.
