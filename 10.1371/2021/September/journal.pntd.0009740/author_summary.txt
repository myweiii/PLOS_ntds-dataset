The World Health Organization established an advisory group to identify and prioritize diagnostic needs for neglected tropical diseases, and to ultimately describe the minimal and ideal characteristics for new diagnostic tests. To support this advisory group, we developed two generic frameworks, which we applied to soil-transmitted helminthiases: one to explore and determine the required sensitivity (probability to correctly detect a diseased person) and specificity (probability to correctly detect a person free of disease), and another one to determine the corresponding samples size and decision rules during surveys. We showed that specificity rather than sensitivity will become more important when the program approaches the endgame of elimination and that the requirements for both parameters are inversely correlated, resulting in multiple combinations of sensitivity and specificity that allow for reliable decision making. We also highlighted that improving diagnostic performance results in smaller sample sizes for the same level of program decision making. In other words, the additional costs per diagnostic tests with improved diagnostic performance can be compensated by the lower operational costs in the field. Based on our results we proposed to the advisory group the required performance characteristics of diagnostic tests for soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programs.
