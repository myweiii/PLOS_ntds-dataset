Cholera is a severe diarrheal illness which affects millions of people annually. Those most affected reside in developing countries where outbreaks can cause a devastating healthcare crisis. Despite this, much is still unknown regarding the longevity of protective immune responses or how they are generated and maintained. This includes aspects of the mucosal response where immunity is induced, as well as features of the early immune response that could predict long-term immunity. To address these issues, we examined primary humoral immune responses following administration of a live attenuated cholera vaccine to 12 human participants. This study provides insight into the development of humoral immunity and information that may prove valuable for improving cholerae vaccines and treatments.
