Clinical research in difficult-to-study infectious diseases such as Lassa fever is challenging. Only one controlled clinical trial has been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions for Lassa fever (LF). Further research to test new and repurposed therapies is needed and should be supported by a methodological framework in which clinical trials can be consistently conducted for LF. To establish a basis for a standardised clinical trial methodology, we carried out a systematic review to identify the clinical characteristics and outcomes of LF and describe how LF has historically been defined and assessed in the scientific literature. Our data corroborates the current characterisation of LF, and also highlights a broader range of other general symptoms that characterise the onset of LF, such as gastrointestinal illness and other nervous system and musculoskeletal disorders that are not commonly included as indicators of LF. These findings, however, should be tempered by the lack of systematic assessment and reporting of presenting signs and symptoms, their evolution following treatment, and outcomes at discharge in the historic literature. It is therefore evident that a standardised set of data variables and outcome measures should be developed and incorporated into future trials and reported to accelerate collective knowledge.
