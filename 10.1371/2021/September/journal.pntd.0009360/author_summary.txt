Criminally falsified or poorly manufactured medicines can lead to patients becoming sicker and losing trust in the health system. Portable tools beyond just documentation checks and visual inspection (the current practices in many low- and middle-income countries) can help pharmacy inspectors with early detection of poor quality medicines. Currently, many tools are available to detect poor quality medicines, but their performances have not been properly assessed and compared. In this study, 12 different devices ranging from disposable single use tests to portable spectrometers were tested in a laboratory. All the tested devices could identify medicines that contained none or the wrong active ingredient(s), a common trait of falsified medicines. Disposable tests required few resources to be implemented, but had difficulties identifying medicines with reduced amounts of active ingredients. Spectrometers used ‘out-of-the-box’ required minimal consumables had varying degrees of success at detecting medicines with reduced amounts of active ingredients. Finally, instruments with more quantitative abilities, such as benchtop simple chromatographs or mass spectrometers, offered the best sensitivity for detecting medicines with reduced amounts of active ingredients, but required the most resources and training and were deemed to be more suitable for centralized testing.
