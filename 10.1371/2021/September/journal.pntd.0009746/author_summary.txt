Aedes aegypti is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. In the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, the suppression of mosquito populations using insecticides commonly has been implemented by public health programs. Unfortunately, few insecticides are available to target adult mosquitoes with outdoor spraying. The mismanagement of insecticides can lead to resistance selection in mosquitoes, affecting our ability to control arboviral diseases. Ideally, screening insecticide susceptibility in local mosquito populations allows public health entities to support insecticide management strategies that will prevent the development of resistance. In this study, we evaluated insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti collected across 26 sites in Tapachula, Mexico. The results reveal the response of populations to its historic use of insecticides. High resistance to pyrethroids, used for 10 years, but not in the previous 5 years, and moderate to high resistance to chlorpyrifos, an insecticide from a different toxicological group and used for the past 5 years, were confirmed. High variation in resistance across Ae. aegypti sites suggests that focal selection plays an important role in the evolution of insecticide resistance in the field. Screening several collections sites within a geographical region provides better evidence to support strategies of insecticide management.
