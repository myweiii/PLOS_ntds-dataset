Bloodstream infections are very common and associated with significant numbers of death and disability around the world. Less is known about the rates, risks and impact of common bloodstream infections in low and middle-income countries. We conducted a large prospective four-year observational study in northeastern Thailand of persons admitted to a tertiary-care hospital with severe infections and analyzed those who had bloodstream infections. The three most common bacteria causing bloodstream infections were Escherichia coli, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the patients were transferred from other hospitals. Overall mortality was 41%. The highest mortality was among those who had B. pseudomallei infection, at 66%, and the lowest mortality was among those who had E. coli infection, at 19%. If appropriate antibiotics were given early, i.e. prior to or during the transfer, this was associated with survival. Our large study was able to identify the types, risk factors and impact of bloodstream infections in a low and middle-income country. These important results highlight the need for the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests and hospital algorithms for early diagnosis to improve care and outcomes of bloodstream infections in low and middle-income countries.
