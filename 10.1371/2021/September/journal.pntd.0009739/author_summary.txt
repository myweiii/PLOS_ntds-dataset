Human African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic infection occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, which is fatal if left untreated. Diagnosis relies on demonstration of trypanosomes, which may occur at such low concentrations that they remain microscopically undetectable. Nucleic acid detection offers an alternative, in particular RNA, which is unstable and a better marker for live organisms than DNA. Trypanosomal SL-RNA detection in blood by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR has hitherto only been tested twice. Although in cerebrospinal fluid, trypanosome presence indicates brain infection, SL-RNA detection has never been attempted. We evaluated sensitivity of SL-RNA detection in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. For each specimen, 2 controls were included: presence of genomic DNA contamination and efficacy of RNA extraction. Sensitivity of SL-RNA detection in blood was higher than of combined blood and lymph microscopy. In cerebrospinal fluid, SL-RNA and trypanosome detection had similar sensitivity. In a few specimens, traces of DNA were amplified. In some cerebrospinal fluids, some RNA was lost during extraction. Performing both internal controls is crucial, to ensure that negative SL-RNA cerebrospinal fluid findings are not due to a failed extraction and, in particular when testing treated patients, to differentiate live parasite RNA from reminiscent DNA.
