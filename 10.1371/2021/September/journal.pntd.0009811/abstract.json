    "Abstract": "Despite recent evidence suggesting that adult trematodes require oxygen for the generation of bioenergy and eggshells, information on the molecular mechanism by which the parasites acquire oxygen remains largely elusive. In this study, the structural and expressional features of globin genes identified in Clonorchis sinensis, a carcinogenic trematode parasite that invades the hypoxic biliary tracts of mammalian hosts, were investigated to gain insight into the molecules that enable oxygen metabolism. The number of globin paralogs substantially differed among parasitic platyhelminths, ranging from one to five genes, and the C. sinensis genome encoded at least five globin genes. The expression of these Clonorchis genes, named CsMb (CsMb1\u2014CsMb3), CsNgb, and CsGbX, according to their preferential similarity patterns toward respective globin subfamilies, exponentially increased in the worms coinciding with their sexual maturation, after being downregulated in early juveniles compared to those in metacercariae. The CsMb1 protein was detected throughout the parenchymal region of adult worms as well as in excretory-secretory products, whereas the other proteins were localized exclusively in the sexual organs and intrauterine eggs. Stimuli generated by exogenous oxygen, nitric oxide (NO), and nitrite as well as co-incubation with human cholangiocytes variously affected globin gene expression in live C. sinensis adults. Together with the specific histological distributions, these hypoxia-induced patterns may suggest that oxygen molecules transported by CsMb1 from host environments are provided to cells in the parenchyma and intrauterine eggs/sex organs of the worms for energy metabolism and/or, more importantly, eggshell formation by CsMb1 and CsMb3, respectively. Other globin homologs are likely to perform non-respiratory functions. Based on the responsive expression profile against nitrosative stress, an oxygenated form of secreted CsMb1 is suggested to play a pivotal role in parasite survival by scavenging NO generated by host immune cells via its NO dioxygenase activity."
