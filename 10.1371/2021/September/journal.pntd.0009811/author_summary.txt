Trematode parasites that invade mammalian tissues have long been believed to produce bioenergy via anaerobic respiration in their definitive hosts. However, recent studies have revealed that these parasites require considerable amounts of oxygen for the generation of hard eggshells during sexual reproduction as well as energy metabolism. Despite these findings, information on the biological mechanisms and relevant molecules responsible for oxygen uptake in the host environment remains largely elusive. Clonorchis sinensis is a carcinogenic trematode parasite that causes clonorchiasis in humans by infecting the bile ducts. Here, we investigated globin genes/proteins in the liver fluke. The genome of C. sinensis encoded at least five globin paralogs (CsMb1, CsMb2, CsMb3, CsNgb, and CsGbX). Temporal expression of these globin genes coincided with the sexual maturation of C. sinensis. Based on the histological localities and induction profiles upon hypoxia, it could be postulated that the oxygen molecules transported by CsMb1 from host environments are provided to cells in the parenchyma and intrauterine eggs/sex organs of the worms by CsMb1 and CsMb3, respectively, for energy metabolism and eggshell formation. Other globin homologs were likely to perform non-respiratory functions. In addition, the oxygenated form of secreted CsMb1 seemed to participate in the scavenging of nitric oxide generated by host immune cells via its nitric oxide dioxygenase activity to increase the survival of the parasite.
