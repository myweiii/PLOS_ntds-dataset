More than 1.5 billion people are infected with parasitic intestinal worms called soil-transmitted helminths. Infection is transmitted by helminth eggs in human feces, which contaminate soil in areas with poor sanitation. Adverse health effects include physical and cognitive impairment in children. A key strategy to control infection is periodic mass drug administration for populations with a high prevalence of disease based on the results of diagnostic testing. The current microscopy method for detecting infection, however, has limited ability to detect disease as the intensity of infection decreases with repeated mass drug administration. To address limitations of current diagnostic methods, we developed a novel technique to diagnose infections, including those at very low levels of intensity, by detecting helminth DNA in stool samples. Our initial studies suggest that the new diagnostic technique reliably detects the presence of intestinal worms, even at low intensities of infection, and may be more useful than currently available diagnostic tools for guiding the use of periodic mass drug administration to eliminate disease in low-resource settings.
