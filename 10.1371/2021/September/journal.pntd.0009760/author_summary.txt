The oocytes of oviparous animals are highly specialized cells committed to the storage of nutrients (yolk) required for the maternally detached embryo development. Most oocytes undergo a massive growth during oogenesis due to their high endocytic activity of yolk macromolecules. In this work, we found that the components of two PI3K complexes are co-transcriptionally regulated, and that one specific PI3K complex (class-III PI3K complex II) is essential for the correct endocytosis and biogenesis of the yolk endocytic organelles. The molecular machinery and regulations that govern the yolk generation are mostly unknown. Thus, these findings are important in the context of general vector’s reproductive biology and for the elaboration of novel strategies for vector’s population control.
