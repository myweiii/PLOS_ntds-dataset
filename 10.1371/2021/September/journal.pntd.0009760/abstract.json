    "Abstract": "In insects the reserve proteins are stored in the oocytes into endocytic-originated vesicles named yolk organelles. VPS38/UVRAG and ATG14 are the variant regulatory subunits of two class-III ATG6/Beclin1 PI3K complexes that regulate the recruitment of the endocytic (complex II) and autophagic (complex I) machineries. In a previous work from our group, we found that the silencing of ATG6/Beclin1 resulted in the formation of yolk-deficient oocytes due to defects in the endocytosis of the yolk proteins. Because ATG6/Beclin1 is present in the two above-described PI3K complexes, we could not identify the contributions of each complex to the yolk defective phenotypes. To address this, here we investigated the role of the variant subunits VPS38/UVRAG (complex II, endocytosis) and ATG14 (complex I, autophagy) in the biogenesis of the yolk organelles in the insect vector of Chagas Disease Rhodnius prolixus. Interestingly, the silencing of both genes phenocopied the silencing of ATG6/Beclin1, generating 1) accumulation of yolk proteins in the hemolymph; 2) white, smaller, and yolk-deficient oocytes; 3) abnormal yolk organelles in the oocyte cortex; and 4) unviable F1 embryos. However, we found that the similar phenotypes were the result of a specific cross-silencing effect among the PI3K subunits where the silencing of VPS38/UVRAG and ATG6/Beclin1 resulted in the specific silencing of each other, whereas the silencing of ATG14 triggered the silencing of all three PI3K components. Because the silencing of VPS38/UVRAG and ATG6/Beclin1 reproduced the yolk-deficiency phenotypes without the cross silencing of ATG14, we concluded that the VPS38/UVRAG PI3K complex II was the major contributor to the previously observed phenotypes in silenced insects."
