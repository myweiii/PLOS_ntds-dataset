    "Background": "Entamoeba infections have major impact on millions of the people worldwide. Entamoeba histolytica has long been accepted as the only pathogenic species. However, recent reports of other Entamoeba spp. in symptomatic cases have raised questions on their pathogenicity.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Total 474 stool samples and 125 liver aspirates from patients with intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations and from community were included. Sewage samples from the hospital and the city were also included. Microscopic examination and molecular detection were performed to detect presence of E. histolytica/ dispar/ moshkovskii/ bangladeshi. The associated demographic and socioeconomic factors were statistically analyzed with the presence of Entamoeba. Microscopy detected Entamoeba spp. in 5.4% stool and 6.4% liver aspirate samples. Through nested multiplex PCR, prevalence of Entamoeba spp. in intestinal and extra-intestinal cases was 6.6% (20/301) and 86.4% (108/125) respectively and in asymptomatic population was 10.5% (13/123). Sewage samples did not show presence of any Entamoeba spp. Uneducated subjects, low economic conditions, untreated drinking water, consumption of raw vegetables and habit of not washing hands before meals were significantly associated with presence of Entamoeba spp.",
    "Conclusions": "E. histolytica still remains the only Entamoeba spp. in invasive extra intestinal infections. E. dispar was detected in both asymptomatic and symptomatic intestinal infections. Routine identification of Entamoeba spp. should incorporate PCR based detection methods."
