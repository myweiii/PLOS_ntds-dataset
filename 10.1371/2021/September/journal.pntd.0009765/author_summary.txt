Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) is a fungal disease caused by two closely related pathogens: Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii. The numbers of Valley fever cases in the US show an upward trend, and possibly many more cases go unrecognized annually. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are needed for the differentiation of C. immitis and C. posadasii. We developed and validated a TaqMan real-time PCR assay that works well for both isolates and primary specimens. The new laboratory test for C. immitis and C. posadasii will likely improve both treatment management and surveillance of coccidioidomycosis.
