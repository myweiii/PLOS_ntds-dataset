Diarrhoeal diseases rank second as cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in low-income countries, yet prospective cohort studies in children with and without diarrhea covering the large variety of diarrhoeal pathogens are limited. While some studies have been conducted among Guinea-Bissauan children, many of them were from the 1990s, when the coverage of the various pathogens was less extensive and the diagnostic methods less sensitive than the modern qPCR methods.
We conducted an observational study with a large cohort and covered concomitantly the various bacterial, viral and parasitic agents, and analyzed their associations with the presence/absence of diarrhoeal symptoms and age groups. Importantly, the assay performed well with dried stool samples and, therefore, appears applicable for epidemiological studies in resource-poor regions.
A pathogen finding was recorded for almost all (98%) children: bacteria in 97%, viruses in 59% and parasites in 51%. Ongoing diarrhoea was associated with findings of enteroninvasive Escherichia coli/Shigella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, astrovirus, norovirus GII and Cryptosporidium. Differences were seen between age groups, infants and young children. The only pathogen associated with severe diarrhoea was enteroninvasive E. coli/Shigella.
