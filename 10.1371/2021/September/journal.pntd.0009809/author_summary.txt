Chagas disease (CD) is a chronic infectious disease caused by the parasite T. cruzi that accounts for a major burden due to its life-lasting morbidity in endemic and non-endemic areas. Globalization facilitated the meeting of CD and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (T. cruzi/HIV co-infection). Patients with this co-infection are at risk of life-threatening CDR. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and mortality rates of patients with T. cruzi/HIV co-infection.
This retrospective multicenter study included 241 patients with co-infection, of those 60 with CDR. Death was more frequent in patients with reactivation and was mainly caused by CDR. Our data showed that co-infection diagnosis is close to the reactivation diagnosis and characterized by poor immune response associated to CDR, higher lethality and more severe forms of CDR (meningoencephalitis). This study emphasizes the prognostic role of CD4+ cells on reactivation and mortality and the need of epidemiological surveillance for co-infection and CDR.
