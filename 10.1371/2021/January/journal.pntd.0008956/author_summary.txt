After elimination, most of the leprosy cases were detected passively, and the epidemiological characteristics of the newly detected leprosy cases had been changed. The proportion of floating population from other provinces in China increased year by year. In 2011, Health Commission of Zhejiang Province developed the planning of reducing harm of leprosy (2011–2020) and implemented leprosy symptom monitoring system in order to strengthen the early detection of leprosy cases. 167 newly detected cases during 2011–2019 were analyzed, whose factors were associated with household registration of other provinces, G2D and delay in diagnosis were explored. Annual proportion of household registration of other provinces showed an increasing trend, from 77.42% in 2011 to 81.82% in 2019, while G2D and delay in diagnosis among newly detected cases showed declining trends, from 22.58%, 40 months in 2011 to 9.09%, 11 months in 2019 respectively. In late phase of leprosy control, some kinds of leprosy control program are still necessary. Control and prevention strategy of floating population based on government commitments would be beneficial to improve early detection of leprosy cases.
