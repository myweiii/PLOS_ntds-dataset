Syphilis is still an endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries and has been resurgent in high-income nations for almost two decades now. In endemic areas, syphilis still causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients, particularly when its causative agent, the bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum is transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. Although there are significant ongoing efforts to identify an effective syphilis vaccine to bring into clinical trials within the decade in the U.S., such efforts are partially hindered by the lack of knowledge on transcriptional regulation of many genes encoding vaccine candidates. Here, we start addressing this knowledge gap for the putative outer membrane protein (OMP) and vaccine candidates TprL, encoded by the tp1031 gene. As we previously reported for other putative OMP-encoding genes of the syphilis agent, tprL transcription level appears to be affected by the length of a homopolymeric sequence of guanosines (Gs) located within the gene promoter. This is a mechanism known as phase variation and often involved in altering the surface antigenic profile of a bacterial pathogen to facilitate immune evasion and/or adaptation to the host milieu.
