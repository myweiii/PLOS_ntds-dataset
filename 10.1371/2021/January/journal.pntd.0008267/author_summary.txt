Human and animal African trypanosomiasis are neglected tropical diseases with potential to spread to new areas. Wild animals are important reservoirs of African trypanosomes and crucial in the emergence and re-emergence of AT. Vertebrate host-vector-parasite interactions are integral to trypanosome transmission. We identified the diversity of tsetse flies and their trypanosomes, endosymbionts, and vertebrate blood-meal hosts to infer potential transmission dynamics. We found that Glossina pallidipes was the major tsetse fly vector and that Trypanosoma vivax was the main trypanosome species circulating in the region. Humans, hippopotamus, and buffalo were the most common blood-meal hosts. Buffalo and hippopotamus blood-meals were identified in trypanosome-positive flies. Feeding of the flies on both humans and wildlife may potentiate the risk of the human trypanosomiasis in this ecology. Additionally, we found that the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius is associated with trypanosome presence in wild tsetse flies. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the interaction of tsetse flies with their endosymbionts and vertebrate blood-meal hosts in the transmission and control of AT.
