Mental health of people affected by leprosy has not been studied much. There is no prevalence data, and the psychological burden of leprosy is unknown, along with factors contributing to it. Estimating and understanding this data is essential to plan interventions and resources to address it. This study was conducted to obtain the prevalence of depression and anxiety in four leprosy endemic states of India. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 was used to screen for depression and anxiety. Study participants were leprosy affected persons who had completed their course of antibiotics from the government and tertiary care hospitals from the study areas. A total of 220 patients were interviewed out of which 33% and 19% were found to be suffering from depression and anxiety, respectively. The factors that contributed to depression and anxiety were women, those with disability and poverty. A person having depression was more prone to anxiety. This study highlights an important issue of the neglected areas of healthcare that need urgent attention. Addressing the mental health of persons affected by leprosy will help in holistic care and wellbeing of people.
