Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread globally in recent years. It is transmitted by female mosquitoes by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The best prevention method is to control mosquito population and avoid being bitten. This study is a telephone survey which examined the knowledge level towards dengue, patterns of mosquito bite and protective behavior among Hong Kong population, and is the first study examining subtropical urban knowledge, mosquito bite patterns and protective measures adoptions against mosquito. In August 2018, 590 Hong Kong residents were interviewed. Results indicated that about 4 out of 5 respondents could identify 1 symptom of dengue and adopt at least 1 mosquito prevention behavior. About 40% respondents claimed they were bitten by mosquitoes in August. The most prevalent places were near grassy area (63.4%), home (42.6%) and transportation waiting spots (39.6%). Younger age, female, living on lower level (6th floor or lower), and near grassy area were associated with self-reported mosquito bite at home. Respondents believing that dengue has a large impact to the society were more likely to adopt protective measures. While respondersâ€™ residential factors affected their adoption of indoor protective measures, other socio-demographic factors affected their outdoor adoption of protection.
