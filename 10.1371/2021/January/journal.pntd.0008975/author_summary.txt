Our study has investigated 63,107 healthy individuals from Wuhan City and other places in China to analyze the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, which was correlated with geographic region, age, sex and the detection time. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively low in WH (1.68%, 186/11,086) and other places of China (0.38%, 53/13,850), but the seroprevalence is significantly higher in Wuhan City than other cities and other places in China. Moreover, the antibody positive rate was higher in regions closer to Wuhan City. The results of binary logistic regression model showed that the higher seroprevalence was observed among older individuals and females had a higher probability of being infected than males.
