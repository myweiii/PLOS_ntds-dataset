Although bovine tuberculosis in humans has been eliminated in developed countries, the disease remains a challenge in many developing countries. Routine laboratory methods used to identify tuberculosis (TB) in high-burden countries do not distinguish between the two main causes of TB in humans, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis. In addition, M. bovis is naturally resistant to one of the first-line drugs used to treat TB called pyrazinamide; therefore, accurate diagnosis of M. bovis is important for proper selection of anti TB drugs. In cattle, surveillance for M. bovis infection is important to obtain data on bovine TB burden and hence provide a basis for the establishment and/or improvement of control programs. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based method was developed to identify M. bovis. This LAMP method detected M. bovis within 40 minutes following incubation at constant temperature (66Â°C) in a battery-powered incubator and results could be read with the naked eye following development of a color change. Our results elaborate a rapid and low-cost LAMP based method for detection and surveillance of M. bovis infection in cattle and humans in resource-limited, endemic areas.
