    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in Brazil during 2013\u20132014 causing an epidemic of previously unknown congenital abnormalities. The frequency of severe congenital abnormalities after maternal ZIKV infection revealed an unexplained geographic variability, especially between the Northeast and the rest of Brazil. Several reasons for this variability have been discussed. Prior immunity against Dengue virus (DENV) affecting ZIKV seems to be the most likely explanation. Here we summarise the current evidence regarding this prominent co-factor to potentially explain the geographic variability."
