Podoconiosis is a disease that causes swelling of the lower legs and tissue lumps (nodules) of the feet. The condition is physically disabling with significant psycho-social impact. It is caused by the destruction of the lymphatic system, that is critical in the transportation of body fluids. The disease is said to be caused by long term barefooted exposure to red-clay soil. Podoconiosis affects more than four million subsistent farmers in the tropics. Ethiopia is one of the endemic countries with more than 1.5 million affected people.
Early-stage podoconiosis morbidity management consists of foot hygiene, regular inspection and care for traumatic abrasions, use of moisturizer, daily exercise, compression with elastic bandages, and last but not least shoe wearing. In the late disease stage, irreversible swelling and woody-hard fibrous nodules arise. As a result, patients can no longer wear shoes and suffer from disabling bacterial infection. Both complications aggravate lymphatic destruction. Moreover, late-stage podoconiosis is unresponsive to the aforementioned therapy options. Surgical intervention removing the nodules (nodulectomy) can potentially alleviate late-stage disease.
Here, we describe the clinical outcome of nodulectomy and its effect on the quality of life in 21 late stage podoconiosis patients, in a before to 12 months after the procedure comparison. We demonstrate that nodulectomy is safe, allows patients to wear shoes again, reduces the number of bacterial infections, and significantly improves their quality of life. Nodulectomy is a safe and effective procedure for podoconiosis patients. We recommend nodulectomy as the preferred therapy option for late-stage podoconiosis complicated by nodules.
