Sand flies are the insect vectors involved in the transmission of many pathogens, however, the transmission of parasites to humans leading to visceral leishmaniasis is currently the most critical threat caused by this insect. Despite the importance of the vector, many aspects of the biology of sand flies are poorly understood, especially their breeding sites. This study was designed to evaluate the oviposition, life span, microbiome, and parasite infections in the main species of sand fly responsible for visceral leishmaniasis in America. Insects were reared on substrates collected from different putative habitats of sand flies in an endemic area for the disease in Brazil. The results showed that female vectors selected an oviposition site depending on the potential offered to their offspring. Furthermore, the development of immature stages varied according to the type of substrate evaluated, with cashew leaves litter delaying larval development, while chicken shelter promoted larval development. The challenge of females emerging from chicken shelter substrate with the parasite indicates that insects reared in such an environment could successfully sustain the infection. These results suggest that the type of breeding site can affect insect biology as well as the epidemiology of the disease.
