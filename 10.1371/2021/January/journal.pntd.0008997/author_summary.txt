Skin-burrowing scabies mites cause pathological changes in the skin. Although these parasites burrow only down to the border between the epidermis and dermis, fibrin thrombi within the dermal vessels are frequently seen in scabies infected skin. Their origin had been unknown. We show by immunohistology that a unique family of mite proteins, the SMIPP-Cs, is found within these fibrin thrombi. We further demonstrate that the SMIPP-Cs promote blood coagulation, change the structure and density of fibrin clots and make them resistant to fibrinolysis.
This may be a novel mechanism by which scabies mites maintain themselves in the microenvironment of the skin. They reside in the lower epidermis close to the dermis to ensure their nutritional requirements are met, and are thereby exposed to the inflammatory and immune responses delivered into the epidermis with the interstitial fluid. To defend themselves from the host immune system the mites release anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and, we propose, hemostasis-modulating novel proteins into their microenvironment. Only the scabies mites have evolved the SMIPP-Cs, which appear to play essential roles in the parasitic lifestyle. SMIPP-Cs may present a novel diagnostic or therapeutic target.
