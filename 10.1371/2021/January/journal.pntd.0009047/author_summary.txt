Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease affecting millions, and a major cause of death of agricultural workers in the tropics. In this research, the authors have developed a simulation model that includes data for agricultural activity across the days and seasons, as well as snake behavioral patterns, and the times and locations humans and snakes meet. Using this model, they predicted observed seasonal snakebite patterns in Sri Lanka, and they successfully showed how these patterns vary between different agricultural activities, including seasonal rice cultivation, and rubber and tea harvests. The findings arising from this study demonstrate that different combinations of human and snake activity, including species and farming practice differences, are likely to generate differences in snakebite patterns across locations. This model could be applied to analyze and predict snakebite in tropical regions around the globe to help mitigate the problem.
