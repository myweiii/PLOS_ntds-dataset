Ticks are well-known pathogen vectors which transmitted virus, bacterial and protozoan. They are considered to be second only to mosquitoes as global vectors of human diseases. Most tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) are transmitted to hosts through tick bites assisted by saliva. Control of ticks has been achieved primarily by the application of acaricides, a method that has drawbacks such as environmental contamination and selection of pesticide-resistant ticks. Understanding the tick physiological characteristics is the key step for this objective; however, there are knowledge gap remained in tick physiology. Tick salivary glands rapidly degenerate and disappear within 4 days post engorgement. In this research, we are focused on tick salivary glands rapidly degeneration within 4 days post engorgement, and made several highlights findings: The first work demonstrated that 20E promotes both autophagy and apoptosis during tick salivary gland degeneration; RhATG5 is the first reported ATG5 homologue in ticks; RhATG5 play an important role in both autophagy and apoptosis during the degeneration of tick salivary glands.
