Parasitic filarial nematodes affect over 100 million individuals in tropical areas where they cause debilitating diseases. Almost all species infecting humans live in mutualism with Wolbachia endosymbionts. The Wolbachia wBm of Brugia malayi, a nematode responsible for human elephantiasis, show a typical localisation in the hypodermis of the adult worms, and in the female germline in order to be vertically transmitted to the next generation through the eggs. Analyses of Wolbachia-depleted filarial nematodes have revealed that these Î±-proteobacteria contribute to the long lifespan of the nematode host. In addition, they clearly support the maintenance of the female germline, indicating a developmental symbiosis between B. malayi and its associated wBm endosymbiont. To understand the mutualism between wBm and the B. malayi host, we performed transcriptomics analyses at an unprecedented tissue-specific resolution, during oogenesis and in the soma, and we characterized the adaptation of wBm to specific cellular environments such as the hypodermis. Additional comparative germline transcriptomic analyses between B. malayi and C. elegans as well as a B. malayi orthology map revealed peculiarities in the filarial oogenesis, likely resulting from evolutionary innovations specific to the parasitic lifestyle.
