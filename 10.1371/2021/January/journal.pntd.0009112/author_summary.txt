Mass drug administration (MDA) is an important tool in the prevention of morbidity caused by various NTDs and in the reduction of their transmission. Due to a variety of social and behavioural reasons, many people will either not be offered or refuse such treatment, and if this behaviour is recurring at an individual level, then control measures may face a challenge in achieving their stated goals. Accurately describing the patterns of individual adherence or non-adherence to MDA control measures for NTDs from data, followed by their use in simulated scenarios is a relatively recent development in the study of NTDs. Past analyses assessing individual adherence have informed the approach we take in this work. However, we have sought to provide a framework which encapsulates as many types of adherence behaviour as possible to facilitate the assessment of impact in mathematical models of parasite transmission and control. Our example application to the TUMIKIA data highlights the importance of such a general framework as we find a dependence on past behaviour that may have been missed in standard statistical analyses.
