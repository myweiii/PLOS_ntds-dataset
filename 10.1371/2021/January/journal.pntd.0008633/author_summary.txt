Zoonotic diseases are increasingly becoming an emerging public health threat, partially due to the risk of spillover events at the human-wildlife interface. This cross -sectional study was carried out among high-risk communities around forest fragments of Hoima District, Uganda, to describe activities that could lead to disease spillover in humans in order to inform public health practitioners of the potential risks at community level for preparedness and response efforts. The study also sought to gain an understanding of the community’s perception of the risk of zoonotic diseases, what activities could expose them to zoonoses, and whether the healthcare services are adequate to identify such diseases at community level. We found that most people were not aware of zoonotic diseases transmissible from wildlife to humans and this can partly be explained by lack of information filtering through to the grass root. It is important to note however, that the interaction between wildlife and humans, is largely driven by communities’ struggle to survive and meet their livelihood needs making it difficult to predict under what circumstances disease could emerge in the community. We need to remind ourselves that all major outbreaks have started at community level and well as the health experts are fast to diagnose the disease in question, some communities are hearing these diseases for the very first time. Quite often these outbreaks are putting the available alternative livelihood in question and demanding for quick unstainable changes that communities are quick to abandon once the outbreaks are over. We recommend that this is the time to invest in health education and create awareness about zoonotic diseases among communities at the human-wildlife interface. Health promotion and or livelihood-based intervention programs should use existing evidence and case studies implemented in collaboration with government agencies and partners.
