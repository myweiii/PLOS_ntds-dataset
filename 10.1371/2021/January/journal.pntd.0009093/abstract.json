    "Background": "Two thiarid snail species, Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera have been reported as first intermediate hosts of the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis; however, their role as true first intermediate hosts has not been verified. Thus, the present study aimed to clarify the suitability of these two snail species as first intermediate hosts of C. sinensis. This was accomplished by collecting snails from a highly endemic area for C. sinensis in Vietnam, the Thac Ba reservoir, and identifying shed cercariae using molecular techniques. We also conducted experimental infections of five snail species including M. tuberculata and T. granifera with eggs of C. sinensis.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A total of 11,985 snails, representing 10 species were sampled. Five snail species, M. tuberculata, T. granifera, Lymnaea swinhoei, Parafossarulus manchouricus, and Bithynia fuchsiana were found shedding cercariae with an overall prevalence of infection ranging from 0.7% to 11.5%. Seven cercarial types were recorded. Cercariae of C. sinensis were only found in Parafossarulus manchouricus. Using a multiplex PCR approach for detecting C. sinensis infection, the prevalence in P. manchouricus was 4.2%. Additionally, all five snail species were experimentally exposed to C. sinensis eggs, however only P. manchouricus was successfully infected with an infection rate of 7.87%.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "We confirmed that in the Thac Ba reservoir, Vietnam, the two thiarids, M. tuberculata and T. granifera are not suitable first intermediate hosts of C. sinensis. Only P. manchouricus was found infected by C. sinensis in nature, and was the only species that became infected experimentally."
