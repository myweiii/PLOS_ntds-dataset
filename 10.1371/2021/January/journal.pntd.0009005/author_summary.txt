We evaluated the efficacy of protecting houses with insecticide-treated nets permanently fixed with aluminium frames on external doors and windows on Ae. aegypti infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Houses protected with screens were â‰ˆ80% less infested with Aedes females and very importantly, had significantly less infected female Ae. aegypti during the peak of the epidemic. Communities strongly accepted the intervention, due to its perceived mode of action, the prevalent risk for Aedes-borne diseases in the area, and the positive feedback from neighbours. House screening provides a simple, affordable sustainable method to reduce human-vector contact inside houses and can protect against dengue, chikungunya and Zika.
