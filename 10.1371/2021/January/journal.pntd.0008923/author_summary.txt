HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus of zoonotic simian origin that has spread globally causing inflammatory and carcinogenic disease. We previously showed that persons with high nonhuman primate (NHP) exposure in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) can be infected with another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), suggesting they are also at risk for infection with STLV-1. We conducted follow-up analysis of the same persons from rural villages of central DRC to determine exposure and transmission risks for STLV-1 and HTLV-1 infection. Most persons, especially women, reported high levels of NHP exposure. We identified possible introduction and spread of STLV-1 from a local monkey species across households, villages, and health zones in DRC. Most persons had HTLV-1 levels above those reported in previous studies for persons with disease. Our findings reveal that coordinated public health strategies are needed at both local and national levels to prevent further spread and morbidity of HTLV-1.
