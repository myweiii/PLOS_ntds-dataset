West Nile virus is a widely spread flavivirus, which is transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes. In humans, the virus can cause West Nile Fever (WNF) and in some cases, it affects the nervous system leading to severe symptoms that may result in death. Human cases have increased in Europe since the large-scale epidemic in 1996, being 2018 the year with the highest number of cases registered to date. We developed risk models based on 2017 cases, and predicted in 2018: 1) the occurrence of the disease; 2) the intensity of the outbreaks; and 3) the imminence of the cases. We identified favorable areas for the incidence of the virus in which environmental and human-related variables had an important role. The outbreaks began in the lower areas of large river basins and spread to higher areas, which highlights the importance of river basins in the propagation of outbreaks. Consequently, the early warning should be based on a basin scale.
