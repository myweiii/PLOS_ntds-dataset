Congenital syphilis (CS) is caused by mother-to child transmission in a setting with poor maternal screening strategies for the infection. Although screening of pregnant women and treatments are simple, inexpensive and widely available, new cases are increasing worldwide. We reviewed the medical records of CS-patients assisted in our hospital over the past 30 years. Our results showed an increase in the number of CS cases. At birth, most children were asymptomatic and later developed CS clinical manifestations. Penicillin treatment, and in one case ceftriaxone, was prescribed with a good clinical and serological response. Nevertheless, one infant died, four had persistent kidney involvement and one showed bone sequelae. Spinal lumbar puncture did not modify therapeutic decisions. We conclude that the detection and treatment of CS, as well as consistent follow-up, remains a great challenge for clinical practice in our region, particularly in underserved patients. Also, we observed that the commonly used diagnostic lumbar puncture had no impact in the management of asymptomatic newborns, and its role in CS should probably be reevaluated.
It is crucial that the health system, and pediatricians and obstetricians in particular, make a greater effort to detect this neglected disease in an attempt to reverse its upwards trend.
