Negligible data are present related to anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) treatment outcome and resultant unresponsiveness risk determinants. The role of demographic, clinical, and environmental risk associated-factors in the development of treatment failure, relapse, and chronic forms of ACL has not been studied. We carried out a case-control study for a period of 4 years (2015â€“2019) using culture media and nested PCR to identify the causative agent. Afterward, we analyzed the data by univariate multinomial and multiple multinomial logistic regression models and the backward elimination stepwise method. Also, we examined skin punch biopsies to study the histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) profile for different comparative groups. The findings identified 8 major risk factors were significantly associated with the creation of unresponsive forms. Clinical practitioners and health surveillance systems should be aware of and monitor such perplexing factors. Awareness of the major determinants for unresponsiveness to the treatment of ACL is critical to improving clinical strategies and public health measures. These multidisciplinary approaches need to address specific barriers that directly affect the treatment outcome.
