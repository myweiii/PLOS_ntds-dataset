In regions where helminth infection is common and sanitation standards are poor, people are at a high risk of exposure to bacterial pathogens. Previous work in animal models has shown that helminth infection can impair host resistance to bacterial infection. The current treatment for helminth infection is the administration of helminth-clearing drugs, yet it is not known whether drug clearance of helminths restores helminth-impaired host resistance to bacterial infection. In this report we use a mouse helminth-Salmonella co-infection model system, where we find that the presence of small intestinal helminths at the point of Salmonella infection aids the establishment of Salmonella in the small intestinal lumen. We show that helminth drug clearance prior to Salmonella infection is sufficient to restore host resistance to Salmonella. However, if helminth drug clearance is delayed until after Salmonella had already established in the small intestinal lumen, helminth elimination does not result in complete clearance of Salmonella from this site. Our work suggests that helminth drug clearance may be beneficial in reducing susceptibility to subsequent intestinal bacterial infections, but that helminth drug clearance after co-infection may not result in clearance of bacterial populations that have firmly established in the intestinal lumen.
