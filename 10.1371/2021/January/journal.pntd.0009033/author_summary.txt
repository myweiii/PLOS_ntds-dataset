Two recent discoveries hold particularly important ramifications for Leishmania transmission. First, parasites are heterogeneously distributed within the skin of an infected host. Second, the discovery of a new lifecycle stage known as the retroleptomonad promastigote changes the within-vector parasite dynamics. It is not yet known how these newly identified factors may interact to influence transmission. In this study, we design a tractable model for parasite population dynamics in the sand fly vector that consolidates these new results into a single system. We first demonstrate that our model can replicate established experimental results. We then interrogate this model, both analytically and numerically, to draw conclusions about Leishmania transmission in an ecological and epidemiological context. We conclude that the relative importance of the two focal factors depends critically on sand fly lifespan. In short-lived sand flies the heterogeneity in the number of parasites initially taken up by a sand fly is typically the crucial factor in Leishmania transmission, whereas for longer-lived sand flies the retroleptomonad lifecycle stage is likely to drive transmission. In a practical context these results suggest that minimising the expected sand fly lifespan could be an effective strategy to reduce Leishmania transmission.
