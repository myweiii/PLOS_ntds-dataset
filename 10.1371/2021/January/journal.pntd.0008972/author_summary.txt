Aedes-borne diseases comprise a serious public health burden in many parts of the world, usually affecting low income areas. The ability to detect virus circulation within a population may be key in responding to the threat of outbreaks, providing a cost-effective approach for triggering vector control. Unfortunately, gaps in the knowledge of natural Aedes-borne virus (ABV) infection in Aedes aegypti have led to uncertainties in the consideration of arbovirus surveillance in mosquitoes. Here, we show that the natural infection rate in a mosquito population may not be a function of where Aedes aegypti are, but rather where key human-mosquito contacts occur. Sampling 200 houses with suspected ABV active transmission led us to quantify high virus infection rates in all Aedes aegypti present in the house and use such information to estimate the sensitivity of indoor aspiration with Prokopack devices and two measures of ABV transmission potential. Our findings provide evidence that the accurate quantification of arbovirus infection rate and transmission risk is a function of the sampling effort, the local abundance of Aedes aegypti and the intensity of arbovirus circulation. Results from this study are relevant to understand the value of virus testing of vector populations, and for the design of entomological endpoints relevant for epidemiological trials quantifying the impact of vector control on ABVs.
