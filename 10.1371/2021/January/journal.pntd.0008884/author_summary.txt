Lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms which affects millions of individuals, represents an important public health concern due to its high morbidity that significantly diminishes quality of life. The parasite is able to establish a chronic infection by manipulating its host’s immune responses. The larval mf stage of the parasite is of particular interest as the parasites are present in the peripheral blood and in constant contact with the host’s immune cells. We decided to investigate the role of mf-derived EVs in the modulation of human antigen presenting cells during infection. We showed that mf release EVs that are similar to exosomes, and these parasite vesicles are readily internalized by human DC. The mf-derived EVs possess a unique miRNA profile and are enriched in miRNAs that can target the mTOR pathway. We have also demonstrated that purified mf-derived EVs are capable of inhibiting mTOR signaling in human monocytes. Collectively, our results suggest that mf release exosome-like vesicles that modulate the immune metabolism of host antigen presenting cells.
