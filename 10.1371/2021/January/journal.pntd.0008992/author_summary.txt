In 2017 an outbreak of Dengue fever (DF) was reported in Kabridahar Town, Ethiopia. This mosquito transmitted disease was recently detected in Ethiopia only four years prior, with this being the first time it was identified in the area. In response, our team was dispatched to confirm the presence of the disease, identify potential causes, and implement mitigation and control measures. We identified and compared suspected cases and suspected non-cases to identify the potential risk factors of infection. Laboratory confirmation of infection and disease-type was also performed. Due to the entomological nature of disease transmission, additional entomological investigations were conducted at the households of both groups to understand its influence at the household level. Through these measures, we were able to establish the presence of DF in Kabridahar Town and identify risk factors leading to infection. Risk factors included a lack of formal education and open water containers near the home, while the presence of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets were found to be protective. Mitigation and control measures were implemented to combat or promote the identified risk and protective factors respectively. Cases counts began to reduce five days after the onset of these measures. Recommendations were made based on our findings to prevent future outbreaks. The last case was recorded ten days after implementation of the mitigation and control measures.
