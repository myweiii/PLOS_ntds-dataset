Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical skin disease, which globally affects an estimated 0.6 to 1 million people. The skin disease is caused by the protozoa Leishmania and is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies in Old World CL (OWCL). In Pakistan, CL is highly endemic, especially in the provinces Balochistan and Khyber Pashtunkwa, where L. tropica is the main causative species. In this context, untreated CL often leads to stigmatisation and severe (psycho)social suffering, due to the disfiguring ulcerating wounds and scars. The mainstay treatment is with pentavalent antimonials, and evidence for efficacy of alternative treatments for L. tropica is lacking. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has specialised treatment centres in Balochistan (Quetta and Kuchlak), where in December 2017 miltefosine was introduced for patients who did not respond to, or had contraindications for antimonials. In this study, we showed favourable outcomes of miltefosine as second-line treatment for these CL patients.
