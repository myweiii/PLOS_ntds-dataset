Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a disease of poverty and disadvantage, is almost completely preventable. It is now extremely rare in wealthy countries, but in Far North Queensland in tropical Australia, the incidence of RHD, RHD-related hospitalisations and RHD-related surgery is continuing to rise, with the burden of disease borne almost entirely by the region’s Indigenous population. While the increasing incidence of RHD and its complications may be partly explained by improvements in local service delivery, the disease remains inextricably linked to socioeconomic disadvantage. In this study, not only were patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas more likely to have RHD, but they were also paradoxically less likely to receive valve surgery. The current local model of care—which is centralised, medical and emphasises disease monitoring and secondary prophylaxis—appears to be having a limited impact on morbidity. Strategies must evolve—in partnership with Indigenous communities—to have a greater focus on disease prevention by addressing the personal, community and environmental factors that increase the risk of the disease. This is likely to not only reduce the incidence of RHD, but will also tend to reduce the burden of the many other diseases that result from socioeconomic disadvantage and that disproportionately affect Indigenous Australians.
