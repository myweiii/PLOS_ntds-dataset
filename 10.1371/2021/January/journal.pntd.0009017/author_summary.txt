Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects nearly 220 million people worldwide. Long-term effects include anaemia, growth stunting, bladder cancer and infertility. Currently, the main approach to schistosomiasis control involves mass preventive chemotherapy treatment. Current guidelines recommend treating 75% of school-aged children but many programmes struggle to achieve this target. This study conducted a comprehensive review of factors conditioning the uptake of treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa across different levels of analysis: individual, interpersonal, organisational, community and policy. This examination showed, first, that the literature suffers of publication bias, with most studies based in rural East African sites and focusing in discussing individual- and policy-level factors. It indicated as well that people’s livelihoods, food security, and school-enrolment, alongside knowledge and attitudinal factors influenced treatment uptake at the individual level. Various contextual factors concerning interpersonal relations, organisations’ resources, and prevalent socio-cultural features (e.g., gender) further shaped people’s responses to MDA campaigns. Finally, it was observed that the effectiveness of programme-level decisions on sensitisation, training, and drug-delivery strategies were constantly re-shaped by mediating factors operating at lower levels of analysis. We conclude that the promotion of context-based transdisciplinary research is essential to design effective strategies to promote sustainable high levels of treatment coverage.
