The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel as the global strategy for morbidity control of schistosomiasis. The guidelines include target groups and treatment frequencies based on prevalence in school-age children. However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion. The Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) put forward a series of cluster-randomized trials in different African countries, including Côte d’Ivoire, to identify the most suitable approach to gain and sustain the control of schistosomiasis. Results from Côte d’Ivoire did not show statistically significant differences between three school-based treatment schedules (i.e., annual treatment over four years; treatment only in the first two years, followed by two years whithout treatment; and treatment every other year without treatment in-between) in reducing prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children aged 9–12 years. The results in first-grade children with an age of 5–8 years entering school who had never received deworming drugs showed no significant difference in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection between the different treatments at the study end, suggesting that the three strategies were not significantly different for reducing the disease transmission in affected communities. However, our data should be combined with other SCORE studies carried out elsewhere in Africa. A meta-analysis including the results of the sister trials could help to conclude and make more generic recommendations.
