Intestinal worms, such as hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura, infect one in five people worldwide. In children, they can cause cognitive and physical impairment. Accurate detection of these infections is important to treat patients and control the spread of intestinal worms. Currently, the Kato-Katz technique is the most commonly used diagnostic method, particularly, in programmatic settings. However, there are still several open questions to be resolved. In this study, we aimed at exploring the effect of storage time, storage temperature, and stirring of stool samples on the number of worm eggs detectable by the Kato-Katz technique. We included 488 stool samples collected from schoolchildren on Pemba Island, United Republic of Tanzania. We found that, at room temperature, hookworm eggs rapidly disappear from Kato-Katz slides, but storing them in a refrigerator preserves eggs for up to 110 minutes. For A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura no relevant trend in fecal egg counts in Kato-Katz slides over time and or influence of storing temperature was detected. However, storing whole stool samples in a refrigerator overnight did not prevent hookworm eggs from disappearing, thus, we recommend analyzing all samples on the day of collection. For A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura fecal egg counts remained stable in whole stool samples over time, regardless of storage temperature. Finally, we found that stirring samples reduced the variation of fecal egg counts for hookworm and T. trichiura, but not for A. lumbricoides. Hookworm fecal egg counts decreased with increasing rounds of sample stirring.
