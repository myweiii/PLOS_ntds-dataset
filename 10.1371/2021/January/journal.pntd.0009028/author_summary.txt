In the last decades, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever, usutu and dengue viruses have (re)-emerged in different parts of the world and many of these outbreaks occur in resource-limited countries with limited or under-equipped health facilities and where endemic malaria with very similar clinical symptoms confounds surveillance. Most arboviruses that circulate today likely originated in Africa where sporadic human outbreaks occur. In this work, we developed a serological tool that allows simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies to multiple arbovirus in a biological sample. With this highly sensitive and specific multiplex assay, we screened more than 3,500 samples collected from 29 species of monkeys and apes in Africa. We found a global IgG antibody prevalence of less than 5%. However, this seroprevalence varied by collection site, NPHs species and virus type. Given these findings, we concluded that African non-human primates are most likely not the reservoirs, but rather are intermediate hosts.
