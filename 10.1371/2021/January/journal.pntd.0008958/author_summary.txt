In this study we summarize the epidemiological trends of the early phase of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Ecuador, the country with the highest excess mortality reported at the beginning of the global health crisis due to COVID-19 worldwide.
We have carried out a complete analysis of the epidemiological trends, clinical features, risk factors associated with death and the main demographic characteristics of the first 9,468 patients. Ecuador has officially reported 474 COVID-19 confirmed deaths, nevertheless, at least 4,780 deaths were reported as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the same period of time, suggesting an important underreporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in the country. In Ecuador, COVID-19 is five times more lethal among unemployed patients compared to white-collar workers, suggesting a strong association between poverty and mortality. This is the first epidemiological report from Ecuador that uses the official reported cases of COVID-19. High altitude dwellers had lower attack and mortality rates than those living in lowlands, possibly due to reduced access to health care services.
