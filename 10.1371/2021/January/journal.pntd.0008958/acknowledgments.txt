The authors thank Rebeca Bravo who was very keen in editing our maps for this publication as well as the staff from the National Direction of Epidemiology for sharing the official database after fulfilling their requirements. We greatly appreciate the work carried out by Dr. Ignacia Paez and her team of Community Mental Health professionals from the Ministry of Public Health, for their role of distributing the self-reporting symptomology tool among the entire cohort of patients who were under constant monitoring from the official epidemiological department of the MoH.
