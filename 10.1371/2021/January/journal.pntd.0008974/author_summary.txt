Yellow fever (YF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever found in tropical South America and Africa that affects both humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Despite a long-standing recognition of YF as a pathogen of significant public health concern, not much is known about why cases are reported in some years and not others, or what drives the strong seasonal trends that are observed in South America.
Using a combination of statistical techniques, the authors have looked at the relationship between different types of land-use, vegetation, climate, human and NHP and the reporting of YF across all of South America and both inter-annual and seasonally over the period 2003â€“2016. The authors have found that both are highly influenced by changes in vegetation, however the inter-annual is additional influenced by land-cover and the seasonal climatic factors.
The authors have found that the differing drivers of seasonal and inter-annual transmission, though both are predominantly shaped by changes in vegetation, highlighting the role of land-cover in influencing the inter-annual and climate the seasonal.
This research enhances our understanding of YF transmission in South America, describing the geographic and temporal distribution of cases in relation to vegetation, land-cover and climate. This research is of particular importance, given the recent large-scale outbreaks of YF across the continent, global YF vaccination shortages and the exportation of cases globally.
