Schistosomiasis remains a serious public health problem worldwide. Accurate diagnostic tests play a key role in control of schistosomiasis, especially in Asia where the prevalence and intensity of infection is low. As stool examination techniques, particularly the Kato-Katz technique has shown low sensitivity for the detection of light-intensity infections, highly sensitive diagnostics are urgently required to monitor prevalence of infection in low transmission settings. The purpose of this review was to assess and synthesize the performance of diagnostic tests for detecting schistosomiasis in people living in endemic areas in Asia. A comprehensive search, without any limit of language, date or types of publication, were performed for both- multiple electronic databases and other resources to identify the eligible studies. Robust analytical approaches such as diagnostic meta-analysis, HSROC curve, and diagnostic odds ratio, were used to provide more diagnostic accuracy of index tests. We assessed performance of three diagnostic tests (ELISA, IHA, and PCR) for detecting infection with S. japonicum using stool examination as a reference standard. In these meta-analyses, IHA showed the highest detection accuracy, followed by ELISA. We could not perform meta-analysis for S. mekongi due to insufficient number of studies.
