Dromedary camels are well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environment that makes up about 80% of Kenyaâ€™s landmass. As such, camels play an important role in the socio-economic wellbeing and food security of pastoralists in the country. However, the species remains relatively neglected in scientific research, one of the main reasons being camels are mostly found in remote, low-income, arid regions of Africa and Asia. We carried out a study to determine the levels of exposure of camels in northern Kenya to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Rift Valley fever virus, three priority zoonotic pathogens in the country. We found high levels of exposure to the three pathogens, indicating the important role camels might play in the epidemiology of the zoonotic diseases in humans and other livestock. Based on the study findings, we argue for the immediate need for investments in disease surveillance and control strategies for priority zoonotic disease in camels in Kenya.
