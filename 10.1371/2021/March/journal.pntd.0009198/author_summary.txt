Intestinal dysfunction due to mucosal inflammation, known as environmental enteric dysfunction, has been hypothesized to contribute to child undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries. Poor water and sanitation conditions are thought to be an underlying cause of both environmental enteric dysfunction and child undernutrition. To examine these relationships, we conducted a sub-study within a larger matched cohort study of a household-level water and sanitation intervention in rural Odisha, India. We collected stool samples from children under age five years and analyzed them for three biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction: myeloperoxidase, neopterin, and α1-anti-trypsin. We also assessed the same children’s nutritional status by measuring their height and calculating their height-for-age z-score. We observed a protective effect of the water and sanitation infrastructure intervention on α1-anti-trypsin. We also observed an association between myeloperoxidase and child height-for-age z-score. Our results contribute evidence that a transformative water and sanitation infrastructure intervention may reduce environmental enteric dysfunction in young children. Our study also adds to observational evidence that intestinal inflammation may be related to chronic undernutrition in young children, though the exact nature and relative importance of that relationship remains unclear.
