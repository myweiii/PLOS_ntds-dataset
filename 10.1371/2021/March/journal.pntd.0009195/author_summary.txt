Zika virus (ZIKV) is a significant global health threat particularly due to the speed in which epidemics can occur. The resulting infections have been demonstrated to harm a developing fetus and, in some adults, be a co-factor for the development of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. ZIKV is typically spread by the Aedes mosquito, but sexual transmission is also possible. We sought to develop a ZIKV prophylactic vaccine based on surface glycoproteins of the virus that would be devoid of any viral genetic material. This Virus-Like-Particle (VLP) was generated in vitro following introduction of plasmid DNA encoding Zika structural protein (prM-E) genes into mammalian cells. The aluminum-adjuvanted VLP induced nAbs in mice and nonhuman primates and protected against ZIKV challenge in vivo. These studies support the evaluation of this VLP candidate vaccine in human clinical trials.
