Insecticide resistance may threaten the efficacy of insecticides currently used in the dengue vector control program. These current findings reveal widespread insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus sampled from dengue hotspots. This screening provides comprehensive data on insecticide resistance to insecticides commonly used in dengue vector control programs. The mapping approach utilized in this present study facilitates easy visualization of the resistance distribution in dengue vectors across many dengue hotspots. Therefore, it could hence be beneficial to the Ministry of Health in managing the threat of resistance before it compromises current dengue vector control strategies.
