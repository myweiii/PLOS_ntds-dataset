Racemose neurocysticercosis is the most aggressive and lethal form of the disease characterized by progressive expansion of the larval stage of Taenia solium within the subarachnoid spaces of the brain. Currently, the cellular or molecular events that promote its formation and development are unknown. Our observations, employing tissue samples, revealed the presence of mitotically active cells in the bladder wall of the racemose larvae. Finally, we isolated and established primary cell cultures and observed that these cells are sensitive (proliferate in response to insulin). These results suggest that the proliferative cells stimulated by host biomolecules like hormones would be responsible for the abnormal growth of racemose larvae. Further studies are needed to identify all genes and pathways altered in the racemose form. The primary cell cultures will be used as a therapeutic target and allow us in future works to understand the developmental biology of the parasite.
