The acceptability of a new combination treatment regimen for lymphatic filariasis (ivermectin, plus DEC and albendazole, or IDA) was assessed as part of a larger community-based safety study in Fiji, Haiti, India, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. To understand how trial participants and communities felt about the new treatment, a survey was carried out with people who had participated in the safety study receiving either the standard treatment [DEC plus albendazole (DA)] or the new treatment regimen (IDA). Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were performed in the same communities. Results showed that there was no difference in acceptability between the DA and IDA. Adverse events and presence of filarial infection did not affect acceptability. The most important indicator associated with acceptability was country. All countries accepted the treatment regimens. Fiji had the highest acceptability scores, followed by Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Haiti and India. Results from the qualitative research showed that study participants appreciated the professionalism of the drug delivery team and the support offered for the management of any adverse events.
