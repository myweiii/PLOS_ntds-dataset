Histoplasmosis, an infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, is prevalent in the Americas, it is a common cause of pulmonary acute disease in cave explorers, speleologists, boy scouts and some other people in circumstantial risk, in most of these people the infection is commonly self-limited. However, in people living with HIV (PLWHIV) this infection might be acquired without specific exposition and it behaves like a severe disease with high fever, consumption, septic shock and death. Thus, there is a need for rapid and accurate methods for diagnosis in this population at risk. We tested five different methods for rapid diagnosis (three based on antigen detection in urine and two molecular assays based on PCR amplification, widely used) of disseminated histoplasmosis and we were able to demonstrate that two urine antigen detection tests (clarus Histoplasma GM Enzyme Immunoassay kit and MiraVista Histoplasma Urine Antigen LFA) showed excellent performance to diagnose of disseminated histoplasmosis in PLWHIV. The antigen detection tests have advantages over the PCR tests, their performance is higher, they are commercial standardized tests, easy to perform, and provide results in hours, therefore the integration of these tests in clinical laboratories will certainly impact on early diagnosis/treatment and consequently on the outcome of patients.
