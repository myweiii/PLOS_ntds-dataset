Although a century has elapsed since Chagas disease discovery, only two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are approved for its treatment. These drugs have significant safety and efficacy limitations and their specific modes of action are still poorly understood. Moreover, the causative agent, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, displays high genetic variability, which is suspected to affect clinical manifestations and disease outcome. With these facts in mind, we aimed to elucidate the role of the parasiteâ€™s genetic background in benznidazole treatment efficacy. Our results unveiled interesting differences in the sensitivity to benznidazole between some T. cruzi genotypes, which suggests genetic variability could influence patient cure rates. Additionally, they show the need for uniformity in experimental conditions during laboratory analysis of new drug candidates for Chagas disease treatment, and they highlight the importance of screening diverse T. cruzi strains from different genetic background as part of the process of drug evaluation and optimization.
