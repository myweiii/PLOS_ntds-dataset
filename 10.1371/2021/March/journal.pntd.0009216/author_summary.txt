The ability to meaningfully quantify the absolute and relative risks of Congenital Zika Syndrome is contingent on the accurate identification of ZIKV infections in pregnant women and the long-term follow-up of children at risk. This study builds on the evidence base on ZIKV in pregnancy by not only examining pregnancy and birth outcomes, but also considering later onset manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome, conducting a deep and standardized investigation of infant outcomes. In addition, it used unprecedented repeated testing and the use of multiple diagnostic platforms, including qRT-PCR, IgM and IgG3 ELISAs, and PRNTs to identify ZIKV cases. The absolute risk of microcephaly was 2.9%, of calcifications and/or ventriculomegaly was 7.2%, of additional neurologic alterations was 5.3%, of ophthalmologic abnormalities was 7% and of dysphagia was 1.8%. The manifestations presented more frequently in isolation than in combination (i.e., less than 1% of the children experienced abnormalities across all of the domains simultaneously). Although approximately one-fifth of children with confirmed and suspected exposure to ZIKV in pregnancy presented with at least one abnormality compatible with CZS, the manifestations presented more frequently in isolation than in combination
