The Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii), with a near-countrywide distribution, is arguably the deadliest snake species in India. Despite being responsible for the majority of snakebite deaths in the country, the influence of biogeography on its venom composition and potency, and the impact of this variation on snakebite therapy, is yet to be understood. Evaluation of the composition, biochemical activities, pharmacological implications and potencies of D. russelii venoms from five distinct biogeographic zones in India (>5,800 km) revealed remarkable intraspecific differences in venom profiles. Surprisingly, these observed differences did not seem to affect the marketed effectiveness of the commercial Indian antivenoms in countering the lethal effects of D. russelii venoms, with the exception of the North Indian semi-arid population. A similar lack of antivenom potency has also been documented in two other ‘big four’ snake species in these regions that suffer the brunt of snakebite. These alarming findings underscore the pressing need to develop pan-India efficacious antivenoms, especially for the treatment of snakebites in regions that are worst affected by this neglected tropical disease.
