Despite the amount of efficient Ebola virus therapeutic antibodies reported in recent years, their application in tropical endemic areas has remained limited due to the low thermal stability of mammalian antibodies. A highly thermostable therapeutic polyclonal antibody against EBOV was developed based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The EBOV specific IgY antibodies displayed excellent thermal stability, retaining their neutralising activity at 25Â°C for one year. The newborn mice receiving the passive transfer of IgY achieved complete protection against a lethal dose of virus challenge proving that the anti-EBOV IgY provides a promising recourse to solve some of the current clinical application hindrances of Ebola antibody-based treatments in Africa due to thermal stability.
