Lyme disease (LD) is an enzootic disease that is widely distributed in Asia, America, and Europe. In recent years, the incidence and the endemic range of LD have steadily expanded with increased human influence. Hainan Province has a tropical climate and is located in the South China Sea, and the first cases of LD in Hainan province were reported in 2015. However, there is lack of information on the prevalence and risk distribution of LD on the island. To analyze the prevalence of LD, we examined 1583 serum samples from patients presenting with arthritis and neurological symptoms. We then mapped the risk of LD using correlated factors such as the distribution of Muridae and Ixodidae, and human activity. This study is the first to demonstrate the distribution of LD risk in Hainan Province. A better understanding of the host-vector and human-vector interactions, as well as distribution of high-risk areas will serve as a good starting point to prevent this disease.
