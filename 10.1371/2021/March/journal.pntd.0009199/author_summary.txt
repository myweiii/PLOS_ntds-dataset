Toxoplasmic Encephalitis is a debilitating, yet highly treatable illness, classically seen in person living with HIV lacking treatment. Prompt diagnosis ensures the best outcome possible for patients, but remains a challenge: requiring invasive specimen collection, lacking necessary clinical sensitivity, demanding significant technical skills, and substantial infrastructure. Here we offer proof of concept of a diagnostic approach that is minimally invasive, using a urine-based approach that concentrates T. gondii antigens with hydrogel mesh nanoparticles to improve analytical sensitivity for detection by western blot.
