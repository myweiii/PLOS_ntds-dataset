Bats have a wide range of species and distribution, these mammals have been proposed as the natural reservoirs of pathogens for many years. Previous research focus mainly on viral agents in bats, while the infection of Borrelia spirochetes in bats is much neglected. Borrelia species causing Lyme disease and relapsing fever have been found in a wide range of ticks. Relapsing fever has long been recognized as major cause of disease and death in Africa, but as more and more cases reported in different continents, relapsing fever has become an emergent disease. There is growing evidence that bats can play a role in carrying Borrelia species. In this study, we captured different species of bats from caves during 2018â€“2020 in Central China, tested liver tissue for Borrelia by PCR, and applied multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to identify this bacterium. Our study found human pathogenic relapsing fever Candidatus Borrelia fainii in Central China, suggesting bat borne Borrelia spirochetes may pose a threat to public health in China.
