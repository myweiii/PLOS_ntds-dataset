Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, with an estimated 200 000–400 000 cases and 20 000–40 000 deaths per year worldwide. Leishmania parasites proliferate in spleen, liver and bone marrow, and the disease is usually fatal if untreated. Despite progress in the development of new therapies in recent years there is still a need to develop effective and safe treatments. Characterising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and their relationships has provided valuable information in the development and dosing of anti-infective agents, such as anti-bacterials and anti-fungals. The present study characterised these properties of the anti-leishmanial drugs AmBisome and miltefosine in a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis. We propose optimal dosing strategies for AmBisome and present a new approach for investigating anti-leishmanial drug action, which can be applied to the development of new treatments for visceral leishmaniasis.
