Globally, more than 1 billion residents live in urban slums, where inadequate sanitation increases the spread of pathogens and their animal hosts. Leptospirosis is a globally distributed bacterial disease, and in urban areas the bacteria is spread by brown rats. Humans become infected upon exposure to water or soil/mud that was contaminated with the urine of infected rats. In four urban slums in the city of Salvador, Brazil, we used a range of individual, socioeconomic, and environmental variables to understand how they influence to one another and define o leptospirosis exposure in residents. Poverty and sanitation influenced the degree to which residents were exposed to sewer water and mud. Further, we found that while residents tried to improve the physical environment near their household, living in an area with poor sanitation mean that their infection risk remained high. This work highlight the importance of socioeconomic and environmental factors in determining disease risk, and suggests that governmental interventions should focus on improving sanitation changes in the poorest parts of the community.
