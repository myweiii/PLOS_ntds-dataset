    "Background": "Aedes aegypti is an important vector of many human diseases and a serious threat to human health due to its wide geographic distribution and preference for human hosts. A. aegypti also has evolved widespread resistance to pyrethroids due to the extensive use of this insecticide class over the past decades. Mutations that cause insecticide resistance result in fitness costs in the absence of insecticides. The fitness costs of pyrethroid resistance mutations in A. aegypti are still poorly understood despite their implications for arbovirus transmission.",
    "Methodology/Principle findings": "We evaluated fitness based both on allele-competition and by measuring specific fitness components (i.e. life table and mating competition) to determine the costs of the different resistance mechanisms individually and in combination. We used four congenic A. aegypti strains: Rockefeller (ROCK) is susceptible to insecticides; KDR:ROCK (KR) contains only voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Vssc) mutations S989P+V1016G (kdr); CYP:ROCK (CR) contains only CYP-mediated resistance; and CYP+KDR:ROCK (CKR) contains both CYP-mediated resistance and kdr. The kdr allele frequency decreased over nine generations in the allele-competition study regardless of the presence of CYP-mediated resistance. Specific fitness costs were variable by strain and component measured. CR and CKR had a lower net reproductive rate (R0) than ROCK or KR, and KR was not different than ROCK. There was no correlation between the level of permethrin resistance conferred by the different mechanisms and their fitness cost ratio. We also found that CKR males had a reduced mating success relative to ROCK males when attempting to mate with ROCK females.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Both kdr and CYP-mediated resistance have a fitness cost affecting different physiological aspects of the mosquito. CYP-mediated resistance negatively affected adult longevity and mating competition, whereas the specific fitness costs of kdr remains elusive. Understanding fitness costs helps us determine whether and how quickly resistance will be lost after pesticide application has ceased."
