Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is one of the common human infectious disease threating Asia-Pacific countries. To explore the epidemiology and environmental risk factors for HFMD in inland China, we utilized 10-year HFMD surveillance data in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and combined multiple spatial-temporal statistical analyses. We identified spatial-temporal clusters of HFMD incidence and found that multiple factors could affect HFMD incidence: urban area being major land cover type, higher gross domestic product per capita, rise in monthly average temperature and monthly accumulative precipitation predicted increase in the incidence of HFMD; farmland being major land cover type, an increase of percentage of the minority and population density were related to a decrease in the incidence of HFMD. Our findings facilitate the understanding of HFMD epidemiology and risk factors in different geographic regions, which are crucial for conducting prevention and control strategies of HFMD.
