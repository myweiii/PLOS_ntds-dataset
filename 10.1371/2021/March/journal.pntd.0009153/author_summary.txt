Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease and the transmission of its virus depends on four factors: The presence of 1) the virus, 2) the human host, 3) the mosquito vector, and 4) the suitability of environmental conditions. Mainland China faces regular dengue outbreaks. Because the virus is constantly imported by infected travellers into the susceptible populations of Chinese metropolises, factors 1) and 2) are almost always met. We now investigate factors 3) and 4) to see when and where the risk for outbreaks is greatest. We use a novel model that considers the development of both the mosquitoes and the viruses under different climate conditions. Our findings suggest that the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) can potentially transmit dengue virus over large parts of mainland China; the biggest transmission risk is simulated over southern China where large outbreaks have occurred historically, but also over the temperate north, as far as Beijing, where smaller dengue outbreaks could occur during hot summer months.
