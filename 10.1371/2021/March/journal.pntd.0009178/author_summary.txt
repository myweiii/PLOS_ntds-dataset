Zoonotic bacterial infections cause both economic and health burdens to humans, especially in developing countries. Bartonella is a diverse group with several species that are infectious to humans. There is limited knowledge of Bartonella diversity and subsequent risk for spillover in several tropical countries, including India. This study, set in a biodiversity hotspot with high human density, reveals a high prevalence and diversity of Bartonella in the most common, and synanthropic small mammals. Several lineages identified are phylogenetically related to zoonotic species known to cause infections in humans. We suggest that there is unexplored diversity of Bartonella in small mammals that reside in human-modified landscapes in India, demonstrating an urgent need for further investigation. By identifying the natural reservoirs of pathogens, their ecology, and their relationship and proximity to humans, we will be able to proactively survey for these under-detected bacterial infections and minimize the burden.
