Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic roundworm, is endemic in many countries world-wide. In Australia, groups at risk for strongyloidiasis include Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, who acquired this parasite locally, and immigrants and returned travellers who acquired the infection outside Australia. We obtained deidentified results of ELISA IgG antibody tests for Strongyloides from diagnostic pathology laboratories during 2012 to 2016 and calculated the number of people who were positive at least once and the number who never had a positive result. We drew maps showing the number positive per 100,000 of population, the percent positive of those tested, and the number tested/100,000 for each region and the number positive in each suburb of residence according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The highest seropositivity (260-996/100,000 of population) was in Northern Australia, north-west South Australia and north-east New South Wales where many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in remote communities. There were also some regions in Greater Capital Cities with a high number of people positive per 100,000 of population (112-188/100,000), likely reflecting higher populations of immigrants and returned travellers who were infected outside Australia.
