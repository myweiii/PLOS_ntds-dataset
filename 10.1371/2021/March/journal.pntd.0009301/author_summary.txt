Anthrax is a neglected zoonosis worldwide. In Kenya, outbreaks have been reported in wildlife, livestock, and humans, resulting in severe public health burden and socio-economic impacts. Because of this, anthrax is ranked as the highest priority disease in the country. To identify factors that influence the spatial distribution of the disease in Kenya, we analyzed surveillance on available anthrax outbreaks recorded in the southern half of the country. Areas predicted to be highly suitable for the disease were predominantly in the southwestern region around the shared Kenya-Tanzania border running as a belt through central regions and central highlands of Kenya. These suitability regions extend westwards to cover large areas in western highlands and the western regions around Lake Victoria and bordering Uganda. The entire eastern and lower-eastern regions towards the coastal region were predicted to have lower suitability for anthrax. Cattle density, rainfall of wettest month, soil clay content, soil pH, soil organic carbon, length of longest dry season, vegetation index and temperature seasonality were key variables predicting the distribution of anthrax in the region. The study generated a suitability map depicting geographical areas that can be targeted for risk-based surveillance and or control measures for the disease.
