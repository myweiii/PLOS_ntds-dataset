Microcephaly defined using growth charts occurs naturally in some healthy infants. Nonetheless, in many recent Zika virus studies, such measurement-based microcephaly and other common mild abnormalities have been automatically attributed to viral exposure during pregnancy. For example, in 2016 in Guadeloupe, we did a cohort study and estimated that the risk of Zika virus related birth defects was 7%. However, most of the ‘abnormal’ live born infants that contributed to this risk estimate were considered healthy by pediatricians, but were found to have measurement-based microcephaly during data analysis. In the current study, we did a cross-sectional evaluation of infants live born in 2016 in Guadeloupe, but whose mothers were not infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. We found that Zika virus unexposed live born infants had similar proportions of measurement-based microcephaly and mild neurological abnormalities as exposed live born infants. If only severe and uncommon birth defects were considered linked to Zika virus in our original cohort study, our risk estimate would have been significantly lower. This research shows that it is important to consider baseline risks and control comparisons when establishing key parameters for emerging diseases, such as Zika virus.
