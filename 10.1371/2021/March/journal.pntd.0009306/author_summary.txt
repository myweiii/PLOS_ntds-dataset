Little is known about the host response to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) and the cellular factors this alphavirus hijacks to support effective replication or evade cellular immune responses. Monitoring dynamics of host and viral RNA (vRNA) during viral infection at a single-cell level can provide insight into the virus-host interplay at a high resolution. Here, a single-cell RNA sequencing technology that detects host and viral RNA was used to investigate the interactions between TC-83, the vaccine strain of VEEV, and the human host during the course of infection of U-87 MG cells (human astrocytoma). Virus abundance and host transcriptome were heterogeneous across cells from the same culture. Subsets of differentially expressed genes, positively or negatively correlating with vRNA abundance, were identified and subsequently in vitro validated as candidate proviral and antiviral factors, respectively, in TC-83 and/or virulent VEEV infections. In the first replication cycle, “superproducer” cells exhibited rapid increase in vRNA abundance and unique gene expression patterns. At later time points, cells with increased structural-to-nonstructural transcript ratio demonstrated upregulation of intracellular membrane trafficking genes. Lastly, comparing the VEEV dataset with published datasets on other RNA viruses revealed unique and overlapping responses across viral clades. Overall, this study improves the understanding of VEEV-host interactions, reveals candidate targets for antiviral approaches, and establishes a comparative single-cell approach to study the evolution of virus-host interactions.
