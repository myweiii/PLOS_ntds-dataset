    "Background": "Recent circumstantial evidence suggests increasing number of Iranian patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) who are unresponsive to meglumine antimoniate (MA), the first line of treatment in Iran. Oral meltifosine was previously reported to be effective in visceral leishmaniasis as well CL. The current study is designed to determine efficacy and safety of oral miltefosine for the treatment of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) cases who were refractory to MA in Iran.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Miltefosine was orally administered for 27 patients with MA resistant ACL with approved L.tropica infection, at a dosage of \u223c2.5 mg/kg daily for 28 days. Patients were evaluated on day 14 and 28, as well as 3, 6 and 12 month post treatment follow up sessions. Laboratory data were performed and repeated at each visit. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. Twenty-seven patients including 16 men (59.25%) and 11 women (40.74%) with mean age of 28.56 \u00b1 4.8 (range 3\u201354 years old) were enrolled. Total number of lesions were 42 (1\u20134 in each patient). Most of lesions were on face (76.19%). Mean lesions\u2019 induration size was 2.38 \u00b1 0.73 cm at the base-line which significantly decreased to1.31 \u00b1 0.58 cm and 0.61 \u00b10.49 cm after 14 and 28 days of therapy, respectively (p value <0.05). At 12-months follow-up post treatment, 22 patients had definite/partial cure (81.48%) including 17 definitely cured patients, corresponding to a cure rate of 68% on per protocol analysis, and 62.96% according to intention to treat analysis. Recurrence of lesion was only occurred in one patient (3.70%). Nausea was the most subjective complication during the therapy (33.33%).",
    "Conclusion": "Oral miltefosine could be an effective alternative for the treatment of MA-resistant ACL."
