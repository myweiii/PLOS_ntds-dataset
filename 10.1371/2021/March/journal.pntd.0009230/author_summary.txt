Understanding the genetics of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite causing leishmaniasis, is relevant for understanding fundamental questions on the pathogenâ€™s biology and its interaction with hosts. We explore mechanisms used by Leishmania to promptly adapt to different hosts investigating the control of gene expression occurring at the post-transcriptional level in the parasite. Methylation of arginine performed by Protein Arginine Methyltransferase (PRMTs), among other post-translational modifications, may alter the function and interactions of target proteins, some of them are RNA binding proteins, known regulators of gene expression. In this study, we unveil the impact of PRMT7 on parasite development and pathogenicity. In addition to a negative correlation between the levels of LmjPRMT7 and parasite pathogenicity, we observed an impairment of the parasite development in the sand fly vector. Remarkably, despite a severe lesion development in mice, we observed no differences in parasite burden between infections with the pathogenic LmjPRMT7 knockout parasite or the attenuated parental line. Instead, the severe pathology observed is associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response correlated with excessive neutrophil recruitment.
