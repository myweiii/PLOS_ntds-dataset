It is important to consider context-specific behaviors and transmission pathways when designing scalable and sustainable intervention strategies for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cysticercosis, suites of interventions have been recommended but are inconsistently implemented due to cost and feasibility-related constraints. This study investigated the potential of a cooking intervention to interrupt transmission via undercooked pork in marketplaces of Burkina Faso. The sensitivity of Taenia solium parasite to temperatures attainable via improved cooking strategies provides a low-cost, human-centered approach to prevent consumption of infected pork meals. By accounting for differential behavior and the relative role of this transmission route across three provinces, we show how the potential of cysticercosis elimination (as a public health problem) varies across behavior-focused interventions. Further investigation into intervention strategies against human and pig cysticercosis warrants data-driven analyses that account for local variation in transmission behaviors.
