Typhoid fever is a systemic human disease that involves gastroenteritis, fever, and severe diarrhea caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) and requires prompt antibiotic treatment. Due to improved living standards, it has become a rare disease but is still prevalent in developing countries such as India and Southeast Asia. Most reported cases are related to travelers or immigrants from these regions. Because of treatment failure, serious morbidity, and economic loss, there is a global health issue with the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains associated with fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. Of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi, haplotype H58 is a dominant multidrug-resistant lineage that has been reported in endemic regions over the past two decades. We identified fluoroquinolone resistance in cases of S. Typhi infection after travel to India. Among them, some strains highly resistant to ciprofloxacin were confirmed to have characteristics of haplotype H58. In Korea, S. Typhi haplotype H58 from travelers has not been confirmed before. This study provides information about intercontinental drug-resistant transmission between countries and suggests that travelers need to be careful about personal hygiene.
