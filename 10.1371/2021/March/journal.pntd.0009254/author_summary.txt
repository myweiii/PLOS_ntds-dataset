The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reinforced that health workers are critical for the functioning of a health system and that they need to be protected from infection. To provide biosecurity and biosafety for health workers for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control (IPC), it is critical to identify who the patient-facing health workers are in a specific health system. We therefore conducted our study in Zimbabwe to characterise the different workers coming into contact with patients and their exposure to COVID-19. The health workers were defined by occupation and work station within the health centre. The study showed that over 75.0% of the health workers were female, and that the largest group of patient-facing health workers were nurses who constituted 45.3% of the workforce. The largest group, 43.0% of the workforce, was based in the clinical wards. Sero-reactivity among these health workers was 8.9% with the highest prevalence being in the nurses. Two participants (0.36%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. None of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive people were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing.
