Unlike other mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, ZIKV can persistently replicate in the male reproductive system and is sexually transmitted. ZIKV infection was reported to damage testis. However, ZIKV-induced epididymal injury was not investigated in detail. Clinically, epididymitis is closely associated with male infertility. In this study, a mouse model was used to demonstrate that ZIKV causes histomorphological and functional changes in the epididymis, which may alter the microenvironment of sperm maturation and movement and finally lead to male infertility. Therefore, long-term investigation of male reproductive health may be needed in the areas of ZIKV epidemic.
