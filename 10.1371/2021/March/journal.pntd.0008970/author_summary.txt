Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected zoonotic reemerging disease. The immune response of hosts against these bacteria has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we studied over 6 months the antibody profiles in mice infected with L. interrogans and determined whether this humoral response confers long-term protection after homologous challenge six months after primary infection. Groups of mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2Ã—107 bacteria of one of three different pathogenic serovars (Manilae, Copenhageni and Icterohaemorrhagiae) and some corresponding attenuated avirulent mutants. We measured by ELISA each type of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgA, IgM, IgG and 4 subclasses) produced in the first weeks up to 6 months post-infection and studied their cross-reactivities among serovars. We showed different profiles of antibody response after L. interrogans challenge in mice, depending on the serovar and virulence of strains. However, all infected mice, including the ones harboring low antibody levels, like mice vaccinated with an inactivated, heat-killed strain, were protected against leptospirosis after challenge. Notably, we also showed an unusual sustained IgM response associated with chronic leptospiral colonization. Altogether, this long-term immune protection is different from what is known in humans and warrants further investigation.
