Lassa Fever (LF) is a life-threatening rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic disease of epidemic potential particularly affecting some West African communities. Although it is estimated to cause 100,000â€“300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths annually, the true burden of the disease in the community is not well understood since research has largely focussed on hospitalised cases (thought to account for ~15% of infections) because of the difficulty of identifying mild or asymptomatic cases in the community. Gaining a better understanding of LF epidemiology, particularly the exposure and immunity status of populations in countries where the virus is endemic in the rodent hosts, is critical to developing control measures including vaccines which can protect against disease and/or reduce risk of epidemic transmission. A key step is to be able to identify who has been previously infected by virus, and therefore likely immune, and who remains susceptible by examining the prevalence of antibodies to the virus in the community. However, to date all tests require blood to be drawn which can be problematic for community participation as well as risky for collectors. This study reports on a project to develop and validate an antibody test that can be used with an easy-to-give oral fluid sample.
