Almost two billion people defecate into onsite sanitation facilities such as pit latrines. Evidence suggests these individuals are often at a disproportionately high risk of enteric infection compared to those served by piped sewerage. Public health surveillance in high-risk communities could monitor key pathogens in fecal sludges to inform which pathogens are circulating among those contributing waste. Representative surveys including multiple latrines could inform vaccination campaigns and interventions to limit the transmission of these pathogens, including eradication efforts, at a localized scale. A better understanding of how enteric pathogen detection may vary by pit latrine sampling depth would be useful to inform methods for fecal sludge collection. To refine methods for sampling in such surveys, we collected fecal sludges from the surface, mid-point, and maximum depth of pit latrines in Malawi. We found pit latrine depth did not significantly affect enteric pathogen detection by the methods we used. However, surface samples may be preferred due to their ease of collection and because the most recently deposited fecal material may be of greater interest in surveillance efforts that aim to inform pathogen carriage at the time of sampling.
