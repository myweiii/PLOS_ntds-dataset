    "Introduction": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represents a diverse group of communicable, disabling, chronic and disfiguring diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions [1,2,3]. NTDs affect more than one billion people in 149 countries, most especially the rural and disadvantaged urban settings challenged by poverty. These areas are usually characterized by inadequate access to water and sanitation facilities, close proximity to infectious vectors and domestic animals or livestock [4\u20136]. Based on recent classifications, NTDs comprises of 20 different type of diseases with the addition of snakebite, scabies and other ectoparasites, mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses [1\u20133,7]. The newly launched WHO 2021\u20132030 NTDs roadmap therefore identifies the specific targets and milestones set for each of the 20 diseases, with 2, 11 and 8 of the diseases targeted for eradication, elimination and control respectively by 2030 [8]\nNTDs are more common in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with about 500 million people affected [5\u20137,9]. About 25% of Africa\u2019s NTD burden is in Nigeria [3,7,9]. Although the epidemiological profiles of snakebite, scabies and mycetoma remain largely unknown in Nigeria, over half of the WHO recognized NTDs are present in Nigeria [10\u201313]. The country also has the highest number of people infected or at risk in SSA with NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC-NTDs) such as onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) [3,9,14,15].\nThe 2012 London Declaration achieved a long-term commitment from pharmaceutical companies to donate essential medicines for the control of PC-NTDs in endemic countries, including Nigeria [16]. Donated medicines are delivered at large scale in a coordinated manner to risk groups in schools and households/communities via already established NTDs control programme architecture at sub-national/district levels [17]. This strategy known as mass administration of medicines (MAM) requires substantial commitment of both financial and human resources [18], and more importantly, effective communal participation in the bid to sustain progress towards established public health targets or goals [17\u201319]. However, there are pockets of evidence on the low public awareness about NTDs and efforts targeted at controlling it in Nigeria [14,20\u201323]. This study therefore aims to investigate public awareness about NTDs and efforts targeted at controlling it in Ekiti State, where such information is lacking.\nNTDs were one of the few health and developmental issues that didn\u2019t have a dedicated advocacy milestone. The World Health Organization has therefore set aside 30th January of each year as the annual World NTD Day to mobilize greater attention, action and investment on priority issues [24]. The annual World NTD day event therefore serves as an exciting opportunity to investigate the knowledge and perception of the public regarding NTDs and its control activities as it brought together stakeholders living or working in endemic countries and across the diverse NTD landscape. This study was therefore cconducted on 30th of January, 2020 during the Inaugural World NTDs day event held in Ekiti State, Nigeria.",
    "Methodology": "Ethics statement\nThis study received ethical approval from the Ethics Review Committees of State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Ekiti State, and Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria (HRS/WNTD/001). Those who agreed to participate were given informed consent forms to complete after the purpose of the study has been explained to them. Formal consent was obtained through a duly completed consent form with the name and signature of the attendee.\n\n\nStudy area\nThis study was carried out in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Ekiti State is one of the six southwestern states in Nigeria. It has 16 Local Government Areas (LGAs) with Ado-Ekiti as the capital. (Fig 1). The state is endemic for Onchocerciasis, Lymphatic Filariasis, Schistosomiasis and Soil Transmitted Helminthiasis. MAM targeted at controling and possibly eliminating these diseases commenced in Ekiti State in 2015 with support from Mission to save the helpless (MITOSATH), a non-governmental organization.\nMap of Fig 1 was created using ArcGIS software by ESRI (www.esri.com).

The event was well-advertised via a rally, live radio programme, and the web (email, Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook). Invitation to attend was openly announced to all interested members of the public.\n\n\nQuestionnaire administration\nThe study was cross-sectional in design and involved the administration of already pretested semi-structured questionnaires to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from consenting participants (S1 Text). Participants were approached at the registration desk of the event and invited to participate in the study. Information such as participants\u2019 demographic data, and their knowledge and awareness about NTDs were assessed using the pretested questionnaires. To prevent event-induced responses and biases, attendees completed the questionnaires before proceeding with registration or gaining access to the event hall.\n\n\nData collection, processing, and analysis\nData obtained were entered into Microsoft Excel 2019 software (S1 Data). Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics in SPSS. 20.0 and expressed as frequencies and percentages. Cross-tabulations and Chi-square analysis were performed to investigate associations. Confidence interval was set at 95%. However, qualitative data to support quantitative analysis were obtained using open-ended questionnaires, manually coded based on emerging themes and summarized in form of a pie chart (Fig 2). Detailed STROBE checklist for the study has been provided (S1 STROBE Checklist)",
    "Results": "Demographic information of study participants\nA total of 309 attendees participated in the study, including 167 (54.0%) females, and 142 (46.0%) males. Also, the majority of the study participants 206 (66.7%) were within 15\u201325 years age category, and 4 (1.3%) participants were below 15 years of age. A total of 221 (71.5%) attendees were students or job-seekers, 48 (15.5%) work in tertiary educational institutions, 38 (12.3%) were health workers, 1 (0.3%) was a policy maker and 1 (0.3%) media personnel. (Table 1)\n\n\nPerception of attendees about NTDs as a disease and a public health problem\nMajority of the attendees, 167 (54.8%) have not heard about NTDs before. The proportion of attendees who have heard about NTDs were not significantly different by occupational status (p = 0.217). Among those who have heard about NTDs, 110 (50.00%) learnt about in the hospital, and 77 (35.0%) through the advert for the World NTD event. Other sources of information listed were schools 18 (8.2%) and internet 15 (6.8%) (Table 2). There were significant differences in the proportions across the different occupational status (p = 0.004). Also, a total of 87 (28.2%) and 61 (19.7%) attendees were able to correctly identify schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis respectively as NTDs. Onchocerciasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminthiasis were also identified as NTDs by 36 (11.7%) and 34(11.0%) additional attendees respectively (Fig 2). Other significant diseases such as Malaria, Tuberculosis, HIV, and Diabetes were incorrectly listed as NTDs by 41 (13.3%), 27 (8.7%), 17 (5.5%) and 14 (4.5%) attendees respectively (Fig 3). Majority of the attendees, 232 (88.5%) also think that NTDs is a public health problem, although the proportions were not significantly different across the occupational status of attendees (p = 0.853). A sub-stratum of the attendees, 82 (26.5%) ascribed several reasons to it, some of which include; NTDs affects people in overcrowded communities (23(28%)), and the fact that poor awareness and low attention has been given to it (21(26%)) (Fig 2)\n\n\nPerception of attendees about signs and symptoms of common NTDs\nA total of 166 (55.5%) of the attendees have not seen a probable NTDs case before. There was insignificant difference in the proportion of attendees who have seen a probable case and those who have not across the occupational status of attendees (p = 0.551). Among the 4 major symptoms of PC-NTDs (bloody urine, swollen limbs, worm(s) in the stool and depigmented skin) selected for this study, a high proportion of the attendees 217 (71.9%), 207 (70.2%), 179 (59.9%) and 166 (54.8%), indicated that they have not seen anyone with bloody urine, depigmented skin, wormy stool and swollen limbs before the event respectively. Significant difference only exists among the proportions of attendees who have seen anyone with swollen limbs or thighs by occupational status (p = 0.002) (Table 3)\n\n\nAwareness about NTD control programming and promotional activities\nA total of 181 (63.3%) of the attendees were aware of ongoing NTD control programmes in schools and communities. There was insignificant difference in the proportion across the occupational status of attendees (p = 0.056). A high proportion 246 (83.4%) of the attendees have not taken or do not know anyone that has taken PC-NTD drugs/medicines donated in schools or communities (Table 4). There was insignificant difference in the proportion across the occupational status of attendees (p = 0.276). Also, majority of the attendees 218 (76.5%) have not received health educational messages on NTDs before. Among the few that had received, the listed sources of information were in schools 26 (8.4%), hospitals 8 (2.6%), on radio programmes 4 (1.3%) and through the internet 2 (0.6%). There was no significant difference in the proportions across the occupational status of the attendees (p = 0.337). Only 5 (8.3%) of the attendees think there is enough awareness about NTDs. In addition, majority of the participants 249 (80.6%) are willing to participate in NTD promotional activities including advocacy and health promotion 118 (38.2%), research 63 (20.4%) and networking 54 (17.5%). (Table 5).",
    "Discussion": "Public awareness and perception about neglected tropical diseases are important factors in policy formulations, programme planning and modification of field practices focused at controlling NTDs [14,25]. The World NTD Day was recognized to call for action towards ending the burden of the NTDs via increasing advocacy for support, acknowledging strides, and increasing overall awareness about these group of debilitating diseases [2]. In this study, we assessed the awareness and perception of attendees at the inaugural World NTD Day event in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Findings showed that almost half of the attendees are unaware of NTDs before the event. This supports the existing notions that public awareness about NTDs is still low in Nigeria [20\u201323]. Furthermore, knowledge about NTD control programming and promotional activities is very poor, and this finding corroborates with that of [14].\nMore than 80% of the attendees do not know anyone who has benefitted from preventive chemotherapy mass drug administration and about 70% have not received any NTD health educational benefits prior this event. Ekiti is one of the rural states in Nigeria that has benefitted from the community-directed treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) programme aimed at eliminating onchocerciasis since 2002 [26], and more recently from MAM since 2015 [16]. It is thus surprising that such a huge proportion of the attendees have not benefitted or heard about PC-NTD control programs. The role of residential proximity to health facilities had been sufficiently discussed by [27], as such our findings might have been influenced by the residential proximity of attendee\u2019 to areas where MAM were taking place. MAM are usually implemented in rural communities and quite impactful in endemic areas with less dynamic and diverse populations such as those found in rural areas compared to urban areas that are geographically larger in size and complex in human population structure, making MAM more difficult to implement [28]. However, this study did not capture more specific information about attendee mobility and residential status to provide more explanations to the aforementioned low awareness about PC-NTD control programme.\nOn the other hand, sensitization and advocacy activities for NTDs are conducted once in a year, and usually very close to the set implementation dates for the annual MAM, with the focus of promoting compliance to medicine administration. This strategy offers a very limited time for intensive sensitization about NTDs [17], as compared to all year-round sensitization activities common to vaccination and bed-nets campaigns [29]. Communal support and awareness are heightened when repeated sensitization with community members, leaders and influential community structures, such as religious institutions, takes place [30]. Nevertheless, data from this study emphasizes the need for increased awareness on NTDs control activities and reiterates the importance of annual World NTD day as a complementary platform for promoting NTD awareness and control activities. Interestingly, about 25% of the attendees indicated that they have heard about NTDs from the advert of the inaugural event which included a rally and live broadcast on a radio channel. This, therefore, reiterates the potential of open symposiums, online radio programme and rallies as important advocacy strategies in promoting health educational messages and intervention activities to end-users in common and public places such as schools, markets and hospitals [31].\nIt is not uncommon that an appreciable number of the attendees wrongly identified malaria as a neglected tropical disease compared to onchocerciasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. This can be attributed to the fact that there is a common ground of acceptance for the morbidities and burden associated with malaria disease. The incubation period for Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria is between 7 and 30 days which is far shorter than the latency period for other NTDs such as onchocerciasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis which may take several months to more than a decade [32]. Our findings show that majority of the attendees have not seen anyone with bloody urine, swollen limbs, wormy stool and depigmented skin before. This observation is in line with the findings of [19] and may contribute to the reasons why community members perceive less need for MAM over time. Also, unlike NTD control programmes, sustained malaria control programme have been in existence for quite a longer period, and they have more field presence for interventions delivery such as distribution of insecticide treated bednets and intermittent preventive treatment to endemic regions than there are for NTDs control [33]. These might have contributed to more increased awareness for malaria control than most NTDs [14,34].\nThe WHO 2021\u20132030 NTDs roadmap clearly identified with awareness-generation activities aimed at educating and informing endemic communities on behavior changes, MDA scheduling, treatment and care options [8]. Without the public being mobilized to participate in NTD control and promotional activities in Nigeria, it may be increasingly difficult to meet set treatment coverage and achieve the desired objective of the WHO 2021\u20132030 NTDs roadmap of accelerating control and eventual elimination. This study has thus revealed a low level of public perception of NTDs and their control activities among attendees of this event, this is similar to the perception reported among attendees of a job fair in Abuja, Nigeria [14]. Since sustainable promotional and awareness activities require substantial resources commitment and coordination [14,17,19]. Efforts aimed at improving awareness on NTDs, disease control programs and health promotional activities should therefore be modified on this context to ensure optimal communal participation both in rural and urban areas [35]. NTDs largely affect rural populations and resourced challenged areas where access to wealth and media platforms are limited. As such, promotional activities that has a wider coverage and requires lesser financial commitments such as regular radio programmes and dialogues through community meetings should be explored. However, in urban settings, mass public health media campaigns to improve public perception and contribute towards participation and uptake of NTDs intervention tools should be explored. However, in the face of dire financial resources, promotional activities such as engagement with the media via online/TV interviews and podcasts should be done regularly to inform the public about NTDs.",
    "Limitations": "This study is a rapid assessment of attendees\u2019 awareness during the maiden World NTD Day event in Ekiti State. The study has the following limitations; (1) the convenient sampling methodology employed in recruiting study participants contributed to the low sample size and restricted sampling frame, (2) to avoid interfering with attendee\u2019s participation in the event, data collectors do not have enough time to engage and probe attendees adequately, which might have led to the non-response rate recorded for some variables in the questionnaire (3) this study did not capture more specific information on attendee mobility and residential status that could provide more explanations to the low awareness about PC-NTD control programme observed.\nBased on these limitations, our results are descriptive and cannot be used to make inference on the large populace in Ekiti State. However, this study has highlighted some important concepts on awareness and community engagement in NTD control programming. This study therefore offers useful information and research gaps that should be explored using a more robust sampling methodology. More importantly, there is need to repeat the same knowledge assessment in rural communities using a more systematic sampling approach, utilize focus group discussions and avail the questionnaires in a language that is accessible to rural communities to ensure they can express themselves fully.",
    "Conclusion": "Public knowledge and awareness about NTDs control programme and promotional activities among attendees of the maiden World NTD Day event in Ekiti State, Nigeria is low. Investments in regular radio programmes, community dialogues, and massive public health media campaigns targeted at improving public perception on NTDs and contributing towards uptake of NTDs intervention and participation in NTDs promotional activities should be explored."
