Neglected Tropical Diseases has remained a public health menace in most developing countries including Nigeria. Efforts targeted at controlling the diseases requires substantial community acceptance and participation in drug donation campaigns. This study, therefore, provides information on public knowledge and awareness about NTDs and its control activities. We surveyed 309 attendees during the inaugural 2020 World NTD Day event in Ekiti, Nigeria. Our results show that attendeesâ€™ knowledge and awareness about NTD control programme and promotional activities is low. There is thus a need for NTD control program managers to engage in regular promotional activities such as media engagements to ensure improved awareness and community involvement.
