The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) is the geographically most widespread tick-borne arbovirus and it is endemic in several countries. Because of its high case fatality rates, its potential for nosocomial outbreaks and the difficulties in treatment and prevention, CCHFV has been included in the WHOâ€™s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. For fast implementation of infection control measures in CCHFV-affected countries, reliable diagnosis utilizing qualified molecular and serological tests is essential.
Here we compared diagnostic performances of ten serological tests based on detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against CCHFV using samples from CCHFV patients and samples from healthy blood donors collected in Kosovo. The analyses focused on the phase of infection, because IgM and IgG tests have differing intended purposes. We concluded that the tests are suitable for accurate detection of anti-CCHFV IgM and IgG antibodies, but varied in their respective diagnostic performances with respect to the phase of the infection. IgM tests are mainly intended to support the diagnosis of acute infections and performed well in the early and convalescent phases of infection. IgG tests become relevant at later stages of disease progression and for disease surveillance and reached highest sensitivities in the subsided phase of infection.
