This study describes the diagnostic accuracy of the Infection Manager System (IMS), a novel diagnostic algorithm for febrile illnesses that is equipped on a routine hematology analyzer. The latest generation hematology analyzers allow better differentiation between leukocyte subsets and their phenotype. The IMS was created, using differences in immune cell subsets (their activation status for instance), to differentiate viral from bacterial etiologies of fever. Such a tool may guide clinicians in their decision the initiate or withhold antimicrobial therapy.
The study was carried out among febrile patients aged 3 months and older in rural Burkina Faso, a sub-Saharan African setting where malaria is endemic. Standard microbiological techniques such as blood culture were used as a reference to assess the diagnostic accuracy of IMS. We then compared the diagnostic accuracy of the IMS with the marketed biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Our study showed that the diagnostic performance of the IMS was similar to CRP and better than PCT to detect bacteremia in patients with and without malaria co-infection. Further studies are needed to see if the IMS can be safely used to guide initial antimicrobial treatment and help to reduce further spread of antimicrobial resistance.
