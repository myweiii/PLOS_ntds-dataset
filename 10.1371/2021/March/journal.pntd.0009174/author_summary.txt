Malaria and intestinal helminthiasis are endemic parasitic diseases in Sub Sahara Africa including Cameroon that has been associated with poverty. Humans are co-infected with these diseases. Intestinal helminths have been reported to improve or exacerbate malaria severities in co-infected patients. The precise mechanism through which they exert this is not well elucidated but there are speculations about possible immunological implications. It is therefore crucial to understand the mechanism how these neglected tropical disease (helminthiasis) impact malaria severities to develop robust integrated public health intervention strategies and treatment protocols that can effectively manage these diseases in endemic zones. In this study, we focused on the impact of these helminths on malaria parasitaemia, anaemia and pyrexia. We examined each patient for malaria and helminth infections while also measuring their haemoglobin concentrations and body temperatures. We found out that patients infected with intestinal helminths had increased risk of malaria infection and exacerbated malaria parasitaemia, anaemia and pyrexia in co-infected patients. We also observed that increased levels of IL-1Î² were higher in these co-infected patients than in patients infected with malaria parasite or helminths alone. Our study is informative about the possible involvement of intestinal helminths with the immune responses of the host that consequently affects malaria severity.
