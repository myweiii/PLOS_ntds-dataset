Leprosy, which has been reported throughout human history since Biblical times, still presents unclear aspects in regards to its pathogeny, and represents a public health concern, particularly in developing countries, where poor sanitary conditions of socially disfavored groups is a relevant contributing factor in maintaining disease dissemination. Although its signs and symptoms are primarily found in young adults, the increasing number of elderly individuals with leprosy is a recent phenomenon that requires clarification. Considering the specific biochemical profile of the elderly, as well as the influence thereof on their immune response to infection, this work demonstrates that elderly leprosy patients present increased levels of oxidative damage in blood and skin lesions when compared to younger patients. Such findings appear to be correlated with low gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, particularly among multibacillary patients. This work intends to contribute to a better understanding on the progress of leprosy in elderly groups.
