We are grateful to Yuedong Wang, University of California, Santa Barbara, who made valuable suggestions for the implementation of the GLM analysis to our laboratory results. Raúl Stariolo, of the National Chagas Control Service (Córdoba, Argentina), kindly provided the live specimens of T. infestans used to carry out the experiments.
