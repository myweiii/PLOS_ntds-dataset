Species Distribution Modelling determines habitat suitability of a species across geographic areas using macro-climatic variables; however, micro-habitats can buffer or exacerbate the influence of macro-climatic variables, requiring links between physiology and species persistence. We tackled the problem of the combination of exposure time and temperature (a combination difficult to judge a priori) in determining species thermal tolerance, using an active learning approach that utilized machine learning methods to guide thermal tolerance experimental design for three kissing-bug species (Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongylus megistus), vectors of the parasite causing Chagas disease. These bugs are found in micro-habitats with associated shifts in microclimate to enhance survival. Using a limited literature-collected dataset, we showed that temperature followed by exposure time were the strongest predictors of mortality, that species played a minor role, that life stage was the least important, and a complex nonlinear interaction between temperature and exposure time in shaping mortality of kissing bugs. These results led to the design of new laboratory experiments to assess the effects of temperature and exposure for the triatomines. These results can be used to better model micro-climatic envelope for species. Our active learning approach to explore experimental space to design laboratory studies can also be applied to other environmental conditions or species.
