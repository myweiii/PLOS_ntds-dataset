There is a huge diversity in pathogenic Leptospira species worldwide, and our knowledge of the currently circulating species is deficient owing to limited isolation and identification of Leptospira species from endemic countries. This prospective study reveals the wide pathogen diversity that causes human leptospirosis in Sri Lanka, representing four species, more than six serogroups, and fifteen clonal groups. Further, the different geographic and climatic zone distributions and clinical manifestations observed underscores the need for prospective studies to expand the molecular epidemiological approaches to combat leptospirosis.
