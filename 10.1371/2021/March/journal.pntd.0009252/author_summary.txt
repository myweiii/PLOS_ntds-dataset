Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant illness worldwide. Mosquito breeding, which leads to disease transmission, is driven by favorable climatic and meteorological events (e.g., rainfall and warm temperatures). Understanding the association meteorological conditions have with mosquito breeding aids in directing mosquito control activities when there is a likelihood of disease transmission. Predictive models are used in public health decision making and resource allocation to guide mosquito control programs. However, there are multiple modelling methods, all of which provide differing degrees of accuracy in their predictions and suitability to the disease transmission dynamics. This study aims to assess commonly used statistical models for predicting mosquito-borne disease notifications and outbreaks. We demonstrate that statistical model selection plays an important role in accurately forecasting mosquito-borne disease and poor predictive performance may be due to inappropriate model selection. Furthermore, a model suited to predicting disease notifications may not always be the best model to accurately predict the occurrence of disease outbreaks. The methods used here can aid in public health to establish suitable predictive mosquito-borne disease surveillance systems to help guide disease prevention and resource allocation, and mosquito control activities.
