We would like to thank the physicians and nurses at the DOTS clinics of University of Gondar Hospital, Gondar Health Center, Maraki and Azezo Health Centers for collecting patient samples, monitoring and deworming helminth positive patients. We also thank laboratory technologists at the study areas for Xpert and AFB microscopic analysis of sputum samples. Our appreciation also goes to the TB patients and CCs who have been voluntarily involved in the study.
