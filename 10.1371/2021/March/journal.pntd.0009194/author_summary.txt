Monocytes are important cells for the early innate immune response and play an integral part during inflammation and infection. Classical monocytes, the dominant monocyte subset during homeostasis and health, have been linked to efficient TB protection. Intermediate or non-classical monocytes have instead been associated with uncontrolled inflammation (TNF-alpha), cell death, and poor protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In areas endemic for intestinal helminths, the immunoregulatory effects of monocytes may affect development or progression of TB disease. The role of monocyte subsets during helminth/TB coinfection have not been studied. In Gondar, Ethiopia, we show that in patients with helminth infection, a helminth species dependent expansion of non-classical monocytes is triggered, where Ascaris and hookworm had the strongest effect in coinfected pulmonary TB-patients. The increase in non-classical monocytes was mainly detected in coinfected patients with a low-to-intermediate disease severity. Only coinfection with helminths and TB induced an increased TNF-alpha response in monocytes. Thus, we found a helminth species-specific dysregulation of monocyte subset distribution and functionality in coinfected TB-patients which could affect TB pathogenesis.
