Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) with extreme contagiousness is a key danger to public health systems in Europe and Asia. To date, little information is obtained about the molecular mechanism underlying infection, and although commercial vaccines against TBEV exist, there is no specific treatment for the disease. Metabolomics and lipidomics offer multiple-visions of metabolome and lipidome sights and help elucidating metabolic to disease phenotype. Serum metabolism and lipidome analysis were performed based on mass spectrometer (MS) platform on a cohort of TBEV patients. About 400 metabolites performed crucial shifts in TBEV patients compared with healthy subjects. This study revealed that in the stage of infection, the host metabolome is tightly regulated, with anti-inflammatory processes modulating pro-inflammatory processes implying the self-limiting phenotype of TBEV and the inherent regulation in humans. The crucial perturbed metabolic pathways contained amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and phospholipid metabolism. This study provides a powerful and new approach to decipher the interactions between host and virus. These potential metabolites provide high sensitivity and specificity and have the capacity to function as biomarkers for disease surveillance and estimation of therapeutic interventions.
