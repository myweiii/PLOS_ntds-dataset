Neurological manifestations are uncommon in the early stages of Lassa Fever. In Ebonyi State, an unusual pattern was observed between two outbreaks that occurred quite close together in time but with distinctly different presentations. Previous studies on the 2018 outbreak focused on the first part of the outbreak between December 2017â€”May 2018. We therefore compared the two outbreaks and observed that patients in the second outbreak which occurred between August 2018-December 2018, presented with early neurological symptoms and a high mortality rate. This observation highlights the need for further evaluation and molecular studies.
