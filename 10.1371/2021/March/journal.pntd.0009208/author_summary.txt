In 2016, the Zika epidemic in the Americas was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization, due to the finding that Zika virus infection was associated with microcephaly. In total, nearly 700,000 cases of Zika were reported to the Pan American Health Organization between 2015 and 2017. During this time, there were also nearly 4 million cases of dengue and chikungunya, diseases that share a common mosquito vector, and similar symptomatology, with Zika. In a region with co-circulation of these diseases, high potential for clinical misdiagnosis among these diseases has been found. This raises the question of how misdiagnosis could have affected reports of the overall size of the Zika epidemic. We addressed this question by leveraging passive surveillance data and empirical estimates of misdiagnosis to quantify the spatial and temporal extent of misdiagnosis between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Our results suggest that, across the Americas, the Zika epidemic was likely larger than indicated by passive surveillance data taken at face value, but that conclusions about the overall size of the epidemic depend on assumptions made about sensitivities and specificities of laboratory diagnostic tests. We estimated that many misdiagnosed Zika cases occurred in 2015, prior to the start of reporting of Zika in most countries.
