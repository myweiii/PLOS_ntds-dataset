Most guidelines for rabies control call for at least 70% vaccination coverage of dogs. This level of immunity has a very high probability for the local elimination of rabies, but it is often not an achievable ideal due to resource constraints. Campaign managers can be strategic on how they allocate their resources. Lower infectivity rates are present in areas with more restricted dog movements and have higher probabilities for elimination at lower vaccination rates. Smaller sub-populations have higher probabilities for elimination at the same vaccination coverage levels compared to larger sub-populations. Vaccinating immune corridors can divide meta-populations into smaller sub-populations that are likely to result in elimination either due to their small size or due to the local low infectivity. Areas already free of rabies require lower vaccination levels to maintain freedom compared to endemic areas. Where donors do not specifically require sterilization campaigns, funds meant for rabies control should not be diverted to sterilizations.
