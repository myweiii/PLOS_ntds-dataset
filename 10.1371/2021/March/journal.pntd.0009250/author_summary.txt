Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis, more common in tropical and subtropical countries, and the involvement of bones is rare. The metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro is hyperendemic for zoonotic sporotrichosis and the bone presentations are increasing. We evaluated 41 cases of bone sporotrichosis at a reference center in infectious diseases. There was a predominance of men with immunosuppressive conditions, notably HIV infection and alcoholism. Immunosuppression was related to multifocal bone involvement and more severe disease. This form of the disease is a chronic, challenging condition with prolonged treatment, often with poor results and sequelae.
