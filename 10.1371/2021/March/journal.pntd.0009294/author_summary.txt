Improved treatments for lymphatic filariasis (LF) could accelerate the global elimination program for this disease. A triple drug combination of the anti-filarial drugs ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (IDA) has been shown to be safe and effective for achieving sustained clearance of microfilariae (Mf) of the filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti from human blood. However, the triple drug combination has not been previously been evaluated for treatment of brugian filariasis, which accounts for about 10% of the global LF burden. This hospital-based clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of IDA with that of the standard treatment (DEC plus albendazole, DA) in persons with Brugia timori infections on Sumba island, Indonesia. Fifty-five asymptomatic persons with B. timori Mf were treated with either a single oral dose of IDA (28 subjects) or with DA (27 subjects). Adverse events (AE) were assessed in the hospital for two days after treatment and for another five days in participantsâ€™ home villages. IDA was much more effective than DA for clearing Mf from the blood at 24 hr. Only 1 person (4% of those treated) had Mf in their blood one year after IDA, while 10 persons (40%) treated with DA were Mf positive at that time. About 45% of persons in both treatment groups experienced mostly mild AE as fever, muscle aches, lower back, joint and abdominal pain (mostly during the first two days after treatment). This study showed that IDA was well-tolerated and significantly more effective than DA for clearing B. timori Mf from the blood. Larger studies should be performed to further assess the safety and efficacy of IDA as a mass drug administration regimen to eliminate brugian filariasis.
