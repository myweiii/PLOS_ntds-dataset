Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic disease caused by the metacestode stage of the helminth parasite Echinococcus multilocularis. Current treatment requires surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. Thus, novel strategies for the treatment of AE are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small ~22-nucleotide (nt) non-coding RNAs with a major role in regulating gene expression, have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets for treatment and control of helminth parasite infections. In this work, we analyzed the expression profile of E. multilocularis miRNAs throughout metacestode development in vitro. We predicted functional roles for highly expressed miRNAs and found that they could be involved in essential roles for survival and development in the host. We determined that E. multilocularis miR-71, a highly expressed miRNA that is absent in the human host, is expressed in germinative cells and in other cell types of the germinal layer in E. multilocularis metacestodes cultured in vitro. Germinative cells are a relevant cell type to target for anti-echinococcosis drug development. MiRNAs that are absent in the human host, involved in essential functions, highly expressed and/or expressed in germinative cells in E. multilocularis metacestodes may represent selective therapeutic targets for treatment and control of AE.
