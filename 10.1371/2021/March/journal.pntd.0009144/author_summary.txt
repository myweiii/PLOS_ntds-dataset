Oral ivermectin is a safe and efficacious drug for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases. To date, ivermectin is not indicated in children weighing less than 15 kg because there have been insufficient safety data to support a change of recommendation. A PRISMA-level systematic review was conducted, and 97 potential sources were identified. All lead investigators were contacted to share individual patient data if they could provide the minimum criteria. These were the known weights of the children less than 15 kg in whom there were possible adverse events. A total of 17 investigators replied, sharing individual-level patient data (IPD) from 15 studies, which represent a database of 1,088 children weighing less than 15 kg treated with oral ivermectin. Overall 18 adverse events were reported in 1.4% (15/1,088) of children, all of which were mild and self-limiting. No serious adverse events were recorded. These data suggest that ivermectin is safe for use in children weighing less than 15 kilograms. Further data from well-designed clinical trials are needed to assess the safety of oral ivermectin at escalating doses in children weighing less than 15 kg.
