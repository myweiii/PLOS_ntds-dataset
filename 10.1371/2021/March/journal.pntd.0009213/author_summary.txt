Uganda has had multiple Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever outbreaks since 2013 when the first outbreak was confirmed. Tick exposure has been identified as the major risk factor by our study and this finding was similar with other studies done during outbreaks in Uganda. However, Uganda still lacks national tick control guidelines and indiscriminate use of acaricides (pesticides specially for ticks) has been observed widely. This has been cited to influence increased tick resistance to acaricides. Our study might not indicate whether tick resistance to acaricides has increased tick populations in Uganda however it is imperative that tick control is considered in efforts of prevention and control of CCHF outbreaks. We therefore recommend improved tick control in Uganda through national regulations on acaricide distribution and use, development of strategies to reduce tick resistance to acaricides in the country, and more community-based engagement of tick control in livestock management.
