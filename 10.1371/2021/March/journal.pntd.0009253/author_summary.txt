Cystic echinococcosis remains a major public health problem in Morocco. It is a major zoonosis affecting humans and animals caused by the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus. The dog (final host), plays an essential role in the dissemination of eggs in the environment via its feces. The rural and poorest regions in the Middle Atlas that practice extensive sheep farming (intermediate host) are severely affected. Women and children are particularly affected by this zoonosis. Despite previous efforts done by the Moroccan authorities to reduce the incidence of infestation, these measures have been insufficient to control the disease. Through our study protocols in natural field conditions, we have shown that vaccination of the intermediate host is an effective control option in the Moroccan context, with an immune protection rate of 97%. Regular chemotherapy (4 months intervals) of owned dogs only proved to have little efficiency on incidence in sheep.
