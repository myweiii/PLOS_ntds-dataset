Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are two prime mosquito vectors that transmit emerging arboviral pathogens (e.g. dengue virus, Zika virus and chikungunya virus), which cause substantial disease burden in humans. This study attempts to improve previous studies to map the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus with greater validation and provide a finer resolution of current and future projections of mosquito populations. We found evidence of an asymmetrical competitive interaction between Aedes vectors where Aedes aegypti is suppressed by Aedes albopictus. In addition to the role of species interactions, abiotic factors, including meteorological factors and human population density, are important predictors of the distribution of these two Aedes mosquito species. Our models demonstrate the potential to predict the occurrence and abundance of the two Aedes vectors, which can enhance domestic mosquito control efforts.
