Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are parasitic worms transmitted through the faecal-oral or transcutaneous route. STHs are ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical regions where access to clean water, improved sanitation, and hygiene are lacking. STH infections are often asymptomatic; however, heavy infections can cause adverse effects such as abdominal discomfort and anaemia. Anaemia in pregnancy can increase the risk of pregnancy problems such as miscarriage, preterm delivery, and poor fetal growth. This retrospective analysis of routinely collected data from more than 12,000 pregnant refugee and migrant women who attended antenatal care clinics along the Thai-Myanmar border shows that one in five pregnant women were infected with STHs. Moreover, pregnant women with a STH infection were more likely to present with anaemia, suggesting that early presentation to antenatal care as well as anthelmintic treatment with subsequent anaemia prophylaxis may reduce the risk of anaemia. Interestingly, our data also indicate that STH infections may have beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes, as miscarriage was less likely to occur in pregnancies with maternal STH infections. This finding was significant for infection with the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. Verification of these findings in prospective studies is warranted.
