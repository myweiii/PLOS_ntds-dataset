Viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) are amongst the most significant public health concerns of recent years due to the increase in global cases and the rapid spread of the vectors. The primary method of controlling the spread of these arboviruses is through mosquito control. Understanding factors associated with risk of these viruses is key for informing control programmes and predicting when outbreaks may occur. Climate is an important driver in mosquito development and virus reproduction and hence the association of climate with disease risk. Socio-economic factors contribute to perpetuate disease risk. Areas of high poverty have abundance of suitable habitat for Ae. aegypti (e.g. due to poor housing and sanitation). This study investigated the factors affecting arbovirus incidence in three distinct regions of Colombia: Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá. The results show significant relationships between disease incidence and temperature, precipitation and wind speed. A decline in dengue following outbreaks of Zika (2016) is also reported. Measures of poverty, including critical overcrowding and no access to improved water source were also found to be higher in areas of higher disease incidence. The results of this study highlight the importance of using a multifactorial approach when designing vector control programs in order to effectively distribute local health care resources.
