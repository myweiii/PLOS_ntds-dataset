Global protein profiles were compared among a susceptible strain of Cx. pipiens pallens and strains that were cypermethrin-resistant, propoxur-resistant, and dimethyl-dichloro-vinyl-phosphate-resistant after 25 generations of selection by distinct chemical insecticide families, multiple mechanisms were found to operate simultaneously in resistant mosquitoes of Cx. pipiens pallens, including mechanisms to lower penetration of or sequester the insecticide or to increase biodegradation of the insecticide via subtle alterations in either the cuticular protein levels or the activities of detoxification enzymes (P450s and glutathione S-transferases).
