Climate change impacts vector-borne disease incidence by influencing vectors’ habitat and behaviors. As a rodent-borne disease, HFRS’s incidence rate fluctuates with the change of meteorological factors. In this study, we model the meteorological factors and time-series cases to explore the exposure-lag-response effect and interaction between meteorological factors on the risk of HFRS, respectively. The result showed there exist a lag effect between meteorological factors and the occurrence of HFRS and we find that a temperature higher than 23 Celsius degrees resulted in a significantly higher HFRS incidence after 15 weeks; a relative humidity higher than 93% led to a significantly higher incidence after 10 weeks. Also, a synergistic interaction between high temperature and high precipitation on HFRS risk was detected, this effect can be attributed to increased animal reproduction and food resources under this environment. This study provides a basis for in-depth evaluating the impact of meteorological factors and their interaction on HFRS.
