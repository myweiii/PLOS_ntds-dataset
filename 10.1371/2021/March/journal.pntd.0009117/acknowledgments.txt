This work was carried out as part of the onchocerciasis elimination activities of the National NTD Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, which is assisted by SightSavers. We are grateful to the Regional Director of Health of the Cascades and his staff for the material support and the mobilization of community leaders. We also thank the community distributors of the study villages who helped the mobilization of the study participants. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to all the inhabitants of the study villages for their participation to this study and their kindness.
