In 1989, onchocerciasis had been eliminated as a public health problem throughout Burkina Faso by insecticidal treatment of vector breeding sites, but epidemiological surveys along the Comoé River in 2010/11 revealed a recrudescence of infection rates. Modern onchocerciasis control is based upon mass drug administration using ivermectin, and hence biannual distribution of ivermectin was instigated to bring the recrudescence under control. However, it was by no means certain that this was an appropriate strategy because the area was already under mass drug administration with ivermectin since 2004 to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Onchocerca volvulus adult females with reduced susceptibility to ivermectin have been reported from Ghana, and if the Burkinabe recrudescence was the result of reduced susceptibility, ivermectin might fail to solve the problem. To test this, a cohort of positive people was examined for the density of microfilariae in their skin six months after the second round of ivermectin. The reduction in microfilarial load was substantial, and comparable to levels found in ivermectin-naïve populations (normally assumed to be susceptible), but greater than Ghanaian populations with reduced susceptibility. On this basis we conclude that the Burkinabe recrudescence was not the result of parasites with reduced susceptibility to ivermectin, and biannual treatment remains the chosen means to deal with the recrudescence.
