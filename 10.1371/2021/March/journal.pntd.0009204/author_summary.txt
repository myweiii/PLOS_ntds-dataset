Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease with an estimated incidence of 50,000 to 90,000 cases in 2019 but the case burden used to be much higher. This drop is mostly the result of the ongoing elimination campaign in the Indian sub-continent that started in 2005. A preponderance of male cases has been observed in community-based surveys carried out in VL endemic regions and also in some clinical trials. We did a systematic review of all published clinical trials (1980â€“2019) and carried out a random effects meta-analysis estimating the proportion of males enrolled in these studies. We found that overall between two-thirds and three-fourths were males, with substantial heterogeneity in the estimates across and within regions and the imbalance was less pronounced in studies enrolling children. Despite a trend for decreasing proportion of males enrolled over time, there were still 1.8 times as many males than females even in more recent trials. Our review suggests that antileishmanial therapeutic efficacy guidelines are informed by knowledge derived from a study population that is heavily skewed towards adult males, overwhelmingly from high-burden countries of the Indian sub-continent and Eastern Africa, though with some notable regional variations and substantial heterogeneity. This situation has led to a substantial lesser knowledge in optimal treatment strategies for female patients.
