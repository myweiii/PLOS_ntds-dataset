Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a global infectious disease, has a high disease burden in China. This study aimed to explore the temporal and spatial distribution of the disease by analyzing its epidemiological characteristics and to calculate the early warning signals of HFMD by using a logistic differential equation (LDE) model. Our findings showed that 1) the HFMD disease burden in China remained high and HFMD incidence in the southern region was higher than that in the northern region; and 2) the HFMD early warnings times across China were heterogeneous. One high incidence period occurred in the northern regions during summer, peaking in June every year, while in the southern regions two waves emerged every year. Over the southern regions, the disease appeared to spread faster in the spring wave than in the autumn wave. These results provide important information for public health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff to predict and prepare for the onset of the high active periods of HFMD, especially by indicating the heterogeneous warning times of HFMD outbreak across different geographical regions in Mainland China.
