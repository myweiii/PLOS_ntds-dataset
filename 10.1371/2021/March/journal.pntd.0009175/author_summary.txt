Global efforts are underway to reach the goal of elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. A crucial step in elimination programs is the verification of elimination, including surveillance of former transmission foci. This systematic review assessed and evaluated a wide range of diagnostic tools for detection of Schistosoma parasites in snails and water. Our analysis revealed that along with standard snail shedding methods, molecular methods such as PCR, qPCR and LAMP are becoming the widely adopted standard approaches to detect schistosomes in snails. Recent developments in eDNA methods are further enabling novel surveillance capabilities for snails and schistosomes in water and are likely to become more widely adopted. While there is currently a plethora of techniques to choose from, there is a clear need for further field testing and development of standardized protocol for the most promising among them, including eDNA, ddPCR, qPCR and LAMP methods. Future studies focused on field-worthy detection approaches and their efficacy and sensitivity in the field will be a corner stone in development of control and elimination programs.
