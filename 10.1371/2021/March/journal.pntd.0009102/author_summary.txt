Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that causes production losses in livestock due to abortions, increased calving intervals and reduced milk production. The disease can also be transmitted to humans via direct contact with livestock when they give birth or abort or via consumption of unpasteurised dairy products. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of exposure to the bacteria (Brucella spp.) in cattle and buffalo in Ludhiana district, Punjab State, India. In addition, persons in contact with these livestock, either through their occupation or household, were also tested for Brucella spp. antibodies and the data used to identify factors increasing their risk of exposure. The study found high levels of exposure in cattle and buffalo in the study area with 15.1% of large ruminants testing positive for antibodies to Brucella spp. (seropositive) and approximately a third of dairy farms having at least one animal test seropositive. Around 10% of people tested seropositive for the bacteria and those that assisted with calving and/or abortion on a farm where at least one animal tested seropositive had a high risk of infection. Control of brucellosis could reduce production losses in livestock and protect humans in contact with livestock from becoming infected.
