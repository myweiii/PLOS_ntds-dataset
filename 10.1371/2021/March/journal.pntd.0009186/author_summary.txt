Murine typhus, a febrile disease caused by Rickettsia typhi, is often misdiagnosed due to its non-specific presentation. Evidence suggests that murine typhus is more prevalent in Greece than originally believed. We retrospectively collected clinical and epidemiological data for all the patients with confirm and probable murine typhus diagnosed in our laboratory the last eight years and we found evidence of murine typhus throughout Greece. Comparing this evidence to other studies, we found that most of Greek patients presented rash and the typical triad probably due to the awareness of physicians, as during our interrogation, most of physicians mentioned that they considered murine typhus based on rash appearance. Finally, we found that most murine typhus cases in the city of Athens were associated with sunbathing on the beach and we raise the question of beach littering in murine typhus endemic areas.
