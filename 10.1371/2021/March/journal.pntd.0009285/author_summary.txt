Guinea worm eradication depends on detecting people and animals with the disease in order to prevent transmission. The situation in Chad is especially urgent because the number of domestic dogs with Guinea worm has been rapidly increasing in the past five years, and now represents the vast majority of Guinea worm cases globally. The global Guinea Worm Eradication Program, the Chad Guinea Worm Eradication Program, and the Chad Ministry of Public Health requested an investigation to evaluate the associations between Guinea worm knowledge, community engagement, and case detection and to investigate how the active surveillance system could be improved to more effectively detect and contain every Guinea worm case. We surveyed 627 people across 45 villages in Chad. We found that Chadâ€™s system for monitoring Guinea worm operates unevenly, with some villagers receiving frequent visits by community volunteers and other villagers reporting never being visited. Villagers visited by a community volunteer at least twice per week had much better knowledge of Guinea worm symptoms and prevention, compared with villagers visited less frequently. Community volunteers are instrumental to Guinea worm eradication efforts in Chad because they transmit key educational messages that facilitate disease detection. More efforts should be made to increase volunteer accountability and to provide volunteers and their supervisors with targeted, high quality training.
