The management of dengue fever, spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a major challenge to public health in southern coastal Ecuador. This is particularly true in the city of Machala, Ecuador, where the annual number of dengue fever cases is historically high. In this study, we bring together mosquito survey and dengue human infection data to describe household characteristics that are associated with dengue risk in Machala. Household surveys were conducted to determine the presence of adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, household-level dengue infection status, and to collect information on housing conditions, members of the household, and mosquito prevention behaviors. Statistical analyses were performed to determine which household characteristics were linked to presence of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and dengue infection status. We identified several factors that were associated with increased risk of household mosquito presence, or dengue infections, in addition to protective characteristics associated with lower risk. Interestingly, presence of female Ae. aegypti did not predict which households would have dengue infections. These findings add to our understanding of mosquito-borne disease risk in Machala, and in the larger region of southern Ecuador, aiding in the development of improved mosquito and arbovirus control and surveillance efforts.
