Symptoms of MERS are atypical, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and occasionally pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms. As a result, it is difficult to distinguish from other respiratory pathogens based on the clinical symptoms. MERS-CoV is routinely diagnosed using real-time RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR has great advantages in sensitivity and specificity compared with other molecular techniques; nevertheless, it is only suitable for well-equipped or central laboratories due to the demand for sophisticated alternating temperature and fluorescent capture instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated the MERS-CoV RT-RPA-VF assay. Compared to the gold standard real-time RT-PCR, the former was less time consuming and had lower equipment requirements. Thus, this panel may be preferred to rapidly detect MERS-CoV in low-resource settings, even as a point-of-care approach for the timely prevention and control of a pandemic.
