Zika virus (ZIKV) gained global attention during an explosive outbreak in the Americas in 2015â€“16 when it was causally associated with the constellation of birth defects now termed congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). However, a substantial proportion of gestational ZIKV infections result in babies without apparent birth defects. Could there be other factors that influence ZIKV pathogenicity? For example, it is well-established that pre-existing immunity to one dengue virus (DENV) serotype can enhance the severity of a secondary DENV infection. ZIKV is antigenically closely related to DENV, but whether DENV-specific antibodies enhance the severity of ZIKV infection is unclear. To answer this question, we used our non-human primate model of ZIKV to assess the impact of pre-existing immunity to DENV on ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy. We did not observe any difference in ZIKV replication in plasma between macaques that were immune to DENV and those that were not. However, there was more ZIKV vRNA detected in the placenta of macaques immune to DENV, suggesting DENV immunity could enhance ZIKV infection of the placenta. As vaccines to both DENV and ZIKV are developed, it remains critical to understand the risks of DENV immunity for pregnant women exposed to ZIKV.
