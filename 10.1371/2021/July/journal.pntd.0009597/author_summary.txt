Soil-transmitted helminth infections exhibit a significant negative impact on population health worldwide. In particular in endemic regions sub-groups such as children suffer disproportionally from infection due to impoverished living conditions. Yet many of these regions have no or limited availability of infection prevalence data to inform intervention strategies. Application of low sensitivity diagnostic tools such as microscopy exacerbate this issue. Moving towards molecular tools is key in order to establish a more accurate and complete epidemiological profile that can serve as a reference standard for future studies. Recently, a number of studies investigated the microbiota as an important factor determining overall patient health. The gut microbiota can be altered through medication, lifestyle factors and co-inhabitation of the same environmental niche with STHs. However, these microbiota studies often lack a characterised baseline. The current study provides baseline epidemiology data for a cohort of pre-school and school-age Thai children using a molecular diagnostic technique. We estimate the STH infection prevalence and intensity and characterise the host gut microbiota profile at a single cross-sectional timepoint comparing infected with uninfected children. This data can serve as a starting point for future studies investigating the impact of environmental factors and parasitic infections on patient health.
