Generally, the clinical diagnosis of acute Q fever, which is caused by Coxiella burnetii, is based on serologic methods that detect the presence antibodies produced by the body to fight the infection. However, the lag time between becoming infected and production of antibodies limits early diagnosis using this method. Here, we confirmed an epidemic of human Q fever in Zhuhai, a contemporary city in China, using clinical metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and cell phone location data. Our results indicate that Cb-infected goats and cattle at the only official authorized slaughterhouse in Zhuhai were the likely infection source for the Q fever epidemic. More importantly, we demonstrate that mNGS is a useful tool for rapid and effective public health responses to acute bacterial infections.
