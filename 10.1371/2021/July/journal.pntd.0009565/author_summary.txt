Microscopic agglutination test is the most commonly used serological test in the diagnosis of leptospirosis. The test uses a live panel of Leptospira representing main serogroups and for proper performance of the test, an optimised panel which react well with patient samples need to be selected. This paper describes the procedure of selecting such an optimised panel for Sri Lanka which is a country hyper-endemic for leptospirosis. The test was done on serum samples collected from patients presented with acute undifferentiated fever with 24 panel of serogroups and 15 were selected as the optimised panel. The test was found to have a low sensitivity in the acute stage and ELISA based serological tests with molecular diagnosis using PCR assays would be a better way for diagnosis of leptospirosis.
