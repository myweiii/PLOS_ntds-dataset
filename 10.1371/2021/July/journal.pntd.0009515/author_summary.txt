Urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium (Sh) is a neglected tropical disease that is widespread in Africa and the Middle East. It is estimated that more than 100 million people are infected for a total population of 1600 million in these areas. Humans are infected during contact with freshwater by direct skin penetration by larvae. At present, the diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis is based on the complementarity of serological technique and urine microscopic examination (ME). ME remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in Africa. The aim of this work was to evaluate 2 new techniques and compare it to ME in order to improve the diagnosis from 914 urine samples. The first technique (Immunochromatographic antigen technique) showed a specificity of 39%, too poor to be used in low or non-endemic areas as in Europe. The second technique allowing (DNA based diagnostic -PCR) enabled us to increase the number of positive results by a factor of 2.4, from 54 diagnoses by ME to 128 by PCR. In view of our results, we decided to screen urogenital schistosomiasis by direct ME always coupled by PCR, which has shown better reliability criteria.
