    "Background": "The diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis is based on the complementarity of serological technique and microscopic examination (ME). Between 2015 and 2019, the number of urinary schistosomiasis tests received in our laboratory increased sharply from 300 to 900 per year.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "914 urine samples from 846 patients suspected of urogenital schistosomiasis were prescribed and analyzed by PCR and also by antigenic technique for the first 143 samples. The antigenic technique evaluated was Schisto POC-CCA, Rapid Medical Diagnostics. These results (antigenic technique and PCR) were compared to ME which was performed from all urines.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Targeted Sh and Sm PCRs in urine are reliable techniques compared to ME (reference technique). In view of our results, we decided to screen urinary schistosomiasis by direct ME always coupled by the PCR technique, which has shown better reliability criteria."
