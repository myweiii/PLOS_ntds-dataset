The West African Ebola epidemic of 2013â€“2016 killed nearly 4,000 Sierra Leoneans and devastated health infrastructure. There is limited information regarding the effects of the epidemic on health seeking behavior. Lassa fever is clinically similar to Ebola and is prevalent in Kenema District, located in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. There was a significant decline in the number of individuals seeking care for suspected Lassa fever following the epidemic. Responses to a questionnaire completed by 194 Sierra Leonean residents suggested that confidence in the healthcare system was not fully restored. Cost was identified as a major deterrent to seeking healthcare. Additional community sensitization is needed to convey the need, and importance, of seeking care for Lassa fever.
