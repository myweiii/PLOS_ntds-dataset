Yellow fever (YF) is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes and represents an important health problem in countries of South America and Africa, with recent outbreaks in the past few years. Severe cases lead to fulminant hepatitis and death; it has also been reported that surviving patients tend to recover / “regenerate” the liver after the acute phase of the disease. However, there are no prior investigations on this matter. Thus, we followed up a group of previously healthy patients who had severe YF 6 months after the initial symptoms, using a non-invasive ultrasound technique of estimating the liver fibrosis (scar tissue) grade, called elastography. In our findings, we report a low frequency of liver fibrosis. Thus, we concluded that patients who had severe YF are not likely to have late-term liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Nevertheless, there are some specific individuals (older or with chronic diseases) that might need further evaluation.
