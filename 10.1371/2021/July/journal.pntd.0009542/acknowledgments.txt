This work was carried out in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree for M.G. Casafús and M.M. Favalesso at the National University of Northeast (UNNE) and Buenos Aires (UBA) from Argentina, respectively (both are recipients of fellowships from CONICET). We would like to thank the MERNR and the Instituto Misionero de Biodiversidad (Misiones, Argentina) for permission and collaboration to conduct research on venomous lepidopterans in this province, the National Parks Administration (APN, Argentina) for permission to research this insect group in the Argentine Iguazu National Park (authorization number 425), and the INMeT and the UNIOESTE for logistic collaboration to conduct this research. We are immensely grateful to the physician and nursing staff–especially Esteban Couto and Andrea Gularte–from the SAMIC Hospital of Puerto Iguazú city for working together in an integrative approach to lonomism in Misiones, and to colleagues from the biotoxinology team of INMeT for collaboration in obtaining georeferenced data in Misiones. We are especially indebted to all the volunteers and park rangers that helped us with fieldwork, to the taxonomists Fabian Gatti, Leo Rangel and Carolina Peichoto for his valuable help in the identification of host plants of Lonomia, and to all the participants in the interviews and field visits for their time and cooperation, without them this work would not have been possible.
