Caterpillars of the genus Lonomia (Saturniidae: Hemileucinae) are considered the world’s most deadly lepidopterans. Due to the increasing number of cases and the lack of antivenom therapy, envenomation by these animals constitutes an emerging and somewhat neglected public health issue in Argentina and neighboring countries. Our research has determined the eco-epidemiological scenario of such an envenomation in the Argentine province of Misiones–mainly covered by the Atlantic Forest (a suitable biome for L. obliqua)–, and identified some predictors to occurrences/accidents with this insect. This study also provides the first map of the potential risk of lonomism in this province, which has several natural attractions visited by millions of tourists worldwide. We discussed our findings in light of immediate response from health authorities to outline preventive strategies for accidents and conservation of this venomous lepidopteran in its ecological niche.
