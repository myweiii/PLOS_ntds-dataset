Animal and human rabies were still significant public health problems in China. In the past 15 years, although the annual human deaths from rabies have decreased steadily, the proportion change in human deaths from rabies varied with diverse population groups. This condition reflected the different recognition and attention to rabies of various populations. We applied a continuous deterministic SEIR model to study the spread of rabies among canines and from canines to different human groups. Numerical simulation results showed that the proportion of human deaths from rabies in central regions, the populations over 45 years old and the farmers in China increase year by year, and transmission intensity of rabies from canines to the above groups are higher than the nationwide level. Finally, our research indicated that to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating human rabies by 2030, the immunization status of high-risk human groups and mammals in corresponding areas should be enhanced, and the cooperation with various departments related to human, animal and the environment should be enhanced in line with the concept of One Health.
