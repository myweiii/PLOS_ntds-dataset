Our immune system has an enormous capacity of recognizing and responding to foreign antigens and, likewise, presents an extremely efficient mechanism of controlling these responses. Here, we investigated how a specific cell type with regulatory abilities can interfere in the immunological response against tuberculosis bacillus. For this, we used blood samples from individuals sensitized with the bacillus and patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis to understand how these cells act and their impact on the host/parasite relationship in the development of the disease. We could observe the negative impact that such regulatory cells cause during the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, decreasing the control/elimination of the bacillus in asymptomatic individuals and patients with tuberculosis. We also observed a recovery in the immune response when Treg cells were removed during in vitro challenge, restoring the capacity of Mtb clearance. Thus, these regulatory cells, when present, may represent a possible facilitator of the asymptomatic permanence of the bacillus, or even of the development of the disease itself. These data allowed us to see latency and tuberculosis from a new angle and thus postulate new approaches to fight tuberculosis.
