Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant endemic infectious disease in Latin America and is spreading in the U.S. and Europe with the presence of its insect transmission vector. No approved vaccine against Chagas disease exists. We describe a vaccine candidate based on a carbohydrate found on the T. cruzi cell surface, linked in the vaccine to a virus-like particle that provides a strong and focused immune response. Mice were immunized and challenged with the Trypanosoma cruzi parasites from two strains (Y and Colombian). Vaccination conferred substantial protection of mice against infection, compared with the unvaccinated group. Vaccinated animals presented low parasitemia, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IFN-Î³, decreased cardiomyocyte damage, and rapid clearance of parasite nests from heart tissue. These effects were especially significant at time points modeling chronic disease, an important consideration for this pathogen. We, therefore, believe this is a valuable path to pursue in the development of vaccines against Chagas disease.
