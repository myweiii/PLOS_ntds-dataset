Plasmodium vivax causes patent infection of red blood cells and latent infection of the liver. Radical cure for malaria effectively kills parasites in both blood and liver stages. Currently, radical cure for malaria involves either primaquine or tafenoquine, both of which cause acute hemolytic anemia in patients with an inherited defect in G6PD enzymatic activity. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked disorder and it is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. Heterozygous females having one mutated and one normal gene may screen as G6PD normal in qualitative enzyme activity screening prior to primaquine therapy and be at risk of proceeding to hemolytic crisis. To date, there is no evidence-based G6PD activity cut-off value to distinguish those females who may not safely receive primaquine. This study aimed to inform this cut-off by a large survey of females by quantitative G6PD activity phenotyping along with genotyping of the G6PD gene. Two thousand females residing in a meso-endemic area in eastern Indonesia were screened for G6PD deficiency using qualitative and quantitative tests. Those with <80% G6PD activity of normal were genotyped. Among them, we found 0.3% were compound heterozygotes, 2.7% were homozygotes, 68.4% were heterozygotes for five variants of severe G6PD deficiency, and the rest (28.6%) were G6PD-normal. Applying a 70% cut-off excluded most of the G6PD-normals with relatively few G6PD-deficient females also being excluded. Our findings showed that 9.5% of the surveyed population would be at risk of misclassification as normal if using a qualitative test for G6PD deficiency. This study highlights the importance of quantitative G6PD screening of females living in a rural malarious area of Indonesia where G6PD prevalence is high and the variants are severe. Our evidence indicates a cut-off value of 70% of normal may be optimal for safe delivery of primaquine or tafenoquine therapies with minimal exclusion of those who may safely receive it.
