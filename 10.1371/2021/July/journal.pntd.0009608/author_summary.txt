Rubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can affect fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or birth of a baby with a combination of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Vaccination with rubella containing vaccine (RCV) is recommended as one of the strategies for eliminating rubella/CRS. The Southeast Asia region has set a target to eliminate rubella/CRS by 2023. Towards this goal, India completed nationwide immunization campaigns using measles-rubella vaccine during 2017–19, targeting children aged 9 months to <15 years. A case-based surveillance for CRS was initiated in five sentinel hospitals (Phase-1) in 2016 and later expanded to additional 6 sites (Phase-2) in 2019, to estimate burden of CRS and monitor its trend. As an adjunct to CRS surveillance, periodic serologic surveys were also planned to monitor the rubella seroprevalence among the pregnant women. A serosurvey conducted in 2017 indicated that 83.4% pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Phase-1 sentinel hospitals had IgG antibodies against rubella. The second serosurvey conducted during 2019–20 in 6 Phase-2 sites indicated a comparable seroprevalence of 82.3%. Using seroprevalence data from these two serosurveys, we estimated that the annual incidence of CRS in India was 225.58 per 100,000 live births with constant force of infection and 65.47 per 100,000 live births with age-dependent force of infection models. This incidence rates translated to an estimated 14,520 to 50,028 infants with CRS every year. The estimates of CRS incidence will serve as a baseline to monitor the progress towards the elimination goal of rubella/CRS in India.
