Plasmodium vivax malaria causes frequent hospital admissions of infants and toddlers in areas of intense transmission in the Asia-Pacific region, often due to severe anemia, but its epidemiology and burden have been understudied in children from other endemic settings. Here we characterize the cumulative impact of P. vivax infections in infants and toddlers exposed to relatively low levels of malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon. We have previously shown that vivax malaria in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of maternal anemia and impaired fetal growth in this population. Now we show that the adverse effects of malaria extend to early childhood. Children born to mothers who had one or more infections during pregnancy are at an elevated risk of P. vivax malaria in their early life, although the transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus may provide some short-term protection. Children who are repeatedly infected with P. vivax since birth are more likely to be anemic at the age of 2 years. These findings further challenge the traditional view of vivax malaria as a relatively benign infection in pregnancy and early childhood in the Amazon.
