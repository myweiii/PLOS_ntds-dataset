Phlebotomine sand flies are tiny insects transmitting unicellular parasites called Leishmania worldwide. They are bad flyers and are known to be a group dispersing according to historical events. No invasive species are known within Phlebotomine sandflies. Their taxonomy includes about 40 genera. In the Old World, the subgenus Paraphlebotomus includes the main vectors of Leishmania tropica, the agent of a cutaneous leishmaniasis mostly in North Africa visceral and the Middle West. The goal of this study was to explore the phylogeny and the biogeographical history of this subgenus using a new generation sequencing technique. We successfully amplified DNA copies from the selected DNA extracts, some of them being more than 20 years old. We fully resolved the phylogeny of the subgenus Paraphlebotomus who was not recovered as monophyletic, meaning it does not include all the ascendants of last common ancestor. Consequently, the taxonomy was revised with the creation of a new subgenus. We also suggest that Paraphlebotomus originated about 10 million years ago. After a first split isolating North African species, the Messinian crisis caused by the aridification of the Tethys (the ancestor of the Mediterranean Sea) occurring 7 million years ago allowed the divergence of the main lineages including that of Phlebotomus sergenti the most important vector of the group. Most recent radiation events occurred during the Pleistocene. The historical biogeography of these Phlebotomine sandflies are closely related to that of the Leishmania they transmit.
