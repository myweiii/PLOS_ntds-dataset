    "Abstract": "Phlebotomine sand flies are the main natural vectors of Leishmania, which cause visceral and tegumentary tropical diseases worldwide. However, their taxonomy and evolutionary history remain poorly studied. Indeed, as for many human disease vectors, their small size is a challenge for morphological and molecular works. Here, we successfully amplified unbiased copies of whole genome to sequence thousands of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) markers from single specimens of phlebotomines. RAD markers were used to infer a fully resolved phylogeny of the subgenus Paraphlebotomus (11 species + 5 outgroups, 32 specimens). The subgenus was not recovered as monophyletic and we describe a new subgenus Artemievus subg. nov. Depaquit for Phlebotomus alexandri. We also confirm the validity of Ph. riouxi which is reinstated as valid species. Our analyses suggest that Paraphlebotomus sensu nov. originated ca 12.9\u20138.5 Ma and was possibly largely distributed from peri-Mediterranean to Irano-Turanian regions. Its biogeographical history can be summarized into three phases: i) a first split between Ph. riouxi + Ph. chabaudi and other species that may have resulted from the rise of the Saharan belt ca 8.5 Ma; ii) a Messinian vicariant event (7.3\u20135.3 Ma) during which the prolonged drought could have resulted in the divergence of main lineages; iii) a recent radiation event (3\u20132 Ma) that correspond to cycles of wet and dry periods in the Middle East and the East African subregions during the Pleistocene. Interestingly these cycles are also hypothetical drivers of the diversification of rodents, in the burrows of which Paraphlebotomus larvae develop. By meeting the challenge of sequencing pangenomics markers from single, minute phlebotomines, this work opens new avenues for improving our understanding of the epidemiology of leishmaniases and possibly other human diseases transmitted by arthropod vectors."
