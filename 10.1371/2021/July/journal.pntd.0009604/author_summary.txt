Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm transmitted through the bite of an infected blackfly. Onchocerciasis is, or used to be, endemic in many West, Central, and East African countries. Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and vector control have been used to prevent the spread of infection and effectively control onchocerciasis as a public health problem. In Central and East Africa, this was done under the mandate of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). In 2012, the World Health Organization targeted onchocerciasis for control and elimination. Here, we assess the impact of MDA with ivermectin on the prevalence of onchocercal morbidity in 1990 (pre-control), 2020, and 2030, and calculate the associated burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a composite measure of life years lost and years lived with disability. By 2030, we expect that 691 thousand DALYs will be lost in countries formerly covered by APOC. This burden is due to onchocercal skin disease in about 3.8 million people and onchocercal eye disease in about 384 thousand people, with most of this burden being concentrated in only a few countries.
