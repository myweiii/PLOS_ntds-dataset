Mosquito-borne arboviruses like West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), California serogroup virus (CSV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) are on the rise globally. Socioeconomic and environmental conditions have played a role in directing in this expansion by creating conditions ideal for mosquito vectors and transmission. In this study, we used 10 years (2007â€“2017) of county level human arboviral case data from the US state of Alabama to better understand the roles socioeconomics (poverty rate) and environmental (land use, precipitation, land cover) conditions may play in driving patterns of arboviral disease in the southern US. We found a significant association between poverty rate and incidence of WNV, an arbovirus primarily transmitted by Culex spp. mosquitoes, which are known for thriving in contaminated water sources and sewage overflow. Conversely, cases of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, arboviruses primarily transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, were reported in areas of high socioeconomic status. These findings suggest differential distribution of arboviruses relevant to human health in Alabama, and that poverty in the southern US is a significant factor that should be considered when planning WNV prevention and intervention strategies.
