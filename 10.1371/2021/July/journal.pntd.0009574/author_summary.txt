Chagas disease is one of the most important tropical diseases in the Americas. Since 2010, Colombia has implemented programs to interrupt the intradomiciliary transmission of T. cruzi by R. prolixus, Colombia’s primary vector. Boyaca, located in this country’s central region, is one of the most endemic departments for Chagas disease. Control measures have been implemented, and the intradomiciliary transmission of T. cruzi by R. prolixus has been significantly reduced in 24 municipalities, according to PAHO certifications. Currently, the main risks in these certified municipalities are the presence of secondary vectors and certain ecological conditions favorable to triatomines. In the present study, we provide evidence that T. dimidiata and T. venosa have become the most common species. We observed a cluster of these infected species in the northeast and southwest regions of Boyaca. P. geniculatus and P. rufotuberculatus were present but less abundant, and residual R. prolixus populations remain in some certified-free municipalities. The overall natural infection index of secondary vectors was 31%, and spatial analysis identified priority areas for implementing surveillance and control actions. We identified T. cruzi in municipalities above 2,000 meters above sea level, which traditionally are considered non-endemic regions in Colombia. This suggested new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease transmission in Colombia’s highlands and requires more studies to examine these scenarios.
