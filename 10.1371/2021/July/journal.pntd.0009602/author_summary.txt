One of the challenges in early drug discovery of small molecules is the improvement of the poor success rate in the translation from in vitro biological profile into efficacy in disease models, and ultimately in the clinic. Reductionist in vitro models on the bench may not properly recapitulate disease biology, thus overlooking critical properties of candidate compounds. Chagas Disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle. Despite the promising prospect based on in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, efforts to reposition antifungal azoles turned out to be disappointing in clinical trials, with treatment failure in Chagas patients. This raises the question of whether we are using the right preclinical tools for decision-making about moving compounds forward for the treatment of this disease. We hypothesise that in vitro potency and efficacy values alone might be distorting the translational power of preclinical compounds, and we propose the use of rate-of-kill (RoK) assays in high-throughput mode. Herewith we disclose a simple, systematic, and automated methodology of analysis of the otherwise complex kinetic patterns, which provides drug discoverers with a navigation guide along a compound optimisation program or prioritisation of best exemplars across different chemical series.
