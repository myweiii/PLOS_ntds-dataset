The neglected tropical disease human African trypanosomiasis is lethal unless treated. One of the treatments for the late stage–i.e. when parasites have invaded the central nervous system–of Gambian human African trypanosomiasis is the drug eflornithine, which is dosed as 50:50 racemic mixture of the two enantiomers L-eflornithine and D-eflornithine. This study showed that L-eflornithine was better than D-eflornithine at inhibiting the growth of parasites in vitro. The 50% inhibitory concentration for L-eflornithine was 5.5 μM in comparison to 50 μM for D-eflornithine. This higher in vitro potency for L-eflornithine warrants further studies to assess its potential as an improved treatment for late-stage Gambian human African trypanosomiasis.
