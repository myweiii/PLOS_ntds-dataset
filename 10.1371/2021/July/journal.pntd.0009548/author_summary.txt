Changes in global climate, which include higher temperatures and more frequent extreme temperature events, are expected to cause dramatic shifts in the distributions of infectious diseases. The geographic range of the mosquito Aedes aegypti continues to expand, risking greater incidence of viral diseases including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. One emerging solution to control these viruses is the release of the insect bacterium Wolbachia, whose infection in mosquitoes reduces virus transmission to humans. However, the effects of rising temperatures on the efficacy of this tool are unclear. Here, we studied whether DENV and Wolbachia can alter the thermal sensitivity of the mosquito Ae. aegypti by using a heat-based physiological assay. We demonstrate that, separately, DENV and Wolbachia infections increase mosquito thermal sensitivity, causing more rapid death when mosquitoes are exposed to extreme heat. The impacts of the microbes on mosquito thermal sensitivity were similar but not additive, suggesting they effect the mosquito in similar ways. Our work demonstrates that future global projections of DENV transmission risk and of Wolbachiaâ€™s potential efficacy may need to consider the impact of these microbes on vector survival.
