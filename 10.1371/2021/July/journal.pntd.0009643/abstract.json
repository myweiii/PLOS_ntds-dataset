    "Background": "Respiratory cryptosporidiosis has been documented in children with diarrhea. We sought to describe the dynamics of respiratory involvement in children hospitalized with gastrointestinal (GI) diarrheal disease.",
    "Methods": "We conducted a prospective, observational longitudinal study of Malawian children 2\u201324 months hospitalized with diarrhea. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, induced sputum and stool specimens were collected. Participants that were positive by Cryptosporidium PCR in any of the three compartments were followed up with fortnightly visits up to 8 weeks post-enrollment.",
    "Results": "Of the 162 children recruited, participants had mild-moderate malnutrition (mean HAZ -1.6 (SD 2.1)), 37 (21%) were PCR-positive for Cryptosporidium at enrollment (37 stool, 11 sputum, and 4 NP) and 27 completed the majority of follow-up visits (73%). Cryptosporidium was detected in all compartments over the 4 post-enrollment visits, most commonly in stool (100% at enrollment with mean cycle thresholds (Ct) of 28.8\u00b14.3 to 44% at 8 weeks with Ct 29.9\u00b14.1), followed by sputum (31% at enrollment with mean Ct 31.1\u00b14.4 to 20% at 8 weeks with Ct 35.7\u00b12.6), then NP (11% with mean Ct 33.5\u00b11.0 to 8% with Ct 36.6\u00b10.7). Participants with Cryptosporidium detection in both the respiratory and GI tract over the study period reported respiratory and GI symptoms in 81% and 62% of study visits, respectively, compared to 68% and 27%, respectively, for those with only GI detection, and had longer GI shedding (17.5\u00b16.6 v. 15.9\u00b12.9 days).",
    "Conclusion": "Cryptosporidium was detected in both respiratory and GI tracts throughout the 8 weeks post-enrollment. The development of therapeutics for Cryptosporidium in children should target the respiratory as well as GI tract."
