The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil has intensified global concern about congenital defects associated with intrauterine exposure. Social determinants are factors that reinforce and contribute to the transmission and spread of ZIKV as well as other arboviruses like Dengue. We performed a cross-sectional study to describe the prevalence of ZIKV and the contribution of social determinants to transmission among pregnant women during the 2015â€“2016 ZIKV epidemic in Salvador, Brazil. We found that 61% of pregnant women were ZIKV seropositive. We also found that lower education level, food insecurity and lower maternal age were associated with higher ZIKV infection risk. These findings contribute to understanding the role of social determinants in ZIKV transmission, providing key social factors that can be combined with pre-existing tactics (vector control and environmental improvement) to create policies and interventions which reduce social inequalities and risk of infection in vulnerable populations like pregnant women.
