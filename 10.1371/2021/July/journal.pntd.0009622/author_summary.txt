Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that is fatal if left untreated. Miltefosine is currently the only oral drug available but is increasingly failing to cure patients, resulting in its discontinuation as first-line drug in some endemic areas. To understand these treatment failures, we investigated the complex interplay of the parasite with the host immune system in the presence and absence of miltefosine. Our data indicate that miltefosine-resistant Leishmania parasites become severely hampered in their in vivo infectivity, which could be attributed to the induction of a pronounced innate immune response. Interestingly, the infection deficit was partially restored in the presence of miltefosine. Our results further indicate that miltefosine can exacerbate infections with resistant parasites by reducing innate immune recognition. This study provides new insights into the complex interplay between parasite, drug and host and discloses an immune-related mechanism of treatment failure.
