Crusted scabies is a severely debilitating skin disease with potentially fatal consequences that is endemic in some remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Early detection is essential to maximise the chance of recovery and help prevent transmission of scabies to others. There is little knowledge about how to actively detect crusted scabies, so we sought relevant knowledge about a disease with many similarities: leprosy. The review demonstrates the importance of ACD campaigns in communities facing the highest barriers to healthcare access and within neighbourhoods of index cases. Lessons for crusted scabies in the NT include the importance of skilled screening personnel and appropriate community engagement strategies to maximise screening uptake. More research is needed to assess ACD cost effectiveness, impact on disease control, and to explore ACD methods capable of capturing the homeless and highly mobile who may be missed in household centric models.
