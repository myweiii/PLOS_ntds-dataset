Scrub typhus is an infection that is caused by a rickettsial bacteria called Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted to humans through chigger mites. Scrub typhus has re-emerged as one of the most common life-threatening rickettsial infections accounting for a million cases annually. However, it is a largely overlooked public health problem in India.
This systematic review aims to integrate data obtained from medical literature over the past 10 years to estimate the burden of scrub typhus in India. It also intends to summarize the diagnostic tests that are most commonly used to confirm scrub typhus cases and to map the distribution of cases across India. The insights provided from this review will further enable policymakers to establish a surveillance system to observe this disease and initiate strategies to effectively control, and prevent the spread of, this neglected disease.
In this review, we found that scrub typhus is very common in India and affects multiple organs in the majority of positively tested patients. This increases complications and the risk of death. Improving awareness about this disease, increasing access to testing and initiating appropriate therapy early can help reduce this public health threat in the future.
