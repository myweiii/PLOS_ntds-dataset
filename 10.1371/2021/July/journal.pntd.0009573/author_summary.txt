Acute Q fever is endemic in Israel, yet the clinical and laboratory picture is poorly defined. We performed a retrospective study reviewing medical records of acute Q fever patients compared to those for whom acute Q fever was excluded. Serum samples from suspected cases were preliminary tested by a qualitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Confirmatory testing at the reference laboratory used an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Positive cases were defined as fever with at least one other symptom and accepted laboratory criteria. Cases not fulfilling these criteria and in which acute Q fever was excluded, served as a control group. Over 6 years, 484 patients tested positive by EIA. After confirmatory testing, 65 (13.4%) were positive for acute Q fever (with requisite clinical picture), 171 (35.3%) were definitely not infected, the remaining 248 were excluded because of past/chronic/undetermined infection. Most resided in urban areas without animal exposure. Pneumonia was seen in 57% of cases and a combination with headache/hepatitis was highly suggestive of acute Q fever diagnosis. Syncope/presyncope, fall and arthritis were more common in acute Q fever cases. We conclude that a syndromic approach to acute Q fever in combination with improved rapid diagnostic testing would be beneficial.
