Rabies-specific antibodies in unvaccinated domestic dogs have been reported in several studies, in some cases in a substantial proportion of the population. These antibodies may be the result of non-lethal rabies exposure leading to naturally acquired immunity, which could influence rabies transmission and persistence. In this study, a model was developed to consider a range of scenarios for naturally acquired immunity in a domestic dog population. Model outputs for rabies incidence and seroprevalence, the proportion of the population with rabies antibodies, were compared to estimates from empirical studies. Our results indicate that naturally acquired immunity could contribute to rabies persistence by limiting disease incidence and preventing population extinction. However, taking into account spatial structure and human response to high rabies incidence showed that rabies could persist without naturally acquired immunity, although immunity may contribute to the low incidence observed for endemic rabies. Assuming higher rates of subclinical exposure led to seroprevalences comparable to the estimates from empirical studies. However, uncertainty remains over the interpretation of rabies antibodies in unvaccinated individuals, and false positives may contribute to the high seroprevalences reported.
