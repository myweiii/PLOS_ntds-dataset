The Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits dengue, chikungunya, Zika and other viral diseases between humans. Previous research has shown that when a symbiotic bacterium called Wolbachia–which exists naturally in many other insect species–is introduced into Ae. aegypti mosquitoes it makes them less able to transmit dengue and other viruses, and is passed from generation to generation via mosquito eggs. The authors report that after releasing Wolbachia-carrying Ae. aegypti in the Brazilian city of Niterói for periods during 2017 to 2019, between 33% and 90% of the Ae. aegypti mosquito population in four release zones were infected with Wolbachia by March 2020. The authors used controlled interrupted time series analysis to show that Wolbachia deployments were associated with a 69% reduction in dengue cases notified to the public health authorities, compared to a control area of Niterói that did not receive Wolbachia releases. Chikungunya and Zika case incidence was also significantly lower in the Wolbachia release areas. These results support previous findings from Indonesia and Australia, and show that Wolbachia mosquito releases are an effective and sustainable method for controlling dengue and other diseases spread by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, even in large and complex urban environments.
