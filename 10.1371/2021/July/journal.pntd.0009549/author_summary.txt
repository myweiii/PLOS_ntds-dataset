Aedes aegypti is a primary vector of viral pathogens and is responsible for millions of human infections and pyrethroids are one of the most commonly used classes of insecticides to control adult A. aegypti. The insecticidal activity of pyrethroids depends on their ability to bind and disrupt the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC). A common mechanism of resistance to pyrethroids is due to mutations in Vssc (hereafter referred as knockdown resistance mutations, kdr). In this study, we found that a kdr (410L+1016I+154C) allele was the main mechanism of resistance in a pyrethroid-resistant strain of A. aegypti collected in Colombia. We determined the levels of resistance to pyrethroids, DCJW and DDT conferred by this allele. The 410L+1016I+1534C kdr allele does not confer higher levels of resistance to six out of 10 pyrethroids relative to the 1534C allele. Resistance conferred by kdr alleles can vary between pyrethroids and can vary between the stereoisomers. Knowing the levels of resistance conferred by different alleles to different insecticides provides valuable information for pest control and for understanding the evolution of resistance.
