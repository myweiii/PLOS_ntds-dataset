In the last decade one important issue concerning Chagas Disease (CD) is the active engagement of CD affected persons (patients, families, friends, students, and health professionals) as protagonists of a global struggle against neglection. Since 2015 CD patients of Fiocruz-Rio de Janeiro were in close contact with our education research group, where they were able to develop ArtScience activities related to information, education, and self-consciousness. This work paved the way for the creation of the Rio Chagas Association in 2016. However, its members often requested opportunities to offer activities of this nature in their birthplaces, where their families still live in a situation of socioeconomic vulnerability and at risk of infection. To address this request, our group developed a social technology called “Chagas Express XXI” (CE21), an expedition that offered 41 practical ArtScience activities that were co-created and co-mediated by people affected by DC, researchers, and graduate students. We tested CE21 in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, where 2,117 people filled out the participation forms. Among them, 1,100 adults requested the available serological test, and 20% were diagnosed with positive CD. These results support that CE21 could be used as a tool for active search of chronic asymptomatic cases. Further, 600 participants were registered to collaborate in health promotion nuclei to foster new associations of CD affected persons. Our study presents an innovative social technology to address prevention and health care for CD using non-formal learning and its corresponding educational resources. This education technology can be applied to other NTD by direct communication to people at risk of infection and/or affected in endemic areas. Science and health education are intimately related and the association with the art tools helps to improve knowledge communication to society.
