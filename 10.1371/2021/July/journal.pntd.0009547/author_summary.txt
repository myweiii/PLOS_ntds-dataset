Echinococcosis, a worldwide zoonosis caused by genus Echinococcus, is highly endemic in Tibet of China. CE and AE as two main types of Echinococcosis are causing serious health burdens, thereby attracting more attention to public health in Tibet. This work provides detailed geographical information about CE and AE prevalence based on the recorded human echinococcosis data from CDC. A geographical detector was employed to explore the potential environmental factors that influence these diseases and to quantify the specific contribution of each factor as well as discovering the interaction between factors. The results showed that biological factors have the most impact on the prevalence of echinococcosis, of which the yak population contributes most to CE while the dog population makes the most contribution to AE. Besides, the interactive results greatly improved the explanation of the two diseases, indicating that the echinococcosis prevalence is not simply affected by one factor, but by various interrelated factors. Such research can be beneficial to the evaluation, control projects, and prevention programs of the echinococcosis risk in Tibet.
