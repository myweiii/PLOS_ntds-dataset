Interest in Zika virus (ZIKV) has increased in the last decade due to its emergence and rapid spread in the Americas. In this review, we examine ZIKV clinical manifestations and sequelae in adults. Among studies reporting subjects with confirmed ZIKV and critical appraisal scores of at least 70%, symptoms reported include exanthema, fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Neurological sequelae in this group occurred in 0.3% of subjects, of which 75% were Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS). Recovery from GBS was variable: some patients returned to health and others endured chronic disability. Mortality was rare (0.1%). Hospitalization (11%) was often associated co-morbidities or GBS; this percentage perhaps reflects studies in which all reported subjects were hospitalized. Synthesizing reported data is challenging given the wide range of case definitions and ZIKV testing practices.
