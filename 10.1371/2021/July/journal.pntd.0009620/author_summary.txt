The fly round is a mobile method used to sample G. m. morsitans and G. m. centralis, important vectors of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. However, its effectiveness is largely dependent on the skill and ability of the operator(s) to catch flies using a hand net. Here, we report the evaluation of an alternative mobile sampling tool, the vehicle-mounted sticky trap (VST) which is independent of operator skill and ability to catch flies. We show that VST is more effective in catching both female and male G. m. morsitans and G. m. centralis compared to the black-screen fly round (BFR). Furthermore, VST covered the same distance of BFR in a much shorter time. This study provides a basis for the use of VST in large scale sampling of G. morsitans to determine its geographical limit, a critical aspect in the planning of vector control strategies and interventions.
