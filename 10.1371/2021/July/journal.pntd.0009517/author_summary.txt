Leishmaniasis and human bartonellosis, two neglected tropical diseases, are endemic in Peruvian Andean regions. However, no human bartonellosis cases has been reported in the Amazon jungle where leishmaniasis has high prevalence. The improvement of sand fly trapping methods and identification of putative Leishmania and Bartonella vectors across Andean and Amazonian regions are important steps towards the design of better control strategies and reducing the risk of transmission in endemic areas. In this paper the authors explored the effectiveness of different trap types, based in LED colors and odor attractants, for sand fly collections in endemic areas of leishmaniasis and bartonellosis. Also, we reported for the first time the detection of Bartonella DNA in sand fly species from the Peruvian Amazon jungle, and the first record in Peru of L. (V.) naiffi infecting Lu. hirsuta hirsuta. The information provided by this manuscript will serve as a baseline for future surveillance and intervention studies about sand fly species as potential vectors of Leishmania and Bartonella in highly endemic areas.
