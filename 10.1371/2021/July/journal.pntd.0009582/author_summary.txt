Podoconiosis is a disease of the lymphatic vessels of the lower extremities, caused by chronic exposure to irritant soils. It results in leg swelling, commonly complicated by acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA, or ‘acute attacks’), characterised by severe pain, fever and disability. The Gojjam Lymphoedema Best Practice Trial (GoLBeT) trial is a successfully completed randomised controlled trial of podoconiosis treatment that was conducted in the highlands of northern Ethiopia. In this study we report the steps involved in the setup of this trial, from inception to recruitment. The challenges faced are discussed, along with recommendations on how these could be overcome.
