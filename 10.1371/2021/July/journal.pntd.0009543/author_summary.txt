The zoonotic enteric parasites of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis are a One Health concern for human, animal and environmental health. In this study, human, animal, fly, and water samples were collected from 250 households in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Mongolia in conjunction with a household risk factor survey. Twenty percent of the households (n = 51) had at least one sample positive for Cryptosporidium spp. and/or Giardia duodenalis with several households demonstrating parasite presence in multiple sample types (9.8%, 5/51). Households that used unimproved drinking water, did not have access to an indoor handwashing site, were located in rural areas, and owned animals were associated with higher rates of parasite presence. Our findings show that zoonotic enteric parasite exposure is occurring at the household level and from different hosts, vectors, and vehicles. Public health efforts to prevent the further spread of disease should concentrate on increased water, sanitation and hygiene measures and One Health collaboration between human and animal health care disciplines.
