Nontuberculosis mycobacteria represent a large group of diverse bacteria that live across a range of environments. Human contact with the habitats in which these organisms live can result in opportunistic infections. Among the NTM, Mycobacterium ulcerans causes necrotic skin ulcers that can lead to significant long term physical impairment; Mycobacterium marinum causes granulomatous skin lesions; and Mycobacterium chimaera has been linked to contaminated heater-cooler units used during cardiac surgery, resulting in prosthetic heart valve infections that are particularly difficult to treat. We performed laboratory experiments to test the susceptibility of these NTM species (M. ulcerans, M. marinum and M. chimaera) to a recently developed antibiotic, SPR719. We found that SPR719 inhibits the growth of these mycobacteria at concentration ranges similar to or better than commonly used anti-mycobacterial antibiotics. As SPR720, the oral prodrug of SPR719, has recently completed a Phase I safety, tolerability and PK study in healthy human volunteers, the potential exists for this product to be explored for the treatment of NTM infections, where new treatment options are urgently needed.
