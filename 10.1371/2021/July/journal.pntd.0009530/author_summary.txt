Leishmaniases correspond to a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by protozoan parasites members of more than 20 Leishmania species. Leishmaniases are epidemiologically complex diseases. Their complexity relates to the diversity of species and transmission cycle components, often poorly elucidated. Risk factors for changing eco-epidemiological profiles include environmental and climate changes, migrations and conflicts, contributing to leishmaniases emergence in disease-free areas, leading to co-sympatry of the major pathogens in the same transmission areas and even foci. Taxonomical identification of the parasites is a central issue for patient management, molecular epidemiology and thus disease control and surveillance. Thus, development of adequate specific and sensitive DNA tools to identify and classify Leishmania parasites for surveillance and control remains a research priority. The DPPIII gene is an essential gene conserved in all Leishmania species. By comparative sequence analyses of the DPPIII gene fragments and the development of DPPIII-based PCR RFLP assays, we showed its potential for molecular diagnosis, epidemiology and taxonomy. We conclude that this molecular marker can be used to complement other molecular methods for OW Leishmania species identification and discrimination and can contribute to evidence- based disease control and surveillance.
