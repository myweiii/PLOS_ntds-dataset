EED is a subclinical condition of compromised gut integrity secondary to frequent and repeated exposure to enteropathogens in global settings with a high prevalence of undernutrition. In this study, we reported association of gut mucosal architecture with a dual sugar intestinal permeability assay (lactulose-rhamnose) in Pakistani children. In the presence of duodenal enteropathogens, features such as chronic inflammation, intra-epithelial lymphocytosis, enterocyte injury and Paneth cell reduction were consistently observed. When comparing undernourished cases and controls living in the same setting, we found urinary excretion of the sugars was similar among groups; however, variability in HAZ among children at 24 months was partially explained by a model that includes excretion values.
