Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a widespread parasitic disease caused by sand fly-borne parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex (L. donovani and L. infantum). Without early diagnosis and successful chemotherapy symptomatic human VL is fatal. Dogs are reservoir hosts of L. infantum, and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) often precedes outbreaks in local human populations. With dogs sampled within a region of emergent CVL in northern Argentina, we compared a range of diagnostic techniques, including microscopy, serology by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and detection and identification of Leishmania DNA. Novel serological assays based on the rK28 antigen were more sensitive than those based on rK39, and without evidence of cross reaction with six other canine pathogens. A commercial DNA detection kit (LAMP; Eiken Loopamp), used for the first time with CVL, was more sensitive than PCR on lymph node samples. Unexpectedly, we also found canine infection with the Viannia sub-genus of Leishmania. Our results reinforce the need for improved diagnosis, vigilance, surveillance and control of CVL.
