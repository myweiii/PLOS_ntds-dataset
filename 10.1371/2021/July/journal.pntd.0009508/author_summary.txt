Tuberculous pleural effusion is characterized by intense chronic accumulations of fluid and lymphocyte cells and monocytes/macrophages in the pleural space. Complement mediators play important roles in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection induced the amplification of complement activation in TPE. Complement activation produces anaphylatoxins that induce PMCs and CD16+ monocytes to secrete abundant cytokines capable of only inducing Th17 expansion, but Th1 was feeble. In addition, costimulatory molecules were more highly expressed in CD16+ than in CD16− monocytes isolated from TPE. The interactions between monocytes and PMCs enhanced the ability of PMCs and monocytes to produce cytokines and that of monocytes to express HLA-DR, CD40, CD80 and CD86, which synergistically induced Th17 expansion. In the above process, anaphylatoxins enhanced the interactions between monocytes and PMCs by increasing the level of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23 and upregulating the phenotype of CD40 and CD80 in CD16+ monocytes. In summary, these data highlighted the importance of anaphylatoxins and the innate immune system in eliciting pathogenic T cell responses in TPE and suggested that monocytes, especially the CD16+ subset, might be an efficient target for controlling inflammation.
