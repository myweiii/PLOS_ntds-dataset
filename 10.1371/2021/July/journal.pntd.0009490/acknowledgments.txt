This paper is dedicated to the memory of Dr Tanya Parkinson, without whom the project would never have happened. The authors would like to thank a large number of people who have helped the project along the way. In particular, Dr Tim Wells (MMV) provided invaluable guidance and input across a large range of topics throughout the project, provided the compound library which gave us the hits that were optimised and funded the provision of bulk material to help ensure speedy progression into development. Prof. Paul Fish (UCL), Prof. Dennis Smith (consultant), Dr Alan Brown (Salvensis) and Prof Simon Croft (LSHTM) all gave invaluable support and advice. Dr Thomas Spangenberg (Merck KGaA) also followed the project with interest; Merck have now taken the project on and are aiming to conduct experiments prior to development [33] Dr Oliver Kingsbury (Elkington & Fife) provided enormous help and time for free in preparation of the patents. We would also like to thank Sophie Howson and Rachel Gregory for assistance with maintenance of the S. mansoni life cycle at LSHTM, BRI-NIH, USA for providing us with infected Bulinus and Oncomelania snails, Dr Susanta Mondal, Dr Bikash Maity, Dr Mrinal Kundu & their colleagues at TCG Life Sciences and Jill Segelbacher at York Bioanalytical.
