Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite T. cruzi. It is endemic in certain areas of continental Latin America. Few cases of T. cruzi infection have been described in travellers. However, there is little information regarding the incidence rate of T. cruzi infection during a trip to continental Latin America. In this study we aim to study the incidence of T. cruzi infection among migrants from Latin America living in Spain travelling to visit friends and relatives. In this study we found no cases of newly acquired T. cruzi infection among 79 previously uninfected travellers and calculate that the upper limit of the 95% CI of the incidence rate of T. cruzi acquisition in travellers is 0.8 per 1000 participants-day.
