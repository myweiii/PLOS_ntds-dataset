Schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease that affects approximately 200 million people globally. It is transmitted through contact with freshwater that contains parasitic larvae known as cercariae and is prevalent in communities that do not have access to safe water supplies. Treatment with the drug praziquantel is effective against adult worms, but this cannot prevent reinfection if contact with contaminated water continues. Providing safe water for laundry and bathing can prevent transmission of the disease and the emerging technology of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes could offer a chemical free option for point-of-use water treatment, but there is insufficient published data to determine the UV fluence-response of schistosome cercariae. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of UV disinfection at four wavelengths against Schistosoma mansoni cercariae. The results show that high UV fluences are required to kill S. mansoni cercariae at all wavelengths, but they are visibly damaged at lower fluences. This suggests UV disinfection alone is unlikely to be an efficient method for providing cercariae-free water unless there are improvements in UV-LED technology or further research can demonstrate UV-damaged cercariae are non-infective.
