The first dengue vaccine, known as CYD-TDV, is currently under consideration as a public health tool in Puerto Rico, where dengue is endemic. Although the vaccine protects individuals with prior exposure to dengue virus, individuals vaccinated without prior dengue virus infection could experience a higher chance of severe disease. To avoid vaccinating individuals who have not been exposed to dengue virus, screening for prior infection before vaccination is recommended. Understanding the potential impacts of this intervention in specific settings can help public health decision makers to balance economic and health benefits to consider the implementation of this vaccine. In this study, we estimated the impacts of incorporating screening and vaccination in Puerto Rico for the next 10 years. We found that the vaccine could have a positive impact in reducing severe dengue by preventing 5.5% of hospitalizations, but it could also cause 1.6 hospitalizations for every 1,000 vaccinated who had a false-positive screening result. We also found that this intervention could be cost-effective in Puerto Rico at a cost of 382 USD.
