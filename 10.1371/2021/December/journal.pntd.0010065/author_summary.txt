Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a severe form of chronic infection with various trematodes of the genus Schistosoma, characterized by portal venous fibrosis, splenomegaly with hypersplenism, and portal hypertension with subsequent life-threatening bleeding events. While effective anthelminthic treatment is available, portal fibrosis is only partially reversible. Portal hypertension with subsequent bleeding events as a complication is hitherto insufficiently addressed. Surgical techniques are currently the best established treatment option for HSS, despite their inherent complication risk and irreversibility. Interventional procedures like TIPS have rarely been assessed in HSS with mixed results. In a series of 13 cases with follow-up periods up to 99 months and a cumulative follow-up of 30.9 years, we demonstrate excellent bleeding prophylaxis and a low adverse event rate of TIPS and–if TIPS proves infeasible–splenorenal shunt surgery. Main complications of TIPS comprise transient hepatic encephalopathy and increase of liver enzymes, especially in patients with hepatic comorbidities. Due to necessary infrastructure and skills, TIPS implantation is currently limited to specialized centers. However, we think that our study can support the establishment and development of new treatment options for schistosomiasis and, in the medium term, also improve the prognosis of this neglected tropical disease in endemic regions.
