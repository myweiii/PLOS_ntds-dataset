Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continue to be high among schoolchildren in the Philippines despite the conduct of semi-annual nationwide school-based mass drug administration (MDA) program more than a decade ago. In this cross-sectional survey, we assess the prevalence of STH, the risk factors associated with infection, and the impact of STH on nutritional indices among schoolchildren in Laguna province, the Philippines. Our results show that STH prevalence (23%) remains above the World Health Organization (WHO) target of < 20% for morbidity control. The prevalences of stunting (20.2%), being underweight (19%) or wasting (9.5%) are high and are still regarded as public health problems according to WHO criteria, but low anaemia prevalence (13%) was observed. Age, socio-economic status, rural/urban classification of schools and knowledge of STH were significant risk factors for STH infections. Moreover, infections with STH were significantly associated with stunting and being underweight but not wasting or anaemia after controlling for key confounders. Sustainable deworming in tandem with other measures such as the provision of health education, improvements in sanitation and hygiene, and nutritional programs, are needed to control intestinal worm infections and improve morbidity outcomes in schoolchildren.
