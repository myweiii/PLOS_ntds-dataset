Schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni is of great public health importance in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that control efforts aim to reduce morbidity through large-scale intervention programmes. However, intestinal and liver morbidity is rarely assessed in such control programmes. Hence, little is known about (i) the magnitude of the intestinal and liver morbidity burden in the community, or about (ii) the morbidity associated with S. mansoni infection, specifically. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which we assessed intestinal morbidity by questionnaire and liver morbidity by abdominal ultrasonography. Additionally, we determined the infection status of the study participants using standard diagnostic procedures (Kato-Katz technique and point-of-care cathodic circulating S. mansoni antigen [POC-CCA] urine test). Among the 586 study participants, aged six years and older, from 13 villages in Ituri Province, DRC, we observed a high degree of intestinal (23.4% with diarrhoea; 21.5% with blood in stool) and hepatosplenic morbidity (42.8% with abnormal liver C, D, E, and F patterns; 26.5% with an enlarged liver; 25.3% with an enlarged spleen). S. mansoni infection was associated with liver and spleen enlargement. Likewise, S. mansoni infection intensity was linked to diarrhoea, to liver and spleen enlargement and to pathological changes in the liver parenchyma. At village level, we observed that the prevalence of an enlarged liver and spleen among patients increased with the prevalence of S. mansoni infection. We conclude that the population of Ituri Province carries an alarming burden of intestinal, liver and spleen morbidity associated with S. mansoni infection. A comprehensive control programme to address this infection and disease burden is urgently required.
