Cutaneous leishmaniasis is mainly caused by Leishmania tropica in the Middle East, where it is known for treatment failure and a need for prolonged and/or multiple treatments. Several factors affect the clinical presentation and treatment outcome, such as host genetic variability and specific immune response, as well as environmental factors and the vector species. Little is known about the parasite genome and its influence on treatment response. By analysing the genome of 22 isolates of L. tropica, we have revealed extensive genomic variation and a complex population structure with evidence of genetic exchange within and among the isolates, indicating a possible presence of sexual or parasexual mechanisms. Understanding the Leishmania genome better may improve future treatment and better understanding of treatment failure and relapse.
