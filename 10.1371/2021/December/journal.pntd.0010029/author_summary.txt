Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae. The development of an effective treatment in the 1980s contributed to the decline of leprosy prevalence. Still, around 200 thousand new leprosy cases are detected every year. In the past two decades, multiple studies have identified genetic variants increasing the risk of developing leprosy, particularly using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, GWAS loci commonly encompass multiple genes, which poses a challenge in identifying the best candidates contributing to susceptibility. This limits the usefulness of the genetic findings for understanding leprosy pathogenesis. Our study tested if the accumulation of rare protein-altering variants in genes located in GWAS loci could distinguish the best functional candidates. We found that the burden of amino acid changes in IL18R1 and BCL10 was significantly different between leprosy cases and healthy controls, suggesting these genes as functional candidates in leprosy pathogenesis.
