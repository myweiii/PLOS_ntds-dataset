Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an environmental mycobacterium. Although transmission of M. ulcerans remains poorly understood, the main identified risk factor for acquiring Buruli ulcer is living in proximity of potentially contaminated water sources. For this infectious disease occurring mainly in Africa, little is known about recurrence due to reinfection. We describe two patients with Buruli ulcer recurrence due to reinfection with M. ulcerans, as demonstrated by comparisons of DNA from the M. ulcerans strains isolated at the time of the first and second diagnostics. We formally demonstrated that the recurrence in these two patients was due to reinfection. Based on the sites at which the patients reported engaging in activities relating to unprotected water, we were able to identify possible sites of contamination. Our findings indicate that the non-random distribution of M. ulcerans genotypes in this region may provide useful information about human activities at risk for contamination.
