The secondary endosymbionts can positively influence the metabolism of many compounds essential for the survival of the insect vectors, provide resistance to pathogens and impact susceptibility to insecticides, as also the tolerance to heat stress. We provide information from new records of natural infection of secondary endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia, Cardinium, Microsporidia, Flavobacterium, and Rickettsia in phlebotomine sand flies and mosquitoes from Colombia. An important finding is the detection of Bartonella sp. in Cx. nigripalpus. Clear differences were found in the composition and diversity of microbiota at the intra-specific and interspecific levels in sand flies and Cx. nigripalpus, which may depend in the of the load of natural infection of endosymbionts (as Wolbachia), the geographical distribution and host.
