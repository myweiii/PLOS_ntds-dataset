Few CHIKV outbreaks have been detected in Myanmar since the first documented case in 1973. After an outbreak, the virus seems to disappear from the region gradually for a few years to more than a decade. In 2019, a CHIKV outbreak was reported in blood donors and children with febrile illness in the Mandalay region. The last official report of a CHIKV outbreak before this was in 2010. Our findings showed evidence of both IgG (28.6%) and IgM (8.9%) antibody circulation against CHIKV. In 2018, the highest seroprevalence rate (37.3%) was found, a probable predictor of the CHIKV outbreak reported in 2019. Additionally, we observed an overall prevalence of 32.5% of circulating anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibodies in the study population. Neutralizing antibodies were observed in patients with febrile illness and healthy volunteers. These findings indicate a continued risk for future outbreaks, reinforcing the need to monitor potential outbreaks in the country.
