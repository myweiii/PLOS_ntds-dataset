Leptospirosis is an important but largely under-recognized public health problem in the tropics. Recreational leptospirosis is a major cause of infection; people contract leptospirosis via recreational activities in rivers or lakes. Okinawa Prefecture is located in the southernmost part of Japan, has a subtropical climate, and is a major tourist destination, with an estimated 10 million visitors annually. In this study, we revealed that the trend of leptospirosis in this prefecture has changed. Leptospirosis was considered an endemic disease among agricultural workers; however, during the last 17 years, most of the confirmed cases in Okinawa Prefecture were attributable to recreation or labor in rivers in the summer in the northern part of the main island of Okinawa and the Yaeyama region, which are designated as national parks with abundant nature. Since recreation in rivers is the most popular activity among tourists in Okinawa Prefecture, leptospirosis is a health concern not only for residents of Okinawa Prefecture but also for tourists.
