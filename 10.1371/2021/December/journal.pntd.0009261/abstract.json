    "Background": "During 2017, twenty health districts (locations) implemented a dengue outbreak Early Warning and Response System (EWARS) in Mexico, which processes epidemiological, meteorological and entomological alarm indicators to predict dengue outbreaks and triggers early response activities.",
    "Methods": "Five indicators of dengue outbreak response (larval control, entomological studies with water container interventions, focal spraying and indoor residual spraying) were quantitatively analyzed across two groups (\u201doutbreak districts\u201d and \u201cnon-outbreak districts\u201d). However, for quality control purposes, only qualitative concluding remarks were derived from the fifth response indicator (fogging).",
    "Results": "The average coverage of vector control responses was significantly higher in non-outbreak districts and across all four indicators. In the \u201coutbreak districts\u201d the response activities started late and were of much lower intensity compared to \u201cnon-outbreak districts\u201d. Vector control teams at districts-level demonstrated diverse levels of compliance with local guidelines for \u2018initial\u2019, \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018late\u2019 responses to outbreak alarms, which could potentially explain the different outcomes observed following the outbreak alarms.",
    "Conclusion": "Failing timely and adequate response of alarm signals generated by EWARS showed to negatively impact the disease outbreak control process. On the other hand, districts with adequate and timely response guided by alarm signals demonstrated successful records of outbreak prevention. This study presents important operational scenarios when failing or successding EWARS but warrants investigating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EWARS using a more robust designs."
