Vector control is key to decrease the incidence of viral infections transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, like dengue, but traditional control methods like insecticides and breeding sites reduction can be time-consuming, ineffective, and challenged by insecticide resistance. In the method known as Wolbachia suppression, male mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia are released to mate with wild female mosquitoes. As the resulting eggs do not hatch, the mosquito population decreases over time. As public support is key to implement and maintain any vector control method, we assessed community support for Wolbachia suppression through focus groups and interviews with residents of Ponce, Puerto Rico, where a community cohort has been implemented. Support for this method in this population was high and increased after an educational campaign. Respondents with higher income and those who used repellent in the last 30 days were more likely to support Wolbachia suppression. Questions regarding the impact of this method on human and animal health, and the environment, were the most reported. Community engagement activities to increase the understanding of the method, including clear and specific information on health risk assessments, should be conducted before and during the implementation of Wolbachia suppression.
