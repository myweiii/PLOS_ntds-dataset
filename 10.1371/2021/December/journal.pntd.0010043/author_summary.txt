Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represents socioeconomic burden in most countries of Latin America. Chagas disease, a NTD, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease can be mild, causing swelling and fever, or it can be long-lasting. Left untreated, it often causes heart failure. This study focused on T. cruzi lineages, emphasizing the gap of information from Central America and complementing what is known in North America. Our diverse collection of kissing bugs from North America (United States and Mexico) and Central America identified two of the major mitochondrial lineages circulating in these regions, both representing distinct clades within the already established three clusters of the T. cruzi parasite (mtTcI-mtTcIII): mtTcINA-CA and mtTcIIINA-CA. At a local scale, population genetic structure of T. cruzi revealed that genetic diversity has a notable geographic component. The important insights into the genetic and evolutionary diversity of T. cruzi in North and Central America provide not only the necessity for referencing genomes to identify lineages but the basis to develop more precise and comprehensive diagnostic assays to better detect T. cruzi infections.
