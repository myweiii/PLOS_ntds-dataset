    "Abstract": "More than 100 years since the first description of Chagas Disease and with over 29,000 new cases annually due to vector transmission (in 2010), American Trypanosomiasis remains a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD). This study presents the most comprehensive Trypanosoma cruzi sampling in terms of geographic locations and triatomine species analyzed to date and includes both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. This addresses the gap of information from North and Central America. We incorporate new and previously published DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial genes, Cytochrome oxidase II (COII) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1). These T. cruzi samples were collected over a broad geographic range including 111 parasite DNA samples extracted from triatomines newly collected across North and Central America, all of which were infected with T. cruzi in their natural environment. In addition, we present parasite reduced representation (Restriction site Associated DNA markers, RAD-tag) genomic nuclear data combined with the mitochondrial gene sequences for a subset of the triatomines (27 specimens) collected from Guatemala and El Salvador. Our mitochondrial phylogenetic reconstruction revealed two of the major mitochondrial lineages circulating across North and Central America, as well as the first ever mitochondrial data for TcBat from a triatomine collected in Central America. Our data also show that within mtTcIII, North and Central America represent an independent, distinct clade from South America, named here as mtTcIIINA-CA, geographically restricted to North and Central America. Lastly, the most frequent lineage detected across North and Central America, mtTcI, was also an independent, distinct clade from South America, noted as mtTcINA-CA. Furthermore, nuclear genome data based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) showed genetic structure of lineage TcI from specimens collected in Guatemala and El Salvador supporting the hypothesis that genetic diversity at a local scale has a geographical component. Our multiscale analysis contributes to the understanding of the independent and distinct evolution of T. cruzi lineages in North and Central America regions."
