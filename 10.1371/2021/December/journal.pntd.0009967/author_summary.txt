Following an imported outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Uganda’s western Kasese District, the Uganda Virus Research Institute and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jointly established a frontline field laboratory to test specimens collected from alert and suspect cases for Ebola virus disease. Using a single room equipped with a rapid containment kit to safely inactivate patient specimens and a GeneXpert to perform the Xpert Ebola Assay, the field laboratory rapidly ruled-out Ebola virus disease as the cause of illness in 76 patients during its 46 operational days. All specimens were also referred to Uganda Virus Research Institute (Entebbe) for confirmatory Ebola virus testing and testing against a panel of viruses known to cause hemorrhagic fever in Uganda, in line with the National Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Program’s testing protocol and mandate. The Ebola field laboratory served as a valuable asset in the outbreak response by supporting patient management and epidemiological surveillance.
