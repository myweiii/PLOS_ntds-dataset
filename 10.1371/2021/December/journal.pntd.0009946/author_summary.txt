The question of ‘ecology or immunology’ as determinants of the shape of age intensity profiles of infection is still not resolved, but a degree of immunity is believed to slowly build up over long periods of exposure. In this study we show that acquired immunity dependent on the integral of past exposure to infection has a strong effect on the potential impact of MDA programmes to control morbidity induced by schistosome infection. We employ an individual based stochastic model of parasite transmission and control to demonstrate the effects of acquired immunity. In particular, we show that MDA programmes are less effective if human hosts acquire some level of immunity in proportion to the sum of an individual’s past exposure to infection. If acquired immunity is acting with strength, in some moderate to high transmission settings, we show that the current treatment guidelines are unlikely to achieve morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. This suggests that programme adaptations to increase the frequency of treatment where at all possible are required. This study aims to provide health workers with quantitative tools to assess what treatment strategies are best applied in given epidemiological settings.
