The main method of preventing Aedes-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is by targeting the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, with insecticides. However, the success of these vector control strategies is jeopardized by the widespread development of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti are still not well understood, resulting in limited resistance mitigation and management strategies. In this paper, we found that resistance to some pyrethroid insecticides in different Colombian cities is associated with three allelic substitutions V419L, V1016I, and F1534C, on the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, known as kdr (‘knock-down resistance’) mutations, with all three mutations present in mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids. The data also showed that kdr mutations are important in conferring low resistance levels, but after around 10-fold intensity, the allele frequencies don’t change, indicating that other mechanisms contribute to the resistance. Thus, we found that mosquitoes under selective pressure with insecticides present also altered enzymatic activities such as esterases and mixed-function oxidases, indicating that kdr mutations and metabolic enzymes are involved in the resistance expression. The findings on the extent of insecticide resistance and the molecular mechanisms underpinning the problem will impact the surveillance, selection, and rational use of insecticides by local health authorities.
