Pneumocystis jirovecii and Toxoplasma gondii are opportunistic pathogens that can cause pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and pulmonary toxoplasmosis (PT) in immunocompromised patients. Due to the non-specific clinical symptoms and similar imaging of lung pathology, these two deadly diseases are difficult to be clinically differential diagnosed. Early diagnosis of these infections would reduce medical costs, morbidity and mortality. A duplex qPCR method was developed for the detection of both P. jirovecii and T. gondii infection simultaneously. This new assay provides a potential application for diagnosis and surveillance of both PCP and PT. Further investigation for the prevalence of P. jirovecii and T. gondii infections indicated that P. jirovecii and T. gondii involvement in lung infection has been seriously underestimated.
