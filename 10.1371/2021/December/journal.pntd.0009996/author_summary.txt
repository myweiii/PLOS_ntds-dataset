Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by larval stages of cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus. In China, human echinococcosis is a major public health burden, especially in western China. Therefore, it is important to understand the prevalence status and spatial distribution of human echinococcosis in order to provide basic information for prevention and control measures reinforcement. To describe the distribution and analyze the prevalence and spatial distribution characteristics of human echinococcosis in China, report data of echinococcosis were collected in 370 counties in 2018. For the year 2018, there were 47,278 cases of echinococcosis recorded in 370 endemic counties in China. Analysis of the disease prevalence showed obvious spatial positive autocorrelation in global spatial autocorrelation with two aggregation modes in local spatial autocorrelation, namely high-high and low-high aggregation areas. The high-high gathering areas were mainly concentrated in northern Tibet, western Qinghai, and Ganzi in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and in Sichuan. This study showed obvious spatial aggregation of human echinococcosis prevalence in China. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the "hot spot" area of human echinococcosis in China. Such findings indicate that here is an urgent need of joint strategies to strengthen efforts for the prevention and control of echinococcosis in China, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
