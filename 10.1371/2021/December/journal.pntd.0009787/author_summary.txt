Taeniasis is an infection of the intestine with tapeworms such as Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), or Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm). In the case of pork tapeworm in particular, infected individuals excrete thousands of eggs in their feces, which can cause cysticercosis if ingested by mouth and develop into larvae. Infection can occur through contaminated vegetables, but also by unwashed hands that had contact with Taenia eggs, including auto-infection. The larval cysts are deposited throughout the body, including the brain (neurocysticercosis), which is a common cause of epilepsy worldwide. Stool microscopy is the standard method for detecting taeniasis, but it cannot distinguish between infection with the beef and the more dangerous pork tapeworm. We have now developed a next-generation sequencing method that allows us to determine the genetic code of the tapewormâ€™s mitochondrial DNA from just two eggs in a stool sample. The sequence obtained makes it possible to uniquely identify the Taenia subspecies, treat patients appropriately, and inform public health efforts of endemic regions in order to eradicate this infection, as proposed by WHO.
