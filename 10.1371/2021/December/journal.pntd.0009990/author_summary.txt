Visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum is an endemic disease in several regions of the world, especially, in the Mediterranean basin, where dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for humans. This zoonotic vector-borne disease is closely associated with the environment.
We carried out studies in 8 different regions of Tunisia, collecting and testing blood samples from 317 dogs. Out of which, more than half (58.3%) tested positive for L. infantum (IFAT+), although, only one-third of these displayed clinical signs. However, the detection of Leishmania DNA by blood PCR revealed a global prevalence in dogs of 21.2% (64/302) with a variation between bioclimatic zones. Our entomological survey revealed 16 sand fly species, dominated by the Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia genera, of which the most dominant were P. perniciosus, P. perfiliewi and P. papatasi. The first two of these are recognized vectors of L. infantum. Canine leishmaniosis continues to spread across Tunisia, moving southward, to arid zones because of global warming and agronomic and social factors affecting the presence and density of the phlebotomine vectors.
