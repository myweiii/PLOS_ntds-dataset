The evaluation of exposure to mosquitoes is a key parameter in assessing the risk of transmission of associated pathogens, including zoonoses. Entomological methods represent the gold standard but have several limitations, and efforts are being made to develop new indicators to accurately assess humanâ€“Culex contact. This study showed the IgG response to Culex quinquefasciatus salivary gland extract is suitable proxy of exposure to Culex bites. The lower antigenicity of the 30 kDa recombinant protein represents a limitation to its use. The high specificity of this protein to the Culex genus makes it an attractive candidate and other isotypic antibody responses specific to this salivary antigen might be more relevant as a biomarker of exposure.
