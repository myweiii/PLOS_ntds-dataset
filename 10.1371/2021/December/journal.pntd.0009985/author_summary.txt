African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is an endemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa that hinders the development of livestock production on the continent. The control of the disease is based on chemotherapy, vector control and diagnosis. Misuse, as well as the continuous/regular use of a limited number of anti-trypanosomal drugs, is responsible for the appearance of increasingly drug-resistant strains of trypanosomes. In terms of serological diagnosis, the most efficient test at present suffers from a lack of reagent standardization. Unfortunately, even the most promising candidates fail due to low sensitivity in primately or chronically infected animals. Based on this observation it seems obvious that diagnosis must be revisited. In this study we evaluated the diagnostic potential of two Trypanosoma brucei proteins, TbLysoPLA and TbGK, in indirect ELISA for antibody detection. To provide a proof of concept that the judicious association of immunoreactive proteins could improve the sensitivity and specificity of tests based on recombinant antigens, we used these molecules alone and then in combination, associated or not with the BiP protein of T. congolense. The evaluation in serological diagnosis showed that the two proteins used separately had a poor performance. However, when used together with the BiP protein, they showed a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity between 87 and 96%, comparable to the reference tests. It shows for the first time that the performance of protein combinations is much better than that of the proteins tested individually for the diagnosis of AAT.
