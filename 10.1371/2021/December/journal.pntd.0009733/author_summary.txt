The males of many species of New World sand flies produce volatile chemicals shown in Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. to be attractive to females and other males. These sex/aggregation pheromones are produced by secretory cells which surround a cuticular reservoir that collects the pheromone and from which it passes through a cuticular duct and a specialised structure on the surface of the abdomen, from where it evaporates. We examined by SEM the structure of the interior cuticular secretory apparatus of 3 members of the Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. species complex and Migonemyia migonei and found a new structure associated with pheromone release that we have called the manifold. The manifold appears to be a substantial extension of the interior tergal cuticle that is connected in-line with the duct and reservoir. Significant differences in size and shape of the manifold between members of the Lu. longipalpis complex were observed. The M. migonei secretory apparatus were substantially different in appearance to those of Lu. longipalpis with the manifold positioned in a pit-like structure within the tergal cuticle. These differences which may have taxonomic value and may be related to the chemical structure of the pheromone or phylogenetic differences.
