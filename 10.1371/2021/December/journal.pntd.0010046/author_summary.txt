Studies of drug resistance in the protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania have been helpful in revealing biochemical pathways as potential drug targets. Here we report on the characterization at the genomics and metabolomics levels of a L. tarentolae strain made resistant to acivicin, an analogue of glutamine with activity against this parasite. We found that resistance to acivicin is accompanied by a reduced uptake and intracellular levels of glutamate and that both are expected to share the same transporter. Through gene overexpression and disruption studies we identified the main amino acid transporter responsible for glutamate uptake.
