Cholera transmission risk is higher in those living in and near the case household. A set of preventive interventions are implemented in and around case household to reduce cholera transmission. We investigated the implementation of cholera case-area targeted interventions (CATI) using systematic reviews (11 peer-reviewed and eight grey literature) and four case studies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Yemen, and Zimbabwe with 30 key informant interviewees. We found 15 outbreaks in 12 countries where CATI approaches were used. The interventions varied across outbreaks with water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions being more common than those of health. We found different alert systems to trigger interventions, inconsistent criteria to select high-risk households for CATI implementation, and varied team compositions to implement CATI approaches. Coordination and integration among actors and sectors were identified as challenging in many outbreaks, and delays in sharing case information were reported. Evaluation measures varied, few evaluated cholera transmission reduction. We recommend using uniform case definition considering countryâ€™s capacity to trigger alert, evaluating effectiveness of the various interventions, establishing criteria to select high-risk households, and improving coordination among actors to facilitate integration to aid future cholera-response CATI approaches.
