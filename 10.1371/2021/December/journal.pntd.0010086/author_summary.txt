Chikungunya and dengue are emerging diseases that have caused large outbreaks in various regions of the world. Both are both spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitos. To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at controlling either of these diseases, it is important to consider the potential effects on both diseases, as an intervention that reduces the mosquito population will reduce the spread of both diseases. We developed a dynamic transmission model of chikungunya and dengue, calibrated to data from Colombia. We evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of the following interventions: residual insecticide treatment, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, routine dengue vaccination for children aged 9, catchup dengue vaccination for individuals aged 10–19 or 10–29, and portfolios of these interventions. In all vaccination scenarios, we considered testing for previous exposure to dengue. We found that insecticide to prevent chikungunya and dengue in Colombia could generate significant health benefits and be cost-effective. While the dengue vaccine was effective in preventing cases and deaths, costs of diagnostic testing and vaccination must decrease for dengue vaccination to be considered cost-effective.
