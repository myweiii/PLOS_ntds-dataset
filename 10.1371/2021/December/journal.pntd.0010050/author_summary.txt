Ascariasis is the most common helminth infection and leads to significant global morbidity. Transient Ascaris larval migration through the hostâ€™s lungs is essential for larval development but leads to an exaggerated type-2 host immune response. Our work demonstrates that transient Ascaris spp. larval migration through the lungs has significant long-term consequences including changes in lung structure and function as well as vascular damage causing chronic lung disease and anemia. We propose that Ascaris spp. larval migration through the host lungs is a risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease and anemia in parasite-endemic regions globally.
