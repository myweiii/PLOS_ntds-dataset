The Leishmania donovani parasite is transmitted by infected sandflies and is the principal causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease with no available vaccine. The infection normally spreads to the liver, spleen and bone marrow and is fatal if untreated. In Sri Lanka however, L. donovani causes only skin pathology at the site of the sandfly bite and does not cause visceral disease. Previous genetic analysis of this atypical attenuated strain identified 91 gene mutations including single amino acid mutations in the RagC and Raptor genes that are part of the conserved eukaryotic TOR regulatory pathway and upstream sensing complexes. This study investigated whether members of the TOR and associated sensing pathways could be identified by bioinformatic analysis and the potential role a RagC mutation plays in the attenuation of L. donovani in Sri Lanka for causing visceral disease. This study provides novel insight into the role of the TOR and associated sensing pathways and the RagC single nucleotide polymorphism in L. donovani virulence.
