The mosquito Aedes aegypti, found globally across the tropics and subtropics, transmits viruses with a significant global public health impact, including chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. There are no antiviral drugs to treat these diseases and few effective vaccines. One way of reducing the global burden of mosquito-borne diseases would be to develop genetically modified mosquitoes unable to transmit viruses. One approach would be to alter the mosquitoes’ immune system to allow them to better fight viral infections. To do so, we first need to understand how viruses are detected by the mosquito immune system. We developed new methods of measuring immune responses in laboratory-cultured mosquito cells and used them to show that one specific arm of the immune system, called the ‘Imd pathway’, can detect the RNA that constitutes the genome of mosquito-borne viruses. These findings pave the way for future immune studies that could inform the development of transmission-incompetent mosquitoes. We also found that another arm of the immune system, called the ‘Toll pathway’, is not functional under any experimental conditions used in this study. This finding has implications for how different laboratories interpret data from these particular cultured cells.
