The Chagas disease is transmitted by the infected feces of kissing bugs, such as Triatoma infestans, when it feeds on human blood. This species is an ectotherm and its physical activity level, behavior, and survival respond to environmental changes in temperature. Climate change predicts changes in environmental temperature and its variability. These changes may affect the distribution and survival of T. infestans, generating difficulties for eradication programs. Here, we evaluated the effects of temperature, and its variability on the performance of T. infestans’ individuals maintained at or acclimated to six different temperatures, which capture the essence of climate change predictions regarding temperature (i.e., temperatures displaying changes in mean and in variance). We found that T. infestans exhibited a plastic response to thermal conditions, with individuals performing worse at a low mean temperature (18°C) with variance (± 5°C), while individuals acclimated to the same low temperature (18°C) without variance (± 0°C) performed as good as individuals acclimated to their optimal temperature (27°C). Nevertheless, thermal variation at a high mean temperature (30°C ± 5°C) increased performance. Thus, we concluded that the thermal variability affects the performance of this species, in a non-linear way. From our results, the difficulty to predict climate change effects on populations of T. infestans becomes evident, as well as the need to include putative thermal plasticity in future predictions.
