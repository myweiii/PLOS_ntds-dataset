Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease that can affect humans and dogs, caused by a parasite called Leishmania transmitted through the bite of sandfly insects. During the bite, together with the parasite, the insects also inoculate their saliva into the host. The host immune response produces molecules to the sandfly saliva, such as antibodies and cytokines that can impact VL resistance or susceptibility. The presence of these molecules also indicates if the insects bit the hosts. We followed dogs of a VL endemic area for two years to study Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) and immune response to sandfly saliva. Dogs were evaluated at 6-month intervals to determine Leishmania infection, clinical manifestations, parasite load, immune response, and sandfly exposure. CVL resistance or susceptibility was determined upon the conclusion of the study. Dogs living in the endemic area were intensely bitten, as at the beginning of the study, 62% of the dogs present anti-saliva antibodies, reaching 100% after one year. Our findings revealed a biosignature of CVL susceptibility characterized by elevated parasite load, interaction of cytokines, and higher exposure to the sandfly. This data reinforced that CVL is a complex disease affected by several factors related to each other.
