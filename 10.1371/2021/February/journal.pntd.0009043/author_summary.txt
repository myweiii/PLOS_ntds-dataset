Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 distributed all over the world. Since 1988, serological screening has been included in routine blood screening in certain developed countries and regions such as American countries and some parts of Western Europe and East Asia. However, data from some highly populated countries such as China are still not available. We performed a 3-year large-scale blood screening survey to systematically characterize the prevalence of HTLV infection among blood donors in Guangdong province in south China during 2016â€“2018. In general, Guangdong was considered to be a low-prevalence region for HTLV-1 infection, but the prevalence is significantly higher in Shanwei, a coastal city of eastern Guangdong. Transcontinental and Japanese subtype lineages dominate the prevalence in Guangdong. Moreover, similar molecular characteristics of prevalent HTLV-1 sequences in Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan suggested a same origin of these viruses.
