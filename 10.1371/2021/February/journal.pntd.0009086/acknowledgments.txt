We want to thank the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) for sharing with us the data of our rural worker population and, thus, allowing the analysis carried out in this study. We would also like to thank Tina Louise Di Prima Melicio from Broward HealthCare Federal Union, Florida, USA, for the English revision.
