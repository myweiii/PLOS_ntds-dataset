Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an important neglected tropical disease that affects many countries in Latin America, including Brazil. The main affected population is rural workers who suffer from an important debilitating disease, besides facing massive economic damage in their lives. Although many studies evaluated the socio-demographic data of patients with PCM and identified many white individuals affected, this is the first study that has managed to compare the data of patients treated in a leading study of the disease with regional population data provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), with regards to ethnicity. The difference between white individuals over non-white individuals found in this study was significant, suggesting a susceptibility of white individuals to PCM. However, the ethnic background is self-reported; therefore, a genetic ancestry investigation could allow other correlations concerning ancestry markers, susceptibility, and resistance to infection.
