Patients who are immunosuppressed are at greater risk of developing visceral leishmaniasis (VL) when infected with Leishmania. Prior infection with HIV has been traditionally associated with an increased risk of developing VL, but the use of immunosuppressants in the treatment of autoimmune disease has been linked to a higher incidence of VL in Leishmania-endemic areas. It is important to understand the influence these treatments have on Leishmania infection, paying special attention to how they affect the immune response mediated by IFN-Î³-, TNF- and IL-2-producing T lymphocytes (such cells are necessary if an infection is to be resolved). Studies in this area require the use of murine models of VL. C57BL/6 mice infected with Leishmania infantum that received immunosuppressant treatment with methylprednisolone, anti-tumour necrosis factor antibodies, or methotrexate prior to and during infection, showed differences in their immune response, and in the parasite load developed in various organs. These results highlight the need to better understand how immunosuppressant treatments might influence the severity of VL in human patients.
