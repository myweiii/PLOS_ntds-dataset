Chikungunya is an emerging mosquito-borne disease in many parts of the world, with a high morbidity burden. Fluctuations in human density and mobility are important drivers of epidemics, particularly in the context of large cities in low- and middle-income countries, which can act to amplify and spread local epidemics. Here, we first describe the epidemiology of chikungunya in Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the largest megacities in the world, during an outbreak in 2017. Using data from a household survey, we estimate a much higher attack rate than suggested by official case counts. We then use estimates of population movement from mobile phone data for over 4 million subscribers, to understand the role of human mobility on the spatial spread of chikungunya. We show that regular population fluxes around Dhaka city played a significant role in determining disease risk, and that travel during the Eid holidays likely spread the infection to the rest of the country. Our results show the impact of large-scale population movements, particularly during holidays, on the spread of infectious diseases, and highlight the value of real-time data from mobile phones for outbreak analysis and forecasting.
