Schistosomiasis is a parasitic neglected tropical disease causing morbidity and mortality in several tropical regions. The most commonly described complications of schistosomiasis include urinary tract and gastrointestinal pathology. However, ectopic migration of parasitic worms and their eggs into the central nervous system can lead to profound and life altering disability. This phenomenon, referred to as ‘Neuroschistosomiasis’ is a rarely reported in non-endemic countries. However, occurrence is increasingly recognised in non-endemic regions due to the increase in global travel. We report the clinical and radiological characteristics of four patients who developed neuroschistosomiasis following tropical freshwater exposure. The report informs diagnosis of schistosomiasis, diagnostic features including subtle radiological findings typical of schistosomiasis, and management of neuroschistosomiasis. The report further highlights the delays in diagnosis of these patients, and the importance of travel history and seeking specialist parasitological advice when patients present with spinal cord syndromes following relevant exposures.
