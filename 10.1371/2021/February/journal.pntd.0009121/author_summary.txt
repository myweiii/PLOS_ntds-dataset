The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Its control relies heavily on the use of insecticides but the rapid evolution of resistance to these chemicals compromises their efficacy. The conservation or restoration of insecticide susceptibility in Ae. aegypti populations is therefore of great importance. Insecticide susceptibility can be encouraged if the evolution of resistance is accompanied by fitness costs that favour susceptible mosquitoes in the absence of insecticides. This paper documents the first report of a reduction in mating success directly associated with an isolated mutation that confers insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti. This change in behaviour appears related to alterations in male wing-beat frequency. Our results provide evidence of behavioural changes related to insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti, suggesting a competitive advantage of susceptible individuals in the absence of insecticides in the field.
