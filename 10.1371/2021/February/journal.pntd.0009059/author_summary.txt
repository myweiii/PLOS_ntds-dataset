Trypanosoma cruzi infection triggers several immune mechanisms in the host that do not result in a total clearance of the parasite, the persistence of which leads to the chronicity of Chagas disease. The mechanisms by which some chronic patients remain asymptomatic or become symptomatic are not entirely clear. The aim of the present manuscript is to study the CD4+ T cell population and its functional capacity in patients with different forms of chronic disease. The obtained results indicate that cells from indeterminate patients have an enhanced multifunctional profile, which is associated with the reduced expression of inhibitory molecules. CD4+ T cells from chronic patients with cardiac alterations show lower functional activity against specific antigens of the parasite and increased coexpression of inhibitory molecules. After benznidazole treatment, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, especially those from indeterminate patients, are more likely to show a multifunctional profile and a decline in the coexpression of inhibitory receptors. These results allow us to make progress in clarifying the mechanisms that may influence disease progression and to realize the importance of antiparasitic treatment for the enhancement of the activity of the immune system.
