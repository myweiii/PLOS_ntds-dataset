Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of people worldwide and, in the case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is potentially fatal if untreated. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania spp. are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, which has different clinical manifestations, including the visceral form and a cutaneous form that causes disfiguring skin lesions. The current treatment options are limited either by the length of treatment or toxic side effects. Starting from a promising hit in an in vitro phenotypic screen, hundreds of analogues were synthesized with the aim of finding a molecule capable of killing the parasite whilst causing little or no harm to the patient. The program led to several active compounds with good in vitro activity against L. infantum intracellular amastigotes, however, in vivo data showed low parasiticidal efficacy.
