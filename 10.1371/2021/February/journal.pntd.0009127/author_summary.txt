Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. On the Zanzibar islands, United Republic of Tanzania, interventions to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis commenced in 2012. From 2012 to 2016, the population was treated biannually with praziquantel and, additionally, some areas received mollusciciding against the intermediate host snail, or educational measures for behavior change. Mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel was continued annually in 2017 and 2018, but not in 2019. As a result of the interventions, the overall S. haematobium prevalence was reduced to 0.4% in adults and 3.4% in schoolchildren in 2020. However, in some areas, the MDA gap in 2019 resulted in a considerable rebound of infections. The recrudescence in 2020 was particularly striking for boys aged 9â€“16 years. In general, in 2020, male participants had higher odds of infection than females. Adults living near to a natural freshwater body also showed an increased risk of S. haematobium infection. Future elimination efforts in Zanzibar should focus on re-intensifying elimination interventions, including MDA, snail control and behavior change in hotspot areas. In low-prevalence areas, the strategy might be adapted from MDA to targeted interventions, such as surveillance-response.
