Guinea has been consistently reporting the largest number of sleeping sickness cases in Western Africa since 2002. The Ebola epidemic that severely hit this country between 2014 and 2016 resulted in an interruption of most medical activities to control sleeping sickness, which was associated with an increase in the number of cases reported in 2016. In order to contain the resurgence of sleeping sickness and to bring it back on the path towards elimination, activities to screen and diagnose patients were intensified by strengthening the capacity of health facilities, and by visiting villages and households to test at-risk populations, while vector control was extended to cover all active foci in the country. This article presents the results that were obtained by the National Sleeping Sickness Control Program of Guinea after the Ebola epidemic by enhancing medical activities in the coastal region, where most cases of sleeping sickness are found. These efforts first resulted in an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed in 2016 and in 2017, and was then followed by an encouraging decline in 2018, thus raising hopes that the disease could be eliminated in the near future in Guinea.
