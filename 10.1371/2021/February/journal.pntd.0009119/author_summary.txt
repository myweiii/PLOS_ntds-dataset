Trachoma is caused by repeated infection that is spread from person to person via contaminated ocular and nasal discharge. Education on healthy habits such as face washing is essential to the elimination of trachoma. Schools are one place for health promotion programs because so many children can be reached. In previous studies, students showed increased knowledge about trachoma and healthy behavior after engaging in health education programs. We examined if there was evidence that school-based messages were disseminated to the community at large via the primary school students. We found that school health messages did not impact clean faces in pre-school children or trachoma prevalence in the community in general. Having a washing station in the school was associated with lower community rates of trachoma. The data suggested that schoolchildren were not effective messengers of health knowledge and behavior. Primary school health promotion mainly targets students themselves and may not have rippling effects in the community. We should view school health curricula with a long-term perspective as they train the next generation of caregivers and heads of households to raise their own children with healthier habits.
