Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection is a serious health problem in tropical and subtropical countries such as Philippines. Most dengue prevention programs aim to eradicate its mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. A successful population control program is reliant in understanding the mosquito behavior and ecology including how human-made structures such as roads influence its expansion and movement. Previous studies have discovered the barrier effect of roads in the movement of mosquitoes. In this study, we examined the influence of roads in the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in a fine spatial scale using 11 microsatellite markers. We found significant genetic differentiation of mosquito populations across the road. Our results suggest limited gene flow across the road and supports our hypothesis that roads are potential barriers to mosquito dispersal. This information can be used in designing an effective mosquito population control zones in perceived barrier to mosquito dispersal such as roads.
