Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne virus infection caused by Dabie bandavirus (formerly SFTS virus, SFTSV), which belongs to the Bandavirus genus of the Phenuiviridae family. The case fatality rate of patients with SFTS is high ranging from 16.2% to 47%. SFTS is endemic to East and Southeast Asia. Favipiravir, an antiviral agent with an inhibitory activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibited replication of SFTSV in vitro and in vivo. It was suggested that favipiravir treatment lowered the case fatality rate of patients with SFTS by approximately 10% in comparison with those reported so far through epidemiological survey in Japan. People living in the SFTS-endemic regions can not escape from the risk of being infected with SFTSV. Favipiravir might be an effective drug for treatment of patients with SFTS and reduces the mortality and morbidity of patients with SFTS.
