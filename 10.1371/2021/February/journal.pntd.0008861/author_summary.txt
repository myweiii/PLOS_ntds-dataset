In Africa, information on dengue is limited to outbreak reports focused on some countries in West and East Africa. To estimate the proportion of dengue-positive cases among febrile patients and identify clinical indicators of dengue cases, we conducted passive health facility-based fever surveillance in a catchment area population of 70,000 residents of Lambaréné and its surroundings, Gabon. Among the patients with negative malaria RDT results, those with current fever or history of fever (≤7 days) between 1 and 55 years of age were enrolled at Albert Schweitzer Hospital (ASH). Two samples were collected with an interval of 10 to 21 days after enrollment. Samples underwent different testing for dengue confirmation. Among 682 febrile patients enrolled, 17.4% were identified as dengue-positive. Of these dengue-positive cases, we found DENV-2 and DENV-3 serotypes. Close to 80% of our dengue-positive cases were < 15 years old. Retro-orbital pain and abdominal pain were more commonly found among dengue-positive cases, compared to non-dengue cases. Lambaréné is not considered dengue-endemic. However, one in six non-malarial febrile episodes was found to be dengue-positive in the study period. Clinicians should consider dengue more frequently among non-malarial febrile patients. Given the lack of data on dengue in Gabon, more data should be generated to understand the burden and patterns of dengue for improved case detection.
