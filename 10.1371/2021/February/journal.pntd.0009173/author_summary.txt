Native to Southeast Asia, breeding populations of Aedes albopictus were first discovered in Harris County, Texas, in 1985, and as of 2017, seasonal populations of this species have been reported in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. Aedes albopictus breed readily in natural or man-made environment where stagnant water can accumulate such as gutters, flowerpots, discarded tires, and tree holes. This mosquito species has been implicated in outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses and is a competent vector of many arboviruses including West Nile, eastern equine encephalitis, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis. Aedes albopictus is regarded as an opportunistic mosquito feeding on a variety of domestic and wild mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians; however, a preference for human blood meals has been noted in blood meal analysis of field-collected mosquitoes and in laboratory investigations. We studied vector-host interactions of Ae. albopictus in Virginia, United States using molecular methods and identified ten mammalian, three reptilian, and two avian species as blood hosts of this mosquito species. Our study clarifies the host associations of Ae. albopictus and highlights concerns about the potential role of this mosquito species in transmission of emerging and reemerging arboviruses.
