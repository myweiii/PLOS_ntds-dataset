Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that affects both humans and animals. Humans get infected via ingestion of unpasteurized animal products from infected animals and direct contact during animal abortions and deliveries. Infected animals shed bacteria for life through milk and during deliveries posing a risk to those with occupational exposure to infected animals. As such, human disease is disproportionately high in regions with high prevalence of animal brucellosis. While human brucellosis is distributed globally, incidence is low in North America and Western Europe and high in Asia and the Middle East where the disease is endemic. Data from Africa are scarce. We set out to estimate the incidence of brucellosis in a pastoralist community with documented high Brucella sero-prevalence in humans and livestock. We followed up a cohort of 804 households for one year and tested household members who became ill in three designated health facilities. We estimated an incidence of 84 cases per 100,000 persons per year in this community. We also found that Brucella was the most common pathogen among persons who had febrile illness highlighting the importance of this pathogen in this rural pastoralist community. No brucellosis intervention measures were being implemented.
