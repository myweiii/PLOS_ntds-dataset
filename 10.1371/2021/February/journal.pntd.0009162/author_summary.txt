ZIKV is a neurotropic virus associated with congenital abnormalities that have been grouped under congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), the most prominent being microcephaly. Recent studies have uncovered a spectrum of other abnormalities. However, what remains unclear is the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) of developmental alterations attributable to ZIKV intrauterine exposure in children (> one year of life). In this population-based cohort study, we found that children (without microcephaly) exposed in utero to ZIKV have an increased incidence of mild cognitive delay and auditory behavior abnormalities, with over half of these events attributable to intrauterine exposure. The results of this study suggest that more than half of alterations found in the population study can be attributed to intrauterine ZIKV exposure, thus demonstrating the importance of monitoring apparently healthy children born during the epidemic, even to asymptomatic mothers. Health services should implement early interventions to limit the morbidity of congenital ZIKV infection.
