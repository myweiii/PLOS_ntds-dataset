Every year, nearly a hundred thousand people worldwide die from infection by the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, despite the widespread availability of metronidazole as a treatment. Here we report that six anticancer drugs of the kinase inhibitor class possess potent anti-amoebic properties, with one of them killing both actively dividing parasite and its transmissible cysts. These anticancer kinase inhibitors, including the dual-purpose drug with both amoebicidal and cysticidal activities may be used to treat amoebiasis, especially in cancer patients or in life-threatening brain- and liver-infecting forms of the disease.
