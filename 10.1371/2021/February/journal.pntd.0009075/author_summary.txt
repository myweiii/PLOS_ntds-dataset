Lymphatic filariasis (LF) infection if untreated results in fluid accumulation in the limbs or breasts (lymphedema) or genitalia (hydrocele) that is painful and causes great discomfort. Morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) strategies such as surgery for hydrocele, treatment of acute attacks and management of lymphedema are necessary for the management of the advanced stages of LF. However, very few countries including Zambia, have adequate information on the health beliefs and health seeking behavior of communities living in endemic areas towards MMDP services for LF. This study sought to explore community and health provider perspectives towards MMDP services for LF in a highly endemic region, Luangwa District, Zambia, between February and April 2019. Some of the perceived causes of lymphedema and hydrocele were; contact with animal faeces, use of traditional herbal aphrodisiacs (mutoto), witchcraft and sexual contact with women who were menstruating or had miscarried. There was limited knowledge of home-based and facility-based care strategies for lymphoedema. Nevertheless, patients would often go to health facilities after visiting traditional healers and observing no improvement. Barriers to accessing healthcare included; long distances to the health facilities, lack of awareness of existing MMDP services, perceived costs of accessing healthcare services, gender and social norms and fear of stigmatization.
