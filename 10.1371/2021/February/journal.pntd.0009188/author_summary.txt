Transmissions in endemic areas of the pathogen Entamoeba histolytica and other non-pathogenic Entamoeba species such as E. dispar and E. coli are caused by ingestion of drinking water and foods contaminated with cysts of the parasites. Cases of Entamoeba infections among school-aged children have been reported in several countries. However, it has not been demonstrated that transmission of protozoa of the Entamoeba genus occurs within school facilities. In addition, genetic information on E. histolytica and other morphologically indistinguishable species, including E. dispar and E. moshkovskii, in Thailand remains scarce. In the present study, we demonstrated that E. histolytica and/or E. dispar are prevalent among school-aged children, but limited to few classes in three rural schools in the Thai-Myanmar border region of northwest Thailand. Although various genotypes of these Entamoeba species were identified, identical genotypes were significantly more prevalent in certain school classes and also among siblings, suggesting that transmission occurred within the classrooms and at home. The possibility of person-to-person transmission among these students via direct or indirect contact during daily activities in classrooms and home is proposed.
