    "Background": "Current knowledge on the burden of, and interactions between malaria and helminth co-infections, as well as the impact of the dual infections on anaemia, remains inconclusive. We have conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to update current knowledge as a first step towards developing and deploying coordinated approaches to the control and, ultimately, elimination of malaria-helminth co-infections among children living in endemic countries.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health and Web of Science from each database inception until 16 March 2020, for peer-reviewed articles reporting malaria-helminth co-infections in children living in endemic countries. No language restriction was applied. Following removal of duplicates, two reviewers independently screened the studies for eligibility. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as a measure of association (random-effects model). We also performed Chi-square heterogeneity test based on Cochrane\u2019s Q and evaluated the severity of heterogeneity using I2 statistics. The included studies were examined for publication bias using a funnel plot and statistical significance was assessed using Egger\u2019s test (bias if p<0.1).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The current review suggests that prevalence of malaria-helminth co-infection is high in children living in endemic countries. The nature of the interactions between malaria and helminth infection and the impact of the co-infection on anaemia remain inconclusive and may be modulated by the immune responses of the affected children."
