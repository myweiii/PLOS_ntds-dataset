    "Background": "Oncomelania snails serve as the sole intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum, one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the world. Afforestation suppression of the Oncomelania hupensis snail has been a long-term effective national strategy to decrease snail density in China. Many previous studies have made clear that vegetation (biotic factors) and soil (abiotic factors) were the basic requirements for snail survival on beaches. Moreover, a lot of research on snail control has been focused on the specific influencing environmental factors for snail survival, such as the vegetation community structure, species composition, diversity index, and the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Most of the existing research has studied the influence of a single factor on snail population density. Conversely, there have been only a few studies focused on the food sources and food composition of the snails. The current research situation on snail control has indicated that the mechanisms underlying ecological snail control have not been systematically characterized. The question of whether biotic or abiotic factors were more important in influencing snail survival remains unclear. Afforestation on beaches has significantly suppressed snail density in China so far. In this study, we proposed that the reduction of snail density was not affected by a single factor but by the interactions of multiple related factors introduced by afforestation. Moreover, different biotic and abiotic factors have significantly different effects on snail control. Therefore the goal of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interactions of related biotic and abiotic factors on snail density. Methods: Four major vegetation communities: Sedge, Reed, Artificial poplar (3 years of age) and Artificial poplar (5 years of age), on the beaches of the Yangtze River in China were selected for vegetation and snail surveys, as well as for soil sampling. Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis was used to assess the interactions of biotic and abiotic factors in the context of snail ecology. The soil properties were considered as abiotic factors, while algae of Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta phyla were considered to be biotic factors. In the path analysis, the total effect between the variables was the sum of the direct and indirect effects.",
    "Results": "The snail density had significant correlations with soil properties, such as water content, bulk density, capillary porosity and pH value, as well as with all three types of soil algae, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Snail density had a direct negative relationship with capillary porosity and soil bulk density, an indirect negative relationship with soil pH value and an indirect positive relationship with soil water content via soil algae. Meanwhile, as an important food source for the snail, the Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta algae had a significant positive correlation with snail density. High soil pH had a negative impact on Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, while soil water content had a positive impact on Chlorophyta, and soil bulk density had a negative impact on Cyanophyta. In addition, the soil pH value and soil bulk density both had negative correlations with soil water content.",
    "Conclusion": "Afforestation of the beach environment can significantly reduce the snail population density by altering ecological factors. Soil algae (biological factors) might be the key element that drives ecological snail control. As important habitat determinants, the impact of the properties of the soil (non-biological factors) on the snail population was largely mediated through soil algae."
