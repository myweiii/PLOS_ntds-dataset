Schistosomiasis is the second largest tropical parasitic disease in the world after malaria. By the end of 2018, the areas in which schistosomiasis is endemic in China are distributed across 12 provinces (municipality and autonomous region). Among these areas, 5 provinces, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi, have continued to consolidate achievements in schistosomiasis elimination. Sichuan Province has achieved transmission interruption and 6 provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu have achieved transmission control. Oncomelania hupensis (Snail) is the only intermediate host for the parasite schistosomiasis japonicum, so snail control is an important measure to control the spread of schistosomiasis. So far, the area the snail inhabits in China is 3.63 billion m2, with more than 95% of this distributed along the beaches of Yangtze River. Forestry schistosomiasis prevention projects has effectively reduced the snail habitat area and decreased snail population density through afforestation of these areas in China. However, the key factors that inhibit snail population growth by afforestation remain unclear. We propose to investigate the interactional relationship between biotic and abiotic factors introduced by afforestation on the distribution of the snail population. The results revealed that the number of soil algae is the important biological element determining snail distribution. Abiotic factors, such as soil properties indirectly impact on the snail population through a direct influence on soil algae. Of these, the pH value, water content, capillary porosity, bulk density interact with the algae content (Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta) to decrease snail density through afforestation.
