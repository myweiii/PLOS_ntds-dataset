All eukaryotes add sugar chains to proteins to make glycoproteins, most of which decorate the cell surface and play central roles in how cells interact with their environment and with other cells. These sugar chains are built up using nucleotide sugars to donate the individual sugars. The nucleotide sugars themselves are generally made in the cytoplasm of cells but in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis and nagana in cattle, they are made inside small organelles called glycosomes. This very unusual arrangement in parasite metabolism is notable and may offer therapeutic opportunities.
