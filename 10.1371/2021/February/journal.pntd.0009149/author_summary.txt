As scabies control efforts continue to grow, scarcity of diagnostic options hinders success of elimination efforts in endemic areas. Efficiency in large-scale monitoring is further obstructed by invasive sample collection techniques, which are often uncomfortable for patients, and lack sensitivity. We have developed two PCR-based diagnostic assays targeting repetitive DNA elements. These were identified using new data on the S. scabiei genome. Targeting these elements by PCR improved the detection of scabies DNA. Enhanced sensitivity was demonstrated when tested against routine microscopy and a published PCR-based diagnostic assay. When combined with a non-invasive, effective FLOQ swab sampling method, the developed qPCR-based assays may provide a useful complementary tool for diagnosis of scabies, and its application will likely improve scabies control in target populations.
