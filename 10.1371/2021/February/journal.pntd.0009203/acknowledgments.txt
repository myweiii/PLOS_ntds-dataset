We thank all the participants for their generous time and patience, and for sharing their personal experiences with us. We are also grateful to the primary school where interviews and focus groups were conducted (not named here for confidentiality of participants) for allowing us to conduct interviews and focus groups on their premises, and to the local translator for assisting with translations. Additionally, we would like to thank the Madieu Williams Foundation, the University of Maryland School of Public Health, and PHBB donors for their support.
