Burkholderia pseudomallei is a type of bacteria that can cause a severe disease called melioidosis in humans, and it is known to be transmitted by aerosols in some cases. In this study, we compare the performance of four aerosol samplers for B. pseudomallei aerosolized from different types of liquid suspensions. We found that differences in sampler performance were dependent on the composition of the suspension from which the bacteria was aerosolized, with samplers that collect onto dry substrates (25mm gelatin filters and a Mercer cascade impactor) performing poorly when the initial suspension contained nothing to protect the bacteria against desiccation. The results of this study will help inform comparisons between previous studies of B. pseudomallei in aerosols that used different methods, and will be useful to inform sampler choices for future studies, both in laboratory settings with controlled conditions and field studies with aerosols of unknown composition.
