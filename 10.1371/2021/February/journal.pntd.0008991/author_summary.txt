Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) has been associated with life-threatening bacteremia in sub-Saharan Africa where co-morbidities such as HIV and malaria are highly prevalent. Children under the age of 5 are especially vulnerable to invasive NTS infections. The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant invasive NTS isolates have limited the availability of effective treatment options. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the evolution of invasive and antimicrobial resistant NTS strains is key to mitigating their impact on human health. In this study, we obtained 11 NTS isolates from the bloodstreams of children in Siaya, Kenya and performed both genotypic and phenotypic characterization compared to antimicrobial sensitive NTS strains. One strain, named UGA14, displayed a unique plasmid makeup compared to the other 10 isolates, which encoded for cephalosporin resistance as well as novel metabolic features allowing it to metabolize both lactose and sucrose. Not only was UGA14 multi-drug resistant but its unique metabolic profile made it indistinguishable from Escherichia coli on brilliant green agar indicating the failure of traditional culture-based techniques to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions. These findings highlight the importance of comparative genotypic and phenotypic analyses to understand the driving mechanisms of invasive and drug-resistant pathogens and support the development of effective countermeasures.
