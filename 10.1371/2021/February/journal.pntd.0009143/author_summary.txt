Many infectious diseases, such as H1N1, Ebola, and COVID-19, can be spread to humas from animals. In order to reduce the risk of disease “spillover” (disease transmission from an animal to a person), it is important to understand how interactions between humans and animals can influence spread. Certain behaviors, such as eating raw meat, hunting, or sharing drinking water with animals can put people at greater risk of contacting bacteria and viruses that can cause these diseases. Globally, communities that depend on animal production are at heightened risk due to increased contact with animals. In this study, the authors conducted human behavioral surveys among different communities in Kenya that raise livestock. Results show that reported behaviors varied greatly by community. One of the communities reported a significantly higher proportion of behaviors, such as eating raw meat or eating animals found dead. Communities that show high prevalence of these behaviors may be at greater risk for contracting diseases from animals. Understanding this variation is important for developing plans for community outreach and addressing behaviors that can influence risk of disease spread.
