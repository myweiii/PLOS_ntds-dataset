Most venomous snakebites cause swelling of the bitten body part within a few hours if venom had been injected. Usually, health care providers diagnose venomous snakebites by doing a clinical examination and by testing for incoagulable blood. If no abnormalities are found, then the snakebite is diagnosed as a non-venomous bite or a dry bite. Swelling of the bitten body part results from venom-induced inflammation and is accompanied by local increase in skin temperature. It is possible to capture visual images of these temperature changes by using infrared imaging, the same technology used in night vision cameras. This study found that most persons with venomous snakebites had hot areas on infrared images while such changes were observed in only a few persons with non-venomous or dry snakebites. This new knowledge could help doctors identify non-venomous and dry snakebites early.
