The diagnosis of Onchocerca lupi (Spirurida: Onchocercidae), a zoonotic nematode of domestic animals, is currently based on microscopic examination of skin snip sediments and on the identification of adults embedded in ocular nodules or by molecular assays. An urgent non-invasive diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of O. lupi in dogs is mandatory. In this context, combined immunoblotting and mass spectrometry-based analyses have been performed to identify two proteins, major antigen and paramyosin, of O. lupi. Peptides herein identified represent suitable candidate biomarker for the development of a specific diagnostic test for canine onchocercosis. An accurate, minimally invasive diagnostic method could prove useful for the control of the canine diseases, for establishing large sero-surveys, for mapping the distribution of the infection in endemic areas as well as in areas where information on the disease is not available and for the reduction of risks for human infection.
