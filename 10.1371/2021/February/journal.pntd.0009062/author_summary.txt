Understanding the ecology of sand flies is critical to developing control measures. An important ecologic adaptation of sand flies is their selective use of habitats as resting or breeding habitats. However, the basis for this preference is not fully understood. Here, we sought to understand the distribution of sand flies in three different habitats namely animal shed, human dwelling (houses indoors) and termite mound, and analyzed the chemical cues associated with these habitats. The study was conducted in Rabai village in Baringo County, Kenya, endemic for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. By analyzing sand flies surveyed at different time points during the dry season, we found that sand fly abundance and diversity varied between the habitats. We collected and analyzed volatile organic compounds from represented substrates associated with these habitats and found commonality in some compounds previously known as attractants for sand flies across the habitats. These volatiles may contribute to the composition of sand flies in these habitats that can potentially be exploited in sand fly surveillance and control purposes.
