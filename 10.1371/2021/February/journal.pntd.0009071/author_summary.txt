In addition to helping the ingestion of a bloodmeal, the saliva of vector insects can modulate vertebrate immune responses. However, most research has focused on the salivary proteins, while the sugars (glycans) that modify them remain unexplored. Here we studied N-glycosylation, a common post-translational modification where sugar structures are attached to specific sites of a protein. Insect salivary N-glycans may affect how the saliva is recognized by the host, possibly playing a role during pathogen transmission. In this manuscript, we present the first detailed structural characterization of the salivary N-glycans in the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans, vector of African trypanosomiasis. We found that tsetse fly glycoproteins are mainly modified by simple N-glycans with short mannose modifications, which are recognised by mammalian C-type lectins (mannose receptor and DC-SIGN). Furthermore, we show that salivary glycoproteins bind to the surface of the trypanosomes that are transmitted to the vertebrate host; this opens up interesting questions as to the role of these glycoproteins in the successful establishment of infection by this parasite. Overall, our work represents a novel contribution towards the salivary N-glycome of an important insect vector, and towards the understanding of vector saliva and its complex effects in the vertebrate host.
