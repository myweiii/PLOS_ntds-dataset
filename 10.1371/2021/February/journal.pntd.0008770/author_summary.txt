Schistosoma mansoni causes schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people living in resource-deprived areas of developing countries. No vaccine exists and the current drug treatment has limitations, notably inefficacy against the larval stages of the parasite. New drugs are, therefore, needed to sustainably control schistosomiasis. A further understanding of parasite biology will uncover new targets and lead to the development of novel therapies. Here, we identify the presence of G-Quadruplexes (G4s) in S. mansoni. G4s are four-stranded DNA structures that can affect gene function and, to date, have not been previously found in any parasitic helminth. Computational analysis predicted potential G4 folding sequences within the S. mansoni genome, several of which were confirmed to fold by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Analysis of G4-containing protein coding genes found an enrichment within the wnt signalling pathway, a developmental pathway crucial for axial development in the parasite. Additionally, G4s could be detected within adult worms using a fluorescent antibody that selectively recognises quadruplex structures in nucleic acids. This research describes the presence of a previously unknown structure within the parasite, which could present a new target for developing novel treatments.
