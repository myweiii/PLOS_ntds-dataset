A key issue for persons with leprosy-, lymphatic filariasis- and podoconiosis-related disabilities is the life-long need to practice self-management routines. Family-based support may be a sustainable and feasible strategy to practice self-management. This proof of concept study aimed to develop and pilot a family-based intervention to support prevention and self-management of leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis-related disabilities in Ethiopia. We collected data on physical impairments, activity limitations, stigma and family quality of life, and conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The family-based intervention consisted of self-management of disabilities, awareness raising and socio-economic empowerment. The intervention was delivered over several monthly group meetings. A total of 275 persons affected attended at least one session with a family member. There was no significant improvement in eye and hand problems after the intervention. However, foot and leg impairments, number of acute attacks, lymphedema and shoe wearing all significantly improved. In addition, family quality of life significantly improved, and stigma levels significantly decreased after the intervention. Activity levels improved, but not significantly. This proof of concept study showed that the family-based intervention had a positive effect on impairments and self-management of disabilities, family quality of life and stigma.
