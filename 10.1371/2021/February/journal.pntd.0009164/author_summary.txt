Rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of cardiovascular death and disability, especially in less-developed parts of Africa and Asia. Unfortunately, medications and surgical procedures to prevent or treat rheumatic heart disease and its precursor rheumatic fever are greatly under-used, even though they are very effective. This study conducted an assessment of health system gaps in delivery of RHD related care in Uganda. We used quantitative and qualitative methods to find out, firstly, what percentage of health facilities are currently providing rheumatic heart disease services and, secondly, what things need to be fixed in order to improve service availability. We found that only 1â€“2% of health facilities are currently fully equipped to provide rheumatic heart disease prevention and treatment. The two biggest problems are that frontline health workers know very little about the condition and that the tests used to diagnose rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are not widely available in many districts. Our assessment can serve as a baseline in monitoring the implementation of future interventions in Uganda. We are making our methods and tools publicly available so that ministries of health in other countries can use them to develop or expand their rheumatic heart disease programs.
