Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. Leishmania panamensis is a species that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis and potentially the more severe mucocutaneous leishmaniasis characterized by disfiguring lesions in nose and mouth. The C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse strains are among the models commonly used for studying Leishmania infection and evaluating the effect of novel drug candidates. Previous research shows that the response of these two strains to Leishmania infection differs by factors that are related to both mouse strain genetic background and the infecting Leishmania species. In this study we characterized the differences in gene expression in macrophages of both mouse strains using next generation sequencing technologies. We identified differences in the expression of genes associated with the immune response that suggest that C57BL/6 macrophages display a classical pattern of activation associated with resolution of the disease, while BALB/c macrophages show an intermediate pattern of activation that favors parasite persistence and chronicity of the disease. The intermediate pattern observed in BALB/c macrophages resembles that observed in human infections with L. panamensis and supports the use of BALB/c as the preferred model for studying L. panamensis infection.
