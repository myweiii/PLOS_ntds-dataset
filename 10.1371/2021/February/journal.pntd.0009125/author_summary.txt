Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in tropical regions globally and is an emerging threat in non-tropical areas worldwide. Its mortality rate is high in endemic areas due to its high infectivity, antimicrobial resistance, lack of available vaccines and limited treatment options. Animal model development and pathogenicity studies of various isolates are critical for the development of countermeasures against this pathogen. In this study, we compared the virulence of three different isolates of B. pseudomallei from two geographical locations in an aerosol non-human primate model. We found that early elevations of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as the persistence of these mediators in the terminal phase of bacterial infection correlate with mortality. Histopathological analysis showed that the severity of lesions in various organs also correlates with the virulence of the B. pseudomallei strains, HBPUB10134a, MSHR5855 and K96243. Thus, a dysregulated immune response leading to excessive IL-1Î² and IL-6 at terminal end points and necrosis are key drivers of acute melioidosis. Development of drugs targeting these host response processes will be necessary to counter B. pseudomallei and mitigate the pathological consequences of melioidosis. This non-human primate model will facilitate the screening of vaccines and novel therapeutics.
