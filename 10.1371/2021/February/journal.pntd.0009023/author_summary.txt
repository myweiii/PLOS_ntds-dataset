Snakebite envenoming was recently classified as a priority neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. Up to five million people are bitten, more than a million envenomed, and around 100,000 victims die, mainly in rural and remote areas of low- and middle-income countries. Snakebite envenoming not only affects victims acutely, but it can also cause long-term disability, disfiguring scars, and heavy economic burden due to treatment costs and inability to work. Previous studies have analyzed snakebite clinical, epidemiological, or socio-economic impacts independently, and little has been done to assess the impact of snakebite in animals and on the livelihoods of the communities that depend upon them.
We present an innovative, holistic, national-scale methodology that includes epidemiology, One Health, economic, and geographic information science approaches into one multi-cluster household survey. We randomly selected 250 sub-district areas from all Cameroonian regions and all Nepali Terai districts, which represented more than 61,000 participants in each country. This methodology could be adapted and implemented in other countries affected by snakebite.
