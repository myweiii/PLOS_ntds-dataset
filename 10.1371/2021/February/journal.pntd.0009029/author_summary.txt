Murine typhus is a neglected zoonotic disease, as the number of human cases is likely underestimated in the absence of specific symptoms. It is caused by Rickettsia typhi, a pathogenic bacterium transmitted by rat fleas (Xenospylla spp). The distribution and dynamics of this disease result from complex interactions involving vectors, reservoirs and humans within a shared environment. In this study, we explored the environmental drivers of rat fleas’ abundance on Reunion Island, where murine typhus has recently emerged. Results showed that i) rat fleas’ abundance is highly dynamic, characterized by a peak at the end of the dry season and ii) among the factors investigated, rainfall, temperature and land cover are the main determinants of rat fleas’ abundance. We modeled a predictive map of flea distribution that strongly correlates with the spatial distribution of human cases on the island. This study highlights the importance of accounting for environmental and climatic characteristics to better understand the spatial and temporal drivers of flea-borne diseases.
