COVID-19 has a great impact worldwide, especially in some rural settings where healthcare resources are not sufficient. While control measures in these area may be limited, scholars have been discussing the potential effects of meteorological factors on mitigating COVID-19 transmission. Unfortunately, the majority of literatures only looked at the association between COVID-19 and environmental factors in which their findings could mislead readers that certain environmental conditions could be ‘protective’. In this study, we argue that the impact of the meteorological factors was very limited by using the incidence data from 102 Chinese cities in the first epidemic period when control measures have been taken into account. As what we expected, once the control measures have been incorporated in the modelling analysis, the meteorological factors could only explain < 1% increase in variability of COVID-19 while control measure explained the variance for more than 40% in total. Because of it, we suggest stringent control measures are necessary to control COVID-19 regardless the meteorological conditions of an area. Given that no vaccine is available to date, our investigation provides an additional evidence, as advocated by World Meteorological Organization rather than relying on changes in the natural environment for mitigation, active non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.
