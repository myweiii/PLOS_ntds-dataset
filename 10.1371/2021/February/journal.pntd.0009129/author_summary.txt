Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is targeted for elimination in India by 2020, where early identification and prompt treatment are essential measures for reaching and sustaining incidence benchmarks. Both active- and passive- case detection (ACD and PCD) strategies have been employed in recent years, and evaluating the cost and outputs of each is now important for sustaining funding and political momentum. This study presents overall and unit costs for PCD, index case-based ACD (where neighbours in the vicinity of a recent VL case are screened), and a combination of blanket and camp ACD (involving house-to-house case searching and weekly diagnostic camps) in Bihar, India during 2018. Results of this study indicate that a larger proportion of VL cases were found through PCD in high incidence districts, which may be related to increased interaction with ACD officers. ACD can be bolstered in meso- and low-incidence districts where educational exposure to VL is low and risk of resurgence is high. Although blanket and camp ACD unit costs were at least four times higher than index case-based ACD, the number of VL cases identified through this approach may warrant the investment to achieve VL elimination. Cost and outcomes of VL case finding approaches need to be continuously evaluated until elimination benchmarks are reached and integrated into sustained surveillance programmes.
