It is important to have a better understanding of the immuno-pathogenesis of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and particularly focusing on the chronic phase associated to arthralgia and arthritis. Benefiting from our prospective cohort studies, we herein provide novel in vivo data identifying for the first time the implication of COX-2 and several other enzymes involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis and the persistence of the virus on the joint. Prostaglandin has major activities in inflammation and joint destruction. In vitro, we have used a model of human synovial fibroblasts to decipher the regulatory mechanisms of prostaglandin biosynthesis pathway. We have made important observations showing that the virus itself as well as major inflammatory cytokines can dramatically control the expression of all enzymes involved in the metabolism of prostaglandin. Interestingly, pharmacological investigations further revealed that dexamethasone, but not methotrexate (currently used to treat patients with chikungunya) may be of clinical values.
