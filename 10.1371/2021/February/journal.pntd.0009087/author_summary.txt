Intestinal parasitic diseases are a global public health problem which mostly affect developing countries where adequate water and sanitation facilities are lacking. Due to its equatorial climate, vast territory with isolated areas and the precariousness of its population, intestinal parasitosis is considered to be a major issue in French Guiana and came to be frequently detected during hospitalisations. However, only few data are available and no integrated control programs have been conducted.
This is the first study that has been exploring and reporting epidemiological data on intestinal parasitic infections in French Guiana covering much of the territory. This work reports an average parasitic index of 16.0%, which was stable between 2011 (18.2%) and 2016 (18.3%) with a majority of Ancylostoma sp, Strongyloides stercoralis and Giardia intestinalis. Although it may not be representative of the entire Guyanese population, the parasitic index remained high and stable from 2011 to 2016 and it justifies the need for an active prevention program as it was already done in the other French overseas departments such as Martinique and Guadeloupe.
