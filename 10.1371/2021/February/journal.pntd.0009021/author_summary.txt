Dengue is an important vector-borne viral disease affecting humans. In Bhutan, dengue incidence is on the rise with increased frequency of outbreaks and spread to new areas. Outbreaks were reported from places as high as above 900m above sea level in recent years. However, dengue control activities in Bhutan are usually initiated at the time of outbreaks. This often leads to a large number of cases and overburden the health system. To address these issues, we developed dengue risk maps at a fine spatial resolution by combining risk factors that mediate the transmission of dengue using a weighted linear combination. Vulnerability to dengue was spatially heterogeneous and varied by season. Dengue is highly vulnerable in low-lying areas throughout the season. However, the vulnerability extended to higher geographical elevations including the nationâ€™s capital during the summer season. The study provides a firm evidence-base to prioritize areas and seasons for dengue control strategies in Bhutan.
