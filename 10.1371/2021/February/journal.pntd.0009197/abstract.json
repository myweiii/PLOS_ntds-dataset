    "Background": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease caused by the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). CCHFV has been implicated in severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. During the summer of 2016, the first two cases with genotype III (Africa 3) were reported in Spain. The first objective of our study was to determine the presence of CCHFV among patients with febrile illness during the spring and summer periods in 2017 and 2018. Finally, we perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine the genotype of the virus.",
    "Methodology": "We prospectively evaluated patients aged 18 years and older who came to the emergency department at the Salamanca\u2019s University Hospital (HUS) with fever. Specific IgM and IgG antibodies against CCHFV by ELISA and one immunofluorescence assay against two different proteins (nucleoprotein and glycoprotein C) was done. Moreover, molecular detection by Real Time PCR was performed in all collected samples. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out to genetically characterize CCHFV detected in this study.",
    "Principal findings": "A total of 133 patients were selected. The mean age was 67.63 years and 60.9% were male. One-third of the patients presented an acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Three patients had anti-CCHFV IgG antibodies, suggesting a previous infection. One patient had anti-CCHFV IgM antibodies and a confirmatory RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus corresponds to the European genotype V. This patient came to the emergency department at HUS in August 2018 presenting an acute febrile syndrome with thrombopenia and liver impairment.",
    "Conclusions": "We describe a new circulation of European genotype V CCHFV in Spain. Moreover, this study suggests that CCHFV is an identifiable cause of febrile illness of unknown origin in Spain. Thus, CCHF could be suspected in patients with fever, liver damage, and/or haemorrhagic disorders, particularly in people with risk activities who present in the spring or summer."
