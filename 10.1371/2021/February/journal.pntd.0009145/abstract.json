    "Abstract": "Identifying the Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance mutation patterns is of the utmost importance to assure proper patient\u2019s management and devising of control programs aimed to limit spread of disease. Zoonotic Mycobacterium bovis infection still represents a threat to human health, particularly in dairy production regions. Routinary, molecular characterization of M. bovis is performed primarily by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) while next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are often performed by reference laboratories. However, spoligotyping and MIRU methodologies lack the resolution required for the fine characterization of tuberculosis isolates, particularly in outbreak settings. In conjunction with sophisticated bioinformatic algorithms, whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis is becoming the method of choice for advanced genetic characterization of tuberculosis isolates. WGS provides valuable information on drug resistance and compensatory mutations that other technologies cannot assess. Here, we performed an analysis of the most frequently identified mutations associated with tuberculosis drug resistance and their genetic relationship among 2,074 Mycobacterium bovis WGS recovered primarily from non-human hosts. Full-length gene sequences harboring drug resistant associated mutations and their phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. The results showed that M. bovis isolates harbor mutations conferring resistance to both first- and second-line antibiotics. Mutations conferring resistance for isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, streptomycin, and aminoglycosides were identified among animal strains. Our findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance to monitor the emergence of mutations associated with multi and extensive drug resistance in livestock and other non-human mammals."
