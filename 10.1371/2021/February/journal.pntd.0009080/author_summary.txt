The predominant sand fly vector of the intracellular parasite Leishmania infantum, that causes human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas, is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Vector control tools to reduce transmission are needed. A sex-aggregation pheromone released by male Lu. longipalpis attracts female conspecifics which facilitates blood-feeding and transmission. This study, conducted in Brazil, quantifies the effects of community deployment of a synthetic version of the sex-aggregation pheromone, in a controlled-release dispenser, and co-located with lethal insecticide applied to a small area of the household compound or outbuilding wall. 50mg synthetic pheromone dispensers were used since they attracted substantially more vectors than 10mg dispensers. Deploying this novel lure-and-kill method to houses in eight replicate study blocks in two suburban endemic areas, demonstrated that it reduces vector numbers at both pheromone + insecticide treated houses, and neighbouring untreated houses. The presence of chickens (a known additional attraction to blood-seeking female Lu. longipalpis) increased the beneficial effects of the intervention. The method used only 1â€“2% of the quantity of insecticide necessary for IRS for an average sized house. The results demonstrate the efficacy and potential cost-effectiveness of this novel lure-and-kill control method.
