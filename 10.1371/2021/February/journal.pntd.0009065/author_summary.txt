Four serotypes of DENV co-circulate in dengue endemic areas. Secondary infection with a different DENV serotype is beleived to involve with severe dengue disease. Standard laboratory diagnosis to identify DENV serotypes in dengue patient specimens is performed by sophisticated genome-based RT-PCR method with serotype-specific oligoprimers. We have previously established an alternative protein-based NS1 assay for DENV serotyping namely, a serotyping-NS1-ELISA (stNS1-ELISA), with the use of serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to NS1 protein. Due to its unsatisfactory performance, the stNS1-ELISA was modified in this study. The biotinylated serotype-specific detection Mabs were introduced to enhance the overall sensitivity. A new DENV2-specific antibody was applied to improve DENV serotype identification. Prediction of infecting serotype from NS1-positive samples by our modified assay was 100% concordant with the standard RT-PCR method for all four serotypes. The overall sensitivity was greatly improved by an additional DENV1/DENV3 sub-complex antibody. This modified assay is efficient not only for early dengue diagnosis, but also for serotype identification in epidemiological studies and disease surveillance.
