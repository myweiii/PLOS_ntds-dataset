The endosymbiont bacterium, Wolbachia, has been successfully established in natural Aedes aegypti populations to help suppress the transmission of arboviral diseases such as dengue. The fertility of infected mosquitoes experiencing a quiescent egg stage will influence the efficiency of mosquito releases when mass-reared eggs are stored and may also influence invasion. We tested stored eggs with the wMel or wAlbB infections and found that females derived from eggs stored in a warm environment had reduced fecundity. We also discovered a novel and strong fertility cost on wAlbB-infected A. aegypti, in that a high proportion of females became infertile even though they mated successfully, which was determined by the period when mosquito eggs were quiescent. This effect across life stages was not evident when eggs were stored under cooler conditions and represents the first time that Wolbachia was found to induce female infertility independent of cytoplasmic incompatibility, pointing to a likely additional phenotypic effect of Wolbachia affecting dengue transmission.
