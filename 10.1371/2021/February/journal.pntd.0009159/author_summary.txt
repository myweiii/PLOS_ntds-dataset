Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis, especially in the tropics. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become widely used in low-resource settings for leptospirosis diagnostics. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of five commercially available RDTs in Thai population. The overall sensitivity ranged from 1.8% to 75%, and specificity was 52.3% to 97.7%. Leptocheck-WB had the highest sensitivity of 75.0%. The sensitivity of five RDTs increased on days 4â€“6 post onset of fever, while the specificity of all tests remained relatively stable at different days post onset of fever. Based on these results, RDTs showed low sensitivity and might not be an appropriate test for acute leptospirosis screening in the Thai population.
