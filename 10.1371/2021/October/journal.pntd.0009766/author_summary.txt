The world population is currently at a high risk of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). People who live in malaria-endemic areas and get infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 if they are co-infected with malaria. Therefore, we aim to demonstrate the prevalence and characteristics of malaria infections among COVID-19-infected individuals. From the systematic literature review, we showed that the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection among patients with COVIDâ€“19 is 11%. Most of the coinfections were reported in Nigeria, India, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Moreover, we showed that patients with coinfections are typically symptomatic at presentation with mild or moderate parasitemia. We also indicated that patients with coinfections often display thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated bilirubin levels. Among four patients with coinfections and severe diseases, one experienced worsened clinical status after administration of the anti-malarial drug. One of the patients, a pregnant woman, experienced a serious outcome of coinfection, fetal abortion, due to the initial misdiagnosis of malaria. Based on our study, further prospective studies must investigate the burden and outcomes of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic regions. Further prompt management is necessary to prevent severe outcomes in patients co-infected with COVID-19 and malaria.
