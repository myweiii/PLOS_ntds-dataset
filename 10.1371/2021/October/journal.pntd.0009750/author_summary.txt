Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonotic tropical disease of humans, which reduces the productivity of animal industries, and imposes an economic burden of at least 3.2 billion dollars annually. Although there are four assemblies for F. hepatica and two assemblies for F. gigantica at NCBI, the inherent limited ability of short reads based assemblies made the completeness of genome sequences and the quality of gene annotation challenging. Here, we report the Pacbio assembly of reference genome for F. gigantica, and the quality of assembly and gene annotation are significantly improved compared with previous assemblies. Besides, we found the evidence of transposon-mediated evolution, especially for LINE insertions into gene regions between 41 Ma and 62 Ma, contributing to the speciation and adaption of the Fasciola ancestors. Furthermore, we identified F. gigantica specific gene duplication including 98 gene families, and 3300 protein-protein interactions between F. gigantica and the host in the small intestine and liver environment. These results illustrate the genomic and gene evolution of F. gigantica potentially shaping multiple parasitic characters.
