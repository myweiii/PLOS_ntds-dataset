    "Abstract": "Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica are causative pathogens of fascioliasis, with the widest latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal distribution; however, among parasites, they have the largest sequenced genomes, hindering genomic research. In the present study, we used various sequencing and assembly technologies to generate a new high-quality Fasciola gigantica reference genome. We improved the integration of gene structure prediction, and identified two independent transposable element expansion events contributing to (1) the speciation between Fasciola and Fasciolopsis during the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary mass extinction, and (2) the habitat switch to the liver during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, accompanied by gene length increment. Long interspersed element (LINE) duplication contributed to the second transposon-mediated alteration, showing an obvious trend of insertion into gene regions, regardless of strong purifying effect. Gene ontology analysis of genes with long LINE insertions identified membrane-associated and vesicle secretion process proteins, further implicating the functional alteration of the gene network. We identified 852 predicted excretory/secretory proteins and 3300 protein-protein interactions between Fasciola gigantica and its host. Among them, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase genes, with specific gene copy number variations, might play a central role in the phase I detoxification process. Analysis of 559 single-copy orthologs suggested that Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica diverged at 11.8 Ma near the Middle and Late Miocene Epoch boundary. We identified 98 rapidly evolving gene families, including actin and aquaporin, which might explain the large body size and the parasitic adaptive character resulting in these liver flukes becoming epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions."
