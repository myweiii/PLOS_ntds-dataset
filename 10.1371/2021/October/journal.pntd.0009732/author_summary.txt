Two hookworm vaccine candidate (Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1) have been tested in Gabonese and found to be safe and to induce antibody response. We aimed to study the cellular immune responses among vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers. We found that Na-GST-1 induced CD4+ T cell responses (IL-2, TNF) among the vaccinated volunteers that received the high vaccine dose (100 ug). Furthermore Na-GST-1 specific memory T cells were found to express the inhibitory molecule CTLA-4. These responses was not observed in those who received the low dose of the Na-GST-1 vaccine, or those who received Na-APR-1 or HBV. By blocking CTLA-4, we observed an increase in TNF production. Our data suggest that an intervention involving blockage of the CTLA-4 molecule in the vaccinated could be beneficial in endemic settings where vaccine responses have been shown to be lower compared to non-endemic settings.
