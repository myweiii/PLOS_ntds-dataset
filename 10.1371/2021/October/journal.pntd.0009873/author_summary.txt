Dengue virus (DENV) accounts for one of the most transmitted mosquito-borne infectious diseases worldwide. While an estimated 390 million infections occur per year, no specific antiviral compounds are available yet. Further, Denvaxia approved vaccine is not fully protective. Research of new therapies that could control infection caused by DENV is thus important to the field. Also, therapies that can modulate the inflammatory immune response, critical for severe progression in DENV-infected patients, may represent good candidates for fighting DENV infections. Here, we continued the research that we have been doing the last years, regarding the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of Vitamin D (VitD3) against DENV infection in human macrophages, which represent a natural target for DENV replication. We show that VitD3 modulates innate immune responses of macrophages in response to DENV 2 infection, through i) downregulation of TLRs ii) decrease in ROS production, and iii) upregulation of SOCS 1 and IFN-stimulated genes such as PKR and OAS. Our study increases our insights into the mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of VitD3 in DENV-2 infected macrophages, which ultimately would contribute to the progress of VitD3 as a candidate for anti-DENV therapy.
