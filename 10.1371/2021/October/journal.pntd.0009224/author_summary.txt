Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites and spread by the bites of infected sand flies. Most cases of leishmaniasis present as self-healing sores that are resolved by a balanced immune response. Other cases of leishmaniasis involve spread to sites distant from the original bite, including damage of the inner surfaces of the mouth and nose. These cases of leishmaniasis involve an excessive immune response. Leishmania parasites produce virulence factor proteins, such as GP63, to trick the immune system into mounting a weaker response. GP63 specifically degrades signaling proteins that attract and activate certain immune cells. Here, we demonstrate that Leishmania parasite species have evolved to differ in their ability to degrade signaling proteins. In Leishmania species known to cause more immune-mediated tissue damage, the GP63 virulence factor has evolved to not degrade specific immune signaling proteins, thus attracting, and activating more immune cells. Our results demonstrate how diversity among Leishmania parasite species can contribute to variation in immune responses that may play critical roles in the outcome of infection.
