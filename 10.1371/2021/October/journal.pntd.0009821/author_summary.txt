Nodding syndrome (NS) is a devastating and enigmatic childhood disease, accompanied by multiple neurological impairments and neuroinflammation. NS is associated with the parasite Onchocerca volvulus (Ov) and other environmental factors. It was shown that NS seems to be an "Autoimmune-Epilepsy". However, it is still not clear why only some children, within the same family, tribe and district, develop this malady in South-Sudan. Recently, we hypothesized that immunogenetic factors might address this question, and indeed demonstrated that few amino acids in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide-binding grooves associate with either protection or susceptibility to NS. In the current study, we evaluate the contribution of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to NS pathology. MIF is an immune-regulatory cytokine that is involved in numerous pathologies, which vary from infectious diseases, autoimmunity to neurodegenerative diseases. Immunogenetic analysis of MIF in South-Sudanese NS patients and healthy controls shed new light on the epidemiology of this disease. Our findings suggest that MIF promoter genotypes that are linked with high-protein expression are associated with disease protection. However, in affected patients, with established NS, MIF plasma levels are elevated compared to control subjects and might be involved with autoimmunity and neuroinflammation.
