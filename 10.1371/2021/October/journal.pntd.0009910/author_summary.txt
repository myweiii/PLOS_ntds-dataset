Leprosy is a chronic mycobacterial infection that affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Despite the wide deployment of effective anti-mycobacterial therapy for this infection, there are still approximately 200,000 new cases of leprosy identified every year globally. The WHO leprosy elimination strategy reduced the overall prevalence of the disease, but the detection of new cases indicates ongoing transmission in many countries. The detection of cases of leprosy in children is a surrogate marker of ongoing transmission in the community. In this study conducted in Cuba, we identified that the Cuban National Leprosy Control Program (NLCP) continues to see an important number of cases of leprosy in children (under the age of 15 years) in selected communities in many of the Cuban provinces. Additionally, we observed that in most cases either one or more relatives with leprosy residing in the same household. In summary, our study highlights to achieve interrupting of leprosy transmission in Cuba; there is a need for further active surveillance efforts targeting selected provinces and communities to identify cases early in their clinical course and institute antimicrobial therapy. Contact investigation is one of the main tools to achieve interruption of transmission.
