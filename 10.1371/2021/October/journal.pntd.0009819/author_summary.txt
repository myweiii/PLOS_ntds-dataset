Chagas disease (CD) is a tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. CD originated in the Americas but is now found globally due to population movements. CD is transmitted through a triatomine vector, organ transplants, blood transfusions, T. cruzi-contaminated food and drinks, and congenitally. It occurs in two stages, an acute stage (usually asymptomatic) and a chronic stage. Twenty to thirty percent of chronic stage cases present severe cardiac symptoms such as heart failure, localized aneurysms and cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, what causes severe cardiac symptoms in some individuals in chronic CD is not fully understood. Therefore, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the heart tissue of chronically T. cruzi-infected and uninfected mice, to understand the impact of infection on the tissue metabolome. We identified discriminatory small molecules related to T. cruzi infection and determined that regions with the highest parasite burden are distinct from the regions with the largest changes in overall metabolite profile. These locations of high metabolic perturbation provide a molecular mechanism to explain why localized cardiac symptoms occur in CD, particularly at the heart apex. Overall, our work gives insight into chronic cardiac CD symptom development and shapes a framework for novel CD treatment.
