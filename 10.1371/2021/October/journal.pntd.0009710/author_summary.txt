Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) had decreased significantly in China based on the two national surveys implemented in 1988–1992 and 2001–2004, respectively. In 2014–2015, an updated national survey on STH was implemented in rural China. This survey covered rural areas of 31 provinces in mainland of China and multiple-stage stratified cluster sampling was employed. Stool samples were collected and examined for helminth eggs. Totally, 484,210 villagers from 604 counties in 31 provinces participated in the survey. The adjusted prevalence of STH was 4.49%, and that of hookworm infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis was 2.62%, 1.36%, 1.02%, respectively. The estimated population with STH was 29.12 million, while that with hookworm infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis was 16.97 million, 8.83 million, 6.60 million, respectively. Children showed a high prevalence in ascariasis and trichuriasis, while the older population had a high prevalence of hookworm infections. STH was still highly prevalent in western parts, moderately in central areas, and low in eastern and northern regions. Further efforts are needed to control STH in China.
