Almost a billion people receive >7.7 billion doses of treatment aimed at eliminating lymphatic filariasis, which is caused by three filarial nematodes: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Drug resistance and adaptation are both associated with pathogen success as well as higher levels of genetic diversity. In an examination of genetic diversity in Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi, we observed a lack of genetic diversity over a third of the genome that is found on chromosome X. These species have neo-X chromosomes where a chromosome X fused with an autosome. Using publicly-available published data, the other filarial nematodes of greatest human significance are also found to have a similar lack of genetic diversity on their neo-X chromosomes. The two filarial nematodes with publicly-available data that lack neo-X chromosomes did not have this lack of genetic diversity. This lack of sequence diversity in B. malayi, W. bancrofti, and O. volvulus could have profound effects on all traits encoded on chromosome X.
