Blastocystis sp. and Dientamoeba fragilis are single-cell parasites of the human intestine which are common worldwide and reported in cases with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the role of Blastocystis sp. and D. fragilis in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms is still controversial because their presence is not always associated with symptoms. As some intestinal parasitic infections can cause severe illness in immunocompromised individuals careful consideration of intestinal protist infection is warranted. However, testing for Blastocystis sp. and D. fragilis is not routinely carried out by most laboratories and clinicians. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. and D. fragilis in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with diarrhea by conventional and molecular methods. Both Blastocystis sp. and D. fragilis were detected more frequently by quantitative polymerase chain reaction than by conventional methods. Next generation sequencing was used to characterize the diversity and frequency of Blastocystis sp. subtypes and mixed subtypes in patients in Turkey. Five Blastocystis sp. subtypes (ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 and ST6) were detected. ST3 was the most frequent subtype in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Mono-infections were more common than mixed subtype infections. Our findings showed that Blastocystis sp. and D. fragilis are commonly present in immunocompetent and immunodeficient patients with diarrhea.
