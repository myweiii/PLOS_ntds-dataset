Aedes albopictus is an invasive species and an efficient disease vector. The bioecological traits of this species and human-mediated transportations have fueled its worldwide spread. Because the levels of vector competence and insecticide resistance vary among geographical strains, the worldwide migration of this species is a concern for public health and vector control. While numerous studies have been done in non-native areas, within its native areas in Asia movements have not been explored. This study used molecular techniques to search for signs of introduction of an exotic population through three major international seaports on Kyushu Island, Japan. The present study found a genetically distinct group of Ae. albopictus near the container terminal in Fukuoka. The study suggests that its origin was one temperate region of East Asia outside of Japan, and the establishment of this group was not recent. As vector competence varies among different populations and the knock down resistance gene has been reported from some populations outside Japan, the risk of introducing mosquitoes with greater vector competence/insecticide resistance needs to be considered. This is the first study to describe the spatial population structure of Ae. albopictus in Japan using molecular techniques.
