Toxoplasmosis gondii (T. gondii) is a parasite that infects over 10 percent of the US population. T. gondii infection can cause serious health problems for some people, but most infections remain undiagnosed and subclinical. When an individual is infected, T. gondii can chronically reside in muscle and central nervous system (including brain) tissue. Previous studies have found that individuals with prior exposure to T. gondii may engage in more risky and impulsive behaviors, and risk tolerance and impulsivity may be related with individualâ€™s diet. Our study examines whether individuals with T. gondii exposure have higher body mass index (BMI) and worse diets. We further discuss and test for alternative explanations that prevent us from establishing a causal relationship between T. gondii and BMI/diet. Overall, our results show that T. gondii exposure is related with higher BMI and worse diets among lower-income females in the US. Our results uncover a novel correlate of BMI and diets, and suggest the importance of investigating the broader public health impacts of chronic T. gondii infection.
