Several studies were conducted on intermediate snail hosts of schistosomes in The Gambia between the 1950s and 1980s, but there are few reports of similar studies in recent times. After The Gambia initiated its national control programme for schistosomiasis in 2014, the need arose for more and current information on schistosomiasis and the intermediate snail hosts involved indirectly in its transmission. We undertook a malacological survey of freshwater sites in all five regions (CRR, URR, WR, LRR and NBR) of The Gambia. While no Biomplalaria snails were found in any of the 114 sites sampled, three species of Bulinus snails were found. Of the total 2877 Bulinus snails collected, 75.9% were identified as Bulinus senegalensis, 20.9% as Bulinus forskalii and 3.2% as Bulinus truncatus. CRR had the highest number of snails amongst the regions and seasonal pools yielded the most snails amongst the habitat types sampled. Habitat type, water temperature and pH of sites were observed to have an influence on snail abundance. All three Bulinus snails were found infected with schistosome parasites. The human parasite (Schistosoma haematobium) had a much more restricted distribution as opposed to the livestock parasite (Schistosoma bovis) which had a wider geographical range. The study provides the first malacological report of intermediate snail hosts of schistosomes in The Gambia in over 3 decades and will be useful to the national schistosomiasis control programme.
