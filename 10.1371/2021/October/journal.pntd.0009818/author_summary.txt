In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occurs typically in urban settings, where dogs play a role as reservoirs and control efforts have failed to reduce disease occurrence. Active screening for Leishmania spp. canine infection by serosurveys is an important pillar of the national VL control program. However, many municipalities also detect cases passively by testing animals on request of individual dog owners. For a VL-endemic municipality in Brazil, we show how the number of dogs tested on free demand in the area increased from 2011 to 2016, with seropositivity consistently exceeding 47%. Increased diagnosis-seeking behavior within neighborhoods was associated with a decrease in the distance to the screening site and higher (recent) levels of canine seropositivity in the neighborhood. The data also suggested that dog owners with better socioeconomic status and animals with clinical signs of canine VL (CVL) predominated among those who sought screening. As passive case detection contributes to timely diagnosis of CVL, it should be encouraged in VL endemic areas. Diagnosis seeking-behavior could be increased by setting up screening sites in multiple accessible areas and especially in areas that are most affected by CVL. In parallel, population-based serosurveys must continue as surveillance tools to guide VL control actions.
