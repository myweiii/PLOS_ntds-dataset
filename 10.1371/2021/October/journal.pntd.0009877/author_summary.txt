Schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) estimated to infect more than 230 million people worldwide. Of the various species of schistosomes that cause disease in humans, Schistosoma japonicum is considered the most virulent. As such, this pathogen presents a crucial public health threat. Typically, diagnosis of S. japonicum has been performed via the Kato-Katz technique which has been shown to dramatically underestimate the burden of infection, resulting in a need for improved detection strategies. To address this need, we have employed bioinformatic tools in order to identify a tandemly arranged, highly repetitive, DNA sequence, SjTR1, in the S. japonicum genome. Utilizing this sequence as a real-time PCR assay target, we have developed a sensitive and specific assay for the detection of S. japonicum DNA. Employment of this assay in field settings will facilitate the accurate detection of S. japonicum and provide guidance capable of informing mass drug administration efforts targeting elimination.
