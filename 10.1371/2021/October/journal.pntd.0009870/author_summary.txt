Chagas disease is caused by the single cell protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Millions of people suffer from this disease in central and south America, which frequently causes heart disease and can result in death. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease due to the lack of investment in development of new medicines. The currently available medicines are inadequate as they require long treatments, often with severe side-effects. To develop new medicines, it is critical to build laboratory assays and tools that help predict the ability of new compounds to cure patients. Rate-of-kill assays measure how quickly compounds can kill parasites, providing a route to differentiate promising compounds from poor ones. Here, we describe development of an advanced rate-of-kill assay that, unlike existing assays, can monitor the same cell population over the duration of compound treatment. Using live-cell microscopy, parasite-infected host cells and their response to compound treatment can be continuously monitored. This enables better defined rate-of-kill profiles to be produced, in turn allowing better informed decisions on subsequent compound progression. Here, we report the live-imaging rate-of-kill profiles for several key compounds, including current drugs and compounds in clinical development.
