We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection and associated risk factors. Stool samples were collected from 681 schoolchildren and processed using Kato-Katz and Ritchie’s concentration techniques. Among those students, 238 (34.9%) were infected with S. mansoni. Kato-Katz and Ritchie’s concentration detect 220 (92.4%) and 165 (69.3%) of the total positive cases, respectively. Most of the S. mansoni infections were categorized as low infection intensity based on egg per gram of stool. Among the potential risk factors assessed; being male, bathing habits in open water and schools in which students attended were independent predictors for S. mansoni infection.
