Schistosomiasis is a global-health concern causing severe disease, particularly in communities in tropical areas such as Uganda. The parasite is spread in areas with inadequate sanitation and a lack of a safe water supply. Government control efforts focus on mass drug administration for people living in affected areas, with most treatments administered to school-aged children. However, drug uptake is low, and people are rapidly reinfected. In three heavily affected communities on the shores of Lake Victoria, we explored the sources of schistosomiasis information, how messages were relayed to community members, the remembered content of these messages and the way messages were perceived. Common sources of information were health workers at government health facilities, trained village health team members, teachers, and radio programmes. Our findings show that the information shared from the different sources is not consistent and, in some cases, this has caused confusion and prompted a reluctance to engage with treatment or preventative efforts. We propose a framework where there is dialogue between community member representatives, health workers based in the community, and government technical staff to come up with clear, concise, and consistent messages.
