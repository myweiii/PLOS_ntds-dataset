Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are parasitic worms present in over 1 billion people. Humans release STH eggs to the environment through faeces, and they become infected by egg ingestion or larvae skin penetration. The higher the number of eggs in an infection (high intensity infection) the higher the morbidity severity. For that, the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate STH as a health problem by reducing moderate and high intensity infections below 2% in 96% of endemic countries by 2030. STH infections main control strategies are mass drug administration to people at risk, and water, sanitation, and hygiene improvements. Nowadays, some regions are reaching WHO goals. Thus, tools to confirm if control strategies could be halted are needed. In this study, we selected a low intensity district in Southern Mozambique where we evaluated how different diagnostic techniques detect STH when intensity of infection is low. In addition, we also created district maps for STH estimated infection prevalence based on the different diagnostics assessed in order to identify the location of ongoing transmission. qPCR showed to be the most sensitive technique. Hence, maps based on the widely used Kato-Katz could underestimate the STH prevalence and lose hidden transmission.
