Vector control (VC) for managing Aedes aegypti and reducing transmission of Aedes-borne diseases is largely focused on peridomestic insecticide applications. However, the indoor resting behavior of Ae. aegypti and the acceleration of insecticide resistance owed to reduced modes of action have diminished the effectiveness of many VC tools. A targeted Indoor residual spraying (TIRS) modality in experimental housing units was employed to investigate the potential of chlorfenapyr, a pyrrole-class insecticide with known effectiveness to resistant mosquito species. This was the first investigation for chlorfenapyr use against locally resistant Ae. aegypti (Merida, Mexico) with this approach. Two treatment arms were investigated in the present study: TIRS and a control house where only water was sprayed. A comparison of entomological efficacy for TIRS applied to interior perimeter walls below 1.5 m with chlorfenapyr (formulated as Sylando 240SC) at 250 mg/m2 over 12 months was assessed. TIRS chlorfenapyr treatments were highly efficacious and led to acute mortalities (after 24 exposure) above 80% up to 5 months; delayed mortalities (to Ae. aegypti) were monitored over seven days post exposures vs untreated controls. When delayed mortality was considered, residual efficacy of chlorfenapyr extended to 7 months. These data provide evidence that TIRS chlorfenapyr is an effective Aedes management tool that surpassed efficacy profiles for other TIRS insecticides that have been previously reported with this method. Further, Chlorfenapyr emerges as a novel addition to Ae. aegypti VC, and future studies should focus on its effectiveness and residual power as part of Phase II-III TIRS trials.
