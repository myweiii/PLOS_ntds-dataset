While the impacts of natural hazards tend to be described in terms of social determinants such as exposure and vulnerability, the risk for infectious disease is often expressed in terms of environmental determinants without fully considering the socio-ecological processes that put people in contact with infective agents of disease. In the case of schistosomiasis, risk is determined by human interactions with freshwater environments where schistosome parasites circulate between people and aquatic snails. In this study, we quantified the relative contributions of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability to schistosome re-infection among schoolchildren in an endemic region of northern Senegal. We find that hazard and vulnerability influence whether a child becomes infected, while exposure and hazard influence the burden of worms once infection is acquired. Increasing numbers of worms is known to be positively associated with increasing severity of disease. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating social and environmental determinants of disease simultaneously; omitting measures of exposure, hazard or vulnerability may limit our understanding of risk.
