Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided extensive information regarding the genetic component of complex traits, including parasitic diseases such as Chagas disease. However, these associations mapped in regulatory regions of the genome and assigning them a functional consequence have been cumbersome. In this study we aimed to evaluate the functional mechanism underlying the previously reported genomic association with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, by assessing the correlation between methylation changes and the underlying genetic variations within the region. These methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) may be involved in gene expression regulation. We identified mQTLs in three genes that have been associated with cardiovascular diseases in previous studies. Interestingly, one of these genes was previously identified as differentially methylated and expressed in heart biopsies of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy patients. Our results suggest novel genes that could play a role in the chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, evidencing the functional relevance of the previously associated loci.
