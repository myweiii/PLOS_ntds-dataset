Although rabies is nearly always fatal, it is also almost 100% preventable. While thousands of people receive PEP each year, the total amount of PEP administered in the United States and whether it is administered correctly, is unknown. To understand PEP use nationally, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sent a survey to public health professionals in the 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York City. Only half of responding jurisdictions had some method of tracking the number of people who had an animal bite or received rabies PEP; these methods differed in quality and completeness. For three states that had PEP data from their surveillance systems and also state-level emergency department (ED) data on the number of initial ED visits for PEP administration, discordant numbers suggested that the number of people who receive PEP may be much higher than estimated. Monitoring PEP administration through ED data could be one way to ensure that people receive appropriate PEP after an exposure and that costs are better understood.
