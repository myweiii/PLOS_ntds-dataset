Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A is an understudied cause of enteric fever which has started replacing Salmonella Typhi in some endemic regions. Currently, there are limited genomic epidemiology data to understand the true disease burden of disease caused by S. Paratyphi A in poor resource settings like Bangladesh. Our genomic data revealed that the population structure of S. Paratyphi A in Bangladesh comprised of only previously defined lineages A, C and F and carried single point mutation in gyrA gene associated with decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility with no evidence of multi-drug resistance. Additionally, the global context revealed the clustering of organisms associated with neighboring countries in South Asia. We identified the pHCM2-like cryptic plasmid among our collection, which was not found in any S. Paratyphi A isolates previously. A comparative plasmid analysis showed that S. Paratyphi A pHCM2-like plasmid was highly similar to the plasmid found in S. Typhi but significantly different to a similar plasmid from non-invasive Salmonella Paratyphi B variant Java isolate from Bangladesh. This present study highlights the importance of sustained genomic surveillance to monitor the ongoing evolution of antimicrobial resistant determinants and plasmids in Bangladesh and transmission between different countries.
