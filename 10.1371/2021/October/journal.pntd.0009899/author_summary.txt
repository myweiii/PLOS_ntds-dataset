Flagellated protozoa belonging to the Leishmania genus are the causative agents of the Leishmaniasis, neglected tropical diseases with a worldwide distribution. These parasites are well known for unique molecular mechanisms which include a lack of regulation of mRNA synthesis, generally the major stage for the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of mRNA translation is therefore critical for survival and adaptation during a life cycle involving multiple life forms. Such regulation is likely dependent on RNA binding proteins (RBPs), such as the Poly-A Binding Protein (PABP) that binds to the 3’ ends of the mRNAs. Three PABPs are found in Leishmania, more than in other unicellular organisms, with presumably distinct but undefined roles. Here we identify different mRNAs targets and specific RBPs with whom they interact. We define a specific association between one of the Leishmania PABPs, a single RBP and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, an important subset of cellular mRNAs. Our results shed new light on the interactions required for the translation of these mRNAs, highlighting the relevance of regulating their translation in different organisms and the convergence of regulatory mechanisms acting through their 5’ and 3’ ends. The data also expands on the known PABP roles.
