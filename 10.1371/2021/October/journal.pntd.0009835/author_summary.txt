Since its first detection in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into more than a thousand recognized lineages. Several of these lineages are known to have higher transmissibility or better escape from the immune system. One of them is the P.1 lineage, also known as the variant of concern Gamma. It was first discovered in Brazil in December 2020 and has quickly replaced the previous lineage dominating the country, P.2. We used genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 samples that were collected in the first months of 2021 to analyze how P.1, P.2 and other lineages had spread across Brazil. Our research has identified that P.1 lineage was already present in several states of Brazil almost two months before its first detection in the state of Amazonas. Our work sheds light on the importance of continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in historically understudied regions to early detect and control the spread of new variants of concern.
