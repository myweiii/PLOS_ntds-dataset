    "Abstract": "The frequency of arboviral disease epidemics is increasing and vector control remains the primary mechanism to limit arboviral transmission. Container inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are the primary vectors of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Current vector control methods for these species are often ineffective, suggesting the need for novel control approaches. A proposed novel approach is autodissemination of insect growth regulators (IGRs). The advantage of autodissemination approaches is small amounts of active ingredients compared to traditional insecticide applications are used to impact mosquito populations. While the direct targeting of cryptic locations via autodissemination seems like a significant advantage over large scale applications of insecticides, this approach could actually affect nontarget organisms by delivering these highly potent long lasting growth inhibitors such as pyriproxyfen (PPF) to the exact locations that other beneficial insects visit, such as a nectar source. Here we tested the hypothesis that PPF treated male Ae. albopictus will contaminate nectar sources, which results in the indirect transfer of PPF to European honey bees (Apis mellifera). We performed bioassays, fluorescent imaging, and mass spectrometry on insect and artificial nectar source materials to examine for intra- and interspecific transfer of PPF. Data suggests there is direct transfer of PPF from Ae. albopictus PPF treated males and indirect transfer of PPF to A. mellifera from artificial nectar sources. In addition, we show a reduction in fecundity in Ae. albopictus and Drosophila melanogaster when exposed to sublethal doses of PPF. The observed transfer of PPF to A. mellifera suggests the need for further investigation of autodissemination approaches in a more field like setting to examine for risks to insect pollinators."
