Autodissemination approaches have attracted a significant amount of attention for mosquito control because of the advantages of self-delivery of small amounts of highly potent insect growth regulators (IGRs) such as pyriproxyfen (PPF) to oviposition locations. However, while PPF may be delivered to oviposition locations by the mosquito vehicles, these treated mosquitoes may also be delivering PPF to nectar sources that other insects may visit, in particular important insect pollinators. Here we have examined for the direct transfer of PPF to nectar sources and the indirect transfer to the European honey bee. We show PPF is being deposited on artificial nectar sources and is being indirectly transferred to European honey bees. The results are discussed in reference to the potential risks to important insect pollinators of using autodissemination approaches for mosquito control.
