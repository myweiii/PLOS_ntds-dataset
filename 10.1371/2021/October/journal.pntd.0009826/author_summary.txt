A strategy to optimize the composition for a broadly-protective Shigella vaccine is to combine components directed against S. sonnei with S. flexneri serotypes to induce antibody responses with the maximum cross-reactivity between different serotypes. Based on mouse and rabbit immunogenicity, we selected 4 GMMA-immunogens, derived from S. sonnei and S. flexneri 1b, 2a and 3a, able to induce antibodies that were broadly bactericidal against most epidemiologically significant S. flexneri strains in mice and rabbits. This was not predicted on the basis of O-antigen modifications conferring serotype or group specificities and allowed revisiting the dogma of cross-protection among S. flexneri serotypes. Overall, this study provides a framework for the rational design of a broadly-protective vaccine that will be evaluated in upcoming human vaccine trials. It also tackles a key issue regarding Shigella vaccine development that is balancing a sufficient number of antigenic components in the vaccine to provide adequate coverage of serotype diversity while minimizing complexity.
