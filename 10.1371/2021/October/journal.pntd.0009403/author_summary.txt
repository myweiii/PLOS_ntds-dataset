Hydrocele is a type of scrotal swelling caused by lymphatic filariasis and requires surgery to treat, which can be challenging to address in many endemic countries. Locating and referring patients, providing high quality surgical intervention, and creating a patient follow-up mechanism are all formidable aspects in communities that are often resource challenged and difficult to reach. We explored if the use of a surgical camp setting would be an appropriate intervention to adequately treat a large number of hydrocele patients over a short period, decreasing delays in seeking, reaching and receiving quality surgery for hydrocele. We analyzed each step required to hold the camp including some novel innovations surrounding patient mobilization, referral, and post-surgical quality assurance. The camp was effective at providing a large number of quality surgeries in a short time, with patients self-reporting improvements in quality of life, economic and health status after surgery. The findings from the study may prove useful for countries seeking to implement similar interventions.
