    "Background": "Assessment of surveillance and response system functions focusing on notifiable diseases has widely been documented in literature. However, there is limited focus on diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, particularly preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs). There are limited strategies to guide strengthening of surveillance and response system functions concerning PC-NTDs. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a framework to improve surveillance and response to PC-NTDs at the sub-national level in Kenya.",
    "Methods": "A multi-phased approach using descriptive cross-sectional mixed-method designs was adopted. Phase one involved a systematic literature review of surveillance assessment studies to derive generalised recommendations. Phase two utilised primary data surveys to identify disease-specific recommendations to improve PC-NTDs surveillance. The third phase utilised a Delphi survey to assess stakeholders\u2019 consensus on feasible recommendations. The fourth phase drew critical lessons from existing conceptual frameworks. The final validated framework was based on resolutions and inputs from concerned stakeholders.",
    "Results": "The first phase identified thirty studies that provided a combination of recommendations for improving surveillance functions. Second phase described PC-NTDs specific recommendations linked to simplified case definitions, enhanced laboratory capacity, improved reporting tools, regular feedback and supervision, enhanced training and improved system stability and flexibility. In the third phase, consensus was achieved on feasibility for implementing recommendations. Based on these recommendations, framework components constituted human, technical and organisational inputs, four process categories, ten distinct outputs, outcomes and overall impact encompassing reduced disease burden, halted disease transmission and reduced costs for implementing treatment interventions to achieve PC-NTDs control and elimination.",
    "Conclusion": "In view of the mixed methodological approach used to develop the framework coupled with further inputs and consensus among concerned stakeholders, the validated framework is relevant for guiding decisions by policy makers to strengthen the existing surveillance and response system functions towards achieving PC-NTDs elimination."
