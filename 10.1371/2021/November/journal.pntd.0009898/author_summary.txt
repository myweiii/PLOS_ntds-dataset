The drug praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by parasitic flatworms. Praziquantel is an old drug, and there is a need to identify novel treatments that retain desirable features and improve weaknesses in the mode of PZQ action. One way to do this is to identify new drugs that exploit vulnerabilities in the same drug target but work in slightly differently ways. Here, we have optimized high throughput screening methods to pharmacologically profile a parasitic flatworm ion channel targeted by PZQ. We have identified several new chemical structures that interact with this channel complex. These ligands provide new opportunity for developing tools to manipulate flatworm biology and potentially new trajectories for anthelmintic drug development.
