Evidence to understand the interactions between disease specific programs and the health system is insufficient and largely based on opinion. This study presents a methodology for using tracer indicators to measure the effect of a disease-specific program, the Bangladesh Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program, on its health system. The Composite Coverage Index and incidence of catastrophic health expenditures are well-established tracer indicators for measuring the strength of a health system. In this study, they were calculated, before the program started in 2000 and after it ended in 2015, using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, respectively. Using the Composite Coverage Index to measure the effects of the Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program revealed that it did not negatively or positively affect health service coverage rates. We can also say that there is a positive association between the program interventions and lowered incidence of catastrophic health expenditures.
