Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as Sleeping Sickness, is a parasitic disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, where it is transmitted by blood-sucking Tsetse flies. The disease is caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite called Trypanosoma brucei. HAT case numbers have decreased over the past two decades, and elimination is in sight. However, to meet the WHO objective of sustainable HAT elimination, newer and safer drugs are needed. Acoziborole is a new drug that has proven safe and effective against HAT and, unlike previous drugs, it can be orally administered. Whilst the mode of action of acoziborole was recently identified, less is known regarding the mechanisms by which T. brucei could become resistant to acoziborole. To address this, we generated a drug resistant cell line under laboratory conditions, in order to analyse the differences between resistant and sensitive cells. By sequencing the transcriptome, we observed that many genes associated with mammalian-infective parasites are down-regulated, whilst genes associated with the insect stage are up-regulated. As a result of these differences, the metabolic effects of acoziborole on parasites are nullified. These data suggest that parasite differentiation, albeit on a gene expression level, is potentially a mechanism of drug resistance in T. brucei, although it is doubtful whether this mechanism could occur in the field where mammalian immune effectors would destroy parasites differentiating this way.
