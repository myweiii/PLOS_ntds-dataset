Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by different species of the genus Leishmania. This disease is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, including the Mediterranean basin. In Spain, the only endemic species is L. (L) infantum, although there are cases of imported leishmaniasis due to travel and migration of people from other endemic areas. Cutaneous lesions are the most common clinical form, but L. (L) infantum can also cause mucosal or visceral involvement. Although microscopic diagnosis and skin biopsy specimens are still used in routine diagnosis for cutaneous leishmaniasis, they are time-consuming and invasive, respectively. Currently, molecular techniques, such as real-time PCR, are very sensitive tools for the detection and identification of Leishmania parasites. In addition, the skin swab sample seems to be a non-invasive alternative for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In the present work, we describe the clinical characteristics of 59 patients diagnosed by real-time PCR of cutaneous leishmaniasis, as well as the molecular epidemiology of the causative species. We show that there has been an increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis cases, both autochthonous and imported cases, over the study period. The presence of Leishmania species other than L. (L) infantum is also highlighted.
