Chagas disease (CD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a homoflagellate parasite that belongs to the group of kinetoplastids. This disease is endemic to the Americas, however, the migrations have spread CD to other continents. An estimated that more than 10,000 die each year due to infection by T. cruzi, 8 million people are infected and therefore more than 25 million people are at risk of acquiring the disease. Treatments to CD are not very efficient, mainly in the chronic phase of the disease and cause adverse effects due to the toxicity of drugs currently in use. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new anti-T. cruzi drugs. In this work we evaluate the anti-T. cruzi capacity of a series of compounds derived from 7-chloroquinolines. We study in more detail the mode of action of A6, an aromatic imizoline derivative that showed a potent effect on the intracellular forms of the parasite (IC50(tryps) = 26.7 Â± 3.7 nM) and a high selectivity index (SI = 5,170). A6 could be a promising alternative for the development of a new efficient treatment against T. cruzi.
