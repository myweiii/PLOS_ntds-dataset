Control of mosquitoes via the use of microbes is a promising alternative to synthetic insecticides and a potential solution to tackle the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Recently, a parasitic microbe named Wolbachia has been found to render the mosquito resistant to virus infections and it is currently showing great promise in reducing dengue cases on tests conducted in the field. On the other side of the symbiotic spectrum, we have entomopathogenic fungi, who have evolved to naturally infect and kill insects, and offer a unique potential to control mosquito populations. In this study, we examined the effect that native Wolbachia can have on the mosquito susceptibility to fungal entomopathogens. Our findings show that while Wolbachia does not affect the action of entomopathogenic fungi on mosquitoes, it does influence the expression of important mosquito immune genes, suggesting that Wolbachia has a closer interaction with the mosquito response to microbial infections than previously reported. Furthermore, our study provides new records on the susceptibility of two important mosquito vectors in the USA (Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens), with Cx. pipiens showing significant resistance to the action of one fungal entomopathogen tested. This article informs on the mosquito susceptibility and interaction with other microbes that will aid in the selection of fungal entomopathogens to control mosquitoes, especially those that carry native microbes such as Wolbachia.
