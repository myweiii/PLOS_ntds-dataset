Eastern and South-Eastern Europe is known to be severely affected by parasitic neglected tropical diseases (NTD) due to its tumultuous historical events of the past decades and to its uncontrolled socio-economic fluctuations. Romania is an example of such a South-Eastern European country that was known to have a high parasitic NTD burden after the fall of Communism in 1989 but has since made significant developmental improvements. However, there is scarce data regarding the incidences of parasitic NTD in Romania after its accession to the European Union in 2007. By using the ICD-10 dataset of Romania over the period 2008–2018, we performed a retrospective epidemiologic analysis of three of its most relevant parasitic diseases, ascariasis, enterobiasis and cystic echinococcosis (CE) and confirmed a downward trend strongly correlating with the country’s decreasing poverty rate. By employing a novel technology called automated time series machine learning we predicted the progress of these diseases for the ensuing two years of 2019 and 2020. Forecasted rates were observed to be constant. Such machine learning tools can help public health officials in adapting and improving targeted measures to combat parasitic NTD.
