Leishmaniasis is an insect vector-borne parasitic disease. With >350 million people world wide considered at risk, 12 million people currently infected and an economic cost that can be estimated in terms of >3.3 million working life years lost, leishmaniasis is a major global health challenge. The disease is of particular importance in Brazil. Current treatment of leishmaniasis is difficult requiring a long, costly course of drug treatment using old drugs with poor safety indications requiring close medical supervision. Moreover, resistance to current antileishmanials is growing, emphasising a major need for new drug targets. In earlier work we had identified a naturally inspired chalcone which had promising antileishmanial activity but with no known mode of action. In this work we use an analogue of this molecule as an activity based probe to identify a protein target of the chalcone. This protein, cTXNPx, has a major role in protecting the parasite against attack by reactive oxygen species in the host cell. By inhibiting this protein the parasite can no longer survive in the host. Collectively this work validates cTXNPx as a drug target with the chalcone as a lead structure for future drug discovery programmes.
