The baseline enrolled 505 patients admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital (Guangzhou, Guangdong) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or H1N1. All the patients were tested by both viruses at admission. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared among adults (≥18 years) hospitalized for H1N1 infection (n = 220), SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 249) and co-infection with both viruses (n = 36). The prevalence rate of H1N1 co-infection was 12.6% (36/285) among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Co-infection affected a predominantly older age group and was associated with poorer clinical outcome. We also described the viral load trajectory in patients with diverse types of infection. Lower initial Ct values (higher viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs) of co-infected patients was found to be associated with a higher number of adverse events and clinical symptoms. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and a simultaneous epidemic of seasonal influenza, the data in China may critically inform future therapeutic or prophylactic strategies, especially for other developing countries.
