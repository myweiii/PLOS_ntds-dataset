Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) cause significant morbidity among children in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We followed a birth cohort to 8 years of age in a rural area of coastal Ecuador and showed almost half acquired STH infections during childhood. The dominant STH parasites in this setting in children were Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and infections peaked in frequency between 3 and 5 years of age. Risk of infection during childhood was associated with markers of marginalisation (Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicity and low educational level), household poverty (overcrowding and poor sanitation), and STH infections among other household members. There was evidence of a reduction in STH infection risk across all ages in study households over the calendar time course of this longitudinal study in parallel with improvements in living conditions, a period of economic growth, and increased government support for those living in extreme poverty. Our data indicate that targeting anthelmintic treatment at members of STH-infected households is likely to reduce the risk of infection in young children.
