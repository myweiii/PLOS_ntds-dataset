Trichinella spiralis is the most important pathogen causing trichinellosis of animals and humans. Reports in mammal animals showed that gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) play key roles in processing and presentation of MHC class II restricted antigens. However, there were no reports about GILT in nematode T. spiralis. In this study, GILT gene from T. spiralis (Tsp-GILT) was cloned and analyzed. The predicted 3D structure of Ts-GILT protein was found similar with that of Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa. To further evaluate the roles of Tsp-GILT in T. spiralis development, a soaking method was used to knockdown the expression of Tsp-GILT gene by siRNA. It was found that NBLs soaked with siRNA showed 32.3% reduction in the generation of MLs, and MLs soaked with siRNA showed 26.2% reduction in the next generation of MLs. Current study concluded that siRNA knockdown of gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase from Trichinella spiralis significantly reduce the larval infectivity, development and survival.
