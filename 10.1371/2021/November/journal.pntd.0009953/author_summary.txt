We analyzed records of patients presenting during a diarrhea epidemic in 2018 to the worldâ€™s largest diarrhea treatment hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Patients presenting during the epidemic and the non-epidemic periods were compared at multiple levels. We found that Vibrio cholerae played a crucial role in the diarrhea epidemic. Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and rotavirus had a secondary role. Adolescents and adults, residents of the Dhaka metropolitan area, and those who were relatively poor and lacked safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices were more vulnerable to the epidemic. Patients had increased disease severity during the epidemic, but the death rate was extremely low in the hospital. icddr,b Dhaka Hospital saved several thousand lives by taking care of diarrhea patients during the epidemic.
