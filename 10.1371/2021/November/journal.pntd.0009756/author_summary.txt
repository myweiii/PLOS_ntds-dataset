Dengue fever is a systemic viral infection of epidemic proportions in tropical countries. The incidence of dengue fever is ever increasing and has doubled over the last few decades. Estimated 50 million new cases are detected each year and close to 10000 deaths occur each year. Epidemics are unpredictable and unprecedented. When epidemics occur, health services are over whelmed leading to overcrowding of hospitals. At present there is no evidence that dengue epidemics can be predicted. We developed a mathematical model using machine learning technique to predict dengue epidemics. We used Island wide dengue epidemiology data, weather data and population density in developing the model. We found that the model is able to predict the incidence of dengue fever of a given month in a given district with precision. Further, using weather data of a given month, the number of cases of dengue in succeeding months too can be predicted with precision. Health authorities can use existing weather data in predicting epidemics in the immediate future and therefore measures to prevent new cases can be taken and more importantly the authorities can prepare local authorities for outbreaks.
