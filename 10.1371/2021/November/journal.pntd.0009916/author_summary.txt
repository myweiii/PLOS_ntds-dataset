Chikungunya fever is a debilitating disease caused by the mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus. Over the past two decades the geographical spread of the virus and its mosquito vector has drastically increased thereby causing millions of infections. To date there is no antiviral drug and no vaccine available to treat/prevent Chikungunya virus infection. We recently showed that the natural steroidal alkaloid tomatidine has potent antiviral activity towards Chikungunya virus at submicromolar concentrations. In this study we dissected how tomatidine reduces the production of Chikungunya virus particles. We show that tomatidine lowers viral protein expression and we hypothesize that the effect of tomatidine on viral protein translation hampers the production of progeny viral RNA copies / number of infected cells thereby leading to a reduced production of secreted virus particles. Also, we show that Chikungunya virus does not readily become resistant to tomatidine. Collectively, we deciphered the mechanism by which tomatidine exerts antiviral activity to Chikungunya virus and our results strengthen the potential of tomatidine as an antiviral treatment strategy towards Chikungunya virus.
