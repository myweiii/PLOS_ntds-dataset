Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus and infects humans after a sandfly bite. Outbreaks are rare and hard to investigate in isolated tropical areas. In this study, the authors explored the different possible origins of an outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers training in the rainforest of French Guiana. The outbreak occurred in March 2020. Concerning the symptoms, several patients presented resistant infections and multiple lines of treatment, raising the issue of resistant Leishmania strains. The different strains isolated during the outbreak were not genetically closed, as far as routine PCR techniques would indicate. The authors looked for individual behaviours exposing soldiers to sandfly bites but none was significantly associated with infection. The authors found two spots in the military training areas where illegal logging probably increased the density of sandflies and put service members at risk. The 13th week of 2020 was associated to a higher risk of infection due to climatic conditions. This study shows how interactions between humans and the rainforest can increase the risk of parasitic outbreaks.
