Todayâ€™s diagnosis of infection with the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus mainly depends on the microscopic analysis of skin biopsies and serological testing. The work presented here describes the use of multiple mass spectrometry-based screening methods (metabolomics and lipidomics) to search for biomarkers indicative of infection with Onchocerca volvulus. This resulted in the identification of elevated concentrations of the plasma metabolites inosine and hypoxanthine as biomarkers for filarial infection, and of the urine metabolite cis-cinnamoylglycine as biomarker for O. volvulus. Further evaluation of these biomarkers in a geographically distinct non-endemic population however invalidated the use of urine cis-cinnamoylglycine. These findings are of utmost importance as it not only opens new avenues in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for filarial infections, but also emphasizes the need for evaluation and validation of newly discovered biomarkers in different populations from different geographies.
