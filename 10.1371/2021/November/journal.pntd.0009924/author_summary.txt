Leprosy is the oldest infectious disease known to humankind. We still do not succeed in curbing its transmission, with more than 200,000 new patients detected worldwide each year. Identifying persons with a high burden of bacteria is key to curb transmission. To identify these persons, bacteria are counted in invasive and painful samples like slit skin smears and skin biopsies. We evaluated whether we can use less invasive samples, like fingerstick blood or nasal swabs, to determine the bacterial load. We found that the level of antibodies against M. leprae (Î±PGL-I IgM) in fingerstick blood correlates well with the bacterial load determined in skin biopsies from the same leprosy patient. Therefore, a high level of antibodies against M. leprae in fingerstick blood might identify persons who pose a potential risk for transmission of leprosy and could be prioritized for contact screening, which is essential for control of the disease.
