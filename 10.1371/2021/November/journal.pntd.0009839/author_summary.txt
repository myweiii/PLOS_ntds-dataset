Dengue and Zika are neglected diseases caused by viruses transmitted to humans by mosquitoes (vector-borne diseases). The primary vector of both diseases is Aedes aegypti, a highly abundant mosquito in tropical countries and adapted to the urban habitat. The viral cycle in the vector starts when the mosquito bites an infected person and acquires the viruses through the blood meal. When the infected blood reaches the mosquitoâ€™s midgut, the viruses invade the epithelial cells and disseminate in several organs until they reach the salivary glands, enabling viral transmission to the next person. However, the mosquitoes have developed strategies to combat the viral invasion and dissemination in their body, making this journey a challenge to the viruses. Herein, we show that the mosquito responses against dengue and Zika viruses are distinct. In addition, mosquitoes from separate populations of the same city have different abilities to deal with the viruses in both cases, dengue and Zika infections. Our results show the diversity of responses that the mosquitoes may present to viral infections. These findings may better direct disease control strategies to combat dengue and Zika outbreaks in endemic regions.
