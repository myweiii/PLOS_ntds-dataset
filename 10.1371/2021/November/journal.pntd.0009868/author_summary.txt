In the Americas, the range and genetic diversity of tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes remains poorly defined. Borrelia turicatae is the predominant species in the southwestern and eastern portions of the United States and Latin America, and recent studies suggests the pathogens and their vectors have established endemic foci in highly populated areas of the United States. Given the rate of urban growth and the incorporation of green spaces into large cities, this study supports previous work suggesting the expansion of B. turicatae.
