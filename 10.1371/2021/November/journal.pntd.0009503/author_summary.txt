Schistosoma mansoni is the major parasitic platyhelminth species causing intestinal schistosomiasis. Currently one drug, praziquantel, is the treatment of choice but its use in mass treatment programs means that the development of resistance is likely and renders imperative the development of new therapeutic agents. As new potential targets we have focused on lysine deacetylases, and in particular S. mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8). Previous studies showed that reduction in the level of transcripts of SmHDAC8 by RNAi led to the impaired survival of the worms after the infection of mice. The analysis of the 3D structure of SmHDAC8 by X-ray crystallography showed that the catalytic domain structure diverges significantly from that of human HDAC8 and this was exploited to develop novel potential anti-schistosomal drugs. The biological roles of SmHDAC8 are unknown. For this reason, we previously characterized its protein binding partners and identified the schistosome orthologue of the human RhoA GTPase, suggesting the involvement of SmHDAC8 in the modulation of cytoskeleton organization. Here we investigated the interaction between SmHDAC8 and SmRho1 and identified two SmRho1 isoforms (SmRho1.1 and SmRho1.2). Our study showed that SmHDAC8 is involved in schistosome cytoskeleton organization.
