More than half a century after the discovery of a new, potentially zoonotic virus transmitted by ticks, the prevalence of Dugbe virus in cattle and its tick vector was investigated in Nigeria. The survey took place in Kwara State on the border with the Republic of Benin over a period of one year. More than 1,000 cattle were examined across the state and nearly 12,000 ticks were collected and identified under the microscope. Using established diagnostic protocols for molecular detection of Dugbe virus by quantitative PCR, we found no virus in the cattle population, but about 0.7% (n = 34) of the ticks were carriers of the virus. The overwhelming majority of ticks collected from cattle belonged to only two species: Amblyomma variegatum (tropical cattle tick) and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Asian blue-footed tick). In addition, most Dugbe virus infections were found in A. variegatum, and only two R. (B.) microplus were also infected. Although there is no clear evidence that A. variegatum is the main vector of Dugbe virus, our whole virus genome data showed a remarkably high similarity with Dugbe virus first isolated in Nigeria in 1964 in the same tick species.
