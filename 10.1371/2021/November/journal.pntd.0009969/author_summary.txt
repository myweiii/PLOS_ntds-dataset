Cholera, a disease caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, remains a major cause of diarrheal illness and death, particularly in settings with poor sanitation and hygiene. We developed a synthetic chemical, named “iOWH032,” as a potential treatment for cholera, which is administered as oral tablets. The chemical acts by blocking secretions from cells in the intestine, and thereby was expected to prevent fluid loss and dehydration caused by cholera illness. We tested iOWH032 in a clinical study using a cholera human challenge model. Study volunteers were intentionally infected with V. cholerae in an inpatient clinic setting to better study the effects of iOWH032 on infected individuals. This challenge model had been used previously to test cholera vaccine candidates, but this study represents the first test of a potential cholera treatment using the model. We found that treatment of individuals with iOWH032 was safe, but did not result in a significant reduction of cholera illness, based on several different measurements of diarrheal symptoms and severity. This study demonstrates how human challenge models incorporating a relatively small number of subjects can help support decision-making about potential new therapeutics and other interventions for infectious diseases.
