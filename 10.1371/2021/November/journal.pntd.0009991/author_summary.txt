Soil-transmitted parasitic worms infect over a billion humans worldwide. In recent years, there has been increasing resistance to existing drugs that are used to treat parasitic infections and this has accelerated the need to develop new classes of drugs. Parasitic worms survive in the low oxygen environment of the host gut, using a special electron carrier, rhodoquinone. Since rhodoquinone is not used or made in humans, enzymes that use or make rhodoquinone are good targets for the development of new drugs. Here, we first identify genes that are important for parasites to carry out these rhodoquinone-dependent processes. Since many of these genes are also present in the human genome and we only want to target the parasite version, we then looked for sequence differences in these genes between parasites and humans to identify enzymes with parasite-specific active sites. These sequence differences may allow for drugs which bind only to the parasite-version of the enzymes. From this, we have identified 4 high-confidence targets that can be used to guide the design of new anti-parasitic drugs.
