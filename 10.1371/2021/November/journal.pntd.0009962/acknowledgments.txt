We would like to thank all the personnel who supported implementation of these surveys. This includes the community and school respondents, data collectors, village guides, technical and logistical support staff, and Cade Howard. Special thanks to the Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda government ministries, and water and sanitation organizations who supported the F&E work: AMREF, Circle for Integrated Community Development (CICOD), Concern International, Heart to Heart, Helene Keller International, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, Matama, Simavi, Water Aid, Water Mission, and World Vision. We would also like to dedicate this article to the late Ruth Tushemereirwe who helped make the surveys in Uganda possible and worked tirelessly towards trachoma elimination in Uganda.
