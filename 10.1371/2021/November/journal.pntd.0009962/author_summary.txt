Trachoma control programs promote facial cleanliness, use of latrines, and emphasizes the importance of access to water as means to reduce trachoma transmission. To address these areas, various country ministries and supporting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) support the implementation of tailored behavior change programs. The process and results of evaluating these types of programs in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda are described here. The goal of this manuscript is to provide trachoma program managers and supporting NGOs with insights, recommendations, and data collection tools that could be used to support their efforts to conduct monitoring and evaluation of their current or future trachoma prevention activities.
