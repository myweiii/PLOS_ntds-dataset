Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), is a potentially disabling infectious disease. After achieving the national elimination target, the focus of leprosy care is now shifting from implementing multidrug therapy (MDT) to accelerating the reduction in disease burden, especially stopping leprosy and its complications, with targets for 2020 of 0 new child cases with Grade 2 disability (G2D) and <1 per million population new leprosy cases with G2D. We assessed physical disabilities and deformities of newly detected leprosy patients in Yunnan, an endemic area of leprosy disease in China, from 1990â€“2019 and the clinical and demographic factors associated with physical disabilities and deformities. We found that delayed diagnosis, nerve damage, WHO and Ridley-Jopling classifications, lack of skin lesions, leprosy reactions, advanced age, rural occupation, Han ethnicity, and male sex were risk factors for physical disabilities in patients with leprosy disease. The findings are important because physical disability is the main sequelae of leprosy disease that leads to stigma, discrimination, and socioeconomic burden. Understanding the related risk factors would be helpful for preventing the physical disability associated with leprosy disease.
