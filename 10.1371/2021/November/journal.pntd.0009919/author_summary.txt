Chagas disease currently affects about six to seven million people worldwide, resulting in high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden in endemic countries of Latin America. Its etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, circulates among a wide variety of mammalian and insect vectors. Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis is adapted to the dry and warm climate of the Caatinga biome, and is considered the main vector in the semi-arid areas of northeastern Brazil. Information on the infestation, natural infection rates, T. cruzi strains, and blood meals sources of this vector is crucial for understanding the dynamics of T. cruzi transmission in areas susceptible to desertification. Triatoma b. brasiliensis colonizes peridomestic structures, particularly in the stone walls of cattle corrals that emerge as a refuge for sylvatic populations where they access a variety of blood meals sources. The predominance of the TcI strain in the sylvatic and peridomestic environments shows an overlap of transmission cycles by T. cruzi mediated by T. b. brasiliensis. The high rates of natural infection and the evidence of their feeding on humans and the rodent K. rupestris are worrisome and indicate the threat this vector poses to human health in the area studied.
