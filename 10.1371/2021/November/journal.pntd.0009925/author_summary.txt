HTLV viruses are responsible for more than 10 million cases of infection worldwide. The infection is considered as a neglected disease due to lack of vaccines and treatments. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for counselling infected persons and prevention of secondary transmissions. In spite of the development of excellent serological screening assays, many cases of indeterminate and untyped results are still regularly reported and their infection status remain uncertain. To address the need of more precise diagnosis, we have developed a new cutting-edge in-vitro diagnostic confirmation test, named Multi-HTLV, which has been validated on a large panel of HTLV samples. The test is a multiplex immunoassay allowing powerful detection of antibodies against HTLV through combination of a set of selective and validated virus-specific antigens in a blood sample. The Multi-HTLV assay increases the reliability of HTLV diagnostics and strain typing thanks to a high precision mathematical algorithm.
