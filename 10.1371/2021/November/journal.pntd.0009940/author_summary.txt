The infection by the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (HTLV-1) is quite frequent in Brazil. Between 1â€“5% of infected individuals develop a devastating neurodegenerative disease (HAM/TSP) as a result of a sustained inflammation in the central nervous system, with no effective treatment. So far, inflammation has been linked to the deregulated activation of T-cells, but the role of innate cells has not been investigated yet. In this work, we aimed to characterize the responsiveness of innate cells, as this immune population is cornerstone of efficient immune response, but also might participate in disease exacerbation found in chronic infection. Our findings suggest an impaired antiviral response and increased inflammatory responsiveness by dendritic cells and monocytes in HAM/TSP patients compared to asymptomatic carriers. This sustained inflammatory responsiveness upon innate cell activation could participate in the establishment of the HAM/TSP disease.
