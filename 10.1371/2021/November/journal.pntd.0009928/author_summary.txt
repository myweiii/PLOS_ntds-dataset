Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Programs targeting trachoma elimination in endemic regions largely rely on periodic prevalence surveys to monitor progress, but training field graders requires active cases, which is becoming challenging as prevalence declines. Photography of the tarsal conjunctiva with remote interpretation via telemedicine may serve as a more auditable, effective, and cost-efficient method for surveys. We developed and evaluated the Image Capture and Processing System (ICAPS), a smartphone-based, hands-free, head-mounted camera system (Samsung Galaxy S8 with custom app, Samsung Gear VR headset, and a Bluetooth-linked foot pedal trigger). The ICAPS was easy to use in challenging field conditions, was able to upload images from Tanzania and link images to field data. The percentage of TF was 5% by both field grade and photo grade, with agreement kappa = 0.53. Additional field training and enhanced certification of photographers may help reduce the proportion of ungradable images; further research on reasons for mismatch of grades between field and photo is needed.
