Mycobacterium leprae and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cause infectious diseases that have a major impact on public health worldwide. Both are worrisome diseases, with some knowledge gaps not yet fully clarified, regarding their pathogen biology and clinical evolution, especially when patients are infected with them at the same time. FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3) is a transcription factor present in certain regulatory (CD4+ CD25+) Treg cells, which regulates the immune response of the host during intracellular infections, such as tuberculosis and leishmaniasis. This study aimed to elucidate a few of these gaps by exploring the role of FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) on the immune response during leprosy co-infection with HIV, by comparing the response of patients with leprosy based on whether or not they present a HIV and leprosy reaction. The results showed a positive correlation between FoxP3 + cell density and viral load; negative correlation in relation to blood CD4 +. These findings support the conclusion that a higher activity of HIV may stimulate or result in a higher expression of FOXP3-Tregs. However there is a clear need to expand studies on TregFoxP3 + cells in co-infected patients to further elucidate its role in the pathophysiology of these diseases.
