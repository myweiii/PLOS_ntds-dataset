The plague still poses a significant threat to human health, such as in Madagascar, which experienced a large pneumonic plague outbreak in 2017. The pneumonic plague always arouses great concern for its pathogenicity and propagation, especially in densely populated cities. In November 2019, one couple in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region suffered pneumonic plague and was transferred to Beijing. Subsequently, another two bubonic plague cases were identified in Inner Mongolia. Genome-wide SNP analysis, together with two PCR-based molecular subtying methods, was used for source-tracking purposes. Corresponding results indicated that human plague cases originated from local rodent plague epizootics. Because there were no obvious geographic barriers between the plague foci area in Inner Mongolia and its counterpart area in Mongolia, early warning and risk communication is necessary.
