Leptospirosis is an important bacterial zoonosis with a worldwide distribution. Each year there are an estimated one million cases, with about 60,000 deaths. The true burden of the disease, however, is unknown. The burden of leptospirosis is probably underestimated due to the lack of specific clinical symptoms and diagnostic techniques that are not readily available. Clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis is difficult because of the diversity of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe multivisceral icteric states. Differential diagnoses with infections presenting with fever or fever and jaundice are numerous and may mislead the clinician. Leptospirosis is considered endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and is known to cause fever with jaundice in African countries; however, for most countries, available epidemiologic data are scarce, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). An improved understanding of the epidemiology of leptospirosis will improve clinical management, lead to policy formulation, and have implications for national surveillance of infectious diseases in these countries. We conducted a retrospective seroepidemiological study to extend the description of the pathogens responsible for fever with jaundice in the DRC and to clarify the circulation of possible leptospirosis in the country. This study showed that leptospirosis is a likely cause of fever with jaundice in the DRC.
