In the absence of professional animal healthcare workers in hard-to-reach settings, lay persons, with limited, non-formal training, have been used to provide animal healthcare services, including vaccination. In spite of the perceived crucial roles lay persons play in the animal health sector, their services are largely unrecognized within official animal healthcare systems. We compiled evidence on how lay persons have been used in animal vaccination programmes and make recommendations regarding how they can be used in more effective ways. We found they were used by both government and non-government institutions to vaccinate different domestic animals and provide regular animal healthcare services. They were mainly used where professional animal healthcare workers are not available or are limited in number. The programmes were more successful where they had the support of the public and institutions, and their outcomes were largely similar to those delivered by professionals. We also found that community participation was an important facilitating factor, whilst the main challenges they faced were opposition from professional veterinarians, financial interests of stakeholders and planning issues. We concluded that lay animal vaccinator programmes could be more beneficial if better regulated.
