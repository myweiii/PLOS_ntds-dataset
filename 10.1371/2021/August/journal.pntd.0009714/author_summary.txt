Pulmonary fibrosis is the main sequel of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a fungal disease that affects mainly men, rural workers. The development of pulmonary fibrosis is complex and involves several mechanisms that culminate in aberrant collagen production and deposition in the lungs making it became stiff and blocking the air passages. These changes lead to difficulty in breathing and in PCM patients dyspnea in response to high or low levels of exertion is common. Therefore, these patients show incapacity to work and the decreased quality of life. With the possibility of identifying some marker, for example, it could help the indication of respiratory physiotherapy, professional rehabilitation, or therapeutic intervention. This is the first study to examine the pulmonary sequelae (PS) in patients with paracoccidioidomycosis using an approach combining proteomics with bioinformatics. Here, we identify the specific proteome pattern found in PCM patients with severe sequelae that distinguishes these patients from that with mild/moderate sequelae. Our results showed that time points immediately before treatment and at clinical cure are key moments at which PS can progress to severe PS due a dysregulation in wound healing with consequent delayed in the healing processes resulting in an aberrant scar. As such, we suggest that the prognoses for severe PS should be considered as soon as possible and as early as diagnosis of PCM. Furthermore, we used proteomics to identify possible serum biomarkers with which to predict the likely development of severe PS, to be validated in future studies.
