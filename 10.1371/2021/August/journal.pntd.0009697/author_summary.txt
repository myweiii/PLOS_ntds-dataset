Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by triatomine insects, first identified in 1909. Chagas disease affects approximately 6–7 million people globally and is highly prevalent in Latin America where most cases are reported. However, there is increasing evidence that Chagas disease is now an important public health issue outside the “classical” endemic countries due to population migration. Our understanding of Chagas disease, including its pathologies and factors relating to progression, remains to date limited, and is also challenged by lack of diagnosis and highly effective treatment. This systematic review aims to describe studies with Chagas patients receiving antiparasitic treatment. Databases were searched for relevant studies published after 1997, and the results of these searches were screened.
Although a large volume of studies was identified in the review, heterogeneity was observed in study design, diagnostic methods, outcome assessment, and treatment regimens. While this aspect will be a limitation in pooling individual patient data, the volume of data available should allow sufficient comparison to form the basis of guidelines for future studies. The results of this review demonstrate that development of a Chagas disease data platform for clinical research would enable optimisation of existing data to strengthen evidence for the treatment and diagnosis of Chagas disease.
