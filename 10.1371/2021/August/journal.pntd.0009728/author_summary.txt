The transmission cycle of dengue virus involves a complex interaction of the virus with the mosquito vector and the human host. DENV enters the mosquito through an infectious blood meal. The virus first infects and replicates in the mosquito midgut before it is translocated to the hemolymph and ultimately reaches the salivary gland. The virus is then released to the saliva and transmitted to the human host through a mosquito blood meal. Previous studies showed that mosquito saliva, salivary gland proteins or mosquito bite modulates arbovirus infection in the mammalian host. Here, we investigate the interplay between the mosquito vector and DENV and address whether the virus is altered in the mosquito vector that consequentially influences disease manifestations in the mammalian host. By excluding the effect of saliva, we demonstrated that after infecting Aedes aegypti, DENV2 acquired the potential to induce more severe hemorrhage in Stat1-/- mice. Msq-DENV2 exhibited smaller particle size, larger plaque size and more rapid growth rate, and was also more efficient in inducing macrophage Tnf production compared to culture-DENV2. Taken together, our data support the notion that mosquito A. aegypti alters DENV2 by changing its growth characteristics as well as its potential to cause disease.
