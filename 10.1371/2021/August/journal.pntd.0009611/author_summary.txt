Chromoblastomycosis (CBM), represents one of the primary implantation mycoses caused by melanized fungi widely found in nature. It is characterized as a Neglected Tropical Disease and mainly affect populations living in poverty with significant morbidity, including stigma and discrimination. The global incidence of CBM remains unclear because this mycosis is not a mandatory notifiable disease and most of the literature consists of case reports or small series incompletely characterized. Although several authors suggest that the CBM global burden may be comparable to mycetoma, its geographic distribution and incidence rates in different endemic areas have never been widely characterized in the medical literature. We retrospectively conducted a comprehensive systematic review of all medical literature published between 1914 and 2020 to better characterize the prevalence rates, geographic distribution, and clinical aspects of CBM in all continents. All reviewed data were not a substitute for high quality epidemiological study or comprehensive surveillance but do provide an approximation of the burden by country. Information generated corroborate the WHO recognition of CBM as a NTD and provides helpful support for all local governments interested in developing specific policies and actions for preventing, diagnosing and assisting patients with CBM.
