Visceral leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases caused by the parasite of the genus leishmania. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a 17-day combined regimen of sodium stibogluconate 20mg/kg /day with daily upper maximum dose limit of 850mg and paromomycin 15mg/kg/day injections in HIV negative visceral leishmaniasis patients. We also identified factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in HIV negative VL patients treated with SSG/PM. Seventy two percent of the study participants developed at least one AE during the initial treatment course but most AEs were reversible. The overall initial efficacy was 92.2% which is comparable with previous study results in East Africa. Among patients who completed six-month follow-up, the efficacy was 93.9%, which appears to be biased due to the small proportion of patients (29%) evaluated at 6-month follow-up. The results affirm that the combination of sodium stibogluconate (20mg/kg b.wt) and paromomycin (15mg/kg b.wt) given for 17 days is still effective in Eastern Africa VL endemic countries. This data applies to VL patients who are HIV negative and not presenting with severe signs/symptoms.
