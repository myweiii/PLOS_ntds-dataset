    "Background": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most neglected tropical infectious diseases. It is fatal if left untreated. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 17-day injections of combined regimen of sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin (SSG/PM) in HIV-negative VL patients.",
    "Methods": "A retrospective analysis of medical records of VL patients treated in the University of Gondar Hospital during period 2012\u20132019 was carried out.",
    "Results": "A total of 2836 patients were treated for VL from 2012 to 2019. Of these 1233 were treated with SSG-PM, and 1000 of them were included in the study. Initial cure was achieved in 922 (92.2%) patients. The frequency of treatment failure, treatment interruptions, default and deaths respectively were 30 (3%), 20 (2%), 13 (1.3%) and 15 (1.5%). Among 280 patients who completed 6-month follow up, the final cure was 93.9% (263/280), 4 (1.4%) relapsed and 13 (4.6%) developed post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The most common adverse events (AEs) were raised liver transaminases (35.1%; 351 patients), injection site pain (29.1%, 291 patients) and raised serum alpha-amylase (29.1%, 291 patients). Factors associated with poor treatment outcomes were sepsis, pneumonia, and adverse events.",
    "Conclusion": "A combination of SSG at 20mg/kg with upper daily maximum dose of 850mg and PM was effective for achieving initial cure at end of treatment and safe for treatment of HIV negative VL patients in northwestern Ethiopia. Our data are consistent with previous reports and confirms effectiveness of SSG/PM treatment regimen in the Eastern African countries. Efficacy at 6-months (93.9%) was estimated on data derived from patients who completed follow up and needs to be interrogated by future studies."
