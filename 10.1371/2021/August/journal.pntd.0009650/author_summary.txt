Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease with an estimated incidence of 50,000 to 90,000 cases in 2019. Women who are susceptible to becoming pregnant or those who are pregnant and lactating are regularly excluded from clinical studies of VL. A specific concern of public health relevance is the little knowledge of the consequences of VL and its treatment on the mother and the foetus. We did a systematic review of all published literature with an overarching aim of identifying cases of VL in pregnancy and assessing the risk-benefit balance of antileishmanial treatment to the pregnant women and the child. We identified a total of 72 records (1926–2020) describing 451 VL cases in pregnant women. In 398, infection was identified during pregnancy of whom 202 received Liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB) and 93 received pentavalent antimony (PA). In studies that reported maternal outcomes, reports of maternal death abortion/spontaneous abortion, and miscarriages were proportionally lower among those who received L-AmB compared to PA (no formal test of significance carried out). A total of 26 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of vertical transmission were identified and the median time to detection was 6 months (range: 0–18 months). Our review brings together scattered observations of VL in pregnant women in the clinical literature and clearly highlights that the disease in pregnancy is under-reported and under-studied. The collated evidence derived mainly from case reports and case series indicate that L-AmB has a favourable safety profile than the antimony regimen and should be the preferred treatment for VL during pregnancy.
