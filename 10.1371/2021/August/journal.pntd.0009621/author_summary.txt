Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. The primary and secondary stages of syphilis are the most transmissive stages in the entire process of the disease. We analyzed primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis data from 2005 to 2017 in Guangzhou, China, provided by the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System. The results showed that the annual incidence rates of P&S syphilis slightly increased from 2005 to 2011 and then began to decrease in 2017. Cases of P&S syphilis were spatially clustered. The high-risk syphilis clusters tended to shift from developed areas to underdeveloped areas. There may be an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of economic development and the incidence of P&S syphilis, suggesting that the incidence of P&S syphilis first increased before decreasing as the level of economic development increased further. These results emphasize the necessity of preventing syphilis at locations in the early stage of economic growth. Investments in syphilis prevention education for people in regions at early development stages may mitigate the increasing cost of syphilis to future healthcare systems.
