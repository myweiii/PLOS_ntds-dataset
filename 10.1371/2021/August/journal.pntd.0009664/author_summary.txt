Up to now, dengue vaccination has not yet been included into the national immunization program in Indonesia. An age-structured decision tree model was developed in this study to assess the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of dengue vaccination in Indonesia in 2020â€“2024, which was based on country specific data. The result confirmed that vaccination and pre-vaccination screening programs would be cost-effective to be implemented in Indonesia. Nevertheless, it seems unaffordable to be implemented since the total required cost for the nationwide vaccination would be 94.44% of routine immunization budget.
