Visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) is a neglected tropical disease that occurs in widely dispersed areas of the world, including Ethiopia. Parasites in the Leishmania donovani complex are responsible for causing visceral leishmaniasis. The condition is difficult to diagnose and treat. We investigated how the immune response generated during follow-up treatment periods of active VL before, during, and post-treatment was influenced by the presence of different cytokines. It is important to identify possible immunological biomarkers that could be correlated with patientsâ€™ clinical and parasitological presentation as well as the response patterns to treatment in VL patients of southwestern Ethiopia.
