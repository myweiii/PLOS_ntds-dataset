Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by specific species of Leishmania parasites that affect internal organs including spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The infective stage called promastigote, is transmitted into the host skin via sandfly bites. Visceral leishmaniasis is usually associated with high mortality rate in poor and developing countries, lacking proper health assistance. Moreover, treatments are expensive while no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection and avoid disease outbreaks. This study suggests an affordable and adjuvant-free vaccine formulation made from the total lysate of promastigotes. Vaccine administration via the intranasal route, ensures a remarkable clearance of Leishmania parasites from the internal organs of infected experimental mice. In particular, intranasal route known to be not invasive, is efficient in inducing adequate immune response against the infective form of the parasite. Further studies are now required to improve this prophylactic vaccine and provide therefore the basis for a promising translational approach.
