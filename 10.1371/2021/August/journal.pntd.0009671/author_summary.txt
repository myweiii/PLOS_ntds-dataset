Hematophagous flies such as Tabanids and Stomoxys, and other biting flies, are mechanical transmitters of various pathogens such as African trypanosomes and Anaplasma species. However, little is known about the role of common camel-specific biting keds (also known as camel flies or louse flies, genus Hippobosca) in pathogen transmission. Keds inflict painful bites to access host blood, and in the process may transmit bacterial hemopathogens. We demonstrated using amplicon sequencing that camel keds can transmit ‘Candidatus Anaplasma camelii’ from naturally-infected camels to healthy mice and rabbits via blood feeding. The high prevalence of camel anaplasmosis throughout the year in northern Kenya could be attributed to keds, which infest camels all year round. Unlike ticks, keds can fly from one host to another and thus promote disease transmission among and between camel herds. Although our study focused on the transmission of Anaplasma sp. by camel keds, these flies could possibly also transmit other hemopathogens through a similar mechanism. Notably, in the absence of their preferred hosts, keds occasionally bite humans and other vertebrates they come across in search of bloodmeals, and in the process could transmit zoonotic pathogens.
