We investigated the association between different Ct genovars, the approximate load of infection, and the distribution of Chlamydia genovars by comparing samples from one trachoma-endemic area (i.e., the city of El-Gadaref in Al Qadarif, Sudan) and one previously endemic area (i.e., the Zagora Province in Morocco), currently considered as non-endemic. This study is the first to reveal a significant difference between the genome copy numbers of Ct genovar A and B/Ba in children with TF. Evidence that Ct is still circulating in rural foci of countries like Morocco that are no longer considered endemic implies that the continuation of the trachoma surveillance must be warranted in future to avoid further spreading of Ct. The clinical significance of different infectious loads in the development of sequelae has to be determined as well as whether these differences are genovar specific or related to the given endemicity level.
