    "Objectives": "Trichinella spiralis is a zoonotic parasite with a complex parasitic life cycle and exposed to animals or humans by infectious meat. To control transmissions of T. spiralis through the food chain to humans, sensitive and selective multihost sera-diagnosis is urgent needed for monitoring T. spiralis exposure.",
    "Methods": "A competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for T. spiralis infection diagnosis in multihost sera was developed based on recombinant cystatin-like protein (rCLP-cELISA) as well as monoclonal antibodies. The sensitivity and accuracy of the rCLP-cELISA were quantified using swine (n = 1316), mice (n = 189) and human (n = 157) serum samples. T. spiralis-antibody targeting test ability of the rCLP-cELISA in swine (n = 22) and human (n = 36), instead of other parasites or viruses antibodies, was evaluated.",
    "Results": "The rCLP-cELISA showed high agreement with commercial ELISA kits in field swine sera assessed by Cohen\u2019s kappa value (\u03ba = 0.7963). And it showed 100% specificity in human trichinellosis detection with sensitivity of 96.49%, no cross-reaction with other parasite or virus infections, and high positive detection rate of 87.5% in low-dose infected swine. Besides, the rCLP-cELISA exhibited potential in the detection of T. spiralis, T. nelsoni and Trichinella T8 infections.",
    "Conclusions": "The rCLP-cELISA can be used for T. spiralis-associated antibody test in multihost sera."
