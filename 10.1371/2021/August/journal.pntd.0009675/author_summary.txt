Guinea worm disease has no pharmacological treatment or vaccines, and therefore existing prevention and control strategies (e.g., case containment, health education, chemical treatment of water bodies) are critically dependent on timely, accurate, and actionable data. We conducted informant interviews, used conceptual frameworks, and mapped data flow to evaluate the Chad Guinea Worm Eradication Programâ€™s current information system. We identified areas for improvement including the need to consolidate variables across data collection forms and the need to develop streamlined workflows. We proposed a four-phased roadmap for transitioning to an electronic data capture system and centralizing data storage. Our approach and proposed roadmap could be adopted by other neglected tropical disease control programs looking to modernize data collection and storage procedures.
