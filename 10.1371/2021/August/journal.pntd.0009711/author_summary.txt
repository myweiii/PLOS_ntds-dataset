Snakebite envenoming (SBE) is currently one of the life-threatening neglected diseases especially in developing countries. The fight against this menace requires multidisciplinary approach. Owing to significant number of deaths and disabilities recorded per year in West African savanna region, we developed a new mathematical model for SBE in order to gain more insights into the dynamics and control of SBE. It is clear that communities in northeast Nigeria do not have adequate health information on self-protection against SBE and the antivenom is almost scarce and unaffordable. Thus, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness and potential impact of both public health awareness campaign and treatment for SBE as interventional strategies against snakebite. We discovered that public health awareness is crucial in averting SBE, deaths and disabilities. Also, if at least 50% of SBE victims received treatment within 24 hours of bite, a significant number of deaths and disabilities will be prevented. Furthermore, the study revealed that the combination of public health awareness and treatment decreases the burden of the disease in terms of deaths and disability adjusted life years at a lesser cost as compared with implementing one of these interventions separately. These results can be used as a guide for planning SBE control policy in northeast Nigeria and beyond.
