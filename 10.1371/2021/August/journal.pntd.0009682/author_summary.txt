Leishmaniasis is a debilitating disease of the tropics, subtropics and southern Europe caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, that are transmitted by blood feeding sand flies. The parasites multiply and undergo morphological changes within the fly and have an effect on the fly that enhances their chances of transmission. One of these effects is the production of a glycoprotein-rich gel which, together with the parasites, forms a plug that blocks the sand fly gut and causes problems with feeding that enable more parasites to be transferred during biting. Using micro-computed tomography, for the first time we have been able to non-invasively visualize the plug in the fly in 3D and the way it distends the midgut and opens the stomodeal valve, facilitating transmission by regurgitation of the gut contents. We also show how a second, uninfected blood meal causes further extension of the midgut and, especially, the plug, supporting the hypothesis that such second meals can facilitate parasite transmission.
