Brucellosis is a neglected disease of livestock that can be transmitted to people through consumption of raw animal products and direct contact with animal birth material. Although prevalent in Ethiopia, there is limited information on the disease prevalence amongst pastoral communities, whose life is intricately linked with their livestock. We therefore, conducted a disease surveillance in people and their livestock in Afar and Somali region (SRS), two pastoral regions of Ethiopia. The study included 13 districts and 650 households. A total of 5469 blood samples were collected from people and livestock species (cattle, camel, sheep and goats) and analyzed using commercial brucellosis ELISA assays. Livestock brucellosis prevalence was 9% in Afar and 8.6% in SRS (ranging from 0.6 to 20.2% at woreda level). In humans, prevalence was 48.3% in Afar and 34.9% in SRS (ranging from 0 to 74.5% at woreda level). 68.4% of all households in Afar and 57.5% of households in SRS had at least one positive animal. This study showed that the disease is widespread in human and their livestock in pastoral communities of Afar and SRS with the existence of geographical hotspots. Results will advise on tailored surveillance programs in pastoral communities.
