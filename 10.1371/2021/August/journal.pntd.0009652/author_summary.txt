Plasmodium vivax is the dominant malaria species in several countries, and a safe and effective vaccine against the species is needed if progress is to be made towards malaria control and elimination. The P. vivax Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) ectodomain and the C-terminal region (19 kDa) of the Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP1) are important malaria vaccine antigens. However, antigenic diversity remains a critical factor for acquisition of immunity and also a major barrier for development of an effective vaccine. Here, investigations on the genetic diversity of two blood stage vaccine candidate antigens, Merozoite surface protein 119 and Apical membrane antigen 1, of P. vivax from three malaria endemic regions of the India was attempted and compared with global population. High genetic variation was observed in Pvama1 domain I, which has been reported as a dominant target of host immune response. In contrast, Pvmsp119 showed highly conserved sequences from three geographically diverse populations of India and globally, which further suggests Pvmsp119 as an extremely conserved protein. Collectively, the diversity data generated in this study provides a baseline data towards development of a broadly efficacious Pvama1 and Pvmsp119 based vaccine.
