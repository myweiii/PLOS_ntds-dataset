    "Background": "Coagulation mechanisms are reported to be affected in dengue illness and evidenced by prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). The main aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the magnitude of coagulation abnormalities among patients with dengue fever infection.",
    "Method": "This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The Joana Brigg\u2019s Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used for quality appraisal. STATA version 11 software was used for meta-analysis. The magnitude of coagulation abnormalities among dengue fever patients was determined by using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the possible source of heterogeneity. Egger weighted regression tests were used to check the presence of publication bias among the included articles.",
    "Result": "Forty-two studies with a total of 12,221 dengue fever patients were eligible for meta-analysis in this study. Of which 22, 15, and 26 studies were used to determine the magnitude of prolonged APTT, PT, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. The magnitude of prolonged APTT and PT among patients with dengue fever infection were 42.91% (95% CI: 30.95, 54.87) I2 = 99.1% and 16.48% (95% CI: 10.95, 22.01) I2 = 97.0%, respectively. Besides, the magnitude of thrombocytopenia among dengue fever patients was 70.29% (95% CI: 62.69, 77.89) I2 = 99.3%. The magnitude of prolonged APTT in children and adults was 51.21% (95% CI: 24.54, 77.89) and 44.89% (95% CI: 28.32, 61.45), respectively. Similarly, the overall magnitude of prolonged PT in children and adults were 13.40% (95% CI: 6.09, 20.71) and 18.73% (95% CI: 7.49, 29.96), respectively.",
    "Conclusion": "The result of this study showed that there is a high magnitude of prolonged APTT and PT in dengue fever patients. Therefore, screening and early correction of coagulation abnormalities may be helpful to reduce further complications in those patients."
