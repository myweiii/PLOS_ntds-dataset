Standardised outcome measures for snakebite randomised controlled trials are needed to enable results to be compared and combined between studies. This systematic review was conducted to understand the variations in outcome measure use in snakebite randomised controlled trials, and to create a comprehensive list of outcome measures from which to develop a core outcome set (COS). A total of 153 unique outcome measures were extracted from the 58 studies identified in this systematic review. Of these 153 unique outcome measures, 91 were used in only in a single study. Although a form of bedside whole blood clotting test was used in 30 of the 58 studies, 18 unique methods of measurement were identified. Only three studies, all conducted in the USA, included patient-centred outcomes. This systematic review demonstrates the strong need for a snakebite core outcome set, which will support the adoption of valid, reproducible, and patient-centred outcome measures, and enable downstream meta-analyses.
