The natural history of dengue has the unique characteristic of plasma leakage that results in hemoconcentration as well as vasculopathy and thrombocytopenia that result in bleeding. Therefore, hematocrit monitoring is a crucial tool to guide management in dengue patients. Microhematocrit adjunct with a complete blood count (CBC) to monitor dengue patients were traditionally performed to decrease the frequency of venipuncture. However, microhematocrit is currently less preferred to the point-of-care hemoglobin monitoring tools to measure red cells in other diseases. There has been no study investigating the feasibility of using point-of-care hemoglobin (POC-Hb) to monitor dengue patients. We studied the correlation of hemoglobin measured by POC-Hb testing and hematocrit measured by an automated CBC in adult dengue patients. We were able to show a strong positive correlation between the two measurements (r = 0.869, p <0.001). Using the rise of POC-Hb value of â‰¥20% above the convalescent value as the criteria for detecting hemoconcentration by POC-Hb testing, measurement of hemoglobin using POC-Hb has a sensitivity of 71.4% for detecting hemoconcentration compared to the traditional hematocrit criteria. Our findings support the use of POC-Hb testing adjunct with a complete blood count to guide fluid management in dengue patients.
