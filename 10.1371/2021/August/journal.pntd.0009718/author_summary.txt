Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic tick-borne viral hemorrhagic disease. This disease is reported from Europe, Mediterranean, north-western China, central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Several outbreaks of CCHF were reported from Gujarat and Rajasthan states, India from 2011 to 2019. In this study, we discuss the clinical, molecular, serological, and the cytokine data of 34 CCHF cases (17 fatal and 17 survived) which were detected from Gujarat state in the year 2019. A sequential weekly follow up of the CCHF survivors was performed to understand the viral kinetics and the antibody profile. Interestingly, the presence of persistence CCHF viral RNA was observed till 76th POD in one of the survivors. To our knowledge, we are reporting this long term persistence of viremia for the first time. We also observed that the anti-CCHFV IgM detection in the serum samples starts as soon as 2nd POD but anti-CCHFV IgG antibody could be detected in the majority of the cases only after the 28th POD. The cytokine analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of serum IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-Î³ during the acute phase of the infection, but interestingly IL-10 lowered to normal upon clearance of the virus in the clinically recovered case. We did the phylogenetic analysis and concluded the circulation of the Asian-West African re-assortment genotype in humans, which has not been reported from India prior to this study.
