Despite several years of deworming campaigns targeting school-aged children, soil-transmitted helminths (STH) remains a public health problem in most developing countries, including Benin. The burden is mostly on children and pregnant women, but also on the whole society. Soil-transmitted helminths are responsible for malnutrition, anemia, low birth weight, cognitive impairment, decrease of school performance, and subsequently economic loss. The current strategy of the Benin National Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program is to achieve STH control through mass drug administration campaigns targeting school-aged children (SAC). The baseline data of Deworm3 study, implemented in Com√©, southern Benin, as part of a multicountry (Benin, Malawi and India) STH elimination trial, shows that previous school deworming campaigns decreased STH prevalence; however there is a persistent reservoir of STH infection in adults and pre-school aged children that should be targeted for a better impact. In order to eliminate STH as a public health problem, Benin National NTD Program would need to increase its target population, from the SAC to the whole community. The future results of Deworm3 trial would demonstrate whether the STH elimination goal STH using community wide mass drug administration would be achievable.
