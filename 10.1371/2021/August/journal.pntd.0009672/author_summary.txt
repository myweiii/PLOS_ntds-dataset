Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum cause the vast majority of all human malaria cases. Across all transmission settings, a large proportion of infections of the two species remain asymptomatic. These infections are not diagnosed and treated by control programs focusing on clinical cases. They can carry gametocytes, the sexual stage of the parasite that establishes infections in mosquitos, thus asymptomatic infections contribute to transmission. In order to determine who is likely to contribute to transmission, gametocyte densities were measured by sensitive molecular methods in afebrile individuals in four countries. The proportion of infections with gametocytes varied greatly among surveys, and was higher in regions that had experienced low transmission for extended periods of time. In moderate-high transmission settings, gametocyte densities were particularly high in children below six years, highlighting the importance that interventions to reduce transmission include this age group. The majority of gametocyte carriers was positive by light microscopy. The comprehensive data on gametocyte carriage presented here lays the foundation for the development of more effective screen and treat activities to reduce malaria transmission.
