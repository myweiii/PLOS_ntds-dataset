Ebola virus (EBOV) is spread through exposure to infected bodily fluids of a human or animal. While EBOV can lead to a severe disease, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), it is possible for individuals to have anti-EBOV antibodies without ever getting sick with EVD. Seroreactivity (the detection of antigen-specific antibodies) suggests that that person has been exposed to EBOV or a similar virus in the past. Our study looked for seroreactive individuals who have never received an EVD diagnosis in four sites across the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Then we checked if animal exposures previously linked to EVD were more common among seroreactive individuals than non-seroreactive individuals. Among respondents from all four sites, 113 (8.3%) were seroreactive to EBOV. Additionally, contact with bats, rodents, and eating non-human primate meat were associated with seroreactivity, indicating these factors may be predictors of undocumented EBOV exposure events. These findings show that some EVD risk factors may be associated with EBOV seroreactivity without EVD diagnosis. Future research is needed to clarify the relationships between zoonotic exposures, seroreactivity, asymptomatic infection, and EVD.
