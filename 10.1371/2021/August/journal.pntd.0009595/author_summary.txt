The question of whether a global public health program can be sustainable is as important as whether that program is effective. While neglected tropical disease (NTD) programs have achieved tangible success in reducing the burden of NTDs over the past decade through a massive collaboration between global and local stakeholders, the achievement of global NTD control and elimination goals will depend in large part on whether these efforts are sustained. This study seeks to encourage more and better dialogue around NTD program sustainability by incorporating a wide variety of expert perspectives to create and propose a shared definition of sustainability upon which future NTD programming decisions can be made. The sustainability statement based on the findings from this study suggests that three essential components to NTD program sustainability are commitment from decision-makers within NTD-endemic countries, resource mobilization that is responsive to local needs, and enhanced mechanisms for accountability.
