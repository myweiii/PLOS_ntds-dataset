To improve the lives of persons with leprosy, perceptions about leprosy need to change. The aim of this study is to describe the development and evaluation of interventions (posters and community meetings) to change the perception and improve knowledge of leprosy in Fatehpur and Chandauli districts, India. To measure the effect of the interventions we administered questionnaires before and after the interventions and we conducted 48 interviews and eight group interviews afterwards. In total 1067 participants were included in the first survey and 843 in the second. We found that the interventions resulted in more knowledge of leprosy and in changed community and personal attitudes towards (persons affected by) leprosy. The percentage of participants with adequate knowledge of leprosy was higher in the second survey and the percentage of participants with negative community and personal attitudes was lower. In the interviews, many participants indicated that there had been a change in perception in the community. The more posters participants had seen, the better their knowledge of leprosy and the more positive their attitudes. Findings from this study suggest that contextualized posters and community meetings can be effective in changing the perception of leprosy and increasing leprosy-related knowledge.
