Cytokine release assays were used to confirm the cure of visceral leishmaniasis in patients (from an area where Leishmania infantum is endemic) with autoimmune disease. They were also used to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infection in similar patients. Some 21.27% of those with no clinical history of leishmaniasis were shown to have been contact with the parasite.
