Microfilaraemia of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans was investigated by light microscopy in paired thick smears of capillary and venous blood; each sample was prepared using a standardised quantity of 10 microliters of blood and analysed by a minimum of two independent microscopists. Microfilaraemia was on average +34.5% (95% CI: +11.0 to +63.0) higher in capillary than in venous blood samples for L. loa and +24.8% (95% CI: +0.0 to +60.5) for M. perstans. This might have implications for treatment algorithms of onchocerciasis and loiasis, in which exact quantification of L. loa microfilaraemia is of importance. Furthermore, the odds for detection of M. perstans microfilariae was 65% higher in capillary than in venous blood which may pre-dispose capillary blood for detection of M. perstans infection in large epidemiological studies when sampling of large blood quantities is not feasible. No solid evidence for a higher odds of L. loa microfilariae detection in capillary blood was revealed, which might be explained by generally high levels of L. loa microfilaraemia in capillary and venous blood.
