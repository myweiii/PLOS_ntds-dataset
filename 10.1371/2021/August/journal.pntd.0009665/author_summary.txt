Nocardia species can be responsible for opportunistic infections in humans, causing a variety of clinical presentations. They can also cause mycetoma in a normal host through direct inoculation. Although these species are often overlooked and misunderstood by modern medicine, they can cause life-threatening infections. However, most of our knowledge about Nocardia is based upon case reports and a few small studies of limited scope. This study provides an overview of the taxonomic and evolutionary structure of the genus Nocardia through extensive analysis of genome sequences. Our work aids the field by dissecting the genetic diversity of this species and improving the identification scheme for Nocardia species.
