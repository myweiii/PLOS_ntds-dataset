    "Abstract": "Nocardia is a complex and diverse genus of aerobic actinomycetes that cause complex clinical presentations, which are difficult to diagnose due to being misunderstood. To date, the genetic diversity, evolution, and taxonomic structure of the genus Nocardia are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the pan-genome of 86 Nocardia type strains to clarify their genetic diversity. Our study revealed an open pan-genome for Nocardia containing 265,836 gene families, with about 99.7% of the pan-genome being variable. Horizontal gene transfer appears to have been an important evolutionary driver of genetic diversity shaping the Nocardia genome and may have caused historical taxonomic confusion from other taxa (primarily Rhodococcus, Skermania, Aldersonia, and Mycobacterium). Based on single-copy gene families, we established a high-accuracy phylogenomic approach for Nocardia using 229 genome sequences. Furthermore, we found 28 potentially new species and reclassified 16 strains. Finally, by comparing the topology between a phylogenomic tree and 384 phylogenetic trees (from 384 single-copy genes from the core genome), we identified a novel locus for inferring the phylogeny of this genus. The dapb1 gene, which encodes dipeptidyl aminopeptidase BI, was far superior to commonly used markers for Nocardia and yielded a topology almost identical to that of genome-based phylogeny. In conclusion, the present study provides insights into the genetic diversity, contributes a robust framework for the taxonomic classification, and elucidates the evolutionary relationships of Nocardia. This framework should facilitate the development of rapid tests for the species identification of highly variable species and has given new insight into the behavior of this genus."
