Schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitic disease of poverty that affects ~200 million people mainly in (sub)tropical regions, resulting in a massive health burden and serious morbidity. During Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) or S. mansoni infection, parasite eggs are trapped in host liver and induce hepatic granulomas and fibrosis, which leads to severe liver damage, and even death of the host. In hepatic schistosomiasis, considerable amounts of ROS accumulate in granulomas surrounding liver-trapped eggs. However, whether schistosome eggs trigger the production of ROS, and if so, whether and how ROS promote hepatic pathology in host remain unknown. In this study, the authors illustrated that S. japonicum eggs evoke high production of ROS in macrophages, which is necessary for egg-mediated M2 macrophage differentiation and promotes hepatic granulomas and fibrosis in S. japonicum-infected mice. These discoveries provide a potential target regarding schistosome eggs-induced ROS production, which can be manipulated to regulate immunopathology in hepatic schistosomiasis.
