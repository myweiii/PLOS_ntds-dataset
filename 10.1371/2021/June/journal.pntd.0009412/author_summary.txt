Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus and it is transmitted by the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes. In October 2015 an unexpected increase in the number of newborns with microcephaly in Brazil. After investigation, Zika virus was strongly related to microcephaly. Considering the epidemiological importance of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and its repercussions on the mother-fetus pair, the aim of the present study was to investigate ZIKV infection in the placenta and umbilical cord blood of women served by the Brazilian Health System in São Luís, state of Maranhão, Northeast, Brazil, after the first ZIKV epidemic. This study investigated the prevalence of Zika infection in asymptomatic pregnant women attending two public maternities in Maranhão state, Northeast Brazil. We believe that these findings will contribute to the need of continuous awareness of the risk of ZIKV infection in pregnancy and the need to improving the health care and strategic planning of public policies regarding obstetric and neonatal care.
