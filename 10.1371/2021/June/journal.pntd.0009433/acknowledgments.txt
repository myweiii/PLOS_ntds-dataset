We thank the participants from the different communities who gave their time and participated in the study. We are grateful to the Cameroon COUNTDOWN Buea team and all students who collaborated to support data collection and analysis and advise on different technical aspects. This study could not have been done without their effort and hard work. COUNTDOWN is a 7-year programme of Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) implementation research funded by UKAID (within the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office). COUNTDOWN is a multi-disciplinary research consortium dedicated to investigating cost-effective, scaled-up and sustainable solutions, necessary to control and eliminate the seven most common NTDs, and brings together researchers from a range of backgrounds, policy makers, health care providers and implementation research specialists from Cameroon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, the UK and the USA.
