In Cameroon, within the Meme River Basin, ending the disease onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, remains a health challenge, despite over 15 years of distributing the prevention and treatment drug called Ivermectin. The ongoing occurrence of the disease in this region highlights that moving from control of the disease to elimination is complicated by many factors. This research found four areas that impact on disease risk, prevention, treatment, experience and health seeking behaviour. These are 1. Contextual factors on health promotion interventions (Onchocerciasis history and understanding of the disease, prevention and mitigation strategies and MDA experience); 2. Social factors (poverty and livelihoods, economic and social impacts on CDD volunteers and stigma); 3. Environmental factors (exposure, housing, occupation and poverty) and 4. health seeking pathways and decision making for treatment. These are also affected by gender differences and community participation and ownership. We recommend the following for policy makers; intersectional and gender analysis at the local level, addressing environmental risk factors through integrated and regular health promotion, vector control strategies and access to safe water sources; action to minimise social and economic barriers to MDA; case detection and management that also addresses stigma and a fair and just support network for CDDs.
