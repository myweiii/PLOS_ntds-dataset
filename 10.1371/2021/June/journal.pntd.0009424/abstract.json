    "Abstract": "Most alphaviruses are mosquito-borne and can cause severe disease in humans and domesticated animals. In North America, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an important human pathogen with case fatality rates of 30\u201390%. Currently, there are no therapeutics or vaccines to treat and/or prevent human infection. One critical impediment in countermeasure development is the lack of insight into clinically relevant parameters in a susceptible animal model. This study examined the disease course of EEEV in a cynomolgus macaque model utilizing advanced telemetry technology to continuously and simultaneously measure temperature, respiration, activity, heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG) following an aerosol challenge at 7.0 log10 PFU. Following challenge, all parameters were rapidly and substantially altered with peak alterations from baseline ranged as follows: temperature (+3.0\u20134.2\u00b0C), respiration rate (+56\u2013128%), activity (-15-76% daytime and +5\u201322% nighttime), heart rate (+67\u2013190%), systolic (+44\u201367%) and diastolic blood pressure (+45\u201380%). Cardiac abnormalities comprised of alterations in QRS and PR duration, QTc Bazett, T wave morphology, amplitude of the QRS complex, and sinoatrial arrest. An unexpected finding of the study was the first documented evidence of a critical cardiac event as an immediate cause of euthanasia in one NHP. All brain waves were rapidly (~12\u201324 hpi) and profoundly altered with increases of up to 6,800% and severe diffuse slowing of all waves with decreases of ~99%. Lastly, all NHPs exhibited disruption of the circadian rhythm, sleep, and food/fluid intake. Accordingly, all NHPs met the euthanasia criteria by ~106\u2013140 hpi. This is the first of its kind study utilizing state of the art telemetry to investigate multiple clinical parameters relevant to human EEEV infection in a susceptible cynomolgus macaque model. The study provides critical insights into EEEV pathogenesis and the parameters identified will improve animal model development to facilitate rapid evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics."
