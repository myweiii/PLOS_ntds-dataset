Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in tropical countries. Diabetes mellitus is the most important risk factor, and routes of infection include skin inoculation, ingestion and inhalation. Prevention guidelines recommend that residents, rice farmers and visitors should wear protective gear such as rubber boots when in direct contact with soil and environmental water, and consume only boiled or bottled water. Here, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness of a multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis in diabetic patients in northeast Thailand. We enrolled 9,056 diabetic patients in 2014. We randomly allocated primary care units as the unit of randomization to receive the intervention starting in March 2016, 2017 and 2018. All diabetic patients were contacted by phone yearly. We found that diabetic patients who received a behavioural support group session had lower incidence rates of hospital admissions involving infectious diseases and of all-cause mortality, but not of culture-confirmed melioidosis. In conclusion, clear benefits of this multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis were not seen. We propose that more compelling invitations for the intervention, modification of or addition to the behaviour change techniques used, and more frequent intervention may be needed.
