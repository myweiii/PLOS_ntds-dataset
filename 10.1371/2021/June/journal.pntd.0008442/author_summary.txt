There are many theories regarding the mechanism of entry of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) into the nervous system. The inflammation cascade effect, resulting from the virus entering the central nervous system (CNS), is a major cause of brain injury in JEV patients. In this study, we found that the earliest point at which viral antigen was detected in the brain tissues following peripheral infection of JEV was at 3d. The virus was located in the nerve nuclei of the thalamus and medulla oblongata and, subsequently, viral antigens were found in the anterior olfactory nucleus. At 4 dpi, the virus was extensively distributed in the brain tissue, and at 6 d -8 d the viral antigen was widely distributed and highly concentrated. The viral concentration detected in the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM), deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe), and motor trigeminal nucleus (Mo5) remained high throughout the experiment. The hypertrophic nerve nuclei of JEV include the early anterior olfactory (AO) nucleus and the late hippocampal CA2 region. In the early stages of viral infection (6 dpi), the changes in viral antigen concentration and mortality rate were consistent. It was hypothesized that this stage represents the activation of viral proliferation and brain inflammation.
