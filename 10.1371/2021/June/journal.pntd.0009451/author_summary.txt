For urogenital schistosomiasis, targets for morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem are based on the percentage of school-age children with a heavy intensity infection in a set of sentinel schools. These targets are not tied to specific morbidity indicators and should be reevaluated due to the recognition that all infections have an impact on people’s health. Multiple studies have shown a strong association between urogenital schistosomiasis infection and microhematuria. In these analyses, data from children aged 6–15 years in monitoring and evaluation cohorts from five African countries were used to determine whether infection and heavy intensity infection targets could be developed, based on a prevalence of microhematuria in a school without schistosomiasis infections before and after initiation of a deworming program. Results indicate that targets of 5%, 8%, or 11% urogenital schistosomiasis infection prevalence in school-age children can be used to reliably conclude that a school is below a microhematuria prevalence of 10%, 13%, or 15%, respectively. These targets could be used by control program managers as guide to determine whether morbidity has been controlled or eliminated as a public health problem.
