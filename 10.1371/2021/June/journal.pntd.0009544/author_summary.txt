The social determinants of health—the circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness—have a profound effect on how, when, and even if patients access healthcare, and yet they are generally under-appreciated by practicing clinicians whose training emphasises the biomedical model of healthcare. In this region of tropical Australia patients diagnosed with melioidosis were more likely to live in a socioeconomically disadvantaged region. Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with melioidosis were also more likely to die from their infection and to die at a younger age. It was notable that socioeconomic disadvantage had a greater independent association with in-hospital death than age, Indigenous status, the presence of bacteraemia or any of the comorbidities that classically predispose individuals to melioidosis. A more holistic approach to the delivery of healthcare—which addresses the social determinants of health—is necessary if we are to reduce the burden of melioidosis and the many other health conditions that disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged members of our society.
