Yellow fever is a vaccine-preventable disease transmitted by mosquitoes that annually affects an estimated 200,000 people and causes 30,000 deaths. Being able to quickly and accurately identify people infected with yellow fever virus by laboratory confirmation is critical for managing outbreaks and vaccination campaigns. A test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can identify yellow fever antibodies in a personâ€™s blood within approximately four hours. In order to assure this test could be used in laboratories located in regions with yellow fever transmission, workshops were held to train laboratorians from Africa and South America on how to use the test. Laboratorians were then given a panel of samples and performed the test in their own laboratories. Of the 39 countries that performed testing, all countries scored 90% or higher concordant results, demonstrating the successful transfer of this yellow fever antibody detection test.
