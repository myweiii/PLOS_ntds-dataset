Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease which mainly affects people living in rural areas of the tropics. Snakebite can result in mild, moderate or severe envenomation, psychological disturbances, long-term disability, and deaths. Snakebite incidence demonstrates both spatial variation and seasonal patterns in many countries, but there have been no previous in-depth evaluations of spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite risk at a country level. We undertook an island-wide community survey to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite in the country. Both snakebites and snakebite envenomings showed clear spatiotemporal patterns where certain hotspots persisted throughout the year while others showed dynamic changes within a year. We found that the monthly snakebite incidence was 39 per 100 000 and envenoming incidences was 19 per 100 000 in Sri Lanka. We developed monthly snakebite and snakebite envenoming risk maps to identify snakebite hotspots and cold spots in the country. These maps provide useful insights into healthcare decision-making, such as, prioritizing locations to establish specialized centres for snakebite management and allocating resources based on risk assessments which consider both location and season. Our methodology demonstrates a general approach to model times and places of individual events and address the effects of variable survey effort and recall bias associated with epidemiological surveys.
