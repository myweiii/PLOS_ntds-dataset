Chagas disease, caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately 10 million people worldwide. In 20%â€“30% of infected individuals, the disease results in heart disease or mega esophagus/megacolon, making Chagas disease the most common cause of infectious myocarditis in the world. Previous studies have shown that the immune response specific for this parasite becomes impaired over time. One mechanism that could explain the loss of immune cells is the defective signaling of cytokines involved in the maintenance of T cells. In this work, we evaluated the signaling pathways of IL-27 and IL-7, which promote T-cell differentiation, but IL-27 might also exert immunomodulatory actions. We found alterations in the IL-27/IL-7 pathways in chronic Chagas disease that affect not only the signal-transduction level but also the transcriptional regulation level. In vitro treatment of PBMCs of patients in early clinical stages of chronic Chagas disease could restore T-cell function, but this was not possible in cell cultures from patients with severe heart disease in whom the immune system is deeply exhausted. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying the anti-T. cruzi response in human subjects which might be useful for vaccine and new therapeutic interventions.
