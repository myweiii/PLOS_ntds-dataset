Praziquantel is still the only drug in use for the treatment of all Schistosoma spp. and is exclusively active against the adult life cycle stage, since schistosomes in the prepatent period of up to eight weeks are not affected by the drug. Although resistance to praziquantel has not been confirmed and its existence remains controversial, some countries have identified clinical schistosome isolates with reduced sensitivity to praziquantel, after deployment in mass drug administration programs. The need for a new antischistosomal compound is urgent, ideally exhibiting broad activity against all stages of the parasiteâ€™s life cycle present in humans. After testing a series of antiplasmodial compounds, the authors found that several compounds also exhibited antischistosomal activity at various life cycle stages of the worms, including pyronaridine and methylene blue, both compounds already approved for human use. A pilot trial with pyronaridine-artesunate done in Gabon showed the first promising results against Schistosoma infections.
