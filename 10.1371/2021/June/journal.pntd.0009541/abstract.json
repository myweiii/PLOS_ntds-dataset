    "Background": "Burkholderia sensu stricto is comprised mainly of opportunistic pathogens. This group is widely distributed in the environment but is especially important in clinical settings. In Mexico, few species have been correctly identified among patients, most often B. cepacia is described.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In this study, approximately 90 strains identified as B. cepacia with the VITEK2 system were isolated from two medical centers in Mexico City and analyzed by MLSA, BOX-PCR and genome analysis. The initial identification of B. cepacia was confirmed for many strains, but B. contaminans, B. multivorans and B. vietnamiensis were also identified among clinical strains for the first time in hospitals in Mexico. Additionally, the presence of B. pseudomallei was confirmed, and a novel species within the B. cepacia complex was documented. Several strains misidentified as B. cepacia actually belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas and Providencia.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The presence of different Burkholderia species in Mexico was confirmed. Correct identification of Burkholderia species is important to provide accurate treatment for immunosuppressed patients."
