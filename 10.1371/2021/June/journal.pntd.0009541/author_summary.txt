Burkholderia sensu stricto species are opportunistic pathogens in immunosuppressed patients. Both B. cepacia complex and B. pseudomallei are widely known around the world but not in Mexico. The identification of these bacteria can be difficult due to the similarity among the species. Tools like MLSA and genome analysis are currently used for identification. Approximately 90 strains identified as B. cepacia with the VITEK2 system were obtained from two hospitals in Mexico City. The strains were analyzed by MLSA, BOX-PCR and genome analysis. The analysis confirmed the presence of B. cepacia and identified for the first time B. multivorans, B. contaminans and B. vietnamiensis in Mexican clinical settings. The presence of B. pseudomallei was confirmed, and a novel species in the B. cepacia complex was also found. The correct identification of Burkholderia species in Mexico is important for appropriate treatment application.
