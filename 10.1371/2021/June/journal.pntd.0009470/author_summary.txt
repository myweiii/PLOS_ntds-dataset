Taenia solium, commonly known as the pork tapeworm is a parasite that, as the etiological agent of neurocysticercosis (the presence of the intermediate state/cysts of the parasite in the central nervous system of humans) is one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy across endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Southern America and south-east Asia. A variety of biologically efficacious control options exist which include; deworming, provision of clean water and sanitation and appropriate hygiene and food safety education in humans and the vaccination, deworming, confinement and proper feeding of pigs. Despite these, the parasite has not been eliminated and varying impact of interventions has been achieved in the many endemic areas. Failure of the interventions to achieve expected impact could be attributed either to inadequate consideration of various contextual factors, or inability to create an enabling environment needed to underpin success. Contextual factors in this instance are features of the circumstances for which an intervention is conceived and developed and in which it is implemented and evaluated. We conducted a systematic literature review coupled with key informant interviews to identify these contextual factors and show how they may have influenced the implementation and evaluation of control programmes. The study identified that choice of baseline and end line measures, local knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the target population, existing infrastructural and staff capacities, stakeholder participation and support by the national governments through policies and strategies may affect the implementation and evaluation of control interventions. During project inception, there is need to document and understand these contextual factors in order to anticipate the challenges and adapt accordingly.
