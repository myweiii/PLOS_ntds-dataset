Dengue is a well-known public health problem in Thailand. To identify epidemiologic and clinical patterns of dengue in Thailand, we studied 951 febrile patients with fever, aged 1–55 years, who attended Bang Phae district hospital in Ratchaburi province, Thailand. Patients were tested with a rapid test for dengue, and further tests were carried out on paired blood samples taken 10–21 days apart. Overall, 14% of the febrile episodes identified between October 2011 and September 2016 were dengue-confirmed. Teenagers were mostly affected with only few adults. Dengue peaks occurred between June-November, but there was no large epidemic during the study period. DENV type 2 was the main serotype in circulation in 2012, DENV type 3 in 2014, and DENV types 4 and 3 in 2015. Dengue cases were 11 times more likely to be hospitalized than non-dengue cases. Dengue patients were more likely to present with rash, headache, hematemesis and alterations to consciousness, compared to non-dengue. Two thirds of the dengue cases were clinically diagnosed with suspected dengue or DHF, even without lab confirmation. Secondary dengue cases were about three times more common than primary cases. Even among children < 10 years-of-age, 61% of the patients were of secondary infection. Among dengue cases, 65% were accurately detected using the dengue RDT. This was not different between secondary and primary dengue cases. All 8 patients clinically diagnosed with DHF were secondary dengue cases. Although most of our dengue-positive patients were secondary dengue cases, we only observed few patients showing DHF. Thus, we concluded that our dengue cases were mostly of mild dengue illness. Our study results support the previous data confirming the high burden of dengue in Thailand and such information would help to make decisions on future implementation of various tools for dengue prevention and control.
