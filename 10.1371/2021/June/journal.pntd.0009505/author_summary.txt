Japanese encephalitis, an infection transmitted by mosquitos, is the most diagnosed viral encephalitis throughout Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. China has one of the world’s highest JE burdens. Although JE has been well-controlled in Zhejiang Province, it is associated with high mortality and disability which brings heavy burden and tremendous pain to families and society. However, specific data on costs and DALYs from the provincial level are absent. With this study, we merged multiple data sources and applied an expansion factor to estimate the total economic burden and disease burden of JE during 2013–2018 in Zhejiang Province. The total economic burden was estimated at US $12.01 million with an EF = 3. Of this, $8.32 million was due to direct economic cost and $3.69 million to indirect cost. The disease burden was 42.75 DALYs per million population according to the GBD 1990 methodology and 80.01 DALYs per million population according to the GBD 2010 methodology. The estimated data show a heavy burden of JE on the economy and health care system in Zhejiang Province. This quantification should improve awareness of health impact assessment and provide evidence for decision-making to further prevent and control JE.
