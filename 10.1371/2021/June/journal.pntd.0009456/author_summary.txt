Understanding the effect that nutritional deficiencies, dietary habits, and undernutrition exert on leprosy transmission can improve our ability to better develop strategies and control programs to prevent this debilitating disease. While there is evidence that leprosy and undernutrition are associated, overall the literature is sparse. The authors here provide evidence for the possible role of undernutrition and low BMI on leprosy susceptibility. Additional questions about dietary habits and socioeconomic status support the framework that food insecurity may lead to undernutrition causing an increase in susceptibility to active leprosy disease. Although the study focuses on the leprosy susceptibility, as it relates to undernutrition, in North Gondar Zone, Ethiopia, the outcomes of the study may inform risks in other areas where the dual burden of undernutrition and neglected tropical diseases exist.
