bTB is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria (M. bovis, mainly), which is also called “TB disease from bovine sources” when it occurs in humans. It is still widespread in China although the prevalence has gradually reduced through national intervention. Because beef and dairy products are important human dietary sources of protein, bTB has a great impact on public health and safety. We constructed the first meta-analysis to assess the epidemic of bTB in dairy cattle in China over the past 10 years and analyzed the potential moderators of bTB. A total of 100 studies were included. The results showed that bTB was common and unevenly distributed in China. The potential moderators affecting the bTB epidemic were region, sampling year, detection methods, age of dairy cattle, feeding mode, season, and certain geographical and climatic factors (longitude, precipitation, mean temperature, humidity, and altitude). These important findings may help in the formulation of policies to control the prevalence of bTB in cattle, thereby reducing the economic losses caused by bTB and reducing the threat of bTB to human health.
