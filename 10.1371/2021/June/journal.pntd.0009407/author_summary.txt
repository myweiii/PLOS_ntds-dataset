Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease, transmitted by tsetse flies, that is usually fatal if untreated. The number of cases have been rapidly declining over the past years indicating that elimination of the disease as a public health problem is within reach. To achieve the next stage, i.e. interruption of HAT transmission by 2030, intensive screening and surveillance will need to be maintained, but with tools and strategies more efficiently tailored to the very low prevalence. In contrast to the traditional approach of sending laboratory expertise to the field, we assessed an alternative approach based on the collection of dried blood samples on filter paper that were tested in a regional laboratory. Samples were taken in endemic, previously endemic and non-endemic villages and tested by ELISA and Immune Trypanolysis. The ELISA positivity rates were similar to those of other screening techniques currently used and Immune Trypanolysis was highly specific. Hence for surveillance in HAT endemic areas, collecting dried blood samples followed by centralized testing could become an alternative to the current strategy of active screening by mobile teams with on the spot confirmation. It has also potential for post-elimination surveillance to monitor resurgence and for exploratory surveillance in historic foci. Though highly specific, Immune Trypanolysis remains too complex for use in intermediate level laboratories, to further expand this strategy an alternative second step test is required.
