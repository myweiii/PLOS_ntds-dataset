This is the first report of human immune responses to Phlebotomus alexandri. Phlebotomus alexandri is a sand fly found in Southwest Asia and is the vector for transmission of the parasite Leishmania infantum, agent of visceral leishmaniasis. During the bite of this sand fly, a small amount of saliva is injected into the skin. In this study, we report the human immune response to Phlebotomus alexandri saliva. We found that 64% of people who traveled to endemic Iraq developed antibodies directed toward this sand flyâ€™s saliva. This suggests that saliva is very immunogenic and that anti-saliva immune responses could be a good indicator of vector exposure. Additionally, we studied the cellular immune responses in saliva-stimulated white blood cells and found a Th2 biased cytokine profile.
