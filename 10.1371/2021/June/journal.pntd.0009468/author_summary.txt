Chikungunya fever is a serious public health problem, with a high rate of infection and disease. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a cosmopolitan virus, which has inflicted severe damage in 50 countries in the Americas and is responsible for chronic disabling manifestations. In spite of this, epidemiological data on vulnerable groups such as Indigenous people are scarce. We report on a cross-sectional study describing the seroprevalence of CHIKV in Indigenous groups in the São Francisco Valley, Brazil, in association with anthropometric data. The study population included 433 individuals distributed in the following ethnic groups: 109 (25.2%) Truká, 272 (62·8%) Fulni-ô, and 52 (12%) from the non-Indigenous urbanized control group When the sample was stratified, positive CHIKV IgG was distributed as follows: no individuals in the Truká group, 213/272 (78.3%; 95% CI: 72·9–83·1) individuals in the Fulni-ô group, and 3/52 (5.8%; 95% CI: 1·21–16) individuals in the control group. This study shows, for the first time, that CHIKV circulated in an Indigenous population (Fulni-ô) in the São Francisco Valley, in 2016 and 2017. The finding strikingly differs from the absence of anti-CHIKV serology found in the Truká people and from the low prevalence in the urban region of Juazeiro, Bahia.
