Mycetoma is a tropical infection causing large tumorous lesions on mainly the foot. This infection is most commonly caused by the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. Mycetoma is treated with antifungal agents and surgery but with low success rates. In our search for novel treatments for mycetoma we determined if CIN-102, a synthetic oil that resembles cinnamon oil, would be therapeutic in mycetoma. We therefore determined the activity of this oil against the fungus in vitro. We found that CIN-102 could inhibit M. mycetomatis growth in vitro. To determine if CIN-102 was also active against the mycetoma grain in vivo, we determined the efficacy in our Galleria mellonella grain model. Interestingly, CIN-102 was found to be effective in the larvae at a low concentrations.
