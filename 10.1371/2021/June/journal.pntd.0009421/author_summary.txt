Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected disease that induces heart failure and arrhythmias in approximately 30% of patients during the chronic phase of the disease. There are several substrates for arrhythmias in the heart. Some of them involve changes in the electrical properties of cardiomyocytes, the working cells of the heart. In our study we evaluate the potential involvement of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in the arrhythmic phenotype of cardiomyocytes isolated from mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, between 180- and 200- days post-infection, which is considered the chronic phase of CD in this animal model. In our study we found several arrhythmogenic membrane potential oscillations during action potential measurements, in rest and using a protocol to simulate a pause after a tachycardia. Using pharmacological approach, we determine that NCX significantly contributed to the arrhythmogenic phenomena observed. Thus, in our study we demonstrate that NCX may be relevant to the cellular arrhythmogenic profile observed in cardiomyocytes during the chronic phase of experimental CD and blocking NCX may be a new therapeutic strategy to treat arrhythmias in this condition.
