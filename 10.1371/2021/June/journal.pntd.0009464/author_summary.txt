The World Health Organisation has established a strategy to halve snakebite mortality and morbidity by 2030. Achieving this ambitious target within a decade will require substantial investment from governments of countries most affected by snakebite. The burden of snakebite however, is typically greatest in low-middle income countries with already limited health budgets. Acquiring government support to prioritise snakebite over other prevailing diseases will require evidence of the scale, causes, precise geographies and health economic impacts of snakebite. While the snakebite research community has progressed the delivery of some of these evidence types, it has been weak at providing evidence of the health economic burden of snakebite. Our hospital-based study identifies the health (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) and financial burdens of snakebite to three districts of Burkina Faso. We argue that funding of more health economic research, performed at greater depth and that includes cost-effectiveness of snakebite treatment and other remedial interventions is arguably the most effective tool to advocate for the policy support and investment required of national and international health agencies to deliver WHOâ€™s laudable 2030 target for snakebite.
