Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease whose incidence has increased dramatically (>30-fold) in recent years, alongside the geographical expansion of Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue is currently one of the most important neglected tropical diseases, and its transmission is strongly influenced by rainfall, temperature, urbanization and distribution of the principal mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. Vector control strategies are being implemented to reduce the expansion of this disease, but still there is a great need for better therapeutics and preventive vaccines against dengue and other flaviviruses. Flaviviruses create complex virus-host and virus-vector interactions. The interactions between viral particles and protein components in the vector are not completely understood. In this work we characterize how two mosquito proteins, “AeSNAP” and “ATPase”, influence DENV viral dissemination within A. aegypti, using both in vitro and in vivo models. These results suggest that anti-vector measures that target specific mosquito molecules may represent promising alternatives to traditional countermeasures against dengue virus spread.
