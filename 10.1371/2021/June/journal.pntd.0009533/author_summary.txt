Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a protozoan parasite. It infects macrophage associated organs and invades the immune system. Currently, there is no vaccination against the disease and the conventional chemotherapeutic agents are ineffective due to the increased resistance and toxicity. In the present work, we utilized porous silicon nanoparticles as carriers for an anti-leishmanial drug (buparvaquone) to improve its therapeutic efficacy against visceral leishmaniasis (S1 Scheme). The nanoparticles were synthesized from an agricultural residue (barley husk), which is cheap and widely available. Due to the nano size of the nanoparticles, they internalized into the infected cells successfully. The efficacies of buparvaquone loaded in the nanoparticles were greatly improved in comparison with pure buparvaquone to evacuate the parasitic infection both in vitro and in vivo studies. Therefore, the biogenic silicon nanocarriers are promising candidates to be utilized as low-cost treatment regimen in leishmaniases therapy.
