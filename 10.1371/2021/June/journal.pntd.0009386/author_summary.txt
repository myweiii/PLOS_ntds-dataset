Scabies is an infestation of the skin caused by a mite. There is limited data on how common scabies is in sub-Saharan Africa, including Malawi. The DerMalawi project has been providing care for dermatological conditions in rural Malawi since 2015. Between 2015 and 2018 we observed an increase in patients with scabies attending for treatment. In response the project shifted from providing care at clinics to an approach using community-based outreach. Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted community-based activities on three occasions in an area of approximately 30,000 individuals. The DerMalawi team visited schools and villages to identify and treat cases of scabies and their contacts. We were able to examine about 50% of the population on each visit. Initially a large proportion of the population had scabies (15%) and this was similar during our second community survey. At our third survey this appeared to have decreased to 2% but it is difficult for us to know if this is because of treatment given in the previous rounds. Scabies is a major problem in rural populations in Malawi and public health strategies are needed to reduce the disease burden.
