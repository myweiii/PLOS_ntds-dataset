Measuring biting rates of bloodsucking arthropods has been proved to be a crucial tool in understanding transmission dynamics and evaluating control measures against vector-borne diseases. Blackflies of the S. damnosum sensu lato (s.l.) complex are the prime vectors of Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode and causative agent of human onchocerciasis (or river blindness) in Africa. Blackfly biting rates are typically measured by human attractant vector collectors who capture host-seeking female flies as they alight on their skin but before they take a blood meal. Apart from the ethical concerns raised by this method, estimates thus obtained do not reflect true exposure to vector bites. An understanding of whether there are people who receive more bites than others and who may be at higher risk of acquiring the infection is crucial to modelling control interventions. Therefore, in the present study we developed IgG- and IgM-based immunoassays to quantify antibody responses in human populations to salivary antigens of S. damnosum s.l. in onchocerciasis-endemic communities of Ghana. The proteome of S. damnosum s.l. salivary glands was also investigated to potentially identify salivary antigens that could be employed as exposure markers against this important vector group.
