In Mali, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and filariasis are co-endemic. We hypothesized that co-infection with helminth parasites may modulate the immune response to saliva of the CL vector Phlebotomus duboscqi (Pd). Hence, we investigated the effect of Pd salivary glands (SG) on human monocytes in subjects exposed or unexposed to sand fly bites in the context of a concomitant filaria infection. Monocytes of unexposed individuals selectively upregulated the production of IL-6 and CCL4 in response to SG from Pd or other vector species. In contrast, monocytes of individuals exposed to sand fly bites lost their responsiveness to SG, microfilariae antigen and LPS, irrespective of co-infection with filaria. Nevertheless, infection with filaria significantly upreguled the frequency of CCL22+monocytes, IL-10+mDCs and regulatory T cells. Together, our data suggest that repeated exposure to Pd saliva alters human monocyte function towards a tolerized phenotype while co-infection with filaria favors a Leishmania-promoting Th2/regulatory response.
