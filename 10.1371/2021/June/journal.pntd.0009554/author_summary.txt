Patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) inevitably results in liver fibrosis and hepatosplenomegaly. Currently, praziquantel is the drug of choice for these patients. Although praziquantel effectively kills the worm, it cannot prevent re-infection or resolve liver fibrosis. Moreover, resistance of praziquantel has been suggested in vivo and in vitro studies. Therefore, finding new and effective treatment options is urgently needed. Schisandrin B (Sch B) of Schisandra chinensis has been shown to protect against different liver injuries including fatty liver disease, hepatotoxicity, fibrosis, and hepatoma. In this study we have investigated the potential of using Sch B to treat S. mansoni-induced liver fibrosis.
