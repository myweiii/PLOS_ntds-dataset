Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) is a stigmatizing skin condition caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease results in permanent functional limitations in the absence of early medical intervention. The disabling BUD conditions, financial constraints and frequent hospital visits support the role of caregiving for affected individuals. Caregiver burden is poorly understood although the role and need for caregiving is widely recognised in BUD. This study identified a previously unrecognized burden on the caregivers of BUD patients in 3 endemic districts in Ghana. Specifically, we identified significant financial and psychological pressure on affected families in meeting healthcare related costs and physical care while also providing for their own and other family membersâ€™ needs. We also highlight the emotional burden experienced by caregivers, their reduced work productivity, the barriers caregivers face in accessing healthcare with BUD patients and the limited support available for caregivers. Our study highlights the serious social consequences of BUD in Ghana. Further quantitative research within different economic regions affected by BUD is warranted to better understand the caregiver burden of BUD.
