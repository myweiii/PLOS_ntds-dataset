Scabies is a very common skin condition that is caused by tiny mites that lay eggs in the skin. One of the first symptoms that are reported by persons who are infested with scabies is intense itching, especially at night. Typically a rash occurs which affects certain parts of the body, for instance between the fingers. Without treatment scabies could lead to secondary skin infections caused by bacteria due to persistent scratching. Outbreaks of scabies tend to occur in settings where people live in close quarters, such as nursing homes. In October 2018 there was an outbreak of scabies in a nursing home in the region of The Hague in the Netherlands. Of the 78 staff members and residents included in the investigation, ten persons had typical lesions or tested positive for scabies using PCR and/or microscopy on skin samples. For two persons who tested positive for scabies, PCR test was done on skin samples from bed linens. Testing of skin samples from bed linens is a technique not previously used for the diagnosis of scabies prior to the current investigation. This illustrates the potential of using this technique to help diagnose scabies during outbreaks.
