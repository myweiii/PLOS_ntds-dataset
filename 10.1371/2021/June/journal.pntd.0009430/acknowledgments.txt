We are very grateful to the medical students at the “Hôpital de l’Amitié” in Bangui, the Landja resident surveyors, the staff of the health center where our team was based, and the traditional authorities for their contribution to the smooth running of this study. We would also like to thank all the patients and their relatives who gave their time to participate in this study. Many thanks to the members of the NGO Fracarita who work in the village and thanks to whom the alert was launched.
