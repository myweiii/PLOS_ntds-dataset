Nodding Syndrome (NS) is a form of severe epilepsy that affects children in Africa. Thousands of children have been affected since its first description 60 years ago in East Africa, particularly Tanzania, South Sudan, and Uganda. Its evolution is marked by the appearance of many serious complications such as stunting, wasting, delayed sexual development, and psychiatric illness that can lead to death in some cases. Both the future of the affected children and the present of the adults in charge of them are hampered by an intolerable level of social and economic harm. Here, we describe new cases of NS that emerged in a context of extreme poverty in the Central African Republic (CAR). Because the area at risk of NS was partially investigated in this study, we urge to carry out a larger-scale study in order to assess the real burden of NS in CAR and draw the attention of public authorities.
