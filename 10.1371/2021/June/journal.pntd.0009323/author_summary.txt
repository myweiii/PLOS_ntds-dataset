Sleeping sickness (HAT) is a public health problem in 36 African countries. In Chad, 5 active foci are present in the Southern part. It is caused by trypanosomes, parasites causing disease in humans and livestock. Tsetse flies, the vectors of trypanosomes, declined in the Mandoul focus due to the impact of vector control coupled with active/passive screening and treatment campaigns. In the Maro focus, where such campaigns were absent during these surveys, HAT cases were reported recently. We carried out a study on circulating trypanosomes in humans, cattle and tsetse in these two foci. The results confirmed a reduction of the tsetse population and pathogenic trypanosomes of human and cattle in Mandoul. However, an unknown trypanosome was identified in a human and high frequency of T. theileri (known as non-pathogenic) was found in cattle. In contrast, in Maro, a high diversity of trypanosomes was observed, including T. b. gambiense and T. congolense in humans and several unknown trypanosomes in tsetse. These observations provide evidence of the circulating trypanosomes in the area that recommend widening the investigation to other mammalian hosts and mechanical vectors and considering and monitoring a possible zoonotic potential with the unknown trypanosome and T. congolense in humans.
