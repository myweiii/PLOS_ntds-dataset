Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most common form of acquired heart disease in Ethiopia across all age groups. Monthly benzathine penicillin G (BPG) injections remains the cornerstone of secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrent acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and progression to RHD, but data supporting the optimal dose and timing of BPG injections is a major knowledge gap for National RHD control programs, particularly amongst the highest risk groups. In this study we measured penicillin concentrations in Ethiopian patients receiving regular BPG injections. It demonstrates that that most Ethiopian patients receiving BPG as secondary prophylaxis to prevent RHD do not maintain target concentrations for more than two weeks during each 4-weekly injection cycle. This study highlights the limitation of the current BPG dosing recommendations and underpin global calls for improved penicillin formulations and better dosing and delivery strategies.
