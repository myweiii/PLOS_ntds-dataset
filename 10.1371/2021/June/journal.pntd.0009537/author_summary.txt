Viruses transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes represent a major public health concern. With the abundance of the mosquito and susceptible human population, the entry of new Aedes-transmitted viruses brings the risk of large epidemics. The first-ever chikungunya epidemic in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, happened in 2016. We used neighbourhood information on the environment, socioeconomic status, and weekly temperature, to study the disease spread within the city. Our results show that better socioeconomic status plays a major role in preventing the disease, with poorer areas being affected first and harder by the epidemic. This highlights that improving sanitary and socioeconomic conditions is essential for Aedes-borne diseases prevention and control. The temperature increased the risk of chikungunya cases, and this effect persisted for longer in areas where the epidemic was concentrated. This indicates that interventions should be designed to be long-lasting in such locations. Our results contribute to understanding better the dynamics of a first urban Aedes-borne disease epidemic in a tropical metropolitan city, with the potential to help design better interventions for disease prevention and control.
