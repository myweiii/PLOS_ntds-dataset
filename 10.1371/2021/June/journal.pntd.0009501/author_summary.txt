Shigellosis has a heavy disease burden in developing countries. The incidence of shigellosis is highest in children aged under 5 years. The transmission characteristics of shigellosis are unclear in different groups, such as age and occupation groups. In this study, we applied an age-specific mathematical model to analyze data on shigellosis built in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. The study found that: 1) Shigellosis transmission in children aged 5 years and under occurred among themselves, but was most commonly transmitted by adults aged 25–59 years; 2) The transmission interaction was greatest between children aged 5 years and under, and adults aged 25–59 years; 3) Infectivity was highest in children aged 5 years and under, and susceptibility was highest in adults aged 25–59 years.
