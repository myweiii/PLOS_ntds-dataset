To establish a life cycle between insect and mammalian hosts, the malaria parasite has evolved mechanisms to manage metal ions from the distinct microenvironments it encounters. Previous work has addressed how interference using metal chelation affects parasite development in human, primate, and rodent hosts. Similar studies in mosquito species that harbor Plasmodium have not been performed. Here, we address such micronutrient relationships in three steps. First, we characterized how the metallome fluctuates during development in two species of mosquito. Second, we asked whether susceptibility to Plasmodium infection correlated with a differential response in mosquito metal homeostasis. Third, we tested the effects of iron and copper chelation treatment of adult mosquitoes concerning propensity of infection and mosquito reproduction. Metal ions offer a promising target in the ongoing efforts to control the mosquito-borne disease.
