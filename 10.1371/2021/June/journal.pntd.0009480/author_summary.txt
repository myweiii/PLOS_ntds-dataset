Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease transmitted by hard ticks (Ixodidae: Ixodida) that has a 10–40% fatality. While more than 3 billion people are at risk acquiring the disease, on the order of 10,000–15,000 people are infected and over 500 people die every year from the disease. The main vector and reservoir of the CCHF virus are ticks of the genus Hyalomma. As the microbiota influences vector competence, its manipulation may be used for vector control. In this study, we characterize cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria from H. anatolicum ticks. Field collected samples were processed for aerobic culture and 16s rRNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The cultivable bacterium Bacillus subtilis was found in all samples analysed, including H. anatolicum males, females, larval guts and host skin. NGS revealed Francisella spp as the most common non-cultivable bacteria in H. anatolicum ticks. Bacterial OTUs varied between eggs and female guts, indicating that community structure varies by tick developmental stage. Our results indicate that B. subtilis is be a potential paratransgenesis candidate for vector control intervention. Integrated methods (bacteria culture, NGS) are recommended for more accurate characterization of microbial community and diversity.
