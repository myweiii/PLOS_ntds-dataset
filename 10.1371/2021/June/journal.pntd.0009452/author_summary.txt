Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral disease mainly transmitted by ticks. Effective prophylactics and therapeutics have not been established for this disease yet. While CCHF is endemic in Africa, information on the distribution and genetic diversity of CCHF virus (CCHFV) is quite limited in many Sub-Saharan African countries. In this study, we conducted serologic and molecular epidemiologic investigations for CCHFV infection in cattle and ticks in Zambia. Serologic screening revealed that 8.4% of cattle were tested positive for CCHFV-specific IgG. Hyalomma ticks infected with CCHFV were also identified by genetic screening. Phylogenetic analyses showed that one of the CCHFVs detected in Zambia was a genetic reassortant between African and Asian CCHFV strains. Currently, Zambia is considered CCHF-free country because CCHF cases have never been reported. However, the findings in this study indicate that CCHFV is maintained in Hyalomma ticks and occasionally transmitted to vertebrate hosts such as cattle in Zambia. Further epidemiologic studies and continuous monitoring of CCHFV infection should be implemented in the southern African region.
