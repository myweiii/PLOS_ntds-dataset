Human Q fever, zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, presents with diverse clinical manifestations, from self-limited febrile illnesses to endocarditis. It is usually diagnosed using serological tests. Because of the diagnostic challenge and nonspecific symptoms, it has been considered an underrecognized infectious disease, particularly in non-endemic or non-epidemic areas. In South Korea, Q fever was designated as a notifiable disease in 2006, and the number of Q fever cases has increased sharply since 2015. This study shows that Q fever is becoming an endemic disease in the midwestern area of South Korea. In this study, patients with acute Q fever primarily presented with mild illnesses such as hepatitis (64.5%) and isolated febrile illness (24.0%). However, patients with chronic Q fever presented with vascular infection (52.9%) and endocarditis (35.3%); such patients were likely to undergo surgery (41.2%) and had a high mortality rate (23.5%). We also surveyed physiciansâ€™ awareness regarding how to appropriately diagnose and manage Q fever. This survey showed that more than half of the physicians did not follow-up suspected patients with acute Q fever who had negative serological results at the early stage of illness using a serological test and that follow-ups for identifying chronic Q fever after primary C. burnetii infection were only performed by 24.0% of physicians.
