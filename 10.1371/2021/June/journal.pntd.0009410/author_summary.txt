Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptospires are transmitted to humans via contaminated urine, soil and water from carrier animals such as rodents. Human leptospirosis is mostly asymptomatic or a mild acute febrile illness, but some patients progress to Weilâ€™s disease, characterized by kidney failure, jaundice, and pulmonary hemorrhage, and some of them die. To understand pathogen-host interactions in the kidney, a major target of leptospirosis, the authors collected kidneys and blood samples from the acute to chronic phase using a subcutaneously infected hamster model to compare the renal distribution of Leptospira with histopathological findings and renal function. The results demonstrated that the increase in antibody titers in the acute phase affected the outcome in the natural course of acute leptospirosis, and that the distribution of leptospires in the kidney during the acute phase may affect the decline of renal function during the chronic phase. It is possible that leptospirosis is one of the causes of unexplained renal dysfunction in tropical and subtropical regions.
