Severe acute malnutrition is a global public health issue which greatly impacts childhood mortality rates. Although still not fully understood, the multi-factorial pathology of severe acute malnutrition has been associated, among other factors, with sub-optimal feeding practices (including dysfunctional breastfeeding) and an altered gut microbiota. The serendipitous detection of Listeria monocytogenes in the breast milk of Malian women has raised the possibility of its involvement in the pathogenesis of severe acute malnutrition. To investigate this possibility, the presence of L. monocytogenes was assessed in a cohort of lactating Senegalese women, both mothers of healthy children as well as those of severely malnourished children using culture-dependent and independent methods. Our study confirms the previously unsuspected presence of L. monocytogenes in the breast milk of Senegalese women, which is increased in the milk of mothers of severely malnourished children. Moreover, breast milk samples from the mothers of healthy children more frequently induced a potent inhibition of L. monocytogenes than those from the mothers of severely malnourished children. An inhibition was also achieved using potential probiotics, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species, isolated from breast milk. Our study reveals the previously unsuspected carriage of L. monocytogenes in the breast milk of West African women, which is associated with severe acute malnutrition. The inhibitory effect of human selected lactic acid bacterial species against L. monocytogenes might provide new therapeutic and inexpensive options to prevent and treat this neglected public health issue.
