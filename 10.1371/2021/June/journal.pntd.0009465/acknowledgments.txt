The Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional (Argentina) provided the daily weather data of its meteorological stations. Erin Mordecai kindly shared the posterior distributions of parameters to calculate R0. Adrian Baddeley and the Spatstat team provided improvements in the package functions to run the analyses. Thorsten Wiegand gave helpful advice on the spatial analyses. We thank Dan Haydon for a critical review of the manuscript. The current research was undertaken as part of an agreement (No. 4352/17) between the Ministry of Health of the City of Buenos Aires, the University of Comahue, and CONICET.
