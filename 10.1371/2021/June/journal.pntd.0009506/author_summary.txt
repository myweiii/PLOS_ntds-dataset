Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection, which frequently coexist with anemia and malnutrition, remains a major disease burden to preschool-age children (PSC) as they may bring negative impacts on children’s growth and development. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of STH infection in Nangapanda subdistrict in Indonesia and explored the association between STH infection with poor nutritional status and anemia among PSC. Poor nutritional status was classified into underweight, stunting, and wasting, while anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels below 11 gr/dL. We revealed that many PSC in this area suffered from STH infection (primarily by Ascaris lumbricoides), malnutrition, and anemia. We also discovered that younger PSC were more vulnerable to stunting and anemia, whereas current single and mild STH infection was independently associated with a lower risk of anemia. Although no evidence for negative impact of STH infection was found in this study, the high prevalence of STH infection, malnutrition, and anemia in the study population warrants urgent intervention in order to improve the children’s health and wellbeing. Further research is required to assess the quality and quantity of food intake, as well as to investigate socioeconomic and environmental factors contributing to the poor nutritional status.
