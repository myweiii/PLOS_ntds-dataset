Cystic and alveolar echinococcosis (CE and AE) are parasitic zoonoses that cause a substantial disease burden in Kyrgyzstan. The etiologic agents of these diseases are parasites in the genus Echinococcus. These parasites have complex life cycles which include mammalian definitive and intermediate hosts and a free-living egg stage in the environment. Consequently, environmental and climatic factors can affect the prevalence and geographical distribution of these diseases because such factors influence the parasitesâ€™ eggs survival and longevity, and can affect suitable habitats for the intermediate and definitive hosts. In this geographic correlation study, we assessed environmental and climatic determinants of the spatial distributions of CE and AE in Kyrgyzstan. We found that 10-year lag annual temperature plays an important role in AE distribution, whilst none of the variables assessed was found to significantly affect that of CE. Moreover, communities at risk where these diseases are potentially under- or misdiagnosed were identified. Our findings provide vital information for targeted, area-specific interventions in Kyrgyzstan, and add to the body of knowledge on the ecology of these neglected parasitic diseases that are emerging and reemerging in several regions in North America, Europe and Asia.
