Mayaro virus is an understudied alphavirus that is currently circulating in tropical environments in South and Central America without an approved vaccine. Recent outbreaks have suggested a broadening range and higher likelihood of urban outbreaks, increasing the public health risk. Mayaro virus is closely related to other arthritogenic alphaviruses with overlapping circulation such as chikungunya and Una viruses, both of which also lack clinically approved vaccines. Identification of a safe, easily manufactured, and effective strategy to vaccinate at risk populations is important to control outbreak potential. Here we report on a vaccination approach using a non-replicating adenovirus viral vector that encodes Mayaro virus structural proteins that assemble into non-infectious virus-like particles upon expression following vaccination. These particles stimulate strong immune responses against Mayaro virus. Upon testing against other alphaviruses, it was determined that the vaccine elicits cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against chikungunya and Una viruses, significantly diminishes disease severity, and protects immunocompromised, highly susceptible mice from death following viral challenge. Our study provides new approaches to protect against these co-circulating viruses using a single vaccine. This approach is highly amenable to other virus targets for vaccine development and its ability to provide protection against chikungunya virus has global ramifications.
