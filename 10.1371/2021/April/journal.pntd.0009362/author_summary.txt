Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes serious neurological disorders of central and peripheral nervous system, and fetal brain development disorders including microcephaly. There are still uncovered explorations for the underlying molecular mechanism of ZIKV-infected pathogenesis. This study reveals a series of dysregulation of neuropathic genes mRNA and protein expression in mouse and human astrocytes upon ZIKV infection. As an ideal ZIKV infection model in mouse primary astrocytes (MPAs), RNA-seq was performed to profile transcriptome alteration by ZIKV infection. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated the significant alterations of the 710 genes that were linked to glial cell differentiation and projection, neurogenesis and migration of neurons, myelination, as well as synaptic control. Among the top selected differentially expressed genes, such as PTBP1, LIF, GHR, PTBP3, EDNRB, and MBP, the mRNA and protein expressions were confirmed to identify the dysregulation of the transcriptome in MPAs upon ZIKV infection. Furthermore, ZIKV infection altered the mRNA and protein expression of these astrocytic genes involved in neurodevelopment in U251 cells following the analysis of the transcriptome. In conclusion, the alteration of astrocytic gene functions or associated-pathways suggest a novel clue of a mechanism involved in the ZIKV-induced neurodevelopment disorders.
