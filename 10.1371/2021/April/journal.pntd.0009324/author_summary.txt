The plague natural foci are widely distributed in the world, and correspondingly, the plague still poses a significant threat to human health in some countries with endemic plague foci. Streptomycin is used as the first-line treatment against plague in many countries for the antibiotic is considered to be one of the effective antibiotics, particularly for the treatment of pneumonic plague. The resistance to streptomycin had been reported in Y. pestis strains from Madagascar in previous studies. In this study, we reported the high-level resistance to streptomycin in a clinical isolate of Y. pestis from a pneumonic patient in Tibet Autonomous Region, China, and a novel mechanism of streptomycin resistance, i.e. mutation in the rpsL gene were identified. The knowledge acquired about streptomycin resistance in Y. pestis will remain of great practical value. For the emergence of resistance to streptomycin in Y. pestis would render the treatment failure, thus corresponding antibiotic monitoring should be routinely carried out in countries threatened by plague. In addition, based on our further understanding about streptomycin resistance of Y. pestis isolates, such monitoring should not only include plasmid-mediated resistance but also include the ribosomal protein S12 gene (rpsL) mutation in Y. pestis isolates.
