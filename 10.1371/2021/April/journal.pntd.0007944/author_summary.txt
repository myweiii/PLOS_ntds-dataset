Rabies is a deadly viral disease, that is transmitted mainly by dog bites. Globally at least 59,000 deaths are reported to occur annually- mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. However, rabies can be prevented through vaccination of pets (dogs and cats) and administration of rabies vaccine in humans exposed to rabies. In our study we reviewed secondary data of animal bites and rabies captured at the National Animal disease diagnostic epidemiology centre in Entebbe for the period 2013â€“2017. We found that of 1441 animal bite victims who never received rabies vaccine, only 156 (11%) died hence need for immediate administration of exposed humans with rabies and sensitization of the public about the consequences of animal bites and need for urgent health care. There was a decline in the reporting rate of animal bites during the study period suggesting that evaluation of the barriers to complete reporting may facilitate interventions to enhance surveillance quality. Less than 10% of the pets in the Uganda were vaccinated against rabies hence need for improved vaccination of pets against rabies through appropriated legislation.
