Strongyloidiasis affects about 600 million people worldwide, causing substantial morbidity. Large-scale programming to control strongyloidiasis is currently not implemented. We estimate that 161â€“284 million school-age children should be enrolled in deworming campaigns to substantially reduce the prevalence of strongyloidiasis. Our estimates might help endemic countries in estimating the ivermectin supply needed for the implementation of control programs for strongyloidiasis. As the availability of the drug at an affordable cost is a main issue, we hope that our estimates would encourage the production of generic ivermectin, showing the extent of the potential market.
