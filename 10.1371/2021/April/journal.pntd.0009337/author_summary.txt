DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV infections are the three major neglected tropical diseases continually posing threats to the public health and the socioeconomic development in recent decades. Given a high fraction of inapparent infections of these viruses, it is necessary to obtain informative knowledge of the seroepidemiology of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV worldwide, so as to estimate the true burden of these diseases and evaluate effects on vaccine efficacy and uptake. Given the fact that the reported infection rates may vary greatly due to the measurement, criteria of inclusion, and etc, a systematic review with meta-analysis is essential to collect and summarize the seroepidemiologic evidence of these arboviruses. In this study, the geographical distributions of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV and the proportions of their inapparent infections were analyzed, which revealed an overall high disease burden to the world, especially in specific regions. The epidemiological features of these arboviruses were also characterized via comparisons made in different countries/areas, populations, and time periods. In addition, evidence on the co-infection of DENV and CHIKV was assessed.
