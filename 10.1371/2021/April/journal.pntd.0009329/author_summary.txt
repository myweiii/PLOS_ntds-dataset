The current study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination. The study was conducted in two sites, urban areas in Telangana state, and in rural areas in Odisha state, India. We assessed resilience and quality of life with two questionnaires (the CD-RISC and WHOQOL-BREF) pre-and post-intervention. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted post-intervention. Data were collected at baseline, a few weeks after completion of the intervention, and in Odisha state again at six months after completion. Eighty participants across 20 families were included in the study (23 persons affected and 57 family members). We found a significant increase in resilience scores for persons affected and family members from Odisha state, this improvement was maintained at six-month follow-up. There was no increase in resilience scores post-intervention among participants from Telangana state. Quality of life scores were significantly higher at follow-up for persons affected in both states, and for family members in Odisha state. Participants especially appreciated the social dimensions of the intervention. This pilot study showed that the 10-week family-based intervention to strengthen resilience among persons affected by leprosy and their family members was feasible, and has the potential to improve resilience and quality of life.
