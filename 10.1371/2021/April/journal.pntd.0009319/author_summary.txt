Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite that colonized the urogenital mucosa and causes trichomoniasis, a neglected sexually transmitted infection associated with multiple adverse reproductive outcomes in humans. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The epithelial cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel conducting both Cl− and HCO3−, which participates in the regulation of luminal fluid microenvironment conducive to the success of reproductive events. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a bioactive molecule abundant in human seminal fluid, has been demonstrated to exhibit a robust pro-secretory action by activating CFTR in the female genital tract epithelial cells such as endometrial epithelium. These discoveries motivated the authors to investigate the effect of T. vaginalis infection on exogenous PGE2-induced transepithelial transport of electrolytes in vagina. Here, we found that in rat vaginal epithelium, luminal administration of PGE2 elicited a response of Cl− and HCO3− secretion mediated by cAMP-activated CFTR. However, T. vaginalis infection impaired transepithelial anion transport evoked by PGE2, which is probably related to the defective expression and function of CFTR. These outcomes may complement and expand our knowledge of the complex interaction between T. vaginalis and the infected host, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for disequilibrium in vaginal fluid microenvironment and infertility induced by T. vaginalis infection.
