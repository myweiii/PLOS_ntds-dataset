Paracoccidioides spp. complex and P. lutzii are etiological agents of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), one of the most important systemic mycosis of Latin America. This study aimed to describe the molecular epidemiology associated with clinical and serological data of Paracoccidiodes spp. in the Mato Grosso do Sul, located in the Midwest region, Brazil. Thus, for the first time in this state, the clinical Paracoccidioides species were molecularly identified. Previous findings have frequently been misinterpreted as proving that P. lutzii predominates in this region. In fact, we observed that this state differs from others in the Midwest, presenting a higher proportion of PCM cases due to P. brasiliensis sensu stricto (S1). In addition, we described the first report of P. restrepiensis (PS3) occurrence in the Brazilian Midwest region. Then, we presented an update on the occurrence of Paracoccidioides species in the Midwest region from Brazil. On the other hand, our results do not demonstrate clinical and epidemiological differences between Paracoccidioides spp. Nevertheless, this study reinforces that other researches should be carried out in order to evaluate an association of clinical manifestations and epidemiology with Paracoccidioides species.
