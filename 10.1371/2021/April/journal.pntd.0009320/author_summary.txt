Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic, neglected tropical disease. Interestingly, a high level of species specificity (both bacteria and host) plays a major role in the severity of disease presentation which can vary from asymptomatic to multi-organ failure. Pathogenic Leptospira colonize the kidneys of infected individuals and are shed in urine into the environment where they can survive until they are contracted by another host. This study looks at two strains of L. borgpetersenii, HB203 and JB197 which are genetically very similar, and identical by serotyping as serovar Hardjo, yet HB203 causes a chronic infection in the hamster while JB197 causes organ failure and mortality. To better characterize bacterial factors causing different disease outcomes, we examined the gene expression profile of these strains in the context of temperatures that would reflect natural Leptospira life cycles (environmentally similar 29°C and 37°C which is more indicative of host environment). We found vast differences in gene expression both between the strains and within strains between temperatures. Characterization of the transcriptome of L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strains JB197 and HB203 provides insights into factors that can determine acute versus chronic disease in the hamster model of infection. Additionally, these studies highlight strain to strain variability within the same species, and serovar, at different growth temperatures, which needs to be considered when serovars are selected and propagated for use as bacterin vaccines used to immunize domestic animal species.
