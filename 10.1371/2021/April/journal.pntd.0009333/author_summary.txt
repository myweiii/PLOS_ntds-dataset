In populations living in adverse conditions due to poverty, a wide variety of intestinal parasite infestations can be observed. These infestations are usually diagnosed by stool microscopy but can be easily overlooked if the procedures used are inaccurate or performed in a suboptimal way. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of intestinal parasite infestations in stunted and control children aged from 2 to 5 years living in two disadvantaged neighborhoods of Antananarivo Madagascar. We also assessed risk factors for infestations and the diagnostic performance of microscopic techniques and real-time PCR for the detection of parasites. Almost all individuals were found to be infested with at least one parasitic species. Children aged between 4 and 5 years and mothers with low educational levels were found to be associated with infestation. Similarly, children drinking untreated water were associated with G. intestinalis and E. histolytica infestation. This latter species was also associated with moderately stunted children. Children between 4 and 5 years old and with no cemented soil type were associated with T. trichiura infestation. The high prevalence of intestinal parasite infestations among the study participants requires the improvement of health education, environmental sanitation and quality of water sources.
