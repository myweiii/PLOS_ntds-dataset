Many snakebites in tropical lower and middle-income countries are treated at the community level by traditional healers whose services are often accessible, affordable and offer care within the realms of local tradition and culture. A drawback of traditional care, however, is the associated delay or non-presentation of patients in need of antivenom and medical management at hospitals. We conducted interviews with traditional healers in two separate areas of rural Ghana to chart the socio-cultural context, perceived problems, treatment approaches, health seeking behaviors, and possibilities for future collaboration in snakebite treatment and management between hospitals and traditional healers. Healers described a holistic treatment approach, addressing physiological, psychological, and spiritual complications of snakebite. Healers reported high success rates with therapies ranging from herbal medicine to minor surgical interventions. Major factors precluding hospital health seeking of patients were identified as costs, poor accessibility, lack of antivenom and insufficient pain control. Gaps in clinical management are modifiable factors that, if improved, are likely to increase clinical health seeking. Our findings emphasize that traditional healers can provide a critical link between snakebite patients and hospitals, making their involvement crucial to the rural expansion of snakebite research and emergency care.
