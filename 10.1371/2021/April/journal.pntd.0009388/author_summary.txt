Antenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is linked to a wide range of clinical presentations at birth, from asymptomatic cases to microcephaly, and other neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental abnormalities manifested in the early childhood. Stratification of these clinical phenotypes in newborns with suspected antenatal ZIKV exposure is challenging, but critical to improve early assessment of rehabilitative interventions. In this study, plasma lipidome profiling of 274 lipid species was performed in both normocephalic and microcephalic newborns with antenatal ZIKV exposure and compared to non-infected controls. Multiple lipid species were independent predictors of antenatal ZIKV exposure. More specifically, microcephaly was strongly associated with an oxidized free fatty acid and ZIKV exposed normocephalic newborns exhibited higher plasma concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine relative to controls. These findings emphasize the need for studies focused on the role of individual lipids in neuropathogenesis of ZIKV and raise the potential of plasma lipidome profiling for early diagnosis of newborns with suspected antenatal ZIKV exposure. To validate the predictive ability of this approach, prospective studies with a larger cohort of newborns are now required.
