Cystic echinococcosis is a neglected zoonosis induced by the development of parasitic cysts in intermediate hosts, including humans, mostly in the liver. The diagnosis of CE is based on imaging. As CE cysts may assume different aspects (stages), the range of differential diagnoses is broad, from harmless simple cysts to neoplasms. Serological assays for the detection of serum antibodies are applied when imaging is inconclusive, but their performance depend on a number of factors, among which cyst stage has been reported as important. If this was a robust finding, it would be absolutely required to interpret serological findings in the light of CE cyst staging. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis of the relation between cyst stage of hepatic CE and diagnostic sensitivity of serological tests confirmed that such relation is clear and consistent, and indicate the absolute need to consider cyst staging when evaluating serology results of patients with hepatic CE.
