    "Abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a localized infection controlled by CD4+ T cells that produce IFN-\u03b3 within lesions. Phagocytic cells recruited to lesions, such as monocytes, are then exposed to IFN-\u03b3 which triggers their ability to kill the intracellular parasites. Consistent with this, transcriptional analysis of patient lesions identified an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) signature. To determine whether localized L. braziliensis infection triggers a systemic immune response that may influence the disease, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the blood of L. braziliensis-infected patients and healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis identified an ISG signature as the dominant transcriptional response in the blood of patients. This ISG signature was associated with an increase in monocyte- and macrophage-specific marker genes in the blood and elevated serum levels IFN-\u03b3. A cytotoxicity signature, which is a dominant feature in the lesions, was also observed in the blood and correlated with an increased abundance of cytolytic cells. Thus, two transcriptional signatures present in lesions were found systemically, although with a substantially reduced number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Finally, we found that the number of DEGs and ISGs in leishmaniasis was similar to tuberculosis\u2013another localized infection\u2013but significantly less than observed in malaria. In contrast, the cytolytic signature and increased cytolytic cell abundance was not found in tuberculosis or malaria. Our results indicate that systemic signatures can reflect what is occurring in leishmanial lesions. Furthermore, the presence of an ISG signature in blood monocytes and macrophages suggests a mechanism to limit systemic spread of the parasite, as well as enhance parasite control by pre-activating cells prior to lesion entry."
