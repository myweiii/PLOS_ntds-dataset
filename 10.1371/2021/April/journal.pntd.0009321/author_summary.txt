Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan Leishmania braziliensis exhibits two dominant inflammatory responses in cutaneous lesions: Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated signaling, which promotes parasite control, and cytolysis mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T and NK cells, which promotes increased pathology. To determine if these responses were limited to cutaneous lesions, we performed RNA-seq on the blood of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients, and detected both transcriptional signatures in the peripheral blood. The presence of interferon stimulated genes, as well as circulating IFN-γ, suggests that protective immune responses are not limited to the lesion site, but are occurring systemically. This may be one mechanism to ensure optimal control of the parasites, both by limiting their systemic spread and by pre-activating cells to kill the parasites prior to entry into the lesions. The cytolytic transcriptional signature was uniquely detectable in the blood of L. braziliensis patients when compared to the blood of patients with tuberculosis (TB) or malaria, further emphasizing the importance of this pathway in cutaneous leishmaniasis. Taken together, these data suggest that this localized infection has a systemic component that may have an impact the development of the disease.
