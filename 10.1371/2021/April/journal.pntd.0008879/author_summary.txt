As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are facing dengue epidemics with the fear the two plagues might overburden their healthcare systems. On Reunion island, southwestern Indian ocean: dengue virus is circulating since 2004 under an endemo-epidemic pattern with yearly outbreaks peaking between March and May since 2015, whereas Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible of COVID-19, emerged in March 2020, imported from the Bahamas. COVID-19 and dengue are deemed two clinically similar entities, especially within the first two days from symptom onset. In this context, we conducted a cohort study between March 23 and May 10, 2020, within a SARS-CoV-2 testing center, aimed at identifying the factors discriminating both infections. Surprisingly, we found that non-severe dengue was more symptomatic than mild to moderate COVID-19. Indeed, we found body ache, headache and retro-orbital pain to be indicative of dengue, whereas contact with a COVID-19 positive case, anosmia, delayed presentation (>3 days post symptom onset) and absence of active smoking were indicative of COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for accurate diagnostic tools and not to jeopardize dengue control in areas wherever COVID-19 dengue co-epidemics have the potential to wrought havoc to the healthcare system.
