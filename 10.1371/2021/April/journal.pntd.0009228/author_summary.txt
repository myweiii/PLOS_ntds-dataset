Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a silent threat that repeatedly causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans who have been in close contact with livestock of endemic countries. The detection of CCHFV IgG antibodies in livestock can be a first indication whether the virus circulates in a given region and is thus a valuable diagnostic tool for determining the endemic status. Interestingly, earlier data from Mauritania showed a noticeable difference in IgG prevalence between sheep (18%) and cattle (67%). In contrast to sheep and cattle, current monitoring data on CCHFV IgG antibody presence in camels and goats in Mauritania is very limited. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive up-to-date overview of CCHFV seroprevalences in the four most important Mauritanian livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats and camels). It attempts to highlight the role of potential risk factors responsible for deviating prevalences. In addition, we developed a camel-specific IgG ELISA, which can be used in future CCHFV seroprevalence studies. Furthermore, findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the current epidemiological CCHFV situation in sub-Saharan Africa and which role different livestock species play regarding the viral circulation in endemic regions.
