SARS-CoV-2 has dramatically impacted Amerindian native communities across South America, particularly in the Amazonian basin. In order to unveil the introduction and initial spread of this pandemic virus into this region, we conducted a genomic epidemiology study where we sequenced 59 genomes from cases in the Amazonas department of Colombia. Our results showed two independent introductions of the virus into the department, one of these associated with asymptomatic cases. This represents the first genomic epidemiology study focused on the Colombian Amazonas department where a great amount of native Amerindian indigenous communities inhabits. Our results provide insights of the transmission dynamic in this region and reported relevant information to pursue strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus in the Amazon population which currently are facing new risks due to the circulating new variant of concern P.1.
