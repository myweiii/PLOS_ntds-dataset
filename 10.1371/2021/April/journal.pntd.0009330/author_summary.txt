Scabies is a skin infestation caused by a mite. It leads to disabling itching and sometimes serious bacterial infections. Scabies is endemic in tribal communities. Skin creams and lotions are available to treat scabies but patients may not apply them thoroughly. We conducted a controlled trial in 12 villages to test if an oral medicine called Ivermectin can reduce scabies in a tribal community in central India. In six randomly selected villages (control arm), trained community health workers (CHWs) screened for scabies, physician confirmed the diagnosis and referred patients to the nearest clinic for treatment with skin creams. In the remaining six villages (intervention arm) the patients of scabies and their contacts were provided supervised treatment with oral ivermectin by the CHWs after the diagnosis. Number of scabies cases were evaluated at two and twelve months after these treatments. The risk of scabies was reduced by 79% and 51% at the end of two and twelve months in villages where oral Ivermectin was used compared to villages where patients were referred to receive skin creams. Adverse reactions due to Ivermectin were mild. Screening of individuals and treating scabies with oral Ivermectin by CHWs can be a useful method to reduce scabies in tribal communities.
