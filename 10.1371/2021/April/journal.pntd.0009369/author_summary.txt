Today, infections with intestinal (roundworms, whipworm and hookworms) and blood-dwelling worms (schistosomes) are traditionally diagnosed by demonstrating worm eggs in stool. This current practice comes with some important challenges, including but not limited to the low-throughput and the need of skilled operators. Especially in the context of monitoring and evaluation, there is a need for alternative tools. Therefore, one of the recommendations of the scientific community was to develop tests that are based on the detection of antibodies in blood, which reflect the natural immune response of the host to worm-specific components or antigens. In the present study, we screened the antigenicity of all the peptides that build up the proteome of intestinal and blood-dwelling worms. For intestinal worms, our results revealed that the antibody response to these peptides was either not unique for the worm species or absent in infected subjects. For blood-dwelling worms, the findings were less sobering, with a number of peptides inducing an antibody response that was only observed in infected subjects.
