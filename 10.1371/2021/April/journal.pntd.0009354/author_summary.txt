Ivermectin is a drug used worldwide for various indications: onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, strongyloidiasis, human sarcoptic scabies, acarodermatitis and rosacea. In the early 1990s, it was discovered that ivermectin could induce severe encephalopathies in some patients with high parasite loads of Loa loa, a filarial nematode. This objective of this pharmacovigilance study is to summarize serious neurological and non-neurological post-ivermectin adverse drug reactions reported in the World Health Organization database called VigiBase. This study shows that reported serious adverse drug reactions associated with ivermectin are fairly consistent with those mentioned in the official product information of ivermectin but also provides some new signals. Serious post-ivermectin encephalopathies can also occur outside of Loa loa endemic regions but the understanding of the mechanism by which it occurs requires further studies. A new signal concerning two serious toxidermias (DRESS syndrome and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) is also described. A lack of reporting of adverse drug reactions is noticeable in some Sub-Saharan African countries, and actions are needed to increase the reporting rates of these adverse effects in these countries.
