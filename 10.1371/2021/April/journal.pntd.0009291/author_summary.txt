Limited access to diagnosis is a critical determinant of the “neglect” that defines the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) including cutaneous leishmaniasis. Diagnostic tests that can be performed close to and involve the participation of the affected communities would improve access to treatment as well as diagnosis. Using non-invasive swab and filter paper samples obtained by Community Health Workers, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of an innovative and technically simple molecular test: Isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) to detect Leishmania DNA, coupled with a lateral flow (LF) strip to read the results with the naked eye. The RPA-LF test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and capacity to rule in or rule out a diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis in both an endemic field setting and reference laboratory. The findings encourage the further optimization of the test format for Point-of-Care diagnosis by health personnel and rural health workers in endemic settings.
