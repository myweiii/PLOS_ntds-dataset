Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of spores of the fungus Histoplasma spp. It occurs in specific endemic areas, such as areas of USA, Africa and Latin America. However, the real burden of histoplasmosis remains unknown in many endemic regions. Clinically, histoplasmosis is frequently misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. The current study was carried out to explore the frequency and characteristics of Histoplasma infection in a series of autopsies conducted in the Brazilian Amazon. We found evidence of Histoplasma infection in one-third of the deceased patients. A significant proportion of the cases were disseminated infections, with extensive involvement and severe damage of most organs. All these disseminated infections occurred in HIV-positive patients. Strikingly, histoplasmosis was clinically missed in more than two-thirds of these patients and had an extremely high mortality. In conclusion, the high frequency and mortality of histoplasmosis, together with the frequent misdiagnosis of the disease, highlight the need of implementation of sensitive screening methods for Histoplasma in HIV patients in endemic areas. Additionally, antifungal prophylaxis against Histoplasma should be encouraged in the severely immunocompromised HIV patients in these areas.
