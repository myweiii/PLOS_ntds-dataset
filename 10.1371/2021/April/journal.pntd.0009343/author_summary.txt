Trachoma, a chronic conjunctivitis caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. To eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, countries must achieve trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF) prevalence <5% in children ages 1–9 years in each endemic district, as measured by two surveys conducted after cessation of mass drug/antibiotic administration (MDA). An impact survey in Kongwa District 6 months post-MDA found TF <5%. We conducted another survey 2 years post-MDA in the same villages as the impact survey using multiple tools: assessment of TF (including via photographs of the upper tarsal conjunctiva), infection with C. trachomatis, and seropositivity to chlamydial antigen pgp3. We found a TF prevalence of 7.1%, and 21.5% of TF-positive children tested positive for infection (p = <0.0001). Review of photographic images showed good agreement with field grading. Seropositivity was 18.2% and increased with age (p = <0.0001). The youngest children—who were born after the last round of MDA and in theory should not have had much exposure to infection—had a seropositivity of 6.7%, indicating community transmission during the 2 years post-MDA. All tools pointed to re-emergence of trachoma and supported the feasibility of using targeted serologic markers as a robust surveillance tool.
