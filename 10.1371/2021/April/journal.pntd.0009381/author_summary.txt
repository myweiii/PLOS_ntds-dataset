Most traditional viral research methods are limited to screening for a few types of viruses with low throughput. Here, we relied on metagenomic sequencing, which is a broadly non-specific screen for any virus, for monitoring of mosquito-borne viruses in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region of China in 2019. The baseline of viral abundance and diversity in local Culex pipiens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Anopheles sinensis, and Aedes mosquitoes were investigated, with 116 viral species identified in 31 viral families, including Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Phasmaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and some unclassified viruses. This study provides a baseline survey of the viromes of mosquitoes in the study area, highlighting the necessity of strengthened monitoring of mosquito-borne pathogens.
