Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is one of the most severe zoonotic viral disease that occurs in humans. It is therefore necessary to provide public health stakeholders, research funding agencies and healthcare workers with accurate data on the burden of this disease in order to guide decision-making priorities. Our study is the first systematic review with meta-analysis to provide global data on CCHFV CFR in humans, CCHFV prevalence and seroprevalence in humans, ticks and other animal species. This review is also the first to maps CCHFV CRF, prevalence, and seroprevalence in humans, ticks and other animal species according to the country income level, geographic region, various human categories, and extensive tick and animal species. Broadly, the study showed elevated CFR in low-income countries, WHO regions of Africa, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean, and adult and outpatient patients. In addition, the prevalence and seroprevalence of CCHFV were higher in CCHFV suspected cases, healthcare workers, adults and hospitalized patients, ticks of the genus Ornithodoros and Amblyomma, and animals of the orders Perissodactyla and Bucerotiformes. Finally, our findings show that more attention needs to be paid to low-income countries particularly in WHO regions of Africa, South-East Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean in order to prevent human deaths due to CCHFV. In particular low-income countries and adults should benefit from emergency measures aimed at improving the management of patients with CCHF and reducing exposure of humans and animals to ticks. This meta-analysis further shows that apart from the monitoring and control of CCHFV in humans, a special attention should also be given to role played by non-Hyalomma tick species and other animal species, both domestic and wild.
