Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and characterised by fever and arthralgia. Although it is generally considered a short self-limiting infection, long term sequelae and severe disease are increasingly recognised. In 2018/19, Eastern Sudan experienced the largest epidemic of Chikungunya in Africa to date, affecting approximately 500,000 people. We undertook a prospective hospital-based cohort study of patients presenting with undifferentiated febrile illness in Kassala city, Sudan, supported by next-generation sequencing. We confirmed that CHIKV was the dominant pathogen, with positive CHIKV RT-PCR in 85% of patients presenting during the 7-day study period. Dengue virus was also circulating with nine CHIKV RT-PCR-positive patients co-infected, and we identified high rates of Plasmodium falciparum infection and CHIKV/P.falciparum co-infection. Genetic sequencing confirmed Indian Ocean Lineage of the East/Central/South African CHIKV genotype. A quarter of participants available for follow-up (16/60, 26.6%) reported being admitted to hospital including two children with haemorrhage, reflecting the severe phenotype linked to this genotype. Increased understanding of the health and economic burden of Chikungunya is needed, and recognition that severe and occasionally fatal infection exists. With widespread presence of Ae. aegypti and household water storage practices that encourage mosquito breeding, timely actions will be essential to prevent further large outbreaks.
