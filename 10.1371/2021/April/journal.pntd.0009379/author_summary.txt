Intestinal parasitic infections are distributed virtually with high prevalence rates in many regions, especially in low and middle income countries which intimately linked to age group, poverty and inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene. It is now a dayâ€™s one of the neglected tropical disease. We had searched different individual studies on intestinal parasitic infections to generate the pooled effect and recommend for the concerned body. We head included 30 different articles with a sample size of 14,445 and we have found a pooled prevalence of 46.09%. This finding indicates the prevalence of parasitic infection was almost near to half. Therefore every concerned body should give emphasize to prevent and control parasitic infection infestation.
