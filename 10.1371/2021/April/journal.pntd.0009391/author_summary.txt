Worldwide invasion and expansion of Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, has become a serious concern in global public health. With the large use of insecticides, especially the most commonly used pyrethroid insecticides, the emergence and development of resistance in Aedes albopictus present vector control challenges. However, it is not clear whether the resistance would affect the fitness cost and vector competence of Aedes albopictus. In this study, a laboratory resistant strain of Aedes albopictus was established by selecting the susceptible strain of Aedes albopictus with deltamethrin. Comparing the resistant strain with the susceptible strain, we found that deltamethrin resistance increased the fitness cost and reduced the vector competence of DENV-2 in Aedes albopictus. These latest findings shared the light for dengue disease prevention and vector control strategies.
