After the termination of the first documented outbreak of chikungunya in the Caribbean in 2014, the seroprevalence rate of CHIKV infection in French West Indies was estimated at 61% [95% CI 56.0â€“65.8] in a population-matched cohort of HIV-infected patients. This high seroprevalence may explain the abrupt and persistent cessation CHIKV circulation in these territories. One third of participants had not developed clinical symptoms of chikungunya.
