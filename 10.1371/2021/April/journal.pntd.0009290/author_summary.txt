Since its introduction into Brazil in 2014, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has presented sustained transmission, although much is unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states. Here, using a combined strategy of a mobile sequencing mission through this region, with genomic and epidemiological analysis we generated 24 novel partial and near complete CHIKV genome sequences by means of portable nanopore sequencing of chikungunya virus isolates obtained directly from clinical samples. Our findings reinforce that continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to assist in the monitoring and understanding of arbovirus epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.
