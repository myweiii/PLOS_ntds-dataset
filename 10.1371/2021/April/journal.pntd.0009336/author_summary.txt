Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos but can also be transmitted sexually or vertically from mother-to-child. The same mosquitoes transmit dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which cause similar clinical syndromes. The ZIKV epidemics in the Pacific and the Americas that occurred between 2015 and 2017 were linked to congenital abnormalities, most prominently microcephaly, in newborns. Because most infections are asymptomatic, diagnosis via indirect serological assays is an important strategy. On the other hand, many serological assays are affected by cross-reactivity resulting from prior infections by closely related viruses, such as DENV. This study evaluated three commercially available and widely used immunoassays that detect IgG, IgM or IgA and M (IgAM) antibodies to ZIKV. Our results suggest that the IgAM test performs best by detecting around 90% of RT-PCR confirmed infections. We also detected additional infections that were not detected by RT-PCR. The strength of this study is that it was carried out in two different countries of the American region where several arboviruses are endemic and that sequential blood samples from individual patients were available to evaluate the performance of the tests over time.
