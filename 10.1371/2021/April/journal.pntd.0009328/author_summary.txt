Children living in areas endemic to schistosomiasis typically do not present signs of acute illness during infection. It is believed that fetal exposure from a pregnant mother with infection primes the offspring and influences the child’s susceptibility and immune response to infection. Praziquantel treatment for Schistosoma japonicum infection in pregnant women has been demonstrated to be safe and effective, but the long-term impact on the child’s immunity is not fully understood. This study enrolled 295 children at age six, who were born to mothers who participated in a randomized controlled trial of praziquantel vs placebo for S. japonicum infection during pregnancy. The children were assessed and treated for S. japonicum infection and blood was collected to measure immune response markers. We found that praziquantel treatment during pregnancy did not impact the prevalence or intensity of naturally acquired S. japonicum infection among children at age six. Among the 37 children with S. japonicum infection, immune response markers did not differ by maternal treatment group. This evidence further supports the safe use of praziquantel for pregnant women.
