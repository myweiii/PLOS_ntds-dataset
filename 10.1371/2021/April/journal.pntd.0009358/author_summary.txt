Vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis are transmitted by insect vectors. Transmission can be interrupted through vector control. Chemical insecticides are the mainstay for controlling these insect vectors. However, the use of chemicals also introduces risks to health and the environment and may lead to insecticide resistance. Hence, proper management of those insecticides is critical. To find out how the insecticides used for vector control are being managed, the authors conducted investigations in six countries in Asia and the Middle East. They found that the practices of insecticide procurement, application, storage, and disposal depended on how a program is organized. Dengue programs were operated in a decentralized manner and, consequently, lacked coordination through guidelines and standards on best practices. Also, coordination between malaria, visceral leishmaniasis and dengue programs within countries was minimal, and expertise needed to guide decisions on vector control and to monitor insecticide resistance was in short supply. The identified shortcomings in how vector control insecticides are managed likely affected the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of vector control operations.
