Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. One of the most effective ways to reduce transmission of these viruses is to control Ae. aegypti populations. However, these mosquitoes continue to develop resistance to conventional insecticides. Therefore, alternative methods to control mosquitoes are urgently needed. Most mosquitoes require a bloodmeal greater than their body weight in order to produce eggs. The nutrient-rich blood also contains a large amount of iron, which in such large quantities could be toxic. This implies that the regulation of iron homeostasis is critical to mosquito fitness, and suggests that the mechanisms for how mosquitoes achieve this balancing act with regards to iron may lead to novel mosquito control approaches. Here, we performed a screen to identify transporters potentially involved in mosquito iron homeostasis. After identifying differentially expressed genes via RNAseq and validating a subset in cell culture assays, gene silencing experiments in whole mosquitoes revealed a gene whose reduction resulted in a change in ferritin gene expression and a drastic reduction of egg numbers and hatch rate. Further investigation of this gene may lead to novel mosquito control approaches.
