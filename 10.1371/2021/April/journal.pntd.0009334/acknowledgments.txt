Illumina sequencing was performed at Genomics Sequencing Center at the Virginia Biocomplexity Institute. Portions of this research were conducted with high performance research computing resources provided by Texas A&M University (https://hprc.tamu.edu). We would like to thank Dr. Lan Zhou and Ms. Xiaomeng Yan in the department of statistics at Texas A&M university for their help on statistical analysis for dual-luciferase assay data.
