Taenia solium is a parasite that can infect human brain causing neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of adult-onset epilepsy in the developing world. This infection elicits several cellular and molecular changes as a result of inflammation or parasite-host interaction, which can cause clinical symptoms, such as seizures. Most of these changes have been found in the tissue surrounding to the cysticercus, however, some pathologies, like hippocampal atrophy, which occurs in parts of the brain far from the cyst, are emerging as new complication in NCC patients. Using a rat model, the authors assessed the expression of genes related to different molecular pathways involved in the inflammatory response and healing by the RT-PCR array technique. They found increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and scar tissue formation in tissue surrounding the cyst, as well as tissue far from the cyst, when compared to non-infected brain tissue. This study provides new insights into the inflammatory changes that occur in brain tissue far from viable cysts and may provide evidence for the emerging association between NCC and hippocampal atrophy.
