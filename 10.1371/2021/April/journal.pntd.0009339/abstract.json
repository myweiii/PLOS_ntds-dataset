    "Background": "Scrub typhus is a neglected tropical disease that threatens more than one billion people. If antibiotic therapy is delayed, often due to mis- or late diagnosis, the case fatality rate can increase considerably. Scrub typhus is caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium, Orientia tsutsugamushi, which invades phagocytes and endothelial cells in vivo and diverse tissue culture cell types in vitro. The ability of O. tsutsugamushi to replicate in the cytoplasm indicates that it has evolved to counter eukaryotic host cell immune defense mechanisms. The transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, is a tightly regulated initiator of proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Typically, the inhibitory proteins p105 and I\u03baB\u03b1 sequester the NF-\u03baB p50:p65 heterodimer in the cytoplasm. Canonical activation of NF-\u03baB via TNF\u03b1 involves IKK\u03b2-mediated serine phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p105, which leads to their degradation and enables NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. A portion of p105 is also processed into p50. O. tsutsugamushi impairs NF-\u03baB translocation into the nucleus, but how it does so is incompletely defined.",
    "Principal findings": "Western blot, densitometry, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of O. tsutsugamushi infected host cells were used to determine if the pathogen\u2019s ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB is linked to modulation of p105. Results demonstrate that p105 levels are elevated several-fold in O. tsutsugamushi infected HeLa and RF/6A cells with only a nominal increase in p50. The O. tsutsugamushi-stimulated increase in p105 is bacterial dose- and protein synthesis-dependent, but does not occur at the level of host cell transcription. While TNF\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of p105 serine 932 proceeds unhindered in infected cells, p105 levels remain elevated and NF-\u03baB p65 is retained in the cytoplasm.",
    "Conclusions": "O. tsutsugamushi specifically stabilizes p105 to inhibit the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, which advances understanding of how it counters host immunity to establish infection."
