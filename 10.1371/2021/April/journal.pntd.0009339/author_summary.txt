Scrub typhus is a neglected disease that can be fatal and occurs predominantly in the Asia-Pacific, one of the most densely populated regions of the world. Notably, cases continue to emerge outside this area. The etiologic agent is Orientia tsutsugamushi, a bacterial pathogen that infects certain leukocytes and cells that line blood vessels in animals and humans. The success of O. tsutsugamushi to colonize these cells is at least partially attributable to its ability to counter host immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that O. tsutsugamushi stabilizes p105, a mammalian inhibitor of the transcription factor, NF-κB, which is otherwise key for activating proinflammatory and antimicrobial gene expression. O. tsutsugamushi is the first example of a bacterium that inhibits NF-κB by promoting elevated levels of p105 and impairing its degradation. Our findings provide fundamental information that helps explain how this important pathogen has evolved to stealthily establish infection in host cells.
