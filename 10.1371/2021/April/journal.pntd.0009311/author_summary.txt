Mosquitoes serve as vectors for the transmission of infectious diseases. Some of the most important mosquito-borne arboviruses belong to the genus Flavivirus, which can induce severe disease in humans and livestock. Surveillance of vector populations provide information on circulating arboviruses and may help to identify local outbreaks. Here we sampled mosquitoes over three wet seasons in the densely populated, semi-tropical Zambezi region of north-eastern Namibia and tested them for infections with flaviviruses. We observed simultaneous circulation of two different West Nile virus clades in the main vector species Cx. univittatus. Humans infected with West Nile virus can develop flu-like symptoms or in rare cases meningoencephalitis. Further, we detected Bagaza virus in Cx. univittatus from another locality and season. Bagaza virus infects birds leading to high mortality rates and may also infect humans. Our data suggest that both viruses are endemic in the Zambezi region and may affect human health and well-being in Namibia.
