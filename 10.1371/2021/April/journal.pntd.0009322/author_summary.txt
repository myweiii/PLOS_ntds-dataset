Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease. Among the trypanosomes known to affect humans, this is the only one with an obligatory intracellular multiplication stage in the mammalian host called amastigote. In this work, we describe for the first time the function and location of Trypanosoma cruzi proteins Prohibitin 1 and 2. Prohibitins are highly conserved proteins that belong to the Stomatin-Prohibitin-Flotillin-HflC/K (SPFH) protein superfamily and share a SPFH domain. PHBs are ubiquitous and play important roles in many cellular processes. Although they are mainly located in yeast mitochondria, nematodes and humans, PHBs could also be present in the nucleus and in cytosolic membranes. The localization of T. cruzi PHBs is stage-specific, showing a cytoplasmic membrane distribution in the human infective trypomastigote stages and in the amastigote forms. In the epimastigote form, PHBs bind Fe3+ ions, exerting a protective effect against oxidative stress. While the overexpression of PHB1 and PHB2 showed no significant differences in the parasiteâ€™s infectivity, it caused an increase in the intracellular multiplication of the amastigote form. The deletion of the PHB2 gene had a lethal effect on the parasite, whereas PHB1 partial silencing caused a significant decrease in ROS detoxification. Together, these results indicate that PHBs could participate in metacyclogenesis in ROS detoxification and could play a role in the replication of the intracellular stage of T. cruzi. Besides, our results suggest the potential role of PHB2 as a target for drug therapy.
