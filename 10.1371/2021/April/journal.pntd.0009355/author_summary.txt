Based on sporadic case reports, Rickettsia felis is believed to cause mild infection in humans. However, the true threat of the infection might be underestimated since the laboratory diagnoses of the pathogen were not routinely performed. We conducted a retrospective seroepidemiological survey among patients with clinical symptoms compatible with rickettsioses but negative for scrub typhus, Q fever, and murine typhus at a medical center in Taipei. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to detect antibodies against R. felis, Rickettsia japonica, and Rickettsia typhi. We found that 23 out of 122 (19%, 23/122) such patients were positive for at least one species of rickettsiae, including 4 patients with active R. felis infection. One of these four patients died after stopping the antibiotic treatment after tested negative for scrub typhus, Q fever, and murine typhus. Our results showed that R. felis infection is a neglected disease in Taiwan and could be potentially life-threatening.
