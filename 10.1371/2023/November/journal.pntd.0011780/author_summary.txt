Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a skin rash which appears months or years after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani. It is not life-threatening, and since patients with PKDL are otherwise well and may self-heal, they rarely seek treatment. Sandflies (the parasite vector) become infected with L. donovani after feeding on patients with PKDL, and so, from a public health perspective, ideally all patients, regardless of severity, would be treated to control VL, even those with mild disease. However, current therapies are toxic and/or require long hospitalization. Therefore, treatment is recommended only for patients with persistent disease or severe PKDL. We conducted a phase II trial in 110 patients with PKDL to assess two antimony-free combination therapies and demonstrated that a paromomycin/miltefosine regimen was suitably safe and highly efficacious even for moderate and severe PKDL, and could be administered at primary health centres. This makes it more patient-friendly, which is important since most people with PKDL are children. A liposomal amphotericin B/miltefosine regimen is a good alternative for implementation in hospitals for a shorter period. To support VL elimination in East Africa, new, safe, oral therapies for all patients with PKDL are still needed, including mild cases and women of reproductive potential unwilling or unable to use contraception.
