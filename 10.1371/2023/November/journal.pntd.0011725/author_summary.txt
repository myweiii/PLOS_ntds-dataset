Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite causing Chagas disease in humans. Epimastigote forms of the parasite must cope with different challenges, including redox imbalance and nutrient availability. Epimastigotes proliferate inside the insect vector in the presence of heme, a byproduct of blood digestion. This can upregulate the expression of genes related to glycolysis and aerobic fermentation in these parasites. This work shows that heme-cultured epimastigotes enhanced D-glucose consumption, with elevated succinate production and secretion into the culture medium leading to pH acidification, that was blocked by glycolysis inhibitor. Heme increased the maximum oxygen consumption rates, however, the oxygen consumption rate immediately decreased after D-glucose addition in a Crabtree-like effect. Interrupting the glycolytic pathway does not result in the increase promoted by heme. Therefore, the growth signaled by heme depends on D-glucose.
