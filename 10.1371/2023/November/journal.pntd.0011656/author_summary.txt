Bangladesh was in 2003 one of the world’s countries that was most affected by soil-transmitted helminthiasis, an infection of parasitic intestinal worms, with prevalence estimates as high as 55%. Following recommendations put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO), Bangladesh initiated a national deworming program based on school mass drug administration at six-month intervals, which started in 2008. Data collected between 2017 and 2020 showed that this program has lead to a striking decrease in prevalence, which was now between 10.5% and 1% depending on the species. Entering a close to elimination setting, the disease’s control strategy can be refined according to local endemicity to reduce overtreatment. To inform such a shift, we predict the prevalence across Bangladesh at high spatial resolution and highlight zones of different endemicity. We also show the potential reduction of overtreatment and financial resources that could be achieved by treating according to WHO recommendations at the predicted endemicity levels.
