Human brucellosis continues to be a great threat to human health in China. It was reported that human brucellosis incidence in China was 4.95/100,000 in 2021, surging from 16th place in 2000 to 5th place in 2021. The present study was designed to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of human brucellosis in China from 2004 to 2019, to analyze the socioeconomic factors, meteorological factors, and seasonal effect affecting human brucellosis incidence in different geographical regions. The clear seasonal increase of reported human brucellosis cases between March and July, the spatial clustering situation and the spread of epidemic area from northern to the southern coast and southwestern regions were identified. The inventory of cattle and sheep, beef yield, mutton yield, wool yield, milk yield, gross pastoral product, average air temperature (the same month, 2-month lagged and 3-month lagged), average relative humidity (the same month) and season variability played a significant role in the progression of human brucellosis. Spatial panel model was found to have good applicability and interpretability. As each factor plays a different role in different geographical regions, a comprehensive surveillance system for human brucellosis should be established in conjunction with the relevant risk factors to provide early warning of human and animal epidemics.
