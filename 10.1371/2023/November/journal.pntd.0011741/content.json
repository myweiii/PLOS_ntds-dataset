    "Introduction": "Aedes aegypti is the vector of viruses that have devastating impacts on public health and insecticide control of adult mosquitoes is most commonly carried out using pyrethroids. A. aegypti is the vector of viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika [1\u20135]. To reduce the burden caused by these diseases, control of adult mosquitoes is mainly done using a class of insecticides known as pyrethroids, with deltamethrin being a common pyrethroid applied for control of A. aegypti in the field. Pyrethroid toxicity occurs due to the binding and disruption of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC).\nResistance to pyrethroids in mosquitoes is commonly due to mutations in the Vgsc gene (mutations that cause pyrethroid resistance are known as knockdown resistance or kdr). There are 10 kdr alleles in A. aegypti based on the sequencing of either full-length cDNA or PCR products of domains I, II or III of the Vgsc gene (S1 Table) [6\u201315]. The most common kdr alleles found in the Americas are 410L+1016I+1534C, and 1534C [6,8,15,16] (amino acid numbering based on Musca domestica VGSC, GenBank: CAA65448.1). The 1534C allele confers 7- to 16-fold resistance to pyrethroids [17]. The 410L+1016I+1534C allele confers similar levels of resistance (compared to 1534C), except that the 410L+1016I+1534C allele gives higher levels of resistance to deltamethrin and flumethrin [18].\nRelative to insecticide susceptible alleles, resistance alleles commonly have a fitness cost in the absence of insecticide exposure [19]. However, field populations often include multiple resistance alleles. Thus, the fitness of the different resistance alleles to each other (in both the presence and absence of insecticide) is important to understanding the evolution of resistance. For example, in Musca domestica the relative fitness in the presence of pyrethroids of the different kdr alleles is super-kdr (M918T+L1014F) > kdr (L1014F) > kdr-his (L1014H), but in the absence of insecticide the relative fitness is susceptible > kdr-his > kdr > super-kdr [20], suggesting that alleles with multiple mutations might have a greater fitness cost than those with a single mutation. In A. aegypti, the relative fitness costs of different kdr alleles (to other kdr alleles) is much less studied. This is problematic because many resistance alleles coexist in field populations, and some potentially impose more detrimental disadvantages relative to other resistance alleles in the absence of insecticide exposure. Therefore, it is valuable to understand not only the relative fitness of kdr alleles relative to the susceptible alleles, but also to understand the relative fitness of the different kdr alleles to each other. Such information is needed to better understand the patterns of alleles found in field populations.\nIn this study, we investigated the relative fitness of two A. aegypti kdr alleles (410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C) relative to each other, in the absence and presence of insecticide exposure. We wanted to assess whether a resistance allele with multiple mutations imposed greater fitness costs relative to the allele with only one mutation (in accordance with what was previously found in M. domestica). Overall, the 410L+1016I+1534C allele imposes both an astonishing fitness cost in the absence of insecticide, and a strong advantage relative to 1534C in the presence of deltamethrin exposure.",
    "Materials and methods": "Mosquito strains\nTwo congenic strains of A. aegypti were used in this study. Both strains share the same pyrethroid-susceptible background from the Rockefeller strain (ROCK), but carry different kdr alleles. The LMRKDR:ROCK (LKR) is a pyrethroid-resistant strain which is congenic to ROCK, but contains the kdr allele 410L+1016I+1534C [18]. The 1534C:ROCK is a pyrethroid-resistant strain which is congenic to ROCK, but contains the F1534C allele [17]. In both congenic strains, the kdr alleles are the only mechanism of resistance to pyrethroids [17,18].\n\n\nAllele competition experiments\nTo conduct the allele competition experiments (also known as population cage experiments), the two congenic strains were crossed: Cross A (LKR females x 1534C:ROCK males) and reciprocal cross B (1534C:ROCK females x LKR males)(Fig 1). For each reciprocal cross, 400 unmated females and 200 males were released into a cage and were allowed to mate en masse for seven days. The offspring resulting from crosses A and B were split into three cages (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3) as shown in Fig 1. Mosquitoes were reared at 25.0\u201328.5\u00b0C (average = 25.6), 26.8\u201354.5% (average = 47.9%) relative humidity, and a 14:10-h (light/dark) photoperiod. All replicates were run at the same time. Mosquitoes were reared as previously described [21]. Approximately 800 pupae from the larval containers were placed into cages for each following generation. Additional emerging males and females were stored separately in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes at -80\u00b0C until they were genotyped.\nThe genotyping of the mosquitoes was done by allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) using primers that were allele specific at codon 1016 of the Vgsc (one allele has 410L+1016I+1534C and allele 1534C has V410+V1016+1534C). The genomic DNA from mosquito heads was extracted as previously described [22] and ASPCR was done using the following thermocycler conditions: For the 1534C allele, 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 36 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 62\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C (7 min). For the 410L+1016I+1534C allele, 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 34 x (94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 65\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 1 min) and 72\u00b0C (7 min). We used 1 \u03bcL of extracted DNA as templates for ASPCR. The primers used for each PCR reaction are shown in S2 Table. Each PCR reaction was evaluated on a 1% agarose gel and was scored as homozygous V1016 (PCR band only with V1016 primers), homozygous for 1016I (ASPCR band only with 1016I primers) or heterozygous (PCR band with both 1016V and 1016I primers). For each biological replicate, 45 males and 45 females were genotyped. Every PCR plate included control DNA from 2 samples of LKR, 1534C:ROCK and F1 (control DNA was previously sent for sequencing to validate the expected codon V1016I for each corresponding strain or F1). In addition to the controls, the codon V1016I was verified for 16 samples from A2F5 and A1F10, eight samples each). The sequencing results for the controls and samples agreed with the results from the gels. Each sample was genotyped using two technical replicates by running PCR reactions and gels twice.\nThe genotyping results were scored independently by three judges (JJS, JGS and CRF). Each judge assigned a genotype for each mosquito in both technical replicates. If the technical replicates agreed, a final genotype was assigned. A consensus genotype was determined if there was agreement between two out of three judges. If three judges disagreed on the final genotype, then those samples were considered for a third technical replicate. Third replicates were done if there were more than 10 samples per biological replicate for which there was no consensus genotype; otherwise, these samples were dropped from analysis.\n\n\nSelection of F9 using deltamethrin\nWe selected 3-7-day old males and females with deltamethrin. The doses used for males and females (0.039 ng/mosquito and 0.078 ng/mosquito, respectively) were chosen to give approximately 80% kill. To conduct the selections, mosquitoes were knocked down with CO2 and placed in a paper cup on a bucket filled with ice to keep them anesthetized.\nDeltamethrin in acetone (AF10-1Sel, AF10-2Sel, AF10-3Sel, BF10-1Sel, BF10-2Sel and BF10-3Sel populations) or acetone only (AF10-1, AF10-2, AF10-3, BF10-1, BF10-2 and BF10-3 populations) was applied topically to each mosquito with a PB600-1 repeating dispenser and a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno NV). Treated mosquitoes (40) were placed in a paper cup covered with nylon tulle and a cotton ball saturated with distilled water and held at 25\u00b0C for 24 hours. Both male and unmated female survivors were released in disposable cages (dimensions: A-15.7 x 15.7 x 24 inches, Restcloud Chengdu YiShouWeiSheng Technology Co., Ltd, China) and allowed to mate en masse. These mosquitoes were reared as described above and their offspring harvested for Vgsc genotyping.\n\n\nAllele competition data analysis\nDifferences between allele and genotype frequencies across generations were tested using linear mixed models and checked for significance from F-values generated from ANOVA in R as previously described [21].\nDeviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within generations was assessed using a chi-square test (\u03c72) to compare the observed genotype counts relative to the expected genotype counts calculated using the allele frequencies of the same generation [21]. The level of significance for statistical analyses was p < 0.05. Simulations were used to evaluate the likelihood of the observed allele frequency changes due to genetic drift. Simulations were done with R software [23] and scripts applied as in a previous study [24]. The model assumed a diploid and panmictic population with a fixed size of 800 individuals and the initial 410L+1016I+1534C allele frequency for each generation was defined as the observed frequency in the previous interval. Simulations were repeated 50,000 times per generation and p-values were estimated as the number of simulations in which ending allele frequency was equal or more extreme than the initial value of the interval divided by the total number of simulations. The null hypothesis assumed all fluctuations in allele frequencies could be explained by genetic drift. The p-values obtained for the HWE and genetic drift were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm\u2019s test [25].",
    "Results": "There were no significant differences in the allele frequencies over generations between reciprocal crosses A and B (Fig 1) for the unselected (ANOVA, p-value = 0. 951) or deltamethrin-selected generations (ANOVA, p-value = 0.174). There were no significant differences in the allele frequencies over generations between males and females in the absence (ANOVA, p-value = 0.888) nor presence of deltamethrin selection (ANOVA, p-value = 0.774. For this reason, allele frequencies from crosses A and B (and from males and females) were pooled for further analysis.\nThere was a remarkable fitness disadvantage to the 410L+1016I+1534C allele, relative to the 1534C allele, in the absence of insecticide. The fitness cost was most dramatic from the F1 to F3 and F5 where the 410L+1016I+1534C allele decreased from an average frequency of 50.0% to 21.3% and 11.5%, respectively (S1 Table). The frequency of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele remained relatively unchanged after the F5 (Fig 2 and S1 Table). The frequency of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele decreased in a trend that is best fitted by a power function model (F1,34 = 276.3, r2 = 0.89, ANOVA = 2.20x10-16). Changes in genotype frequencies over time are shown in Fig 3. The genotype frequencies were not in HWE (within generation) at the F3, were largely in HWE in the F5 and F7, and were variable between replicates for the F7 and F9 (S1 Table). Our simulations indicated that the changes in allele frequencies from the F1 could not be accounted for by drift (all p-values = 0). However, as the changes in allele frequency between generations became more subtle (F7-F10), drift was found to possibly explain 8 out of 18 results (comparisons made to previous generation) (S1 Table).\nThe solid black line represents the changes in allele frequencies in the absence of deltamethrin exposure are represented by a power function model (F1,34 = 276.3, r2 = 0.89). The dashed orange line represents the changes in allele frequencies from F9 to F10 in the presence of deltamethrin selection (linear model F1,10 = 186.1, r2 = 0.95). Different letters represent significant differences based on Tukey\u2019s test.\nDifferent letters represent significant differences based on Tukey\u2019s test.\nThe 410L+1016I+1534C allele exhibited an extraordinarily strong fitness advantage after exposure to deltamethrin with the allele frequency rising from 16% to 62.1% (Fig 2). As expected for a population under selection, the genotype frequencies do not follow the assumptions of HWE (p-values were < 0.0001) (S1 Table). These results are consistent with the observation that the 410L+1016I+1534C allele gave higher levels of deltamethrin resistance than the 1534C allele [18].",
    "Discussion": "The frequencies of resistance alleles in populations are a function of the level of protection they provide during periods of insecticide exposure, and their relative fitness in the absence of insecticide. Relative to the 1534C allele, the 410L+1016I+1534C allele gives similar levels of resistance to common insecticides such as cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and etofenprox (resistance ratios of range from 7.6\u201314 for these alleles), but gives higher levels of resistance to deltamethrin and flumethrin (resistance ratios of 42 and 57 for the 410L+1016I+1534C allele, compared to 15 and 13 for the 1534C allele) [18]. A survey of A. aegypti populations in the Americas in 2016\u20132017 found that the 410L+1016I+1534C allele was more common than the 1534C allele [15]. Data collected from 25 field populations from Brazil (2017\u20132018) found the 1534C allele was the most common (40.0%) followed by the 410L+1016I+1534C allele (38.2%) [16]. In Colombia, (2013\u20132014) both the 1534C (43.9%) and 410L+1016I+1534C alleles (22.2%) were found [6]. In Mexico (2016) the 416L+1016I+1534C (68.4%) and 1534C alleles (25.9%) were common [8].\nThe frequencies of the 410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C alleles are strongly influenced by the fitness disadvantage of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele relative to the 1534C allele in the absence of insecticides. In contrast in the presence of deltamethrin, the 410L+1016I+1534C allele has an enormous fitness advantage. During periods of use of pyrethroids such as cyhalothrin (to which the 410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C alleles confer similar levels of resistance [17,18]), both alleles would be favored, relative to susceptible alleles. These results bear some similarity to kdr alleles in house fly where the super-kdr allele (having two mutations) confers higher levels of resistance, but also has a greater fitness cost in the absence of insecticide, compared to kdr-type alleles with a single mutation [20]. Given the importance of the VGSC to neurological function, it would be interesting to explore what neurophysiological changes might underline the fitness costs of kdr alleles.\nThe fitness cost of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele (relative to the 1534C allele) was remarkably higher than has been found for comparisons of kdr versus susceptible alleles. For example, using a similar population cage experiment, the 989P+1016G [26] and the F1534C [21] alleles were shown to have a fitness cost relative to a susceptible allele, but the change in allele frequencies across generations was far less pronounced (frequency of the kdr allele decreased in a linear manner and was >0.3 by the F7) than we observed in this study. Another study used a strain of A. aegypti congenic to the pyrethroid-susceptible ROCK strain, but carrying an unknown kdr allele (although it was known to carry the V1016I mutation) and measured fitness costs. The frequency of the allele containing the 1016I mutation decreased through 15 generations in the absence of pyrethroid exposure (cross A: r2 = 0.527, p = 0.0006 and cross B: r2 = 0.569, p = 0.0003, respectively) [27] at a rate similar to what was seen for the 1534C and 989P+1016G alleles. It would be helpful to know what the allele was in those experiments, as well as what role (if any) the enhanced detoxification enzymes played in the changes in allele frequency.\nOur findings show a strong fitness cost associated with the 410L+1016I+1534C allele in the absence of insecticide exposure, but this allele provides a fitness advantage when exposed to deltamethrin, relative to the 1534C allele. Given the dramatic fitness cost of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele relative to the 1534C allele in the absence of insecticide, it is possible that the functionality of the VGSC is more drastically impaired for the former allele compared to the latter and investigating the neurophysiological differences between these alleles would be insightful."
