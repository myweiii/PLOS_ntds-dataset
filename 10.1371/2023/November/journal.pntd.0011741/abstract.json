    "Abstract": "Aedes aegypti is the vector of viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika that have a critical impact on human health. Control of adult mosquitoes is widely done using pyrethroids, but resistance has reduced the effectiveness of this class of insecticides. Resistance to pyrethroids in mosquitoes is commonly due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene (these mutations are known as knockdown resistance, kdr). In the Americas and the Caribbean, the most common kdr alleles are 410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C. In this study, we conducted a population cage experiment to evaluate changes in the allele and genotype frequencies of the 410L+1016I+1534C allele by crossing two congenic strains; one carrying the 410L+1016I+1534C and another with the 1534C allele. Changes in allele frequencies were measured over 10 generations in the absence of insecticide exposure. We also applied one cycle of selection with deltamethrin at F9 to evaluate the changes in allele and genotype frequencies. Our findings indicate that fitness costs were higher with the 410L+1016I+1534C allele, relative to the 1534C allele, in the absence of deltamethrin exposure, but that the 410L+1016I+1534C allele provides a stronger advantage when exposed to deltamethrin relative to the 1534C allele. Changes in genotype frequencies were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and could not be explained by drift. Our results suggest the diametrically opposed fitness costs in the presence and absence of insecticides is a reason for the variations in frequencies between the 410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C alleles in field populations."
