Hyalomma marginatum is a vector of numerous highly important human and animal pathogens. It is the principal vector of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Europe. This study updated the potential distribution of H. marginatum in the Old World. The model predicted a high suitability for H. marginatum in diverse regions of Africa, along with broader areas in Asia displaying medium to high suitability. The model predicted widespread potential distributions of H. marginatum on the continental European scale, encompassing southern, western, central, and eastern regions and even extending northward to the south of Scandinavian countries. Hyalomma marginatum populations have not yet been established in any country in Central Europe. However, previous studies have reported sporadic records of the species across all countries within the region. Given the frequent occurrence of immature stages of H. marginatum on migratory birds heading northward to temperate Europe, it is crucial to monitor the northward spread and establishment of permanent populations of this species. Our ecological niche model for Central Europe predicted its distribution across all countries within the region, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and surveillance to detect any potential changes in the distribution and establishment of H. marginatum populations. The current prediction of H. marginatum can contribute to our understanding of the disease risk areas associated with this vector.
