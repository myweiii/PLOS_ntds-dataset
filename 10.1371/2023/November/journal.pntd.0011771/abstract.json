    "Background": "Bacillary dysentery (BD) has brought a significant public health concern in China. Temperature is one of the main factors affecting BD incidence. Due to the largely different temperature ranges between regions, the classic multi-region time series studies could only explore the relative temperature-BD association and showed that BD incidence is positively associated with relative temperature (i.e., temperature percentile), which does not conform to the laboratory knowledge that both high and low temperature interfere with the survival of bacteria. The association on relative temperature scale also limits the intuition of epidemiological meanings.",
    "Methods": "A novel two-stage strategy was proposed to investigate the association between monthly temperature and BD incidence on the original temperature scale in 31 provinces, China. In the first stage, truncated polynomial splines, as the substitute of the common natural splines or B-splines in generalized additive models, were used to characterize the temperature-BD association on the original temperature scale in each province. In the second stage, a multivariate meta-analysis compatible with missing values was used to pool the associations. The classic strategy based on relative temperature was used as a reference.",
    "Results": "The average temperature-BD association presented a U-inverted shape, but not a monotonically increasing shape obtained using the classic strategy. This inverted U-shaped association conforms more to the laboratory knowledge and the original-scale association also provided an intuitive perspective and an easily explanatory result. Another advantage is that the novel strategy can extrapolate the province-specific association outside the observed temperature ranges by utilizing information from other provinces, which is meaningful considering the frequent incidences of extreme temperatures.",
    "Conclusions": "The association between temperature and BD incidence presented a U-inverted shape. The proposed strategy can efficiently characterize the association between exposure and outcome on original scale in a multi-region study with largely different exposure ranges."
