The global malaria landscape has changed considerably since 2000, with a drastic reduction of overall malaria cases, but a regional increase of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Suriname is a South American country striving for malaria elimination and Plasmodium vivax malaria is the main impediment, mostly due to the parasiteâ€™s ability to stay dormant in the liver and relapse within months/years after the initial infection, triggering new outbreaks.
As most low- and middle-income countries we are confronted with the lack of effective and affordable molecular tools to assess and monitor the genetic diversity of circulating P. vivax populations. We report the successful application of the PCR-RFLP technique in determining genetic signatures of Plasmodium vivax isolates, obtained from four different regions with varying malaria transmission risks. RFLP-profiling revealed that outbreak samples from three indigenous villages, almost exclusively, harbored a single clonal type, suggesting a limited P. vivax hypnozoite reservoir in Suriname. In contrast, isolates originating from Sophie, a mining area in neighboring French Guiana displayed a heterogeneous parasite population, consistent with its endemic malaria status. We demonstrated the usefulness of PCR-RFLP for assessments of P. vivax genetic diversity, outbreak analysis and identification of imported cases in a low-transmission setting, where resources are limited.
