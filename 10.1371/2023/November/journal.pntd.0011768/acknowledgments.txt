First and foremost, we thank our participants for taking time to share their experiences. We are also grateful to Angelique Uwamahoro, Elisha Muhigirwa and Theoneste Hakizimana for their hard work interviewing snakebite victims and to Community Health Workers who helped us to recruit and support study participants.
