Dengue is a growing public health concern in Tanzania, particularly in the Dar es Salaam region, where outbreaks are common. However, little is known about the region’s preparedness for dengue outbreaks, including the knowledge of health care workers and availability of diagnostic equipment. In a study of 324 health care workers in 78 health facilities in Temeke district, it was found that while almost all workers were aware of dengue, less than half had adequate knowledge of diagnosis, management, and monitoring. Clinicians had higher knowledge scores than other cadres, and those working in private facilities had more knowledge than those in government institutions. Only a small percentage of respondents reported the availability of diagnostic tests, medical guidelines, and refresher training. The study recommends building the capacity of health care workers and ensuring the availability of diagnostic tests and tools to improve readiness for dengue outbreaks. Dengue outbreaks occur every two years in Tanzania, with the last outbreak in 2019 resulting in over 6,800 cases and 13 deaths. As climate change is expected to increase the number of dengue cases, improving health care workers’ knowledge and diagnostic capacity is crucial to effectively detect outbreaks.
