Schistosomiasis remains a major neglected tropical disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Human and animals infected with Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) or Schistosoma mansoni develop a severe liver pathology which arises when schistosome eggs lodged in the liver. The secretions from the embolized mature eggs elicits the hostâ€™s granulomatous cell-mediated immune response, which progresses to irreversible fibrosis and lethal liver pathogenesis. The schistosomes obtain nutrients from the host blood by using nonspecific and specific transport via their body surface and alimentary tracts, and CD36-related protein (CD36RP) was identified in both adult worms and eggs of S. japonicum, which mediates the uptake of cholesteryl ester from the host plasma high-density lipoproteins and facilitates the maturation of the eggs. In this study, we found that immunization with extracellular domain of CD36RP (Ex160) suppressed the egg maturation of schistosomes and reduced liver injury in S. japonicum infected rabbits. Ex160 may serve as a candidate for the antigen for vaccination against schistosomal infection.
