Chagas disease is a global health concern with significant economic implications, yet our understanding of its economic burden remains limited. As part of the RAISE project, aimed at estimating the global impact of chronic Chagas disease and chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, we conducted a systematic review to assess the costs associated with Chagas Disease treatment in both endemic and non-endemic countries. We identified fifteen studies. The most commonly investigated cost components included inpatient care, exams, surgeries, consultations, drugs, and pacemakers. We found substantial heterogeneity in estimation methods and data presentation, revealing a lack of measurement and cost components standardization. Our systematic review represents the first comprehensive assessment of Chagas Disease treatment costs. Our findings emphasize the need for standardized measurement methods and cost components to improve comparability and facilitate economic burden estimation. The high costs of invasive treatments for cardiomyopathies remain challenging for low and middle-income countries. Estimating the economic burden of Chagas disease provides crucial information for conducting policy evaluations and interventions. For instance, these studies can support international agencies in funding research for vaccine development and improved vector control programs. While vaccine research is in its early stages, promising antiparasitic therapies offer potential for disease control.
