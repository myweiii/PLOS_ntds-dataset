Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America. This parasite is genetically diverse and classified into different lineages. Proper strain typing techniques are necessary to study T. cruzi, because their lineages have significant biological differences. Several typing methods have been proposed, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. However, most of these methods lack sensitivity or fail for discriminating some lineages. Genetic markers with high copy numbers are required to gain sensitivity. Here, we deep sequenced DNA regions present in the large mitochondrion of the parasite (mHVRs) from strains belonging to the six main lineages to obtain reference mHVR sequences and develop a typing workflow. Amplicon sequencing of mHVR was conducted on 62 T. cruzi strains. Despite high sequence diversity, strains of the same lineage shared more sequences than strains of different lineages. Two reference sets of mHVR sequences were generated and evaluated for their ability to typify distinct types of T. cruzi samples. The workflow presented in this study could serve as a valuable resource for T. cruzi typing in future studies.
