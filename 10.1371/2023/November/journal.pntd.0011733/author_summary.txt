Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of a highly heterogeneous genus. Most studies have focused on Leptospira interrogans that is responsible for the majority of human infection cases worldwide. On the contrary, our knowledge is very limited for other pathogenic species, including L. santarosai, which may represent a public health problem in both humans and animals in the American continent. Our comparative genomic analyses of the pathogenic species revealed that L. santarosai is characterized by an open pangenome state with high genetic and serovar diversity. This first study of L. santarosai isolates not only contributes to the global understanding of genomics and evolution within the Leptospira pathogenic species but also provides the groundwork for better surveillance of this pathogen.
