Even though scrub typhus and other rickettsial infections are continuously being recorded across India, there has been no systematic surveillance and reporting of the disease in any state. Mizoram, the North-East Indian state sandwiched between Bangladesh and Myanmar has integrated screening and systematic line listing of rickettsial infections across all its health centers. An important outcome of this effort is the very low case fatality rate (CFR); at 0.35, the CFR of rickettsial infections in Mizoram is very low when compared to the median CFR of âˆ¼6% reported from other locations. These findings could serve as a template that could be replicated in other regions across India to prevent and control this neglected disease of huge public health importance.
