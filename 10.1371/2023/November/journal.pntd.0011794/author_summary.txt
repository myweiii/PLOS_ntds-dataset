Leprosy is a chronic, infectious and contagious disease caused by the M. leprae bacterium. Skin lesions, loss of sensation, nerve damage, muscle weakness, and deformities are common characteristics of leprosy. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of leprosy are crucial for preventing the disease’s spread as well as for avoiding negative medical and social effects and reducing the disease’s burden. However the likelihood of nerve damage and subsequent disability rises as the length of the diagnostic delay increases. In this study, we identified that health professionals face many challenges to implement early detection of leprosy cases strategies like lack of the existence of practice-oriented training, Integration of TB and leprosy training, Inadequate supportive supervision of health facilities, Multiple tasks for health workers, Poor coordination and communications, lack of motivation in health workers, Disruption in treatment, and Importance of training related to leprosy outlined. The effective implementation of these strategies will be required for a sustainable reduction and achieve zero autochthonous cases and comply with the WHO’s Leprosy Strategy by 2035.
