Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by the parasite Leishmania and is treated when a microscopy test confirms the presence of the parasite in a sample of the lesion. This test, however, is known to miss patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. DNA diagnostic tests (like PCR) that detect the parasiteâ€™s genetic material in the lesion, have been proposed to improve diagnosis. Filter paper preserves DNA at room temperature and allows samples to be transported from remote health centers to the PCR laboratory. The ability of microscopic and DNA testing to recognize leishmaniasis patients in real-life is complex to evaluate. We compared the performance of both tests using a statistical method that can evaluate both tests simultaneously without assuming that either test works perfectly. We found that PCR will be positive 68% of the time in a participant with leishmaniasis in the Amazon and 73% of the time in the Pacific region. In the Amazon, microscopy detects one out of every two cases, while it does in three out of every four cases in the Pacific. The addition of the PCR test can improve the number of participants with a diagnosis of leishmaniasis, mostly in the Amazon region.
