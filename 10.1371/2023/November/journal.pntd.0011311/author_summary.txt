Human Adenoviruses (HAdV) is among the common causes of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children. HAdV may cause severe or deadly diseases in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. There are many HAdV subtypes and different HAdV subtypes may be associated with different diseases or disease manifestations. In the second half of 2022, for the first time in Northern Vietnam, there was a HAdV-associated ARI outbreak in children with an alarming number of severe cases and deaths. During the outbreak, the authors performed Sanger sequencing on nasal swab samples of 97 patients who tested positive for HAdV by multiplex real-time PCR panel (the PCR panel was designed to test for HAdV and 6 other respiratory viruses). Three HAdV subtypes were identified: B3 (83%), B7 (16%) and C2 (1%). Patient clinical characteristics were similar between the detected HAdV subtypes. Co-detection of HAdV with other respiratory viruses was associated with greater disease severity compared to HAdV detection alone. This is probably the first study describing the clinical features and HAdV molecular subtypes associated with an ARI outbreak in children in Vietnam. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of multi-factor microbial panels for the diagnosis and prognosis of ARI in children.
