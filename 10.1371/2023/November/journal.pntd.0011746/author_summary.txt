Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the neglected zoonoses caused by Echinococcus granulosus s.l. larvae and is a worldwide public health problem. Previous study showed that CE is usually characterized by mild local inflammation, indicating that E. granulosus s.l. can control liver inflammation to shape an ‘immunosuppressive’ microenvironment, a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to maintain immune homoeostasis during persistent infection. Here, by combining data from human CE samples and animal models, we found that hepatic macrophages are involved in the control of liver inflammation to favor persistent E. granulosus s.s. infection. The pool of hepatic macrophages expanded dramatically at the early stage through the attraction of massive amounts of MoMFs that preferentially initially polarized toward a proinflammatory phenotype and then toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype to favor persistent infection at the late stage after infection. Depletion of hepatic macrophages accelerated hydatid cyst establishment and growth by inhibiting CD4+ T-cell infiltration and liver fibrosis during E. granulosus s.s. infection. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the local microenvironment in CE and possibly facilitate the design of novel therapeutic approaches for CE that target hepatic macrophages.
