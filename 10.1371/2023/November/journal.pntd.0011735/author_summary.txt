Host genetic factors play important role in the development and progress of severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum infection. One of the key factors is the abnormality in the gene that encodes cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are involved in complex inflammatory reactions. However, the relationship between the abnormality of this gene and malaria severity remains unclear. The present meta-analysis aimed to better understand this correlation and provide insight into its association in populations with different ethnicities. The analyses showed no significant association. Stratification by ethnicity revealed that two significant associations were found only in the Asians favoring SM for dominant and codominant, but not among the African populations. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that TNF-α -308G >A might affect the risk of P. falciparum SM, particularly in individuals of Asian descent. This supports ethnicity as one of the dependent factors of the association between the abnormality of this gene and clinical severity of malaria. Further large and well-designed genetic studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.
