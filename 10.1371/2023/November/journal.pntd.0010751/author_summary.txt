Chikungunya virus causes an acute febrile disease for which no vaccines and therapy is available. The virus is transmitted to humans via infected A. aegypti or A. albopictus mosquitoes who are mainly circulating in the (sub)tropical regions of the world. For the identification of antiviral targets it is important to understand the interactions between the virus and the host cell during infection. In this study we assessed the role of autophagy-related proteins in chikungunya virus infection. We found that the host cell factor mitochondrial protein and autophagy receptor BCL2 Interacting Protein 3 (BNIP3) controls the infectivity of chikungunya virus. Subsequent analysis revealed that BNIP3 interferes with chikungunya virus infection during the early stages of virus replication. The exact mechanism is not yet understood although we demonstrate that BNIP3 functions independent of its known roles in autophagy and cell death.
