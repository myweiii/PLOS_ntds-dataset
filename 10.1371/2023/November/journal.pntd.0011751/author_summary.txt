Urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium is a major public health problem in the impoverished population of tropical regions. The guidelines of the World Health Organization determine periodic mass drug administration with praziquantel as the main strategy to prevent morbidity associated with the chronic phase of the disease. This strategy has focused in school-age children, but recent recommendations suggest including other target populations, such as pre-school age children. In this study we evaluated the prevalence and morbidity associated with urogenital schistosomiasis in Cubal, an endemic area of Angola. We found a prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis of 30.2% (CI 95%; 24.5–35.9) with a high infection intensity of 20.3% (CI 95%; 15.3–25.3) among pre-school age children. In addition, among the children infected, 54.5% (CI 95%; 47.6–61.8) presented urogenital abnormalities on ultrasound examination. There is an evident need of including them in mass drug administration campaigns and consequently the development of an adapted praziquantel treatment dosage for children under 2 years of age.
