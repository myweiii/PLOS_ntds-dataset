Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus capable of causing debilitating arthritis and myalgia in humans and the virus is currently circulating in Central and South America. With several factors supporting viral emergence, MAYV is a public health risk due to the lack of FDA-approved countermeasures. Although non-human primate (NHP) infection models are well established for chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and the equine encephalitic alphaviruses, there is currently no well-characterized NHP model of MAYV pathogenesis. With evidence of well-established mouse models of MAYV infection and a report from 1967 demonstrating that MAYV infection of NHPs in a laboratory setting was feasible, we aimed to further characterize MAYV infection in three rhesus macaques. Following precursor studies in mice to identify an optimal viral strain for NHP infection, we subcutaneously challenged rhesus macaques and characterized viral pathogenesis and immunity over the course of 10 days. Our study establishes a framework for future evaluation of MAYV-specific treatments in this relevant animal model.
