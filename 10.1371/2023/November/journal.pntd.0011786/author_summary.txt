Bothrops venoms contain toxins targeting hemostasis, a physiological process aiming stopping bleeding in case of injury. Envenomation by B. atrox in French Guiana leads to hemorrhage while envenomation by B. lanceolatus in Martinique results in thrombosis. To understand the mechanisms involved in these opposite manifestations related to the two venoms, we designed a comparative rat study of hemostasis based on a comprehensive approach including blood measurement of initiation time and size of the clot, platelet count, plasma fibrinogen, thrombin and fibrin generation, and various inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers. We showed that B. atrox venom induces more marked platelet and fibrinogen consumption, promoting the risk of hemorrhage, while B. lanceolatus venom induces an initial fibrinogen consumption followed by a secondary increase in combination to an enhanced inflammatory reaction resulting in increased thrombosis risk. Interestingly, the two venoms exhibited no endothelial toxicity.
