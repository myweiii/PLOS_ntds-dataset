    "Abstract": "Hemostasis impairment represents the most threatening consequence of Viperidae envenoming, notably with Bothrops genus. In the French departments of America, B. atrox envenomation in French Guiana may lead to bleeding while B. lanceolatus envenomation in Martinique to thrombosis. Bleeding related to B. atrox envenomation is attributed to vascular damage mediated by venom metalloproteinases and blood uncoagulable state resulting from thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy. Thrombosis related to B. lanceolatus envenomation are poorly understood. We aimed to compare the effects of B. atrox and B. lanceolatus venoms in the rat to identify the determinants of the hemorrhagic versus thrombotic complications. Viscoelastometry (ROTEM), platelet count, plasma fibrinogen, thrombin generation assay, fibrinography, endothelial (von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS13 activity, ICAM-1, and soluble E-selectin), and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and PAI-1) were determined in blood samples obtained at H3, H6, and H24 after the subcutaneous venom versus saline injection. In comparison to the control, initial fibrinogen consumption was observed with the two venoms while thrombocytopenia and reduction in the clot amplitude only with B. atrox venom. Moreover, we showed an increase in thrombin generation at H3 with the two venoms, an increase in fibrin generation accompanied with hyperfibrinogenemia at H24 and an increase in inflammatory biomarkers with B. lanceolatus venom. No endothelial damage was found with the two venoms. To conclude, our data support two-sided hemostasis complications in Bothrops envenoming with an initial risk of hemorrhage related to platelet consumption and hypocoagulability followed by an increased risk of thrombosis promoted by the activated inflammatory response and rapid-onset fibrinogen restoration."
