Dengue fever can lead to severe illness in some cases, which can be fatal. The number of severe cases is increasing. There are currently no effective therapeutic drugs or vaccines available for widespread use. Vascular leakage is the physiological basis of the pathology leading to severe disease, and it is widely believed that vascular leakage is directly or indirectly driven by an excessive immune response, that is, a cytokine storm. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, a complete understanding of disease progression has been missing. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in the mouse model and found that the changes in the small intestine are critical for severe disease. In the small intestine, among six types of γδ T cells, IL-17A-producing Vγ4 and Vγ6 T cell receptor (TCR) γδ T cells were selectively expanded following infection. IL-17A played a critical role, through NF-κB activation, in inducing the production of IL-6 and neutrophil collagenase/matrix metalloprotease 8 (not previously considered an inducer of vascular leakage), as well as STAT-3 phosphorylation, acting synergistically with TNF-α to promote vascular leakage. This study both reinforces and challenges some of the previous observations, while highlighting the need for new perspectives in this field.
