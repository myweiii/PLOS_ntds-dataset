Soft ticks belonging to Ornithodoros genus such as O. turicata are important vectors for human relapsing fever agent. Tick-borne relapsing fever is a neglected disease. Therefore, studies that address molecular aspects of the vector biology of these soft ticks are important. In this study, we identified and partially sequenced several innate immune genes in O. turicata americanus ticks. Studies with hard ticks have shown that subolesin plays an important role in tick feeding, reproduction, and regulation of gene expression. However, studies deciphering the role of subolesin in soft ticks are limited. In this study, we report that O. turicata americanus subolesin not only plays a role in blood feeding but also regulates innate immune gene expression in these ticks.
