Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease transmitted via an intermediate snail host through contact with contaminated fresh water. Even with routine Mass Drug Administration for treatment of the infection, re-infections are still common and variations in infection intensity and pathology are still observed in individuals in the same location. These may be due to differences in individuals’ response to S. mansoni infection. In this study, we used RNAseq to identify differentially expressed genes associated with S. mansoni infection in children between 10–15 years. We conducted comparisons between phenotypes including infection intensities measured by circulating anodic antigen, wasting by body mass index and stunting by height-for-age Z-score. Our data showed very low numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes in all comparisons. Some of the few differentially expressed genes that were observed were associated with fibrosis which is the cause of pathology in humans and has been observed in late stages of S. mansoni infection in murine studies.
