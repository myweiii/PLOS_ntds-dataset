In the present study, we focused on understanding the development of collaborative clinical trials for neglected tropical diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people each year. These diseases, largely prevalent in tropical regions, lead to huge economic and societal burdens. The current status of drug development in this field is caused and exacerbated by a combination of diverse political, market, and scientific factors. Our goal was to highlight the crucial role of collaborations between public entities and private organizations in initiating and promoting clinical trials for these neglected diseases. Our results show that public sector and nongovernmental organization-led collaborations were the most prevalent between 2000 and 2021. Logistic and scientific issues are the most frequent reasons for failures in this clinical trial dataset. In conclusion, our study paints an overview picture of the collaborative clinical trials against neglected tropical diseases. The results highlight the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing this kind of health need. We aspire that our insights will spark more conversations and initiatives aimed at providing equal healthcare opportunities for everyone.
