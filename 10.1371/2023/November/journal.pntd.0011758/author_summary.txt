We reported that the prevalence of elevated pancreatic enzymes in patients with SFTS, and demonstrated that the elevation of pancreatic enzymes was very common in SFTS, which might not always be associated with AP. Imaging examinations could be necessary for clinicians to confirm the diagnosis of AP when SFTS patient with elevated pancreatic enzymes. AP might account for the majority of deaths of patients with elevated pancreatic enzymes. However, among patients with increased pancreatic enzymes except for AP, patients with pancreatic enzymes >3Ã—ULN also had a high in-hospital mortality rate.
