Fever is one of the most common reasons for seeking health care in Latin America and is a substantial contributor to continental morbidity and mortality. Viruses transmitted by arthropods, known as arboviruses, represent one of the predominant etiologic agents responsible for causing febrile illness in Latin America. In the current epidemiological scenario in Brazil, due to shared characteristics of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV, the Ministry of Health recommends performing a differential diagnosis for other clinical syndromes. In this study, we performed the differential molecular diagnosis in 713 samples of individuals with acute febrile illness suspected of arboviruses belonging to the state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2016. The samples were submitted to RT-qPCR and qPCR tests for DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV, together with other agents responsible for causing febrile syndrome and exanthematous fever syndrome. These include Enterovirus, other arboviruses of the Flavivirus and Alphavirus genera and the species Primate Erythroparvovirus 1 (B19V). We report the concomitant detection of CHIKV and B19V in 17.1% of cases, highlighting the importance of a broad diagnostic approach, since the detection of simultaneous infections may be occurring between arboviruses and/ or other viruses during epidemics in different regions of Brazil.
