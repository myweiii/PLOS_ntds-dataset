In our research, we searched for a disease called yaws, which is caused by a type of bacteria. Yaws mostly affects children under 15 years old. In the past, yaws was a big problem in Nigeria, but efforts to get rid of the disease have been successful in reducing the number of cases.
However, we still needed to check if yaws is still spreading in Nigeria. Even though other nearby countries reported cases of yaws, there wasn’t much information about what was happening in Nigeria. So, we did a study in southeast Nigeria. We looked for yaws in school-aged children by visiting communities and schools. If a child had skin problems that looked like yaws, we checked them carefully and used quick tests to see if they had yaws.
After checking about 105,015 schoolchildren, we found 7,706 children with skin issues, but when we tested them for yaws, none of them actually had the disease.
The most common skin problems we found were scabies, a kind of rash (papular urticaria), and some fungal skin infections.
We suggest that Nigeria should keep looking for cases, just to be sure the disease doesn’t come back.
