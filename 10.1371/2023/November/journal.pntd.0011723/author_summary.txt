Typhoid and paratyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A respectively, are common in areas lacking safe water and optimum infrastructure. With increasing multidrug resistance in Salmonella Typhi, newer antimicrobials like ceftriaxone and azithromycin are frequently prescribed for the empirical treatment of both typhoid and paratyphoid fever. This is because Salmonella Paratyphi A is less prevalent in most endemic countries, and typhoid and paratyphoid fever are often symptomatically indistinguishable. In this study, we conducted comprehensive surveillance of Salmonella Paratyphi A in Bangladesh over a period of 23 years and identified 2,725 blood culture-confirmed paratyphoid cases. Our findings indicate that Salmonella Paratyphi A remained susceptible to most of the older generation of antibiotics as over 97% of the isolates continue to be susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole, and no isolate detected was resistant to all three drugs. Although 99% of the isolates exhibited reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility, 99% and 100% were sensitive to azithromycin and ceftriaxone. These findings are important and can guide evidence-based policy decisions for the empirical treatment of paratyphoid fever. While newer antimicrobials such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone remain effective, successful implementation of typhoid conjugate vaccines and rapid diagnostics may re-enable the use of older generation antibiotics for empirical treatment of enteric fever without compromising the treatment efficacy. This approach can contribute to the antimicrobial stewardship efforts by preserving critically important antimicrobials such as ceftriaxone and azithromycin for the treatment of numerous other multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
