The control of onchocerciasis, then an endemic disease in Mali, began through vector control by spraying insecticides in Simulium damnosum s.l. breeding sites in an effort known as the Onchocerciasis Control Program in West Africa (OCP). As the OCP’s activities began to wind down, control activities moved to a combination of vector control together with the distribution of the anthelminthic, ivermectin administered to those populations at risk of infection in the endemic areas. This drug administration was carried out by mobile teams using the framework of community-directed ivermectin treatment (CDTI). It is also important to note that lymphatic filariasis is endemic in all health districts, and thus the onchocerciasis endemic districts, regardless of endemicity, all therefore also benefited from the effects of the additional ivermectin treatment.
After various evaluations of endemicity it was found that Mali qualified to conduct pre-stop ivermectin treatment surveys according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Thus, between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, a large-scale serological survey of children 5–9 years was conducted in all health districts of Mali suspected of being endemic for onchocerciasis. The results of this investigation showed the seroprevalence thresholds measured by the OV16 rapid diagnostic test in the laboratory were below the WHO defined 2% level for success in all operational transmission zones, except for an operational transmission zone in the Kayes region, namely the KA05 zone, where there was 2.60% seropositivity to OV16.
