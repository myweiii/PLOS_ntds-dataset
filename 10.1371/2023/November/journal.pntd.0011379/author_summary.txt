The current multidrug therapy is effective against leprosy but remains long and difficult to observe for patients supporting the need of monthly -based treatment. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a diarylquinoline with a long half-life, is a candidate drug to shorten leprosy treatment by targeting the electron transport chain and inhibiting the ATP synthesis. In this work, we demonstrated that (i) the minimal effective dose of BDQ administered orally against M. leprae is 3.3 mg/kg, (ii) BDQ did not add significantly to the efficacy of CFZ at the doses tested, and (iii) BDQ long acting formulation was similar or less active than BDQ administered orally at equivalent dosing and frequency but should be tested at higher dosing in order to reach equivalent exposure in further experiments.
