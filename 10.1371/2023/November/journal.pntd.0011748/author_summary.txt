The DeWorm3 Project is a community cluster-randomized trial being conducted in Benin, India, and Malawi to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission by six rounds of biannual community-wide MDA (cMDA). As recommended by the World Health Organization, coverage evaluation surveys (CES) among 2,000 households were carried out in the DeWorm3 Project to validate reported treatment coverage of cMDA. During the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020, the fifth round of CES was conducted using mobile phones instead of in-person survey. In phone-based CES, only 56% of sampled households were reached compared to 89% during the in-person CES. This was due to phone numbers being wrongly recorded, or calls being unanswered leading to a higher number of households that had to be sampled in order to achieve the sample size of 2,000 households in phone-based CES compared in-person CES (3,600 and 2,352 respectively). Focus group discussions conducted with the interviewers showed that phone-based CES took less time to complete than in-person CES; mostly men responded to the interview call; and eliciting responses to open-ended questions and confirming treatment compliance from every member of the household was challenging. These observations were also confirmed by analysing the survey participation data that showed less participation by women and more proxy responses in the phone based CES. Collecting phone numbers of women and avoiding open-ended questions may improve the womenâ€™s participation and quality of responses.
