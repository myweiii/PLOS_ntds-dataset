    "Background": "Clonorchiasis, caused by the infection of Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), is a kind of neglected tropical disease, but it is highly related to cholangiocarcinoma. It has been well known that NO from chronic inflammation responses are thought to be a major component of the damage and ultimate carcinogenesis ESPs such as nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) are thought to enhance the damage. The objective of this study was to identify the protein candidates interact with recombinant CsNOSIP (rCsNOSIP) and explore their role involved in CCA development or progression.",
    "Methods": "We applied HuProt microarray containing 21,000 probe sets for a systematic identification of rCsNOSIP-binding proteins and grouped binding hits by gene function. Pull-down assays were used to confirm the interaction of rCsNOSIP with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPSCR-1) and sirtuins 5 (Sirt-5). ASPSCR-1/Sirt-5 over-expression and siRNA knockdown experiments were employed for obtain of ASPSCR-1/Sirt-5 high or low expression (ASP-oe/Sirt5-oe or ASP-si/Sirt5-si) cholangiocarcinoma cell line (CCLP-1) cells. Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species assay (ROS) as well as cell proliferation and wound-healing assays were performed to observe the effect of rCsNOSIP on ASP-oe/Sirt5-oe or ASP-si/Sirt5-si CCLP-1 cells.",
    "Results": "Seventy candidate proteins protein \"hits\" were detected as rCsNOSIP-binding proteins by HuProt microarray and bioinformatics analysis. Pull down assay showed that ASPSCR-1 and Sirt-5 could interact with rCsNOSIP. In addition, endotoxin-free-rCsNOSIP could increase the production of NO and ROS and promote the migration of CCLP-1 cells, while its effect on enhancing cell proliferation was not significant. Furthermore, ROS/NO production, proliferation, or migration were increased in ASP-si or Sirt5-si CCLP-1 cells but decreased in Asp-oe or Sirt5-oe CCLP-1 cells when stimulated with rCsNOSIP.",
    "Conclusions": "Our findings suggest that CsNOSIP as a component of CsESPs might promote the development and invasion of CCA and Sirt5/ ASPSCR1 as host molecules might play a novel protective role against adverse stimulus during C. sinensis infection. This work supports the idea that CsESPs induce the occurrence and progression of CCA through ROS/RNS-induced oxidative and nitrative DNA damage."
