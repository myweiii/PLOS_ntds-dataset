Currently, schistosomiasis control has moved into the transmission interruption phase in China. During the transition from the transmission interruption to elimination stages, the national schistosomiasis control program shifts from morbidity control to interventions of schistosomiasis transmission. Following the implementation of intervention models with adaptations to current epidemiological features of schistosomiasis, the shift from conventional comprehensive control to more scientific and precise modern control is an important issue for schistosomiasis control strategies. Therefore, this study selected Jiangling County of Hubei Province, where schistosomiasis was historically hyperendemic and there is a high risk of schistosomiasis transmission, to carry out field empirical research on different transmission risk intervention modes. Results from the RSR, TOPSIS and fuzzy combination model all revealed that the effectiveness of the integrated health education-led strategy with an emphasis on infectious source management was superior to the other two intervention models. Results from this field interventional study showed that the integrated health education-led strategy with an emphasis on infectious source management was the optimal model to manage the risk of transmission of schistosomiasis during the post-transmission interruption phase.
