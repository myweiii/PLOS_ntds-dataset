    "Background": "The neurotrophic parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) has been implicated as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is only limited information concerning its underlying mechanism and therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the effects of T. gondii chronic infection on the goal-directed cognitive behavior in mice. Moreover, we evaluated the preventive and therapeutic effect of dimethyl itaconate on the behavior deficits induced by the parasite.",
    "Methods": "The infection model was established by orally infecting the cysts of T. gondii. Dimethyl itaconate was intraperitoneally administered before or after the infection. Y-maze and temporal order memory (TOM) tests were used to evaluate the prefrontal cortex-dependent behavior performance. Golgi staining, transmission electron microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence, western blot, and RNA sequencing were utilized to determine the pathological changes in the prefrontal cortex of mice.",
    "Results": "We showed that T. gondii infection impaired the prefrontal cortex-dependent goal-directed behavior. The infection significantly downregulated the expression of the genes associated with synaptic transmission, plasticity, and cognitive behavior in the prefrontal cortex of mice. On the contrary, the infection robustly upregulated the expression of activation makers of microglia and astrocytes. In addition, the metabolic phenotype of the prefrontal cortex post infection was characterized by the enhancement of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, the blockage of the Krebs cycle, and the disorder of aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1)-itaconate axis. Notably, the administration of dimethyl itaconate significantly prevented and treated the cognitive impairment induced by T. gondii, which was evidenced by the improvement of behavioral deficits, synaptic ultrastructure lesion and neuroinflammation.",
    "Conclusion": "The present study demonstrates that T. gondii infection induces the deficits of the goal-directed behavior, which is associated with neuroinflammation, the impairment of synaptic ultrastructure, and the metabolic shifts in the prefrontal cortex of mice. Moreover, we report that dimethyl itaconate has the potential to prevent and treat the behavior deficits."
