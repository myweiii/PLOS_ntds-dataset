Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever occur periodically in Uganda in livestock and humans. An initial outbreak was reported in Kabale in March 2016 after a long quiescent period. Factors that trigger these outbreaks have not been fully described, but above-normal precipitation and flooding are known to be important causes. This paper presents a study that was conducted in the country to analyse RVF virus seroprevalence and risk factors for exposure in livestock. The study also mapped spatial distribution of RVFV seroprevalence. Data used in the study were generated from a national cross-sectional serosurvey that involved cattle, sheep and goats. Results obtained showed that the national RVFV seroprevalence was 11.3%, with 95% confidence interval of 10.2â€“12.3%. Cattle had higher RVFV seroprevalence compared to sheep and goats. Environmental factors that were associated with increased seroprevalence were low precipitation seasonality, haplic planosols, and low cattle density. Prevalence maps generated showed that the southwestern, central and parts of the northeastern regions had higher seroprevalence compared to other regions of the country. These maps can be used to guide the surveillance of the disease in the country.
