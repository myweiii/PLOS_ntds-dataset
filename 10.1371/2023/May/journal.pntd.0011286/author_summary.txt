Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is one of the most common pediatric infectious diseases worldwide and it has affected up to two million children annually in China since 2008. This study used Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling to analyze provincial-level HFMD cases, environmental and socioeconomic data during 2009â€“2018. We found that both environmental (temperature, relative humidity and normalized difference vegetation index) and socioeconomic covariates (population density, birth rate, real GDP per capita and school vacation) are associated with HFMD occurrence under spatiotemporal scales. This model may help to (1) identify outbreaks of HFMD, including their timing, location and severity; (2) understand the transmission dynamics by mapping the spread of HFMD over time and space; (3) indicate areas of higher risk or the emergence of new outbreaks by detecting clusters of HFMD cases in specific geographic locations. Overall, this study provides valuable information for public health decision-makers and researchers, allowing them to better understand the spread of the disease and target their efforts more efficiently to control its transmission and prevent outbreaks.
