Kenya has experienced recurrent cholera outbreaks from 1971 through today and constraints on resources make it essential to target multi-sectoral interventions to high priority areas. Using surveillance data from 2015â€“2020, this study identifies high priority areas for cholera intervention in Kenya following guidance from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. We identified that roughly 3 million people (6% of the population) in 13 sub-counties live in high priority areas in Kenya, where the mean annual incidence exceeded 70 cases per 100,000 population and over 35% of weeks reported at least one suspected cholera case. Further, 1.6 million people living in high priority sub-counties would have been de-prioritized had the analysis been performed only at the county scale. Cholera interventions in Kenya should target high priority sub-counties, and future countries undergoing cholera control planning should carefully consider operational implementation when determining the spatial scale of their prioritization analysis.
