Synthetic chemical insecticides are mainly used for controlling sand flies via indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide treated nets. Sand flies had developed resistance against DDT in endemic areas of Bihar, India, and was replaced by synthetic pyrethroids (alpha-cypermethrin) in the second phase of IRS in 2015. The substantial increase in the use of synthetic pyrethroids will potentially lead to increased resistance because DDT and pyrethroids both have the same target site. To monitor insecticide resistance in field caught sand flies, susceptibility status and diagnostic doses and times are warranted, as no diagnostic dose for resistance detection has been established for Indian sand flies. A laboratory reared P. argentipes was used to quantify insecticide susceptibility and determination of diagnostic doses and times. The CDC bottle bioassay was used with five insecticides viz., alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin, malathion, chlorpyrifos and DDT. Results indicate that the P. argentipes were highly susceptible to alpha-cypermethrin followed by deltamethrin, malathion, chlorpyrifos and least susceptible to DDT. This study provides critical base line reference data for further studies to assess insecticide susceptibility and resistance monitoring in field populations, as well as determining diagnostic doses and times for other insecticide susceptible sand fly populations undergoing surveillance to sustain VL elimination.
