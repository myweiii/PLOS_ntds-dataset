We greatly appreciate the data on cattle habitat use in KFD-affected areas that was shared by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, India (ATREE) and the Monkey Fever Risk project. We also appreciate the insightful discussions with researchers from ATREE and other members of the MonkeyFeverRisk and IndiaZooRisk research teams that helped to inform the development of these models.
