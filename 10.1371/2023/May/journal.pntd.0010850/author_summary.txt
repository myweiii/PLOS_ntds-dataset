Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people, mostly in Latin America. It is crucial to have safe and well-studied treatments for children, who are often affected. The recommended medication for this disease is benznidazole, but limited information is available on this drugâ€™s effectiveness in children, especially infants and neonates.
In this study, we enrolled children with Chagas disease, ranging from newborns to 12-year-olds, and treated them with benznidazole for 60 days. We found that children had lower levels of benznidazole in their blood compared to adults receiving similar weight-adjusted doses. However, the treatment was highly effective and well-tolerated, with few side effects. All children who completed treatment cleared the parasites.
These findings highlight the importance of understanding how benznidazole works in children to provide the right dose and duration of treatment for a successful recovery with minimal adverse drug effects. Healthcare professionals can benefit from this information to provide safer and more effective treatments for children with Chagas disease. This study, the first pharmacokinetics study enrolling infants and neonates with Chagas disease, is an important step towards improving treatments for neglected tropical diseases, emphasizing the need for continued research in this area.
