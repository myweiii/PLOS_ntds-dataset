Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a severe invasive mycosis, affecting the lungs and other important organs of patients in Latin America, notably Brazil. Paracoccidioides is the causative agent of PCM and it was recently included in the World Health Organization (WHO) fungal priority pathogens list to guide research, development and public health action. Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, only one case of concomitant PCM and COVID-19 has been reported. Our work aims to investigate the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with PCM followed at a reference center for infectious diseases in a Brazilian endemic region for PCM. Between March 2020 and September 2022, we identified six individuals with COVID-19 among the 117 patients with PCM evaluated. Although we found a high range of disease severity in the cases analyzed, concomitant disease also represented a severe association. As COVID-19 and PCM may share similar clinical aspects and PCM is neglected, it is probable that COVID-19 has been hampering simultaneous PCM diagnosis, which can explain the absence of new co-infection reports. Our findings call for more attention by health professionals to identify co-infections with Paracoccidioides.
