CarrionÂ´s disease (CD) affects poor communities from the Andean region in South America, where lethal cases have been reported and associated with hemolytic anemia. Therefore, early-stage diagnosis is relevant to treat the early stage of infection, the diagnostic alternatives include serological tests or molecular assays. The serological assays are wildly used because of their low cost and easy application, hence the improvement of the sensitivity and specificity of the serological assays provides better accuracy for the diagnosis CD. In this study, we look for the prediction of specific proteins to B. bacilliformis, the causative agent of CD, and the identification of lineal B-epitopes by in-silico analysis. Using a six-web server, we identified linear epitopes in seven specific proteins which are expected to have antigenic activity.
