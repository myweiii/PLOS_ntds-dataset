Despite recognition of histoplasmosis as a priority disease of public health concern in Kenya and an important AIDS-defining illness, there remains a paucity of research on this neglected fungal disease. Clinical and laboratory capacity for the diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis across Kenya is limited or unknown, and existing diagnostic and therapeutic techniques can be cost-prohibitive. In addition, the fragmentary nature of histoplasmosis research groups worldwide and the under- or over-representation of specific sociodemographic groups and geographic regions in outbreak reports and hospital-based case series have been acknowledged.
This study provides a first look at Histoplasma capsulatum seroprevalence in rural western Kenya and explores risk factors for exposure at this human-animal-environment interface. More broadly, these outcomes will help quantify the burden of H. capsulatum in household and community environments, which may direct further research efforts and inform policy-makers on the prioritisation for clinical services and public health efforts with regards to histoplasmosis.
