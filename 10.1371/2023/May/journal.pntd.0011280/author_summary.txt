Mosquitoes need human blood for the development of their eggs. During this process, when the mosquito bites human already harboring viruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the virus is taken up by the mosquito, which carries the virus for the rest of its life and transmits the virus to healthy individuals during subsequent blood meals. However, the impact of these viruses on the mosquito physiology is poorly understood. This study is an attempt to evaluate the impact of CHIKV infection on the redox biology of Aedes mosquitoes. Oxidative stress is a critical response to several biological activities and is controlled by a vast network of pathways of genes/proteins. Some of these pathways are L-cysteine centric, such as taurine, hypotaurine and glutathione metabolism. By providing dietary supplements of L-cysteine and by reducing the expression of some of the genes in the above mentioned pathways, we studied the role of these pathways in regulating oxidative stress during CHIKV infection. Our results suggest that dietary supplement of L-cysteine and selected genes of the taurine/hypotaurine and glutathione pathways was found to control oxidative damage in the mosquitoes during CHIKV infection by regulating the expression of Glutathione-s-transferases (GST) enzyme, a well known antioxidant molecule.
