Early diagnosis of Buruli ulcer remains a major problem in many endemic countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa which continues to report large wounds as a result. Though reference laboratories with capacity to confirm diagnosis of the disease by recommended PCR method are available in most endemic countries, they are often located long distances from endemic communities and treatment centres. This makes it a challenge to obtain immediate results for patient management. There is therefore the need to have innovative diagnostic tools that can be fully implemented in local health facilities but not compromising accuracy. We have evaluated a diagnostic tool with accuracy like the recommended method with the potential to be used in health facilities closer to the patients.
