Large-scale deworming programs are implemented worldwide to reduce morbidity caused by intestinal worms. As these programs operate in resource-poor-settings, it is important that their operational costs are minimized without jeopardizing the quality of decision-making. We present a framework for evidence-based recommendations for cost-efficient decision-making in deworming programs, using monitoring of therapeutic drug efficacy via stool examination as a case study. To this end, we first assessed the time and the cost of processing stool samples in a laboratory according to different diagnostic methods. Then for each diagnostic method, survey design, and a range of settings (pre-dominant worm species and pre-treatment infection levels), we calculated the probability of correctly detecting a truly reduced therapeutic drug efficacy and the associated operational costs. Generally, the estimated operational costs varied across diagnostic method, survey design, worm species and disease endemicity. Based on our findings, we conclude that the use of the current diagnostic standard, the Kato-Katz method, is justified to assess drug efficacy, but that a change in survey design is warranted. Our methodology, which leverages detailed data on laboratory time and material costs, can also be used to provide evidence-based recommendations for other types of decisions in large-scale deworming programs.
