Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic, vector borne disease of poverty with a high burden throughout the Americas: within Latin America there are an estimated 58,500 new cases per year and 54,050 years of life lost due to disability. Although the World Health Organization has targeted leishmaniasis for elimination and control by 2030, the disease remains a persistent threat. Across the Americas, particularly in Central America, the southeastern United States, and perimeters of the Amazon Basin, risk of infection is increasing in geographic extent and elevation. While it is known that Leishmania parasites, the causative agent of leishmaniasis, are maintained in the environment via a mammalian host, the full suite of wildlife hosts has yet to be documented, which significantly hinders control efforts. Here, we use machine learning and ecological and evolutionary trait profiles of known hosts to identify unrecognized potential wildlife hosts of Leishmania. We identify 136 mammals in the Americas that are likely to be exposed to and infected by zoonotic Leishmania in the wild. The high number of unrecognized potential hosts emphasizes a need to better invest in studying the ecological epidemiology of leishmaniasis. The study provides information and tools to support targeted intervention and management of this important poverty-associated disease.
