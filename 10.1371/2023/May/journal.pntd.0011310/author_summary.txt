Soil transmitted helminths (STH) are highly prevalent in most parts of Kenya especially among school age children (SAC). The National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) in Kenya was launched in 2012 by both Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Education (MoE) and has been offering mass drug administration (MDA) to 28 endemic counties in Kenya. The programme has been targeting all SAC, both enrolled and non-enrolled, as well as those in the pre-schools who live in sub-counties identified as having a high STH infection (prevalence above 20%). The deworming drugs are delivered by trained primary school teachers as recommended by world health organization (WHO). Approximately, over five million SAC and preschool age children (PSAC) have benefitted from the programme for over eight years. The country-wide infection reduced from 32.3% in 2012 to 12.9% in 2018, but varied prevalence rates observed in different counties. However, there are a few counties where the burden of STH has largely remained unchanged after the continued MDA. This study was conducted with a key focus to determine the factors which could be influencing the slow decline of STH infections among school children after continued MDA and give suggestions in future for similar programmes.
