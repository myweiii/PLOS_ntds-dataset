Using a random forest model and future scenarios to project cholera risk, we assessed the achievability of the Global Task Force for Cholera Control 2030 Roadmap in Nigeria, based on sustainable development and environmental protection. The results highlighted how regional inequities within Nigeria will likely prevent the 2030 targets being reached. The northern states in Nigeria are more rural, less developed and have greater levels of insecurity and conflict. Reaching the levels of peace and development achieved in the south at a national level, along with improving urban planning and access and incentives to cholera testing, will be fundamental in reaching the Roadmap targets in Nigeria. Cholera predictions and projections are understudied and here we present the most in-depth projections currently produced for Nigeria. Projections provide a snapshot of potential future conditions and show what is needed going forward to meet and exceed health targets and reduce disease burden. We highlight how quantitative research can be used to inform policy and the relevance of doing so. Quantitative research should fundamentally aim to improve global health and by presenting our work with a strong policy focus, we highlight the relevance and importance of doing so.
