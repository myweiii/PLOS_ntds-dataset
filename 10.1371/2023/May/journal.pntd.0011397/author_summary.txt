The study assessed the risk of transmission of Aedes-borne arboviruses in a community in Cape Coast during the Covid-19 restriction period in 2020. Three larval indices were calculated from the household larval survey in 100 randomly selected houses in the community. Insecticide susceptibility of the female adult Ae. aegypti to four insecticides was performed. The results showed that the risk of a potential outbreak of Aedes-borne diseases in the Covid 19 restriction period was much lower than in 2017 when a similar assessment was done. The low risk was related to frequent clean-up exercises in the community during the Covid-19 restriction period. The mosquito population was resistant to deltamthrin, DDT, bendiocarb and fenitrothion insecticides. However, resistance level was higher in the mosquitoes collected in houses than the mosquitoes collected outside houses. Insecticide use in houses may have contributed to the different level of resistance observed. The study detected F1534C, V1016I and V410L kdr mutations in Ae. aegypti population. The combination of these mutations is known to generate high levels of pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito. The study agrees with sanitation improvement as a tool to control Ae. aegypti and could complement insecticide-based tools in controlling this vector.
