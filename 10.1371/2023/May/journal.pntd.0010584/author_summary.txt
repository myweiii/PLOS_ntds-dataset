Schistosomiasis is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the world. It is caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. In Senegal, the species Schistosoma hæmatobium is the most widespread and responsible for urinary Schistosomiasis in humans. Freshwater snails of the genus Bulinus including Bulinus truncatus, Bulinus globosus, Bulinus senegalensis and Bulinus umbilicatus are its main intermediate hosts. However, Bulinus forskalii, morphologically similar to Bulinus senegalensis is also frequently found but no study has ever mentioned its sensibility to S. hæmatobium in Senegal. The aim of our research is to reveal the relevance of Bulinus forskalii as a potential intermediate host of S. hæmatobium but also to provide an accurate identification of this snail. This study demonstrated the susceptibility of Bulinus forskalii to the S. hæmatobium parasite in Senegal by using innovative and refined identification methods to discriminate this snail and to characterize its infection. This result significantly contributes to the improvement of our knowledge on host-parasite interactions and should be taken into account in future epidemiological studies and schistosomiasis control programs.
