Arenaviruses are a type of RNA virus that primarily exist within rodent reservoirs, which are often virus specific. The family of arenaviruses are divided into two large groups, new world and old world, based upon the geographic region where they were initially isolated. A subset of arenaviruses are capable of being transmitted to humans, where they may cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), a condition characterized by multiorgan system involvement, immune and vascular system dysregulation and that ultimately results in bleeding/hemorrhage and can lead to death. Licensed vaccines and therapies do not exist for many VHF causing arenaviruses. Two such viruses include Junin virus and Guanarito virus. Guinea pigs have been previously used as a model to study disease pathogenesis following new world arenavirus infection. Herein we describe in detail and compare the organ system specific pathology and viral RNA distribution following separate infection in Guinea pigs, with Junin virus and Guanarito virus. This study provides valuable insight into the time course of infection, viral target tissues and similarities between two different new world arenaviruses, that will ultimately aid in development of therapies that may be effective across the spectrum of new world arenaviruses.
