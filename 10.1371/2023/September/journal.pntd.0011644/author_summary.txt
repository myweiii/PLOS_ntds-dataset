Mycetoma is known as a neglected tropical disease causing chronic granulomatous inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue due to infection by microorganisms. In particular, a simple molecular diagnostic method for fungal mycetoma (eumycetoma) is required for a community-based medical treatment, because of the difficulty in isolating and identifying the causative fungus. In this study, we established the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to identify Madurella strains which are common causative agents of eumycetoma. The results suggest that diagnosis using the LAMP reaction enables specific and sensitive detection of Madurella by incubating the sample at a constant temperature and visually confirming DNA amplification. Based on these results, we expect that the LAMP-based diagnosis will contribute to the treatment of eumycetoma in rural settings
