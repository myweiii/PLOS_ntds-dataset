Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal infection that is common in Brazil and other parts of Latin America. There are two clinical forms: the chronic, which affects rural workers and the acute, which is usually more severe and tends to affect young people. The Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, is endemic for PCM, and juvenile cases have increased in the recent years. This is concerning for pregnant women since they could also be affected. In addition, young women could get pregnant during the PCM treatment because itraconazole, the main medication to treat PCM, may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptives. This could represent a risk to both mother and fetus because acute PCM is more invasive, reaching abdominal organs. PCM treatment in pregnant women is a challenge because the available oral drugs to treat this mycosis can be harmful to the fetus. There is little information about this important issue in the literature. Therefore, we investigated cases of PCM in pregnancy performing a search in the databases of a PCM specialized center in Rio de Janeiro state. We found 18 pregnant patients in the period of 1980â€“2020, most of them presenting acute PCM (n = 14, 77.8%) with a moderate to severe clinical profile. Most pregnancies occurred during PCM treatment (n = 11, 61.1%), which created difficulties in the management of both conditions. Some of these cases experienced complications, including prematurity, low birth weight, and two fetal deaths. PCM in pregnancy is an important public health issue and the authors hope to contribute with the knowledge of this subject, to improve care for this vulnerable population.
