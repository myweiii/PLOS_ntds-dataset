Artesunate (ART) has been reported to have an antifibrotic effect while the underlying mechanism has not been systematically elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of ART on anti-hepatic fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. We found that ART significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HSCs. And also ART is effective against liver fibrosis using Mongolian gerbil model induced by Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) infection. Hyp content decreased significantly in the ART-H group compared to the MOD group and GPX activity was significantly higher in the ART-H group than in the MOD group. Besides, ART treatment significantly reduced collagen production (p<0.05). A total of 158 DEGs and 44 differentially expressed miRNAs related to ART-induced anti-schistosomiasis liver fibrosis were identified through transcriptomics approach. These DEGs were implicated in key pathways such as immune and inflammatory response, integrin-mediated signaling and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that ART is effective against liver fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified 30 host candidate regulators in response to ART, and provides a basis for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ART on anti-hepatic fibrosis.
