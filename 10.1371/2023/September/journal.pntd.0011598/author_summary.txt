Plasmodium vivax infections are the most common cause of malaria outside of Sub-Saharan Africa and often prevalent in areas with limited healthcare. A vaccine that interrupts parasite transmission from the mosquito would help limit the burden of vivax malaria. The pre-erythrocytic stages represent an important bottleneck in the life cycle prior to the disease-causing blood stage. However, there is limited knowledge of sporozoite and liver stage antigens that might be suitable vaccine candidates. To address this gap, we identified and characterized sporozoite antigens that could potentially be targets of a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine. We successfully evaluated three novel candidates as targets of inhibitory antibody responses against liver stage infection and development. Data from this study supports advancement of these targets for further P. vivax vaccine development.
