Plague is an animal disease that can affect humans. The disease involves three main actors: the bacillus, the flea, and the rodent. Madagascar is the country with the most human cases of plague in the world. Each year, cases of plague are reported there. This is due to several factors, including the climate and altitude, which are favorable to rodents and fleas. Factors that may contribute to the occurrence of human cases of plague are often those that facilitate contact between human rodents and fleas. The lifestyles of people, their types of housing, and their environment may be some of the factors that facilitate this contact. In plague-endemic areas of Madagascar, households with thatch-roofed, ground floor house types are more likely to have human plague cases compared to households with other characteristics. Households with these characteristics may provide shelter and protection for rodents and are more attractive to rodents, promoting flea-rodent-human contact. This study provides insights into the mechanism of human plague occurrence in Madagascar and other countries.
