The study aimed to understand the protein expression profiles in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes resistant to permethrin and temephos insecticides using quantitative proteomics. The results revealed permethrin and temephos resistance in Ae. aegypti dengue hotspot and non-hotspot areas in Penang Island, Malaysia. The LC-MS/MS LFQ identified 501 and 577 differentially expressed proteins in adult and larvae Ae. aegypti. Furthermore, significantly enriched pathways of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, glycolysis, and citrate cycle. A few differentially expressed proteins were validated as potential candidates for insecticide-resistant screening, prediction and monitoring in field strain Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia.
