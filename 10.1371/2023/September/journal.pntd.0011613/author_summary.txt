Adipokines have not been studied in acute dengue, despite their emerging role in inducing and regulating inflammation. Therefore, we sought to identify adipokine levels in patients with varying severities of acute dengue to understand their role in disease pathogenesis. We determined the levels of leptin, resistin, omentin, adiponectin, IFNÎ², and NS1 in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) at admission (febrile phase) and at the critical phase. Resistin levels and omentin levels were significantly higher in patients who developed DHF. Omentin levels in the febrile phase also correlated with the AST and ALT levels; as well as serum leptin levels with both AST and ALT. Serum adiponectin levels in the febrile phase did not correlate with any of the other adipokines or with liver enzymes, but inversely correlated with CRP levels. The data suggest that adipokines are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of dengue, which should be further explored for the potential to be used as prognostic markers and as therapeutic targets.
