    "Background": "Cutaneous disseminated sporotrichosis (CDS), also called hematogenous sporotrichosis, is a rare condition that usually affects immunocompromised patients. The current work presents the case of a woman with diabetes mellitus associated with CDS.",
    "Case presentation": "A 59-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus presented with a two-year history of ulcerated rashes on the left ankle and both sides of the jaw. Physical examination revealed three annular areas of erythematous and raised plaque with an ulcer over the left ankle and both sides of the jaw. Based on laboratory findings, elevated blood glucose concentration and decreased white cell count were observed. Sporothrix globosa was identified in the mycological culture of biopsied tissue from the three lesions and this was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The skin lesions healed after two-month itraconazole therapy.",
    "Conclusions": "Diabetes is a risk factor for disseminated sporotrichosis, which may be induced by hematogeneous spread, repeated inoculation, or autoinoculation. This study raises awareness among clinicians, with regard to the notion that people with possibly altered immune function are potentially vulnerable to severe clinical forms of sporotrichosis."
