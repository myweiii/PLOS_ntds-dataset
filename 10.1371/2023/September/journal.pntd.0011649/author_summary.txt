West Nile virus and Usutu virus can cause seasonal epidemics in humans. They are maintained in a transmission cycle between wild birds and Culex mosquitoes, and humans that are bitten by infected mosquitoes can develop life-threatening neurological disease. Certain Culex species carry the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia which can block virus transmission in mosquitoes. In Belgium, it is currently unknown which Culex species can transmit West Nile virus and/or Usutu virus, or if they carry Wolbachia bacteria. In our study, we captured wild mosquitoes from Belgium and infected them with West Nile virus or Usutu virus. We found that a common European species (Culex pipiens pipiens, the northern house mosquito) could transmit West Nile virus, whereas a lesser-known species (Culex modestus) could transmit Usutu virus. Wolbachia bacteria could be found in almost all Culex pipiens pipiens, but not in Culex modestus, suggesting that Wolbachia prevalence is species-specific. More research is needed to understand if Wolbachia can influence West Nile virus and Usutu virus transmission in Culex mosquitoes. This is the first report on the ability of Culex mosquitoes to transmit West Nile virus and Usutu virus in Belgium, forewarning the risk of transmission to humans.
