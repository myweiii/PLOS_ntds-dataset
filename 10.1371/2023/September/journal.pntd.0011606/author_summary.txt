Bartonella quintana, best known as the cause of trench fever in soldiers during the First World War, can also cause endocarditis in humans. It is transmitted predominantly by the feces of body lice. After entering the bloodstream, it may become localized in damaged valves or tissues. Nevertheless, B. quintana remains an uncommon cause of infective endocarditis with few cases reported worldwide. However, the number of reported cases of this pathogen has recently increased mostly in refugee camps and among underhoused individuals in Europe and the USA.
We describe here 12 cases of B. quintana endocarditis in patients from Mayotte/the Comoros archipelago in the Southwest Indian Ocean. We highlight the presence of this pathogen in patients from this region characterized by high rates of poverty and population exchanges with Southern Africa.
Genotyping analysis on three strains from this cohort revealed the presence of a single genotype, different from those observed in Europe and Africa, suggesting the presence of a single B. quintana genotype in the Comoros archipelago, or a potential common source of contamination.
This study sheds light on the etiology of this neglected form of endocarditis and should raise local awareness of this disease.
