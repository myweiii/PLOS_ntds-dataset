With increased understanding of genomes and transcriptomes it has become clear that not all RNAs code for protein, in contrast to the Central Dogma of molecular biology. Nevertheless, many such “non-coding” RNAs have functions in their own right. For example, long non-coding (lnc)RNAs comprise a large proportion of the human genome and control expression of some human protein coding genes. In parasites, lncRNAs remain understudied and poorly understood. This paper provides the first description of the lncRNA complement of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica. We show that lncRNA expression changes as parasites develop, in a similar manner to protein-coding mRNA, suggesting important roles in parasite growth and development. Some lncRNAs show correlated developmental expression with mRNAs coding for important parasite proteins, suggesting that they may interact, suggesting regulatory functions for fluke lncRNAs. A larger subset of lncRNA may interact with micro (mi)RNAs, another type of non-coding RNA that are important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. These interactions are, again, important additions to our understanding of fluke lncRNA biology. Our ultimate goal is to discover ways to inhibit these interactions that could be used for new medicines for fluke infections which are a global scourge on the farming industry.
