Kinetoplastid parasites are a health burden in tropical and subtropical countries. Important human diseases produced by kinetoplastids include Human African trypanosomiasis which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, Chagas disease, due to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi and the leishmaniases which are caused by infection with parasites of the Leishmania genus. We previously reported the discovery and isolation of a novel family of four macrolides, produced by the fungus Strasseria geniculata with antiplasmodial activity. In the present study we analyze these strasseriolides for activity against kinetoplastid parasites. Out of the four strasseriolides tested, C and D were active against intracellular T. cruzi and L. donovani amastigotes with EC50 values in the low micromolar range. Compound C is fast-acting against both intracellular amastigotes and extracellular trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi cultured in vitro by infecting mammalian cells, and lowers parasitaemia in acute models of infection of Chagas disease. Hence, strasseriolide C is a promising candidate for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat kinetoplastid diseases.
