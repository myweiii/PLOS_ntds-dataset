Our study describes a drug repurposing screen against the whipworm Trichuris, which causes the neglected tropical disease trichuriasis. Despite the pressing need for more effective drugs to treat whipworm infections, Trichuris has been the focus of extremely few drug screens. Using a combination of comparative genomics, and data on drugs and their targets from the ChEMBL database, we predicted that 409 drugs approved for human use would target Trichuris proteins. Using a high-throughput screening platform, we then screened these 409 drugs against Trichuris adults ex vivo. Our high hit rate of 12% demonstrated the utility of our comparative genomics approach to predict worm proteins for targeting by approved drugs. We subsequently tested the most active compounds in Trichuris-infected mice, but there were no significant hits in vivo. Interestingly, this accorded with a previously published screen against Trichuris, which also reported promising ex vivo hits but low activity in mice. We discuss possible reasons for this finding, and important implications for optimising future drug screens against Trichuris.
