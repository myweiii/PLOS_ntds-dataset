Government of India implemented triple drug regimen for mass drug administration (IDA-MDA) in selected districts from December 2018 to accelerate lymphatic filariasis elimination in the country. Nagpur district in state of Maharashtra, India was one of the five districts where this strategy was first implemented in January 2019 and the reported treatment coverage in one of the evaluation units in the district, EU-2 was 85.0%. This district had previously completed thirteen rounds of DA-MDA till the year 2017. TAS carried out in 2016 showed that the district did not reach elimination level, CFA < 2.0% in children aged 6–7 years. A coverage evaluation survey was carried out in EU-2 following the first round of IDA-MDA and both quantitative and qualitative data was collected to assess the treatment coverage, the level of community preparation and identify the gaps, if any, for improvement. Among the surveyed population (1601), 78.0% received the drugs (programme reach) and 66.1% consumed the drugs (survey coverage). The study showed an effective treatment coverage above 65% in rural areas and a sub-optimal coverage in urban/peri-urban areas (≤65%). There exists a challenge in achieving an effective coverage in urban and peri-urban areas with the new treatment regimen. Appropriate strategies are necessary to improve the treatment coverage in all the areas so as to achieve the elimination target in the evaluation unit. Only 51.6% DOT was observed which needs to be improved.
