Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease transmitted to mammalian hosts primarily by blood-feeding insects named triatomines. The blood meal is required for triatomine females to initiate egg production. Virgin and mated females are capable of making and laying eggs but only the latter have a high epidemiological impact since after each meal, they lay fertile eggs that result in hundreds of offspring. Rhodnius prolixus is one of the most important triatomine vectors and historically, has been the model for studying insect physiology. Interestingly, although the size of the blood meal is the same for both virgin and mated R. prolixus females, mated females have increased egg production capacity. Here, we describe for the first time, molecular, biochemical, endocrine, and behavioral features that are differentially expressed in virgin and mated females of R. prolixus and that influence their reproductive physiology and behavior. A better understanding of triatomine reproductive capacity may provide targets for developing novel strategies to control vector populations, thereby reducing vector-host contacts and disease transmission.
