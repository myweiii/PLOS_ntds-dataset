    "Background": "In South-East Asia, Thailand is the country with the highest number of human autochthonous cases of leishmaniases mostly due to Leishmania martiniquensis. Their transmission remains unresolved to date even though sand flies are known vectors of leishmaniases. As such, we focused a study on the sand fly fauna of a cave in Thailand to explore the biodiversity of potential Leishmania vectors.",
    "Main results": "We carried out an inventory in Pha Tong cave. We caught and identified 570 Phlebotomine sand flies (452 females and 118 males) and identified 14 species belonging to the genera Phlebotomus, Idiophlebotomus, Chinius, Sergentomyia and Grassomyia. Among these 14 species, two could not be related to known sand fly species. Herein, we propose the description of two new sand fly species, previously unknown to science.",
    "Conclusions": "We propose the description of two new sand fly species for Science with morphological and molecular evidence. Ph. shadenae n. sp. was also found to be distributed in the south of Thailand and in Laos. Future studies need to determine whether these two species can play a role as vectors of Leishmania parasites, Trypanosomatids or Phlebovirus. Most of the species caught in the present study are strictly cavernicolous except Grassomyia sp. and a few Sergentomyia."
