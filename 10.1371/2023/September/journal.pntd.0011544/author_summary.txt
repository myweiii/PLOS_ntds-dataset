South America is the region with the highest burden of congenital toxoplasmosis and with the most pathogenic genotypes. Brazil is considered a country with a high prevalence of toxoplasmosis and a hotspot for outbreaks. The outcome of congenital transmission is influenced by factors such as T. gondii genotype, strain virulence, maternal immune status, maternal parasitemia, gestational age at the time of infection, and prenatal treatment. The last point mentioned is still controversial and raises several concerns, such as the financial impact of the monitoring and treatment of pregnant women and their children, the side effects of the medications used, and the benefit of investing in public health policies to mitigate toxoplasmosis. Information on the effectiveness of prenatal treatment is limited since it is challenging to carry out randomized studies. In the present manuscript, we evaluated the benefit of drug treatment for pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis as a protective factor in reducing the risk of congenital infection. Also, we evaluated the side effects of prenatal and postnatal drug use in children and assessed the risk of discontinuing the medication in infants. We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) to report this study.
