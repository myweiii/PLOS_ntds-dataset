The mosquito microbiome plays a critical role in shaping interactions with human pathogens. The factors that contribute to shaping the composition of the mosquito microbiome are of high importance due to its role in pathogen interactions and the successful development of control strategies. In other organisms, both host and environment shape the microbiome composition, but the role of the host in shaping the mosquito microbiome is less clear. Previously, we have shown that different lines of Aedes aegypti harbor different microbiomes when reared in the same environment. We were curious to see if these differences could still be detected after further generations in the same insectary and across environments in a different insectary. We found that the microbiome differed between these lines in each insectary indicating both host and environment play a role in establishing the microbiome. Our results indicate that different lines of Ae. aegypti will interact with their environment differently to shape their microbiome, which could potentially influence interactions with human pathogens and/or the effectiveness of control strategies. More broadly, our results are of interest for the ecology of host-microbe interactions.
