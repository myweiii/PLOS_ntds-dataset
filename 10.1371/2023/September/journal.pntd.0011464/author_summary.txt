Fungal infections are present globally, but the burden is higher in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these infections occur because of underline clinical conditions such as HIV, TB, cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while some may occur without underline conditions. We used the prevalence of susceptible populations to estimate the burden of fungal diseases in Sudan. Based on that, we found a total of 5 million Sudanese suffering from fungal infection. The most common disease was scalp infection (tinea capitis), followed by recurrent vulvovaginitis. Fungal eye infection was estimated to affect 6,552 patients, and the subcutaneous neglected tropical disease eumycetoma affects 16,837 individuals. We also reported a high burden for HIV- and TB-related mycoses. The study highlighted the need to develop surveillance programs for fungal infections in Sudan.
