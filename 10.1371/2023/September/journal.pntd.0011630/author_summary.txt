SFTSV causes a high mortality disease in humans, especially in China, Japan, and South Korea. For a better understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of SFTSVs, our study performed phylogenetic and genetic reassortment analyses using the largely collected genomic information of SFTSVs. It appeared that dominant endemic SFTSVs in China, Japan, and South Korea likely diverged several centuries ago. Movement of vector (e.g., tick) or non-human mammalian reservoirs possibly played a key role in human SFTSV spillover and infrequently led to international spread among three countries. Purifying selection strongly limited the generation of novel variants through either molecular mutations or genetic reassortment. However, we observed a few amino acid sites under positive selection, especially in glycoproteins which might limitedly allow the generation of variants within a clade, in which molecular evolution might not be a major cause for the current emergence of SFTSVs but the ecological or epidemiological change possibly be a more plausible factor. However, we should still carefully monitor the evolutionary dynamics of SFTSV considering the potential of host adaptation in humans.
