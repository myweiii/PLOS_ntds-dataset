Nematodes include some of the most abundant animals on Earth, found in almost every natural habitat. Globally, parasitic nematodes cause major impacts to human, animal and plant health. Little is known about how parasitic nematodes interact with microbes despite the microbe-rich environments that many of them inhabit. In other invertebrate animals, Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) are critical in defense against pathogenic microbes. By characterising nematode AMP diversity and exploring the role of nematode-derived AMPs we could reveal novel targets for antimicrobial and anthelmintic development.
In this study we profiled the distribution of five known AMP groups across the nematode phylum. This homology-directed approach demonstrated that, nematodes appear rich in AMP diversity with major differences in the abundance and distribution of putative AMP-encoding genes across nematode lifestyles and clades. In addition, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show that many of the identified AMP-encoding genes appear biologically relevant in nematode life stages that interact with the host. This study provides a database of potential nematode-derived AMPs which can drive functional analyses to explore the role of nematode AMPs.
