Molecular xenomonitoring, screening insects for pathogen DNA/RNA, may be used for surveillance of diseases transmitted by insects. Since the proportion of insects infected with pathogens is very low in areas targeted for disease elimination, large numbers of females need to be screened. We compared three different methods for collecting Phlebotomus argentipes sand fly females, the vector of parasites causing the disease visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent, to determine which collected the largest number of females. Other factors that may also influence selection of a particular method of collection by a disease control programme, such as the time it takes to collect and sort samples, the acceptance of householders for a particular collection method and whether RNA degradation in insect samples differed between collection methods, were also considered. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (CDC-LTs) proved to be more useful than two types of aspiration methods for collecting higher numbers of sand fly females and RNA preservation was retained. Furthermore, they took less time to install than to perform aspirations and were favoured by householders. Therefore, CDC-LTs were considered to be the most suitable collection method for molecular xenomonitoring of sand flies in India.
