    "Background": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is associated with four serotypes of the dengue virus. Children are vulnerable to infection with the dengue virus, particularly those who have been previously infected with a different dengue serotype. Sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices (KAP) are essential for dengue prevention and control. This study aims to estimate the dengue seropositivity for study participants and to examine the association between households\u2019 dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and children\u2019s risk of dengue seropositivity, while accounting for socioeconomic and demographic differences in Brazil.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This analysis was based on a cross-sectional study from Fortaleza, Brazil between November 2019, and February 2020. There were 392 households and 483 participant children who provided a sample of sufficient quality for serological analysis. The main exposure was a household\u2019s dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices, assessed through a questionnaire to construct a composite KAP score categorized into three levels: low, moderate, and high. The main outcome is dengue immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies, collected using dried blood spots and assessed with Panbio Dengue IgG indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) test commercial kits.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our results provide insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in Fortaleza, Brazil in children, and certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics associated with children\u2019s risk of being seropositive. They also suggest that KAP may not identify those more at-risk for dengue, although understanding and enhancing households\u2019 KAP is crucial for effective community dengue control and prevention initiatives."
