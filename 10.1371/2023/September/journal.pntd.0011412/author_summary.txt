Scrub typhus is a febrile illness common in the Asia Pacific area. It is caused by bacteria in the genus Orientia and spread via the bite of Trombiculid mites. While we know that scrub typhus is present in Indonesia, there is very limited information on how widespread the problem is. To address this problem, this study aimed to create a map of geographic areas that are at risk of scrub typhus by analysing existing data on human, mites, and other animals. By doing so, we hope to provide a better understanding of the extent and distribution of scrub typhus in Indonesia. Evidence of Orientia tsutsugamushi, has been reported from all the five main islands of Indonesia. South Sumatra and Biak had the strongest evidence. However, there was no evidence of presence or absence in about two thirds of the regions and most of the data points were collected before 1946. While the available data suggest that scrub typhus is prevalent in Indonesia, up-to-date information is lacking. Therefore, it is crucial to increase scrub typhus surveillance to improve our understanding of its burden and distribution, and eventually inform treatment strategies.
