In this study, we focused on yaws, a neglected tropical disease, and its causative agent, bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE). Yaws is currently reported in 13 endemic countries in Africa, southern Asia, and the Pacific region. It predominantly infects children and causes papilloma, ulcers and, if untreated, progresses into disfiguring deformation of the bone and cartilage. The second yaws eradication campaign, known as the Morges strategy, is currently ongoing and led by World Health Organization (WHO). There is, however, accumulating genetic evidence that TPE strains naturally infect nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we wanted to find out if the most serious argument–nonhuman and human infecting strains of TPE differ in the previously unknown parts of their genomes, that was raised by the scientific community against nonhuman primates as a source for human yaws infection–is true. Our findings highlight NHPs as a possible source for human yaws, although in this study, we cannot provide insight into the functional aspects of spillover between humans and NHPs. Moreover, these findings underline that Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue can only be eliminated in humans, while the bacterium is still present in nonhuman primates in Sub-Saharan Africa. Whether or not human and nonhuman primate infecting strains are epidemiologically linked is subject to ongoing research. Nevertheless, our results highlight the need for a long-term yaws surveillance program in areas where the infected NHP populations occur.
