A novel Trichinella spiralis serine proteinase (TsSPc) has been identified from ES antigens of T. spiralis intestinal infective larvae (IIL) by immunoproteomics. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological characteristics of TsSPc and its role in larval invasion. rTsSPc was cloned and expressed, and rTsSPc and native TsSPc in crude and ES antigens of various worm stages were recognized by anti-rTsSPc antibodies, suggesting that TsSPc is a secretory protein with good antigenicity. Results of qPCR, Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) showed that TsSPc was expressed at diverse stages, and mainly localized at cuticle, stichosome and intrauterine embryos of this nematode. rTsSPc had enzymatic activity of natural serine proteinases for hydrolyzing the substrates (BAEE, casein and collagen I), but enzymatic activity of rTsSPc was completely lost after its enzyme active sites were mutated. IIFT, Far western and confocal microscopy showed that rTsSPc specifically bound to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and the binding site was principally localized in cell membrane and cytoplasm. An in vitro larval invasion test revealed that rTsSPc evidently accelerated larval invasion of IECs; whereas anti-rTsSPc antibodies and TsSPc-specific dsRNA significantly impeded larval invasion. The results indicated that TsSPc participated in larval invasion of host gut mucosa, and may be considered as a candidate vaccine target for intercepting Trichinella intrusion and infection.
