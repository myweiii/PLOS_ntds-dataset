Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus, caused febrile human disease. Studies have shown that the virus was constantly mutating, and the clinical features of distinct mutational genotypes were also different. Therefore, routine surveillance of this diseaseâ€™s epidemic features is necessary, especially in high-incidence areas. In this study, we conducted timely and systematic research on the disease characteristics, SFTSV diversity, and the correlation between virus genome variation and clinical diseases based on 202 severe fevers with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients in Hubei Province, from 2018 to 2022. Our findings identified at least six prevalent genotypes of SFTSV in Hubei Province and revealed that the dominant genotype of the virus changed over time, indicating a complex genotype diversity of Hubei SFTSV strains. Frequent genetic exchange was also revealed by phylogenetic analysis involving 3 reassortment strains and 8 recombination strains. Despite the limited sample size, SFTSV C1 genotype may be relevant to higher mortality with significant augment level of inflammatory marker serum amyloid A (SAA) than other four genotypes. This study updated the disease characteristics of SFTS with SFTSV epidemic diversity in Hubei Province and provided important insights into the relationship between viral mutations and disease severity.
