Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection caused predominantly by Wuchereria bancrofti. Infection can lead to significant lymphatic dysfunction, including hydroceles and lymphedema, which can progress to elephantiasis. The World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) recommends mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic populations to eliminate the disease. GPELF recommendations for MDA include ivermectin (IVM) plus albendazole (IA) in sub-Saharan Africa where onchocerciasis is present. In 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration approved use of moxidectin for treatment of onchocerciasis. Moxidectin is a macrocytic lactone, similar to IVM, but more lipophilic, with a larger volume of distribution and longer half-life. Onchocerciasis studies found moxidectin to be superior to IVM for clearance of microfiladermia in people with onchocerciasis, with a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile similar to that of ivermectin. Moxidectin has not yet been studied, alone or in combination with other antihelminthic drugs. This is a safety evaluation of the first trial of moxidectin combination therapy for LF, which shows that moxidectin combination regimens are well tolerated in Wuchereria bancrofti-infected patients, with a TEAE profile comparable to standard ivermectin containing regimens.
