Fifty patients with P. vivax malaria and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency were given the WHO-recommended, primaquine regimen of 0.75 mg/kg body weight once per week for 8 weeks. Treatment was highly effective and well tolerated in most patients. Two patients had a significant (>5g/dl) fall in haemoglobin and one was hospitalised for intravenous fluids; both were able to complete the primaquine regimen.
