Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first human retrovirus isolated in the early 1980s. It is estimated that approximately 10 million people worldwide are currently infected with HTLV-1, and most people living with HTLV (PLwHTLV) live in developing countries. The virus is associated with a wide range of diseases, including neoplasms such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and progressive and disabling myelopathy, but most PLwHTLV are unaware of their serologic status. HTLV-1 is transmitted through contact with contaminated blood and derivatives, sexually, and from mother to child, especially through breastfeeding. Only recently has WHO recognized HTLV-1 as a as threatening pathogen to human, but in many parts of the world HTLV screening is not performed in blood banks or in pregnant women. This may promote silent intrafamilial transmission of the virus across generations and promote familial clustering of the virus and associated diseases. In this study, we investigated the familial clustering of HTLV-1 infection in the state of Bahia, an endemic area for this virus in Brazil. We found that both sexual and vertical pathways contribute to the transmission and persistence of the virus in families across multiple generations. Therefore, in addition to expanding screening for pregnant women and providing infant formula to infected mothers, it is of utmost importance to combat sexual transmission through effective measures that can help address this serious and neglected public health problem.
