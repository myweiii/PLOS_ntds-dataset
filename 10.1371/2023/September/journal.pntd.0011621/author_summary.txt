The African trypanosome is a single-celled parasite that causes African Sleeping Sickness in humans and related diseases in many animals. It reproduces in the blood of an infected organism, completely exposed to the immune system, but survives due to its ability to repeatedly disguise itself with new surface coat proteins that fool the antibody response. The African trypanosome has thousands of these Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs) in its genome to switch onto the parasite surface. Therefore, trypanosomiasis is centered on the antibody-VSG interaction and how it varies over time. At the most basic level, understanding the possibilities and constraints of VSG protein architecture is a critical foundation to understand the interaction of the pathogen with the host immune system. The work in this paper thoroughly characterizes this genomic collection of VSGs at the molecular level, classifying the coat proteins into related families based on several important criteria, thereby providing the groundwork for developing an understanding of how this organism is able to evade immunity and thrive during infection.
