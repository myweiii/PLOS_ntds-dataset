Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a group of intestinal parasites which globally infect more than 1.5 billion people, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 260 million preschool-age and 654 million school-age children live in areas where the transmission of STH is very high. The risk of parasitic diseases is estimated to be very high in Afghanistan, but studies are rarely done on STH in Afghanistan. So, this study was conducted with main goals to estimate the prevalence and intensity of STH and its associated factors among primary school children in Kandahar city of Afghanistan. This study found that prevalence of STH is high among school children. Most of the factors associated with increased STH infections in Kandahar city school children are related to poverty, decreased sanitation, and improper hygiene. Improvement of socioeconomic status, sanitation, and health education to promote public awareness about health and hygiene together with periodic mass deworming programs are better strategies for the control of STH infections in Afghanistan.
