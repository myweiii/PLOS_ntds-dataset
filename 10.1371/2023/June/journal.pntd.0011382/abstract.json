    "Background": "This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the efficacy of all available treatments for severe melioidosis in decreasing hospital mortality and to identify eradication therapies with low disease recurrence rates and minimal risk of adverse drug events (AEs).",
    "Methodology": "Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) were searched from Medline and Scopus databases from their inception until July 31, 2022. RCTs that compared the efficacy between treatment regimens for severe melioidosis or eradication therapy of melioidosis, measured outcomes of in-hospital mortality, disease recurrence, drug discontinuation, or AEs, were included for review. A two-stage NMA with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of treatment regimens.",
    "Principal findings": "Fourteen RCTs were included in the review. Ceftazidime plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), ceftazidime plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and cefoperazone-sulbactam plus TMP-SMX had a lower mortality rate than other treatments and were ranked as the top three most appropriate treatments for severe melioidosis with the SUCRA of 79.7%, 66.6%, and 55.7%, respectively. However, these results were not statistically significant. For eradication therapy, treatment with doxycycline monotherapy for 20 weeks was associated with a significantly higher risk of disease recurrence than regimens containing TMP-SMX (i.e.,TMP-SMX for 20 weeks, TMP-SMX plus doxycycline plus chloramphenicol for more than 12 weeks, and TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for more than 12 weeks). According to the SUCRA, TMP-SMX for 20 weeks was ranked as the most efficacious eradication treatment (87.7%) with the lowest chance of drug discontinuation (86.4%), while TMP-SMX for 12 weeks had the lowest risk of AEs (95.6%).",
    "Conclusion": "Our results found a non-significant benefit of ceftazidime plus G-CSF and ceftazidime plus TMP-SMX over other treatments for severe melioidosis. TMP-SMX for 20 weeks was associated with a lower recurrence rate and minimal risk of adverse drug events compared to other eradication treatments. However, the validity of our NMA may be compromised by the limited number of included studies and discrepancies in certain study parameters. Thus, additional well-designed RCTs are needed to improve the therapy of melioidosis."
