To control African trypanosomiasis, tsetse populations must be reduced to levels that impede disease transmission. Limited reliable information on tsetse temporal dynamics hinders the implementation of effective control strategies. We used two empirical modelling strategies (zero-inflated Poisson and generalized linear Poisson) to link tsetse abundance with environmental and weather data, to understand and explain tsetse temporal dynamics in a heterogeneous environment. Tsetse numbers were consistently high within 1.0 km of the reserve outer boundary due to favorable breeding sites, resting sites, and host availability. Beyond 1.0 km of the reserve boundary, tsetse numbers increased after a month of increased rainfall, but started to decline if rainfall persisted beyond a month. For these localities, higher tsetse numbers were also found in areas with NDVI values above 0.7. These insights provide valuable guidance for the timing and location of tsetse control strategies around Shimba Hills National Reserve, particularly considering the limited resources available.
