Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by species of the parasite Leishmania, transmitted by the sand fly bite. The disease manifests in different forms: asymptomatic, cutaneous, and visceral. The immunological response of the infected individual is critical in the clinical manifestation of the infection by Leishmania. Till today, we do not understand why some infected people with the parasite Leishmania, living in the same endemic area, develop the disease and others do not. Our work is to study the DNA of infected people developing the disease Cutaneous Leishmaniasis and compare it to those remaining and living in the same area. The gene CARD8 has a relevant role in the regulation of immunological response. In this work, we look for differences in a small piece of DNA fragment of the gene CARD8 to establish if the single nucleotide DNA sequence variation occurs more frequently in people developing the disease than people who do not. We showed here that some individuals who develop the disease possess a small fragment of DNA called haplotype of the CARD8 gene that may contribute to some people to progress to disease development. However, this does not mean that all individuals bearing this haplotype will develop the disease when infected with Leishmania.
