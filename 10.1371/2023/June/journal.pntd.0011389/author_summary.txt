Schistosomiasis is still a disease imposing great threat to human life and which is far from elimination. The identification and function of many schistosome antigens remains limited, which constrains the development of schistosomiasis vaccines and new diagnostics markers. Schistosomes rely on their neuromuscular systems to coordinate important locomotory behaviors. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is critical for normal physiological and neuropathological conditions, which are of great importance to the movement of the parasites both within and between its hosts. THs from both S. mansoni and S. japonicum and their enzyme activities have been discovered, however, the role of these proteins during infection have not been explored. In this study we show SjTH may be expressed in the head, on the tegument surface, and along the intestinal intima of the parasites, associated with both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. This protein effectively stimulates the host immune response and exhibited highly encouraging performance for schistosomiasis immunodiagnosis. We also show that immunization with the recombinant SjTH was able to protect mice from a challenge S. japonicum infection. Overall, these results indicate the SjTH holds potential value as an immunoprotection target.
