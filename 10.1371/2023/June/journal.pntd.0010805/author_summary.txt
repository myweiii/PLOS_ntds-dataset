This assessment analyzes the capacity of health facilities across Ghana to provide services for lymphoedema, a common manifestation of lymphatic filariasis. Ghana has been working towards lymphatic filariasis elimination over the past two decades. In order to receive official elimination acknowledgement from the WHO, a country must achieve and document a number of indicators including the readiness of health facilities to provide high quality treatment. In this study, the direct inspection protocol (DIP) tool was used to measure health facilitiesâ€™ capacity to meet key competencies of lymphoedema care related to trained staff, education materials, medications and commodities, and patient tracking. The information collected provides evidence on availability and quality of morbidity management services which can be included in an elimination dossier for lymphatic filariasis. These findings can inform future interventions and approaches to further improve the capacity of health facilities to manage lymphoedema, hydrocele and related complications of lymphatic filariasis.
