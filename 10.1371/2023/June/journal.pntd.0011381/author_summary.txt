Leprosy remains an important public health problem. More than 200,000 cases are still diagnosed yearly, with Brazil in second place regarding the highest number of cases. Studies involving spatial analysis have been used to assist in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating health actions to prioritize areas with higher transmission, therefore, presents a higher risk of illness. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of the epidemiological risk of leprosy in the municipalities of Minas Gerais. The epidemiological risk was estimated from leprosy indicators related to the magnitude of the endemic disease and the strength of morbidity and transmission of the disease. We identified the formation of areas with higher leprosy epidemiological risk in the state, highlighting the macroregions Northwest, Northeast, East, and South East, which were found to have a higher proportion of municipalities at high epidemiological risk throughout the study period. Moreover, the North macroregion gained epidemiological importance in the last analyzed period. The low risk macroregions were Southeast, Central, Center-South and South. Our results provide potential ways to guide the organization of timely epidemiological surveillance practices and reinforce the importance of intensifying actions to combat leprosy in these municipalities.
