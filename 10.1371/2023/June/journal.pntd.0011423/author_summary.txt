Ross River virus (RRV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes outbreaks of fever and joint pain in endemic regions of Australia and some Pacific islands. Arboviruses may spread globally if infected travellers are bitten by potential mosquito vectors in previously unaffected countries with highly susceptible human populations. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes have not been incriminated as natural RRV vectors, but are highly prevalent in Malaysia and spread other arboviruses such as dengue virus. We showed that Malaysian Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus could potentially transmit RRV from as early as 3 days after an infectious blood meal. Ae. albopictus demonstrates higher vector competence for transmitting RRV than Ae. aegypti, as it can be infected with lower oral doses, displays higher transmission rates in saliva (100% by 10 days), and higher viral loads in heads and saliva. We tested 240 patient blood samples from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and found only a small proportion (0.8%) had neutralizing antibodies against RRV. In summary, Malaysia is at risk of an RRV epidemic due to presence of a naive host population and abundant competent mosquito vectors. Surveillance efforts and epidemic preparedness should include RRV.
