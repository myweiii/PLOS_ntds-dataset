The lepromatous pole (LL) is the prototype of leprosy patients, contributing to its stigma. Nerve function impairment in LL patients may be clinically asymptomatic for an extended period, and despite its long history, lepromatous leprosy nerve damage pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Tissues involved in infectious and inflammatory diseases are hypermetabolic and have increased glucose uptake by 18F-FDG. Our question was about how the uptake of this radiopharmaceutical would be in LL patientsâ€™ silent neuritis.
Our data demonstrated, for the first time, systemic peripheral nerve 18F-FDG incorporation using PET/CT whole-body images of a group of lepromatous patients with silent neuritis and acute neuritis. 18F-FDG PET-CT could be a useful tool to confirm neuritis, especially in cases that are difficult to diagnose, such as for the differential diagnosis between a new episode of neuritis and chronic neuropathy.
