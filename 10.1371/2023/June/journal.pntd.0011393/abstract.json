    "Background": "CL endemicity was reported worldwide including in Saudi Arabia, imposing a major challenge on the health authorities. Vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) are key modulators of the immune response where the VDR is expressed. A remarkable lack of data exists in humans about the contribution of vitamin D and polymorphisms of the VDR gene in protozoan infections, especially cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).",
    "Objective": "This is the first work conducted to assess the relationship between vitamin D status, polymorphisms of the VDR gene (BsmI, ApaI, TaqI, and FokI), and VDR haplotype with parasite tissue load and susceptibility to CL.",
    "Methods": "Fifty-two patients with confirmed CL (21 patients receiving vitamin D medication and 31 patients not receiving it) and 46 control subjects participated in this cross-sectional investigation. VDR genotyping was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D were assessed using the ELISA method in all participants. The skin biopsy quantified the parasite load based on the Ridley parasitic index.",
    "Results": "The mean serum level of 25-OH vitamin D in CL patients who were not receiving vitamin D therapy was significantly lower compared to CL patients on vitamin D therapy and controls (p <0.001 for both) and CL patients with no history of vitamin D therapy had a significantly higher frequency of vitamin D deficiency compared to CL patients on vitamin D therapy and controls (p < 0.05). Compared to CL patients with no history of vitamin D therapy, CL patients receiving vitamin D therapy had a significantly lower mean size of the lesion and RPI (p = 0.02, .03 respectively). The frequency of genotype \u201caa\u201d and its \u201ca\u201d allele in ApaI SNP of VDR was significantly lower in CL patients compared to controls (p = 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). However, patients with CL had a considerably greater frequency of the \"A\" allele than the controls (p = 0.03), suggesting its role in CL susceptibility. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the genotype and allele frequency distributions of BsmI, TaqI, and FokI (p > 0.05). When compared to controls, CL cases had a considerably greater frequency of the \"B-A-T-F\" haplotype (p = 0.04), and a significantly lower frequency of the \"B-a-T-F\" haplotype (p = 0.01) suggesting that these haplotypes may have the potential susceptibility or protection against CL respectively. The \"Aa\" genotype in ApaI SNP of VDR had considerably lower levels of vitamin D with higher parasite load compared to the \u201cAA\u201d and: aa\u201d genotypes (p = 0.02,0.02 respectively). A significant negative correlation was found between the parasite load and 25-OH vitamin D levels (r2 = -0.53, p< 0.001).",
    "Conclusions": "According to these findings, vitamin D levels and \"ApaI\" VDR gene polymorphisms could affect the parasite load and susceptibility to infection, whereas BsmI, FokI, and TaqI polymorphisms did not. Correction of vitamin D levels may aid in CL management."
