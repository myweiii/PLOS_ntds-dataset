Treatment of the whole community (mass drug administration, MDA) has been a major intervention strategy against many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) over the last decade. Normally health ministries deliver individual MDA rounds targeting specific NTDs. This multiplies the training, transport and time burden for local health service personnel in districts in which several NTDs are present, imposing considerable financial and human resource costs to health ministries and their partners, and causing requiring repeated disruption to the daily life of communities receiving MDA. Delivering MDA for several NTDs at one time could improve the efficiency of NTD programmes. We reviewed existing data on the safety and feasibility of combining MDA of albendazole, ivermectin and azithromycin into a single co-delivered MDA. Several studies had evaluated if taking these drugs at the same time changed drug levels in recipientsâ€™ blood; these studies concluded that there was not an important difference in blood drug levels comparing instances when the medicines were taken separately to instances when they were taken at the same time. Two non-randomised studies assessed side effects experienced by people taking combinations of the three drugs and suggested doing so was safe. One small study in Mali had assessed combining all three drugs and also suggested this was safe but was too small to give a definitive answer. Two studies in Papua New Guinea assessed all three drugs being taken together in combination with a fourth drug, diethylcarbamazine. These studies also suggest co-administration was safe overall. Most of the identified studies had some methodological shortcomings, such as small sample sizes or issues with the way adverse events were recorded. Overall, the data suggest co-administration of azithromycin, ivermectin and albendazole is viable, but larger safety studies are needed.
