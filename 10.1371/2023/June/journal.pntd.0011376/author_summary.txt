SBE is a neglected tropical disease of highest priority to be aware of, and its epidemiology varies widely worldwide. This study explored the nationwide and long-term epidemiology of SBE based on the use of snake antivenom in Taiwan, including its incidence, risk factors, complications, and management. This could facilitate the development of preventive strategies and resource allocation. In Taiwan, six medically important venomous snake species were found; however, majority (73.3%) of the envenomation events were associated with T. s. stejnegeri (bamboo pit viper) and P. mucrosquamatus (Taiwan habu) and some (17.1%) with N. atra (Chinese cobra) and B. m. multicinctus (many-banded krait). The risks varied depending on the season, sex, age, geographic region, and occupation. Compared with patients envenomed by crotalines, those envenomed by elapids were more likely to undergo surgery due to serious wound complications caused by N. atra or endotracheal intubation due to respiratory failure caused by B. m. multicinctus. The low case-fatality rate observed might be due to easy access to modern medicine, immediate availability of antivenoms in healthcare facilities, few adverse effects of antivenoms, and prompt surgical intervention. The lack of highly venomous snakes with highly potent venom is a leading factor in low case fatality.
