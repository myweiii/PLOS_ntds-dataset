Aedes albopictus is the primary dengue fever vector in Shanghai, China. Given the lack of an effective vaccine, vector control remains the key prevention method for this infectious disease. Pyrethroids are the preferred insecticide for vector control owing to their high efficiency and low toxicity; however, vector resistance has reached a high level under selection pressure. Pyrethroids target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), and mutations in the coding region of the VGSC gene can result in knockdown resistance (kdr), one of the primary mosquito resistance mechanisms. This study explored kdr mutations in 17 Ae. albopictus populations collected from 15 districts in Shanghai in 2020. The overall mutation frequency was alarmingly high, reaching 84.65%. Mutant VGSC alleles, including V1016G, I1532T, and F1534S/C/I, were detected, with V1016G and F1534C/I being reported for the first time in Shanghai and F1534I being a novel mutant allele in Ae. albopictus. Additionally, five types of introns in Domain III were identified, with intron B type found to be significantly associated with mutation frequency at codon 1534. The rapid evolution trend of kdr mutations is concerning and indicates a growing risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Therefore, continuous monitoring of resistance changes and strict regulation of insecticide use are necessary.
