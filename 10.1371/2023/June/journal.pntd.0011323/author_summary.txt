T. spiralis adult-specific DNase II-7, a member of the DNase II-like nuclease family with no DNase II activity, whose biological functions are still unknown. We previously found that TsDNase II-7 is located around the infection site in the intestinal tissue, speculating that it was involved in the T. spiralis invasion of host intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, the results showed that TsDNase II-7 is highly transcribed and expressed in the adult stage of T. spiralis, and promoted T. spiralis penetration into intestinal epithelial cells, while knockdown of TsDNase II-7 gene expression by siRNA-TsDNase II-7 impaired worm invasive ability. Our study demonstrated the essential role of TsDNase II-7 in invasion and development, highlighting its potential as a molecular target for vaccine development against T. spiralis infection.
