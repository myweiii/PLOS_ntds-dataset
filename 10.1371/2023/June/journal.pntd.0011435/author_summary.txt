Scorpions cause approximately 3,000 deaths every year worldwide, second only to snakebites in terms of venomous animal-related human accidents due to the potency of their toxins. Natural habitat extinction combined with accelerated urban expansion have promoted greater contact between humans and many species of wild animals, and consequently increased the number of accidents and fatalities caused by these animals. Recognizing which environmental conditions are most associated with accident hotspots can help design better strategies for the control and distribution of anti-scorpion serum, for example. Here we show that scorpionism occurred more frequently in spring, and it decreased in winter. The areas with higher temperatures, lower humidity, and social inequalities were also associated with a higher risk of scorpion envenomation.
