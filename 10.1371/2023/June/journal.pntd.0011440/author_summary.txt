Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a potentially life-threatening parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Measurement of the success of antitrypanosomal treatment is difficult, particularly in the chronic phase of the disease, because serum anti-T. cruzi antibodies persist for prolonged periods even after complete elimination of the parasite. Thus, markers for early assessment of response to antitrypanosomal therapy could be useful tools to monitor response to drug treatment in Chagas disease. In this prospective study, we analyzed serum samples obtained from children diagnosed with Chagas disease and treated with nifurtimox (an antitrypanosomal drug with proven effectiveness). Before treatment and at each annual visit for the 4 years after treatment, we measured levels of antibodies to a specific antigenic protein (F29) of T. cruzi parasite using an established immunological technique; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The number of patients with negative ELISA F29 results increased over the period of observation after the end of treatment. At 4 years post-treatment, we found seronegative ELISA F29 test results in 67.7% of the patients in the 60-day nifurtimox regimen and in 59.1% of the patients in the 30-day nifurtimox regimen. The F29-based ELISA can be considered a useful method to monitor responses to drug treatment in children with asymptomatic Chagas disease.
