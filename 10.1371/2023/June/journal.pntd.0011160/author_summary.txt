Worldwide large-scale deworming programs are implemented to reduce the morbidity attributable to intestinal worms in school children. To monitor and evaluate the progress towards the programsâ€™ goals, Word Health Organization (WHO) has developed both a survey design and a corresponding decision tree based on the prevalence and intensity of infections. However, these programs operate in resource-constrained countries, and hence it is crucial to minimize the operational costs to survey worm infections while ensuring the correctness of the program decision. To further support WHO in more evidence-based recommendations for cost-efficient decision-making, we developed a general framework that captures both the operational resources to perform surveys and the variation in test results when deploying the current diagnostic standard. Subsequently, we determined the most cost-efficient survey design to decide to stop the deworming programs and to verify whether the morbidity attributable to intestinal worms has been eliminated as a public health problem. Generally, we found that the current WHO-recommended survey design may not allow for optimal decision making. Based on our results, we proposed alternative survey designs for each of the worm species and program targets.
