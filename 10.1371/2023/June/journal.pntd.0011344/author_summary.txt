Worm parasites, such as schistosomes, are master regulators of the human immune system, manipulating the host response in order to prolong their survival in their host. As a bystander effect, they also reduce immune responses to allergens and/or auto antigens, thus protecting their host against inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. One of the immune cells involved in immune regulation is the IL-10-producing regulatory B (Breg) cells. Schistosome eggs release various molecules that induce the development of Breg cells, but the identity of these molecules is not yet fully known. In this study, the authors aimed to identify some of these molecules. They investigated both the involvement of glycans on high molecular weight schistosomal egg molecules, as well as dissected the role of proteins with a lower molecular weight coming from schistosomal eggs. Using proteomics, they targeted various interesting molecules, which they recombinantly expressed and confirmed the IL-10 inducing capacity in B cells in vitro and in vivo for 2 molecules. This new knowledge may explain the hyporesponsiveness found in chronic schistosome-infected people and may pave the way to new innovative therapies for inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.
