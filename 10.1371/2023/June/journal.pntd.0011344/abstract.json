    "Abstract": "During chronic schistosome infections, a complex regulatory network is induced to regulate the host immune system, in which IL-10-producing regulatory B (Breg) cells play a significant role. Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA) are bound and internalized by B cells and induce both human and mouse IL-10 producing Breg cells. To identify Breg-inducing proteins in SEA, we fractionated SEA by size exclusion chromatography and found 6 fractions able to induce IL-10 production by B cells (out of 18) in the high, medium and low molecular weight (MW) range. The high MW fractions were rich in heavily glycosylated molecules, including multi-fucosylated proteins. Using SEA glycoproteins purified by affinity chromatography and synthetic glycans coupled to gold nanoparticles, we investigated the role of these glycan structures in inducing IL-10 production by B cells. Then, we performed proteomics analysis on active low MW fractions and identified a number of proteins with putative immunomodulatory properties, notably thioredoxin (SmTrx1) and the fatty acid binding protein Sm14. Subsequent splenic murine B cell stimulations and hock immunizations with recombinant SmTrx1 and Sm14 showed their ability to dose-dependently induce IL-10 production by B cells both in vitro and in vivo. Identification of unique Breg cells-inducing molecules may pave the way to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and auto-immune diseases."
