In April 2020, global guidelines suspended mass drug administration (MDA) programs used in the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the guidance aimed to reduce the risk of coronavirus exposure and transmission among stakeholders involved in MDA delivery and recipient community members, it risked impeding the gains made by MDA programs towards NTD control and elimination, leaving billions at risk of these infectious diseases. This study summarizes the perspectives of Ministry of Health NTD Program Managers and representatives from non-governmental organizations across sub-Saharan African working in NTDs regarding challenges imposed on MDA programs by the COVID-19 pandemic and identify opportunities to improve planning and implementation during the relaunch of MDA programs. Respondents noted key disruptions for MDA programs, including resource shortages, challenges adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols, and community hesitancy due to coronavirus transmission fears. Specific solutions for restarting MDA programs included adaptations to MDA strategies to incorporate safer, low-contact drug delivery techniques, incorporating technology to optimize MDA planning and delivery, and identifying opportunities to promote integration between NTD campaign delivery and pandemic response strategies. This paper includes suggestions for building resilient programs that can continue to perform in the face of public health emergencies.
