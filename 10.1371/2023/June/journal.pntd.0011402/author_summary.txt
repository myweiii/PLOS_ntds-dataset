Many mosquitoes can transmit viruses that cause debilitating illnesses in human populations during the act of blood-feeding by female mosquitoes. Females locate people and other animals by responding to the odors they emit. Among the most important odors that attract females are carboxylic acids, which are components of human sweat. As such, carboxylic acids impact human host feeding, a dominant factor in disease transmission. In this study, we have identified chemical receptors that are localized in the mosquito antennae and detect carboxylic acids. These receptors are highly similar in important disease-transmitting mosquitoes, including Aedes aegypti, a species that transmits Yellow Fever, Dengue, and Zika. Using a cell expression system, we demonstrate that selected receptors are activated by short-chain carboxylic acids in a manner consistent with their function in mosquito attraction. Our results provide a frame of reference for the future development of new mosquito attractant and repellent technologies that may help reduce the global burden of infectious diseases.
