Sandflies are insects that actively participate in the transmission cycles of leishmaniasis and other diseases, and these invertebrate vectors are frequently found in areas with hot and humid climates. However, in addition to the climate, there are several factors that contribute to the occurrence of sandfly vectors, such as, the vegetation type, altitude, and land use and cover. Understanding which environmental variables are important for the presence of sandflies can help us to understand how these insects are distributed and overall, how this affects the transmission of the etiological agents of leishmaniasis. In this study, we performed a set of ecological models where environmental and climatic variables were combined in multiple scales and correlated with the presence of two sandflies species, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani, vectors of parasites causing visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. We then combined this information with human disease data to assess potential risk areas in the state of Piau√≠, northeast Brazil. The resulting maps showed that municipalities of the central-north region of the state have favorable environment for the occurrence of these vectors in addition to higher incidence of leishmaniasis in humans. We thus recommend that control activities should be focused on this region of the state.
