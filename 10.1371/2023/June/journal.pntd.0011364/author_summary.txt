Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Public health programs aim to eliminate the infection with repeated rounds of mass distribution of anti-filarial medicines in areas with LF. These mass drug administration campaigns have been highly successful. Improved diagnostic tests are needed to monitor and verify the success of infection elimination efforts. We have previously shown that detection of antibodies to the recombinant parasite protein Wb-Bhp-1 are sensitive and specific for diagnosis of active filarial infections. Here, we show that antibodies to Wb-Bhp-1 are correlated with the persistence of filarial parasites in the blood after treatment, and that they decrease after effective anti-filarial treatment. Importantly, antibodies to Wb-Bhp-1 decrease after treatment more rapidly than other diagnostic markers such as circulating filarial antigenemia or antibodies to Bm14. Thus, this antibody test may be useful as a tool for monitoring the success of filariasis elimination programs.
