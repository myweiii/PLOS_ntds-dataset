Gaining an understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of prior epidemics, and the factors that may have driven transmission, helps public health agencies identify opportunities for preventing further outbreaks. This study outlines an analysis of the cholera epidemic that occurred in Harare, Zimbabwe, between September 2018 â€“January 2019. The study makes use of data on individual cases, where the household location and time of each case are known, to explore factors associated with cholera transmission and to retrospectively generate detailed maps of weekly transmission risk across the epidemic. As part of these analyses, Call Detail Records (CDR) from a major mobile phone network provider were analysed to help estimate and include information on human movement throughout the epidemic period. Results show several potential risk factors, and suggest that populations living in close proximity to the sewer network with high access to piped water, were at higher risk. One possible explanation for this observation is that sewer bursts led to the contamination of the piped water network, with a higher concentration of pathogens at the point of origin of the burst. This could have turned access to piped water, usually assumed to be associated with reduced cholera risk, into a risk factor itself.
