    "Abstract": "Understanding the factors associated with cholera outbreaks is an integral part of designing better approaches to mitigate their impact. Using a rich set of georeferenced case data from the cholera epidemic that occurred in Harare from September 2018 to January 2019, we apply spatio-temporal modelling to better understand how the outbreak unfolded and the factors associated with higher risk of being a reported case. Using Call Detail Records (CDR) to estimate weekly population movement of the community throughout the city, results suggest that broader human movement (not limited to infected agents) helps to explain some of the spatio-temporal patterns of cases observed. In addition, results highlight a number of socio-demographic risk factors and suggest that there is a relationship between cholera risk and water infrastructure. The analysis shows that populations living close to the sewer network, with high access to piped water are associated with at higher risk. One possible explanation for this observation is that sewer bursts led to the contamination of the piped water network. This could have turned access to piped water, usually assumed to be associated with reduced cholera risk, into a risk factor itself. Such events highlight the importance of maintenance in the provision of SDG improved water and sanitation infrastructure."
