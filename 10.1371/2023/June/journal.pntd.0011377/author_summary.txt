Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic to 78 countries and affects over 230 million people globally, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Contact with open freshwater sources such as lakes, rivers, and dams puts people at risk of infection. Existing systematic reviews have linked schistosome infection to risk factors such as gender and a lack of access to clean drinking water and hygiene infrastructure. Yet, while these risk factors may be mediated by water contact behaviours, the direct association of water contact with schistosome infection likelihood remains poorly quantified. We conducted a systematic review of associations between water contact frequency, duration, and activities on schistosome infection likelihood. We found that having any water contact was associated with 3.14 times higher likelihood of infection compared to having no water contact. This relationship held across adults and children and across medium and high-prevalence settings. Out of 11 water contact activities, 10 actives were associated with increased infection risk. Occupational, domestic, and recreational exposure was associated with similar infection likelihood. The evidence on exposure-schistosome infection associations included in this meta-analysis comes largely from self-reported measures elicited through cross-sectional surveys. Over 90% of included studies did not mention measurement of water contact as one of their aims, meaning exposure measurement was not their primary focus. Study quality was mostly moderate or low and recall periods employed in studies varied between one day and one year. There is a need for an expert consensus to consistently measure exposure. Studies should report on the measurement periods and definitions of water contact categories that were used. Few studies reported on correlations of water contact with infection intensity; this information is needed from future studies to better understand transmission.
