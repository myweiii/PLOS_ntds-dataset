    "Abstract": "Between January and March 2022, WHO conducted a global online survey to collect data on diagnostic capacities and treatment practices in different settings for four implantation mycoses: eumycetoma, actinomycetoma, cutaneous sporotrichosis and chromoblastomycosis. The survey investigated the type of diagnostic methods available in countries at various health system levels (tertiary, secondary, primary level) and the medicines used to treat implantation mycoses, with a view to understanding the level of drug repurposing for treatment of these diseases. 142 respondents from 47 countries, including all continents, contributed data: 60% were from middle-income countries, with 59% working at the tertiary level of the health system and 30% at the secondary level. The results presented in this article provide information on the current diagnostic capacity and treatment trends for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In addition, the survey provides insight on refractory case rates, as well as other challenges, such as availability and affordability of medicines, especially in middle-income countries. Although the study has limitations, the survey-collected data confirms that drug repurposing is occurring for all four surveyed implantation mycoses. The implementation of an openly accessible global and/or a national treatment registry for implantation mycoses could contribute to address the gaps in epidemiological information and collect valuable observational data to inform treatment guidelines and clinical research."
