Culicoides are an important component of arbovirus ecology and should be studied and watched over in order to the potential spread of emerging and re-emerging viruses. A novel OYAV isolate (SZC50), isolated from midge samples was sequenced in this study, and the virusâ€™s putative host tropism was also tested in vitro, and cell lines derived from pig showed a highly susceptible to OYAV SZC50. Notably, high prevalence of OYAV SZC50 neutralization antibody was found in Yunnan pig serum samples. Moreover, the pathogenicity of OYAV SZC50 in animal models was first shown using mice and chicken embryos. Adult C57BL/6 and suckling mice were shown to be extremely sensitive to OYAV SZC50 infection, in contrast to adult Kunming mice, who can survive following infection. The maximum fatality rate of chicken embryos was 37.5%. In summary, regarding the potential infection risk of OYAV to animal or human, systematic investigation of OYAV, its vector and reservoir in nature should be conducted.
