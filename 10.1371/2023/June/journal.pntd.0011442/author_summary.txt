Bites by the West African carpet viper (Echis ocellatus) are very common in the savannah regions of west Africa and envenomed victims usually develop a bleeding syndrome. Routine laboratory coagulation tests are unavailable in health facilities where most snakebite victims are treated. We conducted analysis of 20-minute whole blood clotting tests (20WBCT) performed on snakebite patients in Kaltungo General Hospital, Nigeria who presented within 24 hours of the bite and who brought a dead snake along for snake identification, and we assessed its ability to detect venom induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC) (defined as an INR â‰¥1.4). In our cohort of 121 patients, the 20WBCT had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 50% in detecting VICC. Performing the 20WBCT increased the probability of detecting VICC among our study participants, and it was useful in identifying patients with persistent and rebound coagulopathies who may require extra doses of antivenom. Our findings show that the 20WBCT is a simple, cheap, and easily accessible bedside test with a high sensitivity for the detection of patients with VICC following carpet viper envenoming in North-eastern Nigeria.
