The leishmaniases are a group of four vector-borne neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that are endemic in over 100 countries, putting over 1.6 billion people at risk. In Kenya, the extent of research on leishmaniasis remains unclear. Therefore, this scoping review aims to uncover and classify the body of literature on leishmaniasis in Kenya to elucidate gaps in knowledge and inform future research, related health policies, and interventions in Kenya. Through a database search, we identified 269 articles that met our eligibility criteria, which were included in our final analysis. Our analysis revealed that the majority of articles discussed VL. Most articles were published between 1980 and 1994. There was uneven distribution between the themes of published articles, with vector-related research dominating the list, followed by treatment, diagnostics, general epidemiology, and pathophysiology. The most prevalent type of study was a tie between epidemiological and clinical research, followed by basic science research and then secondary research. There is minimal research coverage on MCL and PKDL, which is as expected given the low prevalence of these diseases in Kenya. Furthermore, little research spans prevention, co-infections, health systems/policy, and general topics.
