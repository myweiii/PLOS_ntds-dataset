Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a parasite transmitted to humans by the bites of sandflies. As these bites usually go unnoticed, it is not clear how long the incubation period (IP) lasts between the infectious bite and the appearance of skin lesions. In this study, we determined the IP distribution based on the dates of arrival, departure, and appearance of skin lesions from military personnel coming from non-endemic areas that were exposed to sandflies bites upon their arrival in French Guiana during the last 20 years. The median IP was 26 days with a 5th and 95th percentile of 7.9 and 62 days, respectively. These IPs are much shorter than those previously reported. Soldiers with disseminated leishmaniasis (more than 10 lesions on two body parts) had a median IP significantly shortened by 21.6 days. Considering our results and the fact that cutaneous leishmaniasis is mostly seen in January and March, people in French Guiana are most probably contaminated at the beginning of the rainy season, between December and February, and not during the dry season, as it was previously admitted.
