Brucellosis is an important zoonosis, it is still a global public health issue. Based on an evaluation from the World Health Organization (WHO), brucellosis cases have been reported in more than 170 countries, with ~500,000 new cases reported each year. During the past decade, outbreaks of human brucellosis have been reported in increasing numbers, and with an apparent geographic expansion from the historically affected north of China to southern provinces, due to increased movement of humans, animals, and animal food products from brucellosis-endemic regions. In recent years, advanced molecular detection methods have improved laboratory diagnosis, and could serve as important alternatives to culture and serological methods. In this study, a ddPCR method was established to accurately quantify Brucella DNA load in whole blood samples, and its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value for human brucellosis was evaluated. The ddPCR results showed that the limit of detection was 1.87 copies per reaction, with high repeatability. The positive rates for ddPCR was 88.5% among 61 SAT positive patients. In addition, 57.6% (19/33) of suspected sero-negative samples were positive by ddPCR. The ddPCR assay showed good accuracy for whole blood samples, and could be a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool for detecting Brucella.
