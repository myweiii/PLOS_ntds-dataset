Ivermectin has been shown to be a valuable tool in mass drug administration campaigns against lymphatic filariasis. The drug shows high variability in drug exposure in previous pharmacokinetic studies. Variability in drug exposure can lead to either a higher exposure with the potential for toxic effects or a lower exposure that may result in treatment failure. Identifying and quantifying the source of high variability using nonâ€“linear mixed effects modeling is crucial for future dosing recommendations that seek to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity risks. In this study, the variability of IVM exposure after a single oral dose was investigated with a population pharmacokinetic model using data from Lymphatic filariasis infected subjects and healthy individuals.
