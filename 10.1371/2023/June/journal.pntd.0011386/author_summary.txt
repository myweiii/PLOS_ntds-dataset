Neurocysticercosis is a central nervous system infection with the helminth Taenia solium in its larval stage. It is a marker of poverty and remains endemic in countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The severity of neurocysticercosis and the prognosis of patients depend on the location of the parasites. Extraparenchymal infection involving the subarachnoid and/or ventricular space is associated with high morbidity and mortality and a suboptimal response to current anthelminthic treatment regimens. We examined peripheral immunological parameters and hormones of 42 participants with extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis before and after treatment, and their associations with subsequent treatment response. Prior to treatment, compared with healthy controls, there was low lymphocyte reactivity with a regulatory response, which may explain the lack of peripheral immunological changes during and after treatment. This weak specific peripheral response could favor the chronicity of the infection and the poor response to treatment and should be considered in research to improve patient outcomes.
