Eggs hepatic granuloma and fibrosis are the predominant pathological features of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. This pathology can cause death from portal hypertension and ascites brought on by hepatic fibrosis. Soluble egg antigens also can trigger hepatocellular carcinogenesis by stimulating proliferation. Angiogenesis plays a crucial part in developing and progressing hepatic fibroproliferative and ischemic disorders. We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ZLE as an anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative agent as a promising hepatoprotective therapy against S. mansoni-induced liver fibrosis in hamsters. Our results revealed that significant decrease in granuloma size and numbers in the ZLE- and PZQ-treated groups compared to the infected untreated group and the decrease in granulomas number and tissue egg load were significantly lower in PZQ treated group compared to ZLE treated group. ZLE exhibited significant anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic effects on granulomas, illustrated by significantly lower expression of VEGF and TGF-Î²1 than infected untreated and PZQ-treated groups. ZLE exhibits antiproliferative activity evidenced by a significant reduction of positive Ki-67 hepatocytes percentage compared to the infected untreated group. Moreover, ZLE exhibits potent antioxidant effects evidenced by a significantly lowered NO and conservation of hepatic GSH, GST, and SOD in hepatic homogenates compared to infected untreated and PZQ-treated groups.
