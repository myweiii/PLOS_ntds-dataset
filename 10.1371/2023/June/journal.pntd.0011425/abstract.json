    "Abstract": "Malaria is caused by parasite of the genus Plasmodium and is still one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Several biological characteristics of Plasmodium vivax contribute to the resilience of this species, including early gametocyte production, both of which lead to efficient malaria transmission to mosquitoes. This study evaluated the impact of currently used drugs on the transmission of P. vivax. Participants received one of the following treatments for malaria: i) chloroquine [10 mg/kg on day 1 and 7.5 mg/kg on day 2 and 3] co-administered with Primaquine [0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days]; ii) Chloroquine [10 mg/kg on day 1 and 7.5 mg/kg on day 2 and 3] co-administered with one-dose of Tafenoquine [300 mg on day 1]; and iii) Artesunate and Mefloquine [100 mg and 200 mg on day 1, 2 and 3] co-administered with Primaquine [0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days]. Patient blood was collected before treatment and 4 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after treatment. The blood was used to perform a direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes. The results showed 100% inhibition of the mosquito infection after 4 h using ASMQ+PQ, after 24 h for the combination of CQ+PQ and 48 h using CQ+TQ. The density of gametocytes declined over time in all treatment groups, although the decline was more rapid in the ASMQ+PQ group. In conclusion, it was possible to demonstrate the transmission-blocking efficacy of the malaria vivax treatment and that ASMQ+PQ acts faster than the two other treatments."
