Bartonella spp. are emerging zoonotic causative agents distributed worldwide and they pose a significant threat to human health worldwide. In this study, the Bartonella carried by rodents in Inner Mongolia were detected and studied. The high positive rate (47.27%) and the remarkable genetic diversity (seven phylogenetic clades) of Bartonella in rodents indicate that rodent-borne Bartonella may potentially be exposed to local peoples.
