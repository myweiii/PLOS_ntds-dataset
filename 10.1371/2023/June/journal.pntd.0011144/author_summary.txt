West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are on the rise in Europe and in France. WNV is reported in France as early as the 1960s in the Camargue and USUV more recently, in 2015 in eastern France. The re-emergence of WNV infections in the Camargue is associated with an expansion towards the North which is also favorable to maintain a viral transmission cycle. USUV frequently co-circulates with WNV sharing the same mosquito vectors. Culex pipiens, able to feed on birds and humans, is considered to be the main vector in France. Our study is the first to investigate the vector competence to WNV and USUV of five different mosquito species collected in northeastern France. We ascertain that French Cx. pipiens mosquitoes are competent to both WNV and USUV. More surprisingly, the mosquito Aedes albopictus from northeastern France was able to transmit WNV and USUV. Based on our result, we propose that surveillance of mosquitoes combined with viral detections must be implemented in northeastern France to allow early viral detection and timely intervention to prevent outbreaks of these two neurological diseases.
