Bartonella are bacteria that can infect humans and cause fatal diseases. They can cause chronic infection and can potentially be transmitted by transfusion since they infect red blood cells. They are difficult to cultivate in a laboratory, and they are present in low numbers in blood. There is no laboratory test that is sufficiently sensitive to detect them. To compare several laboratory diagnostic tests, we searched for these bacterial DNAs in blood and in microbiological liquid cultures of 500 blood donors. We used diverse molecular techniques and then compared the results with the previously published project. We concluded that the use of liquid culture combined with different molecular tests increases the possibility of detecting Bartonella sp.-DNA, but the tests do not avoid false-negative results. We found Bartonella henselae DNA in the blood of at least one in five donors. Hemovigilance programs are unlikely to contribute substantially to the identification of chronic posttransfusion infections since they are designed to identify well-defined acute outcomes, so it is urgent to review B. henselae transfusional risk of transmission and Bartonella sp. infection diagnosis in donors and in patients.
