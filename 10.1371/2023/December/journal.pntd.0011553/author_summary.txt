Cutaneous ulcers are commonly found affecting children in low-income countries of Africa and the South Pacific. In rural and remote communities of Cameroon the limited access to health care and shortage of sanitation is associated with a high morbidity of cutaneous ulcers. The latter represent an important cause of suffering and stigmatization in children. HD is commonly known as the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection chancroid and has been recently described as a leading cause of cutaneous ulcers in yaws-endemic regions. In this study, we investigated the presence of HD and the associated risk factors. Our findings indicate a prevalence of HD associated with cutaneous ulcers of 30.3% and a prevalence of asymptomatic HD carriage of 5.2%. Physical proximity to a confirmed ulcer case, Bantu ethnicity, and the use of traditional latrines were the main risk factors associated with HD ulcers. TP DNA was detected in some cutaneous ulcer samples but in lower proportion compared to HD. This study confirms that HD is a leading cause of cutaneous ulcer in yaws endemic areas in Cameroon. National control programmes in endemic countries should therefore consider this pathogen in their strategies for controlling and eliminating skin neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
