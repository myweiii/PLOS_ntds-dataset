The cholera epidemic in Haiti was unprecedented. One month after the first case was confirmed, the Haitian government quickly activated a national cholera surveillance system (NCSS) to gather relevant epidemiologic information on the disease to inform interventions. Although oral cholera vaccine (OCV) was not available in all administrative departments during the first two years of the epidemic, care seeking for watery diarrhea was increasing throughout the country. However, certain deficiencies relating to determinants of health have prevented many from seeking care in hospitals and clinics, or in numerous cholera treatment centers (CTC) and oral rehydration points (ORP) established in every administrative department in the country. To estimate the effects of those determinants of health and health behaviors on cholera fatality in the Nord Department, we used data from a retrospective survey conducted in the Communes of Borgne, Pilate, Plaisance and Port-Margot by Doctors Without Borders (Médecins sans Frontières, MSF) in 2011. We found that failing to seek care was associated with death, and that common reasons for not seeking care included concerns about travel distance to CTCs and uncertainty about where to seek health care in those Communes for watery diarrhea symptoms. Establishing CTCs and ORPs within rural communities located in mountainous areas with lack of road accessibility could have reduced the excess mortality attributable to not seeking healthcare. In addition, although the Haitian government and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the country free of cholera in 2020, risk factors associated with the rapid spread of the infection in 2010 have ongoing relevance to population health and vulnerability to future outbreaks.
