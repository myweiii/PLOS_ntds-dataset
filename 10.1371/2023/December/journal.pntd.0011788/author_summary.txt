Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the dengue virus. Dengue infection has been shown to affect the central nervous system and cause various complications during the acute stage. Two previous studies suggested that dengue virus had a long-term effect on the risk of developing dementia, but there were limitations in disease diagnosis in the studies. Our study found that dengue was associated with a slightly increased risk of dementia. However, the small corresponding E values suggest that the association between dengue and dementia was less likely to be causal.
