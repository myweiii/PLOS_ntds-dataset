Screening of diverse compound libraries is a powerful way to find chemical start points for drug discovery programmes. There is a lack of such chemical libraries available for neglected infectious diseases and other neglected areas such as non-hormonal contraception. In this paper we describe the design of such a library of 30,000 compounds (graphical abstract). The aim was to develop a library of diverse chemical matter unlikely to have been screened in these disease areas. The compounds were selected from the REAL (REadily AccessibLe) Enamine library, a virtual library of 4.5 billion compounds. The methodology for selection of the compounds is described, along with a detailed analysis of the physicochemical properties of the compounds and comparison to other libraries that we have assembled. This shows that the library contains hit/lead-like compounds suitable as chemical start points, and whilst it covers a similar space to some other libraries, the material within the library is mainly different to other libraries. Copies of the library will be made available for screening; the process for gaining access to this library is described.
