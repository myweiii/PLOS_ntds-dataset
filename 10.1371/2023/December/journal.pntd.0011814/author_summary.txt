Arboviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Rift Valley fever, constitute viral diseases transmitted by blood-sucking arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks, and biting midges, to vertebrate hosts. In many countries, particularly within Africa, the prevalence of these arboviruses remains widely underestimated due to the absence of effective surveillance systems, often resulting in the conflation of arboviral infections with other infectious diseases. Nevertheless, sub-Saharan Africa is prone to periodic arbovirus-linked epidemics, propelled by factors such as the expansion of vector habitats, viral genetic mutations, anthropogenic influences, inadequate healthcare services, commercial transportation, and climate fluctuations. While Guinea has predominantly reported suspected cases of yellow fever, widespread arbovirus-related epidemics have yet to be documented. Nevertheless, it is imperative for healthcare workers to be well-informed and prepared for prospective epidemics. The assessment of the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of healthcare workers can serve as a catalyst to heighten awareness, bolster surveillance mechanisms, and enhance the capabilities of public health facilities in the prevention and mitigation of potential epidemics.
