The Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging paramyxovirus that is widely observed in Southeast Asia and causes fatal respiratory and neurological diseases in humans and animals. The World Health Organization considers NiV diseases priority infectious disease for which an effective vaccine should be developed. LC16m8 is a highly attenuated strain of the vaccinia virus, and more than 100,000 people have been vaccinated against it in Japan without severe side effects. Compared to other attenuated vaccinia virus vaccines, LC16m8 has a relatively high or modest proliferative potential in mammalian hosts, resulting in efficient induction of immune responses in humans. In the present study, we successfully generated recombinant LC16m8 expressing the surface glycoprotein of NiV and confirmed that these vaccine candidates could efficiently induce neutralizing antibodies against NiV in hamsters.
