Chagas disease, affecting approximately 7 million individuals worldwide, leads to worse outcomes in patients with chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCM) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to other etiologies. The chronic inflammatory process associated with Chagas disease is thought to contribute to these adverse outcomes. Inflammatory biomarkers such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and angiotensin II are released due to hemodynamic stress in HF and are considered indicators of inflammation. The role of T. cruzi parasitemia in the progression of chagasic cardiomyopathy remains controversial. Additionally, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin are essential biomarkers for assessing mechanical stress and myocardial injury, respectively, due to their prognostic value. However, studies correlating inflammatory biomarkers with prognosis in patients with CCM have yielded conflicting results. In this study, inflammatory biomarkers were not found to be predictors of survival in patients with HFrEF of chagasic etiology. Instead, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), elevated BNP, and TnT levels were identified as strong predictors of lower survival. This suggests that in patients with advanced chagasic heart failure, the role of inflammatory markers in predicting survival may be limited.
