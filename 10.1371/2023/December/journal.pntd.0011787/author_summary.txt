The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been one of the most challenging pathogens to affect humanity in recent years. Since its first major outbreak in 2004 in Africa, this virus has caused a series of epidemics worldwide, leading the scientific community and health systems to face a threat to public health. The authors conducted a study in the northern jungle of Peru to better understand the CHIKV situation. They determined that the most frequently infected were those in the age group of 18 to 39 years and the most common symptoms were headache, muscle aches and joint pain. It is highlighted that making an etiological diagnosis can be difficult in some remote areas, and that the clinical presentation overlaps with other mosquito-borne diseases. This research emphasizes the importance of epidemiological surveillance and scientific research in disease control, particularly acute febrile CHIKV illness.
