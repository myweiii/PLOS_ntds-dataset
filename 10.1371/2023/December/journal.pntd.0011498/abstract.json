    "Background": "Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected infectious disease that exerts the highest public health burden in the Americas. There are two anti-parasitic drugs approved for its treatment\u2013benznidazole and nifurtimox\u2014but the absence of biomarkers to early assess treatment efficacy hinders patients\u00b4 follow-up.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We conducted a longitudinal, observational study among a cohort of 106 chronically T. cruzi-infected patients in Cochabamba (Bolivia) who completed the recommended treatment of benznidazole. Participants were followed-up for five years, in which we collected clinical and serological data, including yearly electrocardiograms and optical density readouts from two ELISAs (total and recombinant antigens). Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed to understand trends in data, as well as the relationship between clinical symptoms and serological evolution after treatment. Our results showed that both ELISAs documented average declines up to year three and slight inclines for the following two years. The recorded clinical parameters indicated that most patients did not have any significant changes to their cardiac or digestive symptoms after treatment, at least in the timeframe under investigation, while a small percentage demonstrated either a regression or progression in symptoms. Only one participant met the \u201ccure criterion\u201d of a negative serological readout for both ELISAs by the final year.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The study confirms that follow-up of benznidazole-treated T. cruzi-infected patients should be longer than five years to determine, with current tools, if they are cured. In terms of serological evolution, the single use of a total antigen ELISA might be a more reliable measure and suffice to address infection status, at least in the region of Bolivia where the study was done. Additional work is needed to develop a test-of-cure for an early assessment of drugs\u00b4 efficacy with the aim of improving case management protocols."
