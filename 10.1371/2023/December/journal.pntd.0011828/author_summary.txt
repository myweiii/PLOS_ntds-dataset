Paragonimiasis, as a typical food-borne zoonotic helminthiasis, is an important public health problem. Approximately one million people suffer from paragonimiasis annually and areas in which the disease is newly endemic are increasingly identified. Paragonimiasis causes complex symptoms in multiple organs, but chest symptoms are its most distinguishing clinical feature. Most symptomatic paragonimiasis infections appear as pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pleuritis with pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. Pneumothorax is a debilitating and expensive symptomatic pulmonary complication that can occur in cases of paragonimiasis. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the risk factors for pneumothorax in patients with pulmonary paragonimiasis and to evaluate the possibility of pneumothorax in those patients. Our study suggests that history of asthma, chest pain, and intrapulmonary lesions are clinically significant risk factors of pneumothorax associated with pulmonary paragonimiasis. Clinicians should approach patients with pulmonary paragonimiasis that complain of chest pain or have intrapulmonary lesions or asthma as an underlying disease with the possibility of pneumothorax in mind and should note that pulmonary paragonimiasis is one of the causes of the differential diagnosis of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.
