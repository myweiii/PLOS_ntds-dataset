Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot) infection-induced scrub typhus is a leading cause of febrile illness in endemic countries. Research on Ot strain-related disease outcomes or immune signatures in tissue and blood samples is very limited. Using two clinically prevalent strains (Karp and Gilliam), we examined host susceptibility in inbred and outbred mouse models. Application of these small animal models of infection provided new evidence for the activation of pulmonary immune cell subsets during the acute stages of infection. While Gilliam-infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice developed self-limiting infection, mild cellular responses, and tissue injury, Karp infection led to a strong and sustained activation of innate immune cells, followed by extensive influx of activated T cells, which correlated to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in serum samples. We also provided in vitro evidence for Ot strain-dependent immune gene profiles, indicating differential macrophage responses to Karp versus Gilliam bacteria. This is the first comparison of different scrub typhus mouse models with in-depth analyses of cellular responses in inflamed lungs, offering novel insights into potential mechanisms of disease progression versus infection control related to Ot strains and laying the foundation for future investigations.
