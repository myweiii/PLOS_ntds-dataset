Dengue is a serious mosquito-borne disease of substantial public health concern, particularly in endemic countries like Bangladesh. It is vital to assess public knowledge and health beliefs regarding dengue fever in order to adopt efficient preventive practices and develop disease control strategies. The present study highlights dengue knowledge and preventive practices in relation to background characteristics and health beliefs among rural communities in Bangladesh. Findings from this study revealed that people had a moderate level of knowledge regarding dengue. Regarding health beliefs, people had high perceived severity, considering dengue as a dangerous and deadly disease, but their perceived susceptibility to dengue was low. Although people exhibited high self-efficacy, such as keeping their surrounding area clean, public involvement in dengue prevention practices was not satisfactory, except for some specific activities. Moreover, the dengue preventative practices of people were shown to be significantly influenced by their knowledge. Furthermore, evidence from this study emphasizes tailoring community-based health education campaigns to increase public awareness, which will improve health beliefs and encourage dengue prevention in Bangladesh.
