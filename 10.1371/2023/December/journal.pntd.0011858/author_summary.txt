This article discusses the research conducted on the effect of Taenia solium excretory secretory proteins (ESPs) on human macrophages and its role in the immunopathogenesis of Neurocysticercosis (NCC). NCC is a neglected tropical disease caused by larvae of T. solium, which infect humans and localizes in the central nervous system. The larvae cause NCC, a leading cause of acquired epilepsy in the developing world. The study found that T. solium ESPs induce a Th2 immune response in macrophages, which may promote parasite survival and delay their recognition by the host immune system. The research further showed that ESPs modulate macrophage function by altering host miR expression, leading to activated yet compromised functionality that provides a niche for parasite survival. This study provides insights into the interaction of ESPs with the host, revealing therapeutic intervention hot spots to manage NCC and other helminthic infections. In the absence of suitable animal model for NCC, our study elucidates important and novel finding of parasite mediated suppression of host immune system.
