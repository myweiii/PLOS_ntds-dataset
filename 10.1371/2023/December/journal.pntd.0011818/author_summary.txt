The stigma surrounding cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) is multifaceted, encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioural reactions such as misconceptions, negative emotions like disgust and shame, and discriminatory actions. This stigma is further perpetuated by self-stigmatization, which includes enacted, felt, and internalised stigma. As a consequence, individuals with CL and MCL experience psychological distress, marginalisation, rejection, difficulties in forming interpersonal relationships, and heightened anticipation of encountering discrimination.
Our review reveals several gaps in knowledge, including a lack of understanding regarding structural stigma, insufficient appropriate interventions, and the urgent requirement for a specialised tool to measure the stigma related to CL and MCL. Moreover, the absence of a standardised theoretical framework for stigma research on these conditions has led to inconsistent data generation, emphasising the need for a universal stigma framework applicable to various health conditions. Such a framework would foster a deeper understanding, enabling effective strategic planning to address the impacts of stigma on individuals with CL and MCL.
