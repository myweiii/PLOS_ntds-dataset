Two Mabs F1D4 and B7D4 targeting the broad spectrum of vaccine proteins FliK and BcsZ separately were prepared. The two Mabs showed the potential to be broad-spectrum therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of Salmonella infections, which applied equally to several other common foodborne pathogens.
Results suggest that passive immunotherapy with F1D4 or B7D4 in S. Typhimurium LT2 infected mice can reduce the level of infection-related mortality, and both Mabs conferred protection in a dose-dependent manner.
