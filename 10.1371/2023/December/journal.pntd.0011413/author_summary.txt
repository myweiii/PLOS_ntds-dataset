Buruli ulcer, a severe necrotising skin infection caused by M. ulcerans, remains a neglected health problem in some rural communities in West Africa. Although it can be successfully treated with an antibiotic combination of rifampicin and streptomycin or clarithromycin, the presence of other pathogens or opportunistic agents complicates its management. These co-infections or superinfections make treatment more complex and expensive. In this study, we highlight the association of M. ulcerans, a cytotoxin producer, with B. trematum, another toxin producer associated with chronic ulcers in Buruli ulcer patients. B. trematum shows resistance to the antibiotics used in the Buruli ulcer treatment regimen. Therefore, it is essential to conduct further research to understand the magnitude of its contribution to the illness.
