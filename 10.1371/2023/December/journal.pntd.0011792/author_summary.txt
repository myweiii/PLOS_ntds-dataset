Nomadic populations are at increased risk of snakebites, but interventions will not be developed or improved without reliable data on this risk. Highly mobile populations require specific considerations in selecting or creating sampling frames and sampling units for epidemiological research, and using census-based sampling frames would be inappropriate. We conducted scoping reviews to gather evidence on survey methods used in nomadic populations and compared them with contemporary survey methods used for snakebite research, which we used to inform our methodology. We describe the creation of a sampling frame of 50,707 households, the selection and geo-tagging of a sample of 900 households, and the identification and enrolment of participants from 875 households between August 2019 and March 2020. We propose using open-source satellite imaging and geographic information systems to improve the conduct of epidemiological research in these populations.
