A cohort of 790 individuals at risk of developing ZCL, residing in areas endemic to leishmaniasis with different prevalence of L. major infection, was followed for a one-year period to determine the incidence of the disease following a transmission season and to identify immune correlates of protection.
Our results showed that the study population in an endemic area exhibited heterogeneity in terms of exposure to the bites of infectious flies due to the characteristics of the houses such as the presence of shelters for animals which attracts the vectors. IFN-γ and GrB were detected in most participants with significantly higher values in the old focus compared to recent foci and among individuals with LST reaction. Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between IFN-γ and GrB as well as a positive association between the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratios and LST results. Cumulative incidence of infection among the study cohort was 4% after a transmission season, primarily from recent foci. We also showed that high levels of IFN-γ and GrB produced by PBMCs in response to the parasite, as well as a high IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio, at the steady state, were associated with protection against disease development.
