Snakebite envenoming is a debilitating neglected tropical disease disproportionately affecting the rural poor in low and middle-income countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. Evidence gaps need to be addressed if major progress is to be made towards reducing the negative impact of snakebite, particularly in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Africa region. We conducted an electronic survey among 73 people working at ministries of health, health facilities, academia and non-governmental organizations from 15 countries in the WHO Africa region. They reported the primary barriers to snakebite research and policy making to be limited funds, lack of relevant data, and lack of interest from policy makers. Adequate funding commitment, strong political will, building expert networks and a demand for scientific evidence were all considered potential factors that could facilitate snakebite research. All participants indicated interest in the development of research and policy hubs.
