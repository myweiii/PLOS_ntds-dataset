We characterized the relationship between arboviral infection prevalence and human mobility patterns among 1,845 participants in the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Among participants, 39% had a positive arboviral seroprevalence result. The majority (74%) reported spending 5 or more weekly hours outside of their home of residence. In general, more time spent outside the home was associated with decreased arboviral infection prevalence in this population. Arboviral prevalence was associated with the types of locations participants visited regularly, and characteristics of those locations. Work and locations with air conditioning (AC) or screens were protective for arboviral prevalence. Different from other studies, in this population, the characteristics of locations visited appear to be the most important drivers of the relationship between mobility and arboviral prevalence. This relationship indicates that not all mobility is the same, with elements like screens and AC providing protection in some locations. Previous studies have shown that household AC and screens are important factors in determining arboviral risk; however, results from this study further highlight their importance in non-residential locations where people visit. These findings support the use of screens and AC in all locations in areas at risk for arbovirus transmission.
