Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is considered a natural fatty acid activator of sphingomyelinase enzyme that helps to expose the normally hidden parasite surface antigens to antibody binding and subsequent worm killing. Two rabbit anti-schistosome antibodies: anti-Schistsosoma mansoni infection (anti-SmI) and anti- Schistsosoma mansoni alkaline phosphatase antibodies were coupled to the surface of CLA-whey protein co-polymer (CLA-W) to target the CLA-W to the parasite membrane. We assessed the in vivo effects of CLA-W in their non-coupled and antibody-coupled forms against the early and late stages of infection. The injection of anti-SmI-coupled CLA-W produced the highest effects against both early stage schistosome larvae and late stage adult worms, resulting in significant reductions in worms and eggs burdens. By electron microscope, the adult worm tegument showed severe injury and evidence of cell death. Antigens were exposed on the worm surface to antibody binding as indicated by the increase in the worm surface immunofluorescence staining. The study highlights the promising potential of the antibody-coupled CLA-W co-polymer for treatment of schistosomiasis and control of its transmission.
