Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease affecting over 40 million people in Bangladesh. Dengue is endemic in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the economic cost of illness is still limited. A growing literature shows that dengue imposes an enormous socio-economic burden on households, health systems, and societies. As there is no specific study estimating the economic costs of dengue infections in the Bangladesh context, the current study will serve as a benchmark to support evidence-based decision-making processes that guide the dengue prevention and control policies and allocation of health resources efficiently in Bangladesh. This study indicated, there is a substantial economic burden of dengue among the Dhaka city dwellers. We found that prevention of dengue hospitalization incidence, irrespective of the methods of prevention can save about US$ 479 per dengue case. Therefore, decision-makers should consider the treatment cost of dengue infections, particularly among the poor in the population while balancing the benefits of introducing potentially effective dengue preventive programs including vaccination strategies in Bangladesh.
