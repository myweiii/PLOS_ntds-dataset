Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal disease that results from infection with a single-celled parasite known as Cyclospora cayetanensis (C. cayetanensis). Multiple global outbreaks are associated with the parasite. Risk of infection rises with people traveling or living in the endemic countries. Infection occurs frequently by consuming food or water contaminated with C. cayetanensis. The disease is mainly manifested by severe watery diarrhea which may relapse several times. People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness that may unfortunately end up with death. There are several treatment options, however they have severe undesirable side effects. Nitazoxanide is the safest treatment alternative but has a comparable lower efficacy. Consequently, the present work focused on reaching a better therapeutic outcome through the preparation of a novel formula at the nano size range. The novel formulation was achieved by preparing the safe organic nano-structured lipid carriers and loading them with nitazoxanide. The novel formula showed a remarkable potency compared to the commercially available drugs. Subsequently, a new auspicious vista is introduced for cyclosporiasis treatment.
