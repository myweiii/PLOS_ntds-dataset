    "Abstract": "Cyclosporiasis is a ubiquitous infection caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite known as Cyclospora cayetanensis (C. cayetanensis). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea which may be regrettably fatal in immunosuppressed patients. The commercially available treatment options have either severe side effects or low efficiency. In the present study, the novel formula of nitazoxanide (NTZ)-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) was assessed for the first time for C. cayetanensis treatment in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice in comparison to commercially available drugs (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and NTZ). Swiss Albino mice were orally infected by 104 sporulated oocysts. The experimental groups were treated with the gold standard TMP-SMX, NTZ, blank NLCs and NTZ-loaded NLCs. The results demonstrated that NTZ-loaded NLCs represented the highest significant parasite percent reduction of (>98% reduction) in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice designating successful tissue penetration and avoiding recurrence of infection at the end of the study. Oocysts treated with NTZ-loaded NLCs demonstrated the most mutilated rapturing morphology via scanning electron microscope examination as well as representing the most profound improvement of the histopathological picture. In conclusion, NTZ-loaded NLCs exhibited the uppermost efficacy in the treatment of cyclosporiasis. The safe nature and the anti-parasitic effect of the novel formulation encourage its use as a powerful treatment for human cyclosporiasis."
