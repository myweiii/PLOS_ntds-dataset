Leprosy, also known as Hansenâ€™s disease, has long been a great concern in developing countries. Leprosy imposes a substantial burden on patients and society. This disease can impair the skin, nerves, feet, and legs, and then progress to causing deformities, social stigma, and discrimination. The new case detection rate of pediatric leprosy is an essential indicator reflecting recent transmission of the infection. To better understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of leprosy cases among children in China, we collected data on new pediatric leprosy cases over the past 10 years from LEPMIS and performed an analysis with different classification groups. We found 152 new pediatric leprosy cases, and the new case detection rate decreased from 0.13 in 2011 to 0.02 in 2020 per 1,000,000 population. Leprosy was more frequent in males, those 10 to 14 years old, HHCs, and MB. The new cases were concentrated in highly endemic areas. The data indicate that active transmission of leprosy infection will still be ongoing in high-endemic areas. Active surveillance, especially contact tracing, plays an important role in interrupting the infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae to pursue the elimination of leprosy.
