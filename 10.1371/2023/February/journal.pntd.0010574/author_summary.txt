Food insecurity has been found to be a risk factor for cholera at the household and national level, however the mechanism through which food insecurity may increase the risk of cholera remains unknown.
In a large cross-sectional survey of 1072 households in rural Haiti, we observed a robust independent association between food insecurity—defined as a persistent lack of access to food in adequate quantity or quality and measured by the Household Hunger Scale—and reported history of severe, medically-attended cholera. The association was dose-dependent, with the odds of reported cholera increasing linearly with household food insecurity. Household food insecurity was associated with three high-risk behaviors: antacid use, consumption of leftover non-reheated food, and eating food and beverages prepared outside of the home. Two high-risk behaviors—including antacid use and consumption of food and beverages prepared outside of the home (i.e., at a restaurant or from a vendor)—were independent risk factors for cholera.
High-risk food practices may be one causal pathway by which food insecurity increases risk of developing cholera. In this study, we provide a framework for future longitudinal and qualitative studies to investigate whether interventions that target food insecurity could also reduce cholera risk among populations who face a high burden of both conditions.
