Dengue fever is an acute disease caused by dengue virus and transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide affecting an estimated 50â€“100 million people and with 10,000 dengue-related deaths each year. Currently, there is no specific treatment, and safe and effective vaccines have not been fully implemented. Most dengue cases present with nonspecific mild symptoms, but some will evolve into severe dengue, which can be fatal. Early detection and subsequent timely treatment have been shown to decrease mortality among severe cases. Therefore, it is very important to identify biomarkers for the early identification of cases at risk for progression to severe disease. In this study we analyze demographic factors, clinical laboratory data, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and chymase to evaluate associations with disease severity. This study was carried out in Paraguay, which is a hyperendemic country for dengue where the disease has been understudied. A number of factors were found to be associated with severe disease in this population, including patient age, male gender, presence of comorbid illnesses, low platelet count, low lymphocyte percentage, and elevated chymase level.
