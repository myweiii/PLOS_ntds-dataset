The majority of human diseases come from animal sources (zoonoses). People who are close to animals need to be knowledgeable about the nature of zoonoses and preventive measures. Among the common zoonoses in Nepal, only six diseases were delimited that were close to livestock. Due to neglected issues of zoonoses, we have limited data on the knowledge and preventive practices of livestock farmers, who are close to livestock for their livelihood. Therefore, this study seeks to reveal the realities of zoonoses-related knowledge and preventive practices among livestock farmers in selected districts of Nepal. Out of the six studied zoonoses, farmers have good knowledge of diseases that have a long endemic history in societies (i.e., rabies) or frequent outbreaks (i.e., avian influenza, swine flu). However, they are facing vulnerabilities due to poor preventive practices, and significant regional variations in their zoonoses-related knowledge and preventive practices. Lastly, this study might be significant for further planning in the public health, veterinary, and education sectors from the perspective of livestock farmers and indicate interventional programs against common zoonoses for vulnerable populations (i.e., livestock farmers).
