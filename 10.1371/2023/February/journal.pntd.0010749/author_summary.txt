American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is a neglected disease caused by sandfly-transmitted parasites in the Americas. There is an incomplete understanding of which sandfly species transmit the parasite, complicating efforts to limit parasite transmission and consequently, disease burden. In this study, the authors created a database of sandfly traits, then used predictive models to determine important factors in parasite transmission and how different climate and environmental variables predict which vectors can transmit the parasites that cause ACL. The models suggest that transmission occurs at the interface between domestic habitats and well-preserved forests. The authors also generate predictions of which sandflies might be transmitting the parasites that are not known vectors at the time, specifically Psychodopygus amazonensis and Nyssomia antunesi. This new knowledge can lead to a better understanding of the system of transmission and can point to possible hotspots of risk. The analysis can also help direct researchers to areas of interest for sampling studies, as well as specific sandflies on which to focus effort.
