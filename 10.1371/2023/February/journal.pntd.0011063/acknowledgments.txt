We wish to give special thanks to our local collaborators at the field sites in Tanimboca Natural Reserve and Secretaría de Salud (Amazonas), Senderos del Canajagüa (Meta), and La Victoria, Caoba Natural Reserve, and Eudes Baca and his family (Magdalena), who supported this research with their motivation of contributing to scientific knowledge, aware that ultimately it can be translated into benefits for the people living in areas at risk. In the same spirit, we want to thank: Gabriel Colorado, Maria Elisa Peichoto and Pedro Sarmiento, who contributed specimens for barcode identification; the team at CIMPAT and the Department of Biological Sciences, who were always prompt to support sample processing; Giovanni Randazzo, for imaging documentation during fieldwork and Alessandro Giusti (NHMUK) for images of the holotype of L. pseudobliqua (including its dissected genitalia). Silvia Restrepo at Vicerrectoría de Investigaciones Uniandes, who was essential for getting funds for this research; and The National Institute of Health INS, Colombia, who provided information on accidents recorded in the country in 2017. We are also grateful to the Canadian Centre for DNA barcoding and Centre for Biodiversity Genomics at University of Guelph (Ontario, Canada), as well as participants to the Saturniidae DNA barcoding campaign for their contribution to assemble the DNA barcode library of Lonomia moths.
