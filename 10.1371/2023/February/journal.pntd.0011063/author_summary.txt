Caterpillars of the genus Lonomia (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) are responsible for some fatal envenomation of humans in South America due to the hemotoxic activity of their venom. Historically, only two species have been reported to cause such hemorrhagic syndromes in humans, Lonomia achelous and Lonomia obliqua; however, the number of species described in the last decade within the genus has increased by 300% indicating that the diversity of the genus has been underestimated. Here, we revise some taxonomic aspects of genus Lonomia, update the diversity and their spatial distribution, and highlight their potential epidemiological relevance. We provide evidence of seven species being potentially involved in accidents and at least three undescribed new species. Our work emphasizes the need for further research of Lonomia as a genus with medical importance.
