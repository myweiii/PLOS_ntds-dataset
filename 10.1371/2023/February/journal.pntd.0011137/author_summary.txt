Dengue is associated with significant health burden in southern Vietnam. A retrospective data analysis was conducted in this study to describe the age distribution of patients with dengue during 2000–2015 to inform prevention and management strategies. Data were collected from national surveillance system to describe the patterns and changes in reported cases over the time in terms of age distribution and strains in circulation. Since 2000, the age distribution of patients confirmed with dengue has increased, and the age shift occurring mainly from 5–9 y/o to 10–14 y/o. All four dengue serotypes were observed.
