Data regarding a complete course of dengue viremia, especially in pre-febrile and asymptomatic cases, are limited. These data can be obtained from community cluster studies that enroll and follow up with the neighborhood and household members of dengue-confirmed index cases. Using this approach, we assessed the presence of dengue viremia before the development of fever and the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic dengue cases within the community contacts. We found that there are 1.5 asymptomatic dengue infections for each symptomatic case. Furthermore, dengue virus in blood was detected in eight out of sixteen post-enrollment dengue subjects before the onset of fever. The maximum period was up to seven days, longer than previously reported. Viremic subjects play a crucial role in dengue transmission by mosquitoes. Our data indicate that the significance of unnoticed virus transmission supports the need for comprehensive and sustainable vector control interventions. With the active surveillance embedded in the study design, we calculated the incidence of dengue infection to be 636 cases per 1,000 person-years of follow-up, 930 times higher than the national incidence rate around the same study period, showing the real burden of disease in a hyperendemic area and confirming the underestimation of Indonesian incidence data.
