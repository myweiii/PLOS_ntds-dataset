Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected disease that is often mistaken for other sexually transmitted infections. The disease has thus received little attention at the primary health care unit until recent. To support the emerging momentum been built towards controlling this disease, we conducted this study to understand the knowledge and perception of FGS among medical and paramedical students (MPMS) who subsequently transform into HCPs, as well as expertise of current HCPs who are saddled with the responsibility of delivering care to FGS patients. 587 MPMS and 65 HCPs were interviewed in Anambra State, using well designed questionnaires. Our findings show that majority of the MPMS were not aware of schistosomiasis and FGS, but students in the 6th year of study have higher chances of been informed about schistosomiasis. However, almost all the HCPs were aware of schistosomiasis, but FGS awareness was very low. The HCPs also lack the capacity and resources to diagnose and manage FGS. This significant gap in knowledge, capacity and resources calls for development of FGS training materials, and its subsequent incorporation in curricula of medical students, and training of HCPs during routine schistosomiasis control programs. This should be complemented with the provision of necessary diagnostics to perform colposcopy, as well as building competence to diagnose pathognomonic lesions using diagnostic atlas or Artificial Intelligence (AI).
