Dengue outbreaks are frequent in Singapore. Controlling the mosquito population remains the principal method in preventing dengue transmission since safe and effective pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines have not been developed. Typical vector control campaigns that strive to reduce the mosquito population urge relevant stakeholders, including residents, town councils responsible for common areas, schools and construction site contractors, to remove stagnant water from their premises. However, breeding sites have been found at close proximity to but outside of homes, including containers, plants and drains, some of which are managed by residents, others by the government. This study investigates which urban features, which had previously been found to be common breeding habitats in homes and public areas, contributed most to the Ae. aegypti abundance of residential areas. We used objective Gravitrap surveillance data to estimate Ae. aegypti abundance and an exposure assessment tool to measure the presence of urban features. Findings from the study indicate that gully traps, age of high-rise housing blocks, housing unit price and corridor cleanliness were the most predictive of Ae. aegypti abundance. Both residents and the government should be enlisted to uphold effective vector control efforts.
