Elimination of lymphatic filariasis, and of certain other neglected tropical diseases, depends critically on the successful treatment of the population through a series of typically annual mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. When an MDA falls short of expectations in terms of population treated, organizers can learn and adapt the next round of MDA to improve performance. Because this learning is often based on anecdotal evidence or surveys specific to a narrow geography, there is an opportunity in the literature to augment our understanding of what impacts MDA performance, particularly in terms of more contextual factors and trends or patterns that reach across multiple years and regions.
In this analysis we linked a performance measure from 3,880 MDA campaigns across 10 West African countries to contextual factors such as rainfall, temperature, violence or social unrest, COVID-19, the 2014 Ebola outbreak, road access/isolation, population density, observance of Ramadan, and the number of previously completed MDAs. We hope the findings themselves will better equip MDA organizers in decision-making and offer this mixed-level model as an approach to better understanding coverage dynamics in West Africa and elsewhere.
