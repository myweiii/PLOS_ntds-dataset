Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a carcinogenic retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), an unremitting and progressive neurological disorder that presents with spastic paraparesis, neurogenic bladder, sphincter dysfunction, and mild sensory disturbance in the lower extremities. HTLV-1 is endemic in the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean area, foci in the Middle East, and Australia-Melanesia. Based on published seroprevalence rates, which are missing or sparse for up to 6/7th of the global population, an estimated 5 to 10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1. Treatment of ATL and HAM/TSP is very difficult and no vaccine is available. HTLV-1 transmission patterns include mother-to-child transmission through breastfeeding, horizontal transmission through sexual intercourse, and direct contact transmission through blood. HTLV-1 antenatal screening is effective to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1. The probability of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1 through long-term and short-term breastfeeding can be reduced from 20.3% and 7.4% to 2.5% by withholding breastfeeding. However, Japan is the only country in the world that has implemented HTLV-1 antenatal screening. This study demonstrates that HTLV-1 antenatal screening is cost-effective and has the potential to reduce the number of cases and deaths from ATL and HAM/TSP in HTLV-1 high prevalence countries.
