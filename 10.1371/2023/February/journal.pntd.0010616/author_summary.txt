Why was this study done?

Flavivirus infections pose a significant global health burden, underscoring the need for the development of safe and effective vaccination strategies
Co-administration of different vaccines, including flavivirus vaccines, saves time and visits to health care units and vaccine clinics. It serves to provide protection against multiple pathogens in a shorter time-span; e.g., for individuals travelling to different endemic areas
Safety and immunogenicity-related responses have not been appropriately evaluated upon co-administration of many vaccines including currently used flavivirus vaccines, such as yellow fever virus (YFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JE) virus vaccines
Because of this, we performed an open label, non-randomized clinical trial studying the safety and immunogenicity following co-administration of YFV vaccine with TBEV and JEV vaccines


What did the researchers find?

Adverse events, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and other related immunological parameters were not detrimentally affected by concomitant delivery of the vaccines
Concomitant vaccination in the same versus different upper arms of study participants did not significantly affect safety or immunogenicity outcomes


What do these findings mean?
Co-administration of YFV vaccine and TBEV or JEV vaccines is feasible without increased risk of adverse events or reduced development of nAbs against the respective viruses.
