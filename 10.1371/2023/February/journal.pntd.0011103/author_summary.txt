Previous work has been unable to determine what water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH)-related coverages are needed to optimally limit trachoma transmission. This study uses a large, multi-national dataset to explore the impact of hypothetical WaSH interventions designed to increase coverages of face-washing water and latrine use in districts that have met and those that have not met trachoma elimination targets. We used statistical models to explore how these interventions impacted the prevalence of trachoma among children as compared to the observed data.
Our findings provide evidence-based insight into potential WaSH coverage targets that could be hypothesized to achieve meaningful reductions in trachoma prevalence. We found that in areas working to reach trachoma elimination targets, increasing face-washing water and latrine use coverages to a minimum of â‰¥30% were consistently associated with (modelled) reductions in active trachoma prevalence. However, in areas that had already met trachoma elimination targets, we did not see the same pattern. This finding supports our theory that the WaSH-trachoma relationship differs in these areas and suggests a need for additional research to explore these relationships. Our estimates can be used to inform programmatic WaSH targets and future field trials.
