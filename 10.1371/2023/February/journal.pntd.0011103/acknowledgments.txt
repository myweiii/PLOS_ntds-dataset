We acknowledge the dedicated staff who are essential to the success of these surveys, with special appreciation for fieldwork staff who endure long hours, difficult terrain, and unforeseen challenges in their pursuit of reaching these often-remote communities. We also acknowledge the men, women, and children who participate in these surveys so that the epidemiology of trachoma in their communities can be better understood and addressed.
Data were collected as part of surveys supported by the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and Tropical Data. The Global Trachoma Mapping Project was funded by the United Kingdomâ€™s Department for International Development (DFID; ARIES: 203145) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the ENVISION project.
