Borrelia miyamotoi, a causative agent of relapsing fever, has been recognized as a human pathogen worldwide. In Thailand, the spirochete bacteria was first detected in rodents collected from the far north in the country. The further investigation revealed its detection in several rodent species and Ixodes granulatus tick, indicating they could play a role in maintaining the enzootic transmission cycle of B. miyamotoi in nature. Epidemiological surveillance was conducted in Tak province where B. miyamotoi was previously detected in rodents. Although B. miyamotoi was not detected in human samples by molecular methods, the serological reactivity to B. miyamotoi recombinant protein in humans and rodents along with the detection of spirochete bacteria in rodents and ticks is a strong indication of B. miyamotoi transmission in this area. This is also the first report of B. miyamotoi serological reactivity in rodents and humans in Thailand; therefore, the possibility of B. miyamotoi infection should not be neglected. Understanding their epidemiological factors regarding their enzootic transmission, the risk of human exposure, and the awareness of disease prevalence will help control and prevent the disease.
