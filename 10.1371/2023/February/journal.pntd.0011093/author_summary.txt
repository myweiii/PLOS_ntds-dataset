The African trypanosome is a single-celled parasite causing African Sleeping Sickness in humans and related diseases in animals. It has a unique protein coat made up mostly of a single protein, called the Variant Surface Glycoprotein, or VSG. The African trypanosome possesses several thousand different VSG genes. As the immune system of an infected host learns to recognize one coat protein and kill the trypanosomes, the parasite switches to a different VSG protein that is not recognized by the immune system. This allows the parasite to keep thriving in the host as this process repeats. This paper presents molecular images of a subset of VSG proteins that are on the surface of the organism when it is transferred to hosts by the bite of the tsetse flyâ€”the first step in infection. We show that these so-called metacyclic VSGs are neither special nor unique compared to those VSGs that take over in the bloodstream during the course of infection. These results clarify the nature of these first VSG coats the host is exposed to and have important implications for trypanosome infection and vaccine development.
