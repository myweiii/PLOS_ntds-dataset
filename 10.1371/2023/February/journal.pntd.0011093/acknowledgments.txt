We acknowledge synchrotron time at the at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Villingen, Switzerland (SLS, beamline PXIII, Vincent Olieric and colleagues) and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (beamline ID29, Gianluca Santoni and colleagues). We thank Dr. Karine Lapouge of the EMBL Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility for Tm and CD measurements.

Author experimental contributions
F.A.B. and M.C. cloned and created trypanosome expressing strains of mVSG397, mVSG531, and mVSG1954. M.v.S. verified mVSG397 clones. M.C. purified and crystallized mVSG531 and mVSG1954, solved and refined their crystal structures (collecting data on mVSG1954 with J.Z.), co-wrote the manuscript, and generated figures. J.Z. and K.F. expressed, purified, and crystallized mVSG397 while J.Z. and S.D. collected crystallographic data and solved the structure of mVSG397. S.D. conducted suramin survival experiments and S.D. and M.v.S. analyzed and graphed this data. E.T. and L.G. edited the manuscript. N.L. and T.R. performed and analyzed mass spectrometry experiments. C.E.S. conceived of the projects, aided in structural determination, co-wrote the manuscript, and generated figures. All authors commented and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
