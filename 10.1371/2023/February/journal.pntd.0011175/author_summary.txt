Scabies, a skin Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) characteristically causes an intensely pruritic rash. Scabies commonly affects individuals living in poor, overcrowded communities with limited access to healthcare. Integrated control of skin NTDs requires an understanding of local context issues. We explored understanding, beliefs and care seeking behaviours towards scabies in central Ghana.
We found that individuals with scabies delay care-seeking and this delay is enhanced by their beliefs and a perception of limited disease severity. Compared to past scabies participants in the dermatology clinic, participants with past scabies in the community tended to have a longer delay. Participants in the scabies group recruited from community were more likely to associate the disease with curses, witchcraft, heredity or drinking water, than those recruited from the dermatology clinic. Scabies was associated with health consequences, stigma, and loss of productivity.
Early diagnosis and effective treatment of scabies can lead to persons less frequently associating scabies with supernatural forces and promote care-seeking in the formal health system. Health education to promote awareness and early care-seeking is essential to dispel negative perceptions about scabies in Ghana. Further, health systems should be capacitated to adequately treat affected individuals and their contacts to facilitate scabies control.
