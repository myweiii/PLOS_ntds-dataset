We are incredibly grateful for the hard work of the KGH staff, particularly the Outreach Team and all the individuals who participated in this study. We would like to recognize the support and guidance from the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation and the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee, without whom this work could not have been done. We would also like to thank members of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) and Zalgen Labs for support with diagnostics and immunoassays.
