Lassa fever (LF), an acute viral hemorrhagic fever, is a major public health threat in West Africa. Lassa virus (LASV), the cause of LF, is transmitted to humans from the infected excrement or urine of the rodent-host, Mastomys natalensis. The true prevalence of LASV in Sierra Leone remains unknown. Working with the LF research program at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), this study sought to establish a baseline seroprevalence of antibodies to LASV in Sierra Leone, targeting three administrative districts. Previous studies suggest LF and the presence of LASV is more widespread in Sierra Leone than previously recognized. This study corroborated these suggestions and revealed potential demographic and environmental factors that could increase the risk of exposure to LASV. As the largest epidemiological study conducted on LASV to-date in Sierra Leone, it will help inform future public health interventions and improve epidemiological, ecological, and clinical studies on LF and LASV.
