Diseases classified as neglected continue to affect the poorest of people across the world especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Although efforts have been made, several barriers continually exist to delay attainment of programme objectives. This study assessed the challenges of implementation of the neglected tropical diseases programme in Ghana from the major state implementation agency (GHS) at the national, regional and district levels. We found the challenges of implementation that acted independently and synergistically to be inadequate resources, dwindling volunteerism, poor social mobilization, weak governmental commitment and weak monitoring and evaluation.
