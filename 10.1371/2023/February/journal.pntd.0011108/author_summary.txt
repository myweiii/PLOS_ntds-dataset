Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important neglected zoonosis around the world. We evaluated how environmental and socioeconomic factors, as well as VL control and surveillance interventions, influence the spread and detection of VL cases in Pernambuco state (Brazil), which is endemic. Our results reveal that municipalities with almost no agriculture that received technical training and are located close to a notification center are unlikely to have VL infected individuals if no cases have ever been detected. On the other hand, a municipality distant from the notification center, with no technical training, and with a large agricultural area might have already had unreported cases. These results can serve as a foundation to improve the personnel training and notification system strategies adopted by VL Public Health Programs.
