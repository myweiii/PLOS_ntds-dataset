Brucellosis and Rift Valley fever are zoonotic diseases with significant public health and economic burden in Kenya. We investigated the levels of exposure to Brucella spp. and Rift Valley fever virus among slaughterhouse workers in Isiolo County, northern Kenya. We found high exposure levels that are comparable to those previously reported within the community. Occupational exposure was the most probable source of infection since most of the workers did not keep livestock. Therefore, slaughterhouses could be targeted for sensitization on appropriate infection control measures besides being important points for disease surveillance.
