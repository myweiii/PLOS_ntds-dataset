    "Abstract": "Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening global public health issue with Bangladesh having one of the highest rates of snakebite cases. The Bede, a nomadic ethnic group in Bangladesh, traditionally engages in snake-related business such as snake charming. The Bede relies on their own ethnomedicinal practitioners for snakebite treatment while there is a lack of concrete evidence on the effectiveness of such ethnomedicinal treatment. To identify the barriers to the utilization of biomedical treatment for snakebite we conducted interviews with 38 Bede snake charmers, who have experienced snakebite, and six family members of those who died of snakebite. Our results show that four critical barriers, Accessibility, Affordability, Availability, and Acceptability (4As), prevented some of the Bede from seeking biomedical treatment. Moreover, we found that a few Bede died of a snakebite every year. There are survivors of snakebite who were able to receive biomedical treatment by overcoming all of the 4As. Our results provide insights into the current state of snakebite treatment in Bangladesh and can inform the development of more effective and accessible treatment options for those affected. Partnership between the public sector and the Bede community has the potential to make a significant impact in reducing snakebite morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh."
