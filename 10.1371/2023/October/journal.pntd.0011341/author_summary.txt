Understanding the dominant route of transmission of a pathogen is important for designing and implementing effective control strategies. Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A, which cause enteric fever, infect approximately 10 million people and cause over 100,000 deaths annually. In the Kathmandu Valley, prior work suggested ancient stone spouts used for drinking water were often contaminated and driving transmission of the diseases. However, many of these spouts no longer function, and people are still getting sick, suggesting other possible dominant pathways for enteric fever transmission. We tested drinking water from households in this area as well as local river water and found that only 7 drinking water samples were positive for Salmonella Typhi and 4 were positive for Salmonella Paratyphi A. We also tested river water and found many samples (>40%) tested positive for these bacteria. River water samples were not often positive upstream of Kathmandu city center (12% positive for Salmonella Typhi) but were often positive within the city center (58% positive for Salmonella Typhi) and in rural areas up to 10 km downstream of the city (67% positive for Salmonella Typhi). During sample collection, individuals were observed interacting with rivers by walking in them, washing clothes and washing vegetables for sale in markets. This study shows that drinking water may not be a primary driver of enteric fever transmission in the Kathmandu Valley, but that sewage contaminated river water may be a way disease transmits into the wider population.
