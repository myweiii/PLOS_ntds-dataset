Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by a parasitic nematode, Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium, which breed in fast-flowing rivers and streams. To eliminate transmission, a yearly distribution of ivermectin is conducted in infected areas. This medication kills the microfilaria but not the adult nematode, which is killed by doxycycline. Despite over 20 years of ivermectin mass distribution, the disease is still prevalent in the Massangam Health District in Cameroon. Therefore, alternative strategies have been discussed to stop transmission, including treatment of positive tested persons with doxycycline in both settled and nomadic communities. This paper estimated the total cost of implementation at US$168,345 in Massangam district, in order to compare it with the current elimination strategy and to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the interventionâ€“especially in high infection, hard-to-reach and loa loa co-infection settings.
