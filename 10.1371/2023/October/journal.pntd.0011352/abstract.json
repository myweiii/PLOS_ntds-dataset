    "Background": "Leptospirosis is a tropical disease associated with life threatening complications. Identifying clinical and investigation-based parameters that predict mortality and morbidity is vital to provide optimal supportive care",
    "Methods": "We conducted an observational study in an endemic setting, in the southern Sri Lanka. Consecutive patients having complicated leptospirosis were recruited over 18 months. Clinical, investigational and treatment data were collected and the predictors of mortality were analysed.",
    "Results": "Out of 88 patients having complicated leptospirosis, 89% were male. Mean age was 47yrs (\u00b116.0). Among the total major complications 94.3% had acute kidney injury, 38.6% pulmonary haemorrhages, 12.5% fulminant hepatic failure, 60.2% hemodynamic instability and 33% myocarditis. An acute significant reduction of haemoglobin (Hb) was observed in 79.4% of patients with pulmonary haemorrhage. The mean of the highest haemoglobin reduction in patients with pulmonary haemorrhage was 3.1g/dL. The presence of pulmonary haemorrhage (PH) and hemodynamic instability within first 48 hours of admission significantly predicted mortality (p<0.05) in severe leptospirosis. Additionally, within first 48 hours of admission, elevated SGOT (AST), presence of atrial fibrillation, presence of significant haemoglobin reduction, higher number of inotropes used, prolonged shock, invasive ventilation and admission to ICU significantly predicted mortality. Out of major complications during the first week after admission, pulmonary haemorrhage and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) combination had significant adjusted odds of mortality (OR = 6.5 and 4.8, p<0.05). Six patients with severe respiratory failure due to PH underwent ECMO and four survived. The overall mortality in complicated leptospirosis was 17%. In PH and FHF, the mortality rate was higher reaching 35.4% and 54.5%, respectively.",
    "Conclusions": "Within first 48 hours of admission, major complications such as pulmonary haemorrhage and haemodynamic instability and other parameters such as atrial fibrillation, acute haemoglobin reduction, elevated SGOT level could be used as early parameters predictive of mortality in severe leptospirosis. PH and FHF during the first week of admission in leptospirosis are associated with high morbidity and mortality requiring prolonged ICU care and hospitalisation. Above parameters could be used as parameters indicating severity for triaging and intensifying treatment. Using ECMO is a plausible treatment option in patients with severe pulmonary haemorrhage."
