Endocystectomy is a conservative surgical approach to managing hepatic cystic echinococcosis (CE). Bile leakage is the major complication of this technique. In the current study, we evaluated the patients who underwent endocystectomy and assessed the factors associated with bile leakage. The operative and postoperative outcomes and cost efficiency of strategies, which was used to treat bile leakage were also evaluated. Eighty patients with 142 cysts were included. Among them eleven patients shown bile leakage. Four patients underwent reoperation to treat bile leakage, while six patients received radiologic intervention. We found that cysto-biliary fistula and cyst size >8 cm correlate with bile leakage after endocystectomy. We also concluded that early operative management of bile leakage reduces hospital stay and improves cost efficiency compared with radiologic or endoscopic treatments.
