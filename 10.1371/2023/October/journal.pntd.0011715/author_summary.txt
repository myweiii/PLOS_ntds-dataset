Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a disease caused by the larvae of the worm Echinococcus granulosus. Ingesting the eggs of these worms which are excreted in the feces of infected dogs, can result in the formation of cysts in the liver or lungs of humans or herbivorous animals. Although ultrasound is commonly employed for diagnosing these cysts, hydatid cysts can frequently be misdiagnosed as cystic lesions of different origins. Hence, the necessity for faster, more accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic methods is evident. In this study, serum samples were collected from 35 sheep with hydatid cysts, and DNA was extracted and purified. Specific primers were then utilized to amplify the free DNA of the sera via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our findings indicate that the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease can be enhanced up to 95% by increasing the volume of serum, employing larger amounts of DNA template in the PCR reaction, and utilizing nested PCR assay. If applied to human samples, this method holds great promise for significantly improving the sensitivity and accuracy of CE diagnosis.
