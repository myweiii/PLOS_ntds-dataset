Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental bacteria found in the soil and water of tropical and subtropical regions. This organism causes melioidosis, an infectious disease that often results in pneumonia and bloodstream infections. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between specific bacterial genetic factors and disease outcomes. This study reports on the clinical and bacterial genetic factors associated with disease outcomes in Queensland, Australia. A total of 292 patients and the associated bacterial isolates obtained from them during their hospital admission were analysed. The majority of patients presented with pneumonia and had a bloodstream infection. The case-fatality rate improved slightly over time but remains higher than other regions in Australia. Over the period of the study the proportion of First Nationâ€™s people affected decreased significantly. Notably, for reasons yet to be determined, the proportion of patients aged over 70 years increased over time. The bacterial genetic data demonstrate a high level of diversity across the region, however there was no association between previously described virulence genes and clinical outcomes in our cohort. This study creates a platform for further state-wide melioidosis research in Queensland.
