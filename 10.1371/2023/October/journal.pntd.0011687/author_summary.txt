Intestinal protozoan parasites such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium are significant causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. A study analyzed data from 7,800 children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) across seven study sites who tested positive for these parasites using stool immunoassays. The study aimed to quantify the association between intestinal protozoan parasites and child anthropometric outcomes among children under the age of 5.
The results of the study showed negative associations between Giardia and weight-for-age and length/height-for-age among asymptomatic children. Similarly, Cryptosporidium was negatively associated with weight-for-age and weight-for-length/height among asymptomatic children and with weight-for-age, weight-for-length/height, and length/height-for-age among symptomatic children. No significant associations were found between Entamoeba histolytica and child growth.
The study findings suggest that while Giardia may not cause acute diarrhea, it is associated with growth shortfall among young children. These observations highlight the need for preventive strategies to target enteric protozoan parasites among young children to reduce the burden of childhood malnutrition.
