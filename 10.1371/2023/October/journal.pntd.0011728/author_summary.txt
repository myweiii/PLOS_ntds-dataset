Bacteria belonging to the genus Shigella are a leading cause of childhood diarrhea globally. In Vietnam and other transitional low-middle income countries (LMIC), S. sonnei has recently emerged as the dominant Shigella species, displacing S. flexneri, which usually predominates in industrializing regions. Little is known about the epidemiology of S. sonnei and how common infection is amongst children in such settings. In this study, we used regular blood sampling from a large cohort of children in Ho Chi Minh City over a two year period to examine changes in antibody concentrations against S. sonnei, using this to detect evidence of exposure to the bacteria. Importantly, this approach allowed us to identify exposures irrespective of whether the children had experienced symptoms or not. Our findings showed that exposure to S. sonnei was common in this cohort, with the highest incidence of exposure occurring in children observed between the ages of 12 months and 18 months. This is the first study of its kind to describe the epidemiology of S. sonnei infection in a LMIC setting and will be useful in informing future vaccine development and deployment strategies against this important pathogen.
