    "Abstract": "Vector-borne diseases remain a significant public health threat in many regions of the world. Traditional vector surveillance and control methods have relied on active and passive surveillance programs, which are often costly and time-consuming. New internet-based vector surveillance systems have shown promise in removing some of the cost and labor burden from health authorities. We developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a new internet-based surveillance system, \u201cAlertaChirimacha\u201d, for detecting Triatoma infestans (known locally by its Quechua name, Chirimacha), the Chagas disease vector, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. In the first 26 months post-implementation, AlertaChirimacha received 206 reports of residents suspecting or fearing triatomines in their homes or neighborhoods, of which we confirmed, through pictures or inspections, 11 (5.3%) to be Triatoma infestans. After microscopic examination, none of the specimens collected were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. AlertaChirimacha received 57% more confirmed reports than the traditional surveillance system and detected 10% more infested houses than active and passive surveillance approaches combined. Through in-depth interviews we evaluate the reach, bilateral engagement, and response promptness and efficiency of AlertaChirimacha. Our study highlights the potential of internet-based vector surveillance systems, such as AlertaChirimacha, to improve vector surveillance and control efforts in resource-limited settings. This approach could decrease the cost and time horizon for the elimination of vector-mediated Chagas disease in the region."
