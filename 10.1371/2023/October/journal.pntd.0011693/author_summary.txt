Trichomonas vaginalis is a human infective parasite that is responsible for most common, non-viral, sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Despite the over 270 million cases of T. vaginalis infection reported annually worldwide, the parasite continues to be a highly neglected pathogen and thus poorly studied. Despite several attempts to establish an animal model to study T. vaginalis infection, reliable infection models are lacking. As a result, our understanding of parasitic features that contribute to establishing and maintaining an infection have been determined by growing cultures of parasites and human host cells in the laboratory and testing parasite:host cell interactions in test tubes. Here we describe the development of a mouse model for studying T. vaginalis infection in an animal. We demonstrate that two features of the parasite that affect parasite: host cell interaction in test tubes: (1) its adherence properties and (2) the extracellular vesicles it releases that are taken up by host cells also impact parasite survival in this novel, mice model. The establishment of this animal model for T. vaginalis sets the stage for identifying and examining parasite factors that contribute to and influence infection outcomes.
