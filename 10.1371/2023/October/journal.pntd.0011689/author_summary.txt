The neglected tropical disease trachoma is caused by repeated ocular infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Progression from infection to inflammation and scarring is thought to be due to a pathogenic immune response. This study aimed to identify new associations between tear proteins and trachoma, and to study how they change over time in those with infection. We found that inflammatory chemokines and the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme were increased in scarring, while IL-8 was increased during infection. In a separate cohort study, the same inflammatory chemokines were found to increase before and after detectable infection, and were higher in repeated infections.
