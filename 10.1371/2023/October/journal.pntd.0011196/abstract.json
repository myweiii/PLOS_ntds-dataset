    "Background": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a growing public health threat in Ethiopia. Leishmania aethiopica is the predominant causative organism. Affected individuals develop chronic skin lesions on exposed parts of the body, mostly on the face, which are disfiguring and cause scarring. The effects of CL on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of affected individuals has not been assessed in Ethiopia.",
    "Objective": "To assess HRQoL in adults with active CL at ALERT Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",
    "Methods": "A cross-sectional study was done using the Amharic version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Trained health staff administered the DLQI.",
    "Results": "Three hundred and two adults with active CL participated and all of them exhibited a reduced HRQoL. The median DLQI score was 10 (IQR 8). Almost half of the participants reported very poor HRQoL, 36.4% and 11.3% fell within the very large and extremely large effect categories respectively. DLQI scores were higher (median 18) in patients diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) compared to those with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). The DLQI domain of \u2018work and school\u2019 was the most affected, scoring 73.3% and 66.6% of total possible score for female and male respectively, followed by that of \u2018symptom and feeling\u2019 (at 50.0% and 56.6% for female and male respectively). Men were more affected than women in the domains of \u2018leisure\u2019 (P = 0.002) and \u2018personal relationships\u2019 (P = 0.001). In the multivariate ordinal logistic regression site of lesion, clinical phenotype and age of participant remained associated with significantly poor HRQoL.",
    "Conclusion": "The HRQoL impairment associated with CL is significant. Thus, patient-reported outcome measure should be used to assess the efficacy of treatments along with clinical outcome measures."
