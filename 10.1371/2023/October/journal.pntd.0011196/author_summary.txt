Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an important public health problem in Ethiopia with an estimated incidence up to 50,000 cases per year. CL is predominately due to Leishmania aethiopica. The transmission is by sandflies, with hyraxes being reservoir hosts. Lesions are chronic on the exposed part of the body, commonly on the face. Three main clinical phenotypes are recognized; localized (LCL), muco-cutaneous (MCL), and diffuse (DCL) cutaneous leishmaniasis. The permanent damage and altered anatomy of the skin, nose, eyelids, ears and lips due to scarring is often associated with stigma.
This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the Amharic version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) in adults diagnosed with active CL. Trained interviewers administered the DLQI to participants prior to treatment. Our results show that the impact on HRQoL associated with CL is large. There was no significant difference between men and women, and urban and rural dwellers. Participants with DCL, the more extensive form of CL, had lower HRQoL compared to those with other forms. Those with lesions on their head and neck regions and younger than 50 years (20 to 49 years age group) had significantly lower HRQoL.
The observed HRQoL associated with CL calls for improved support for affected individuals as part of CL care and treatment to improve outcomes. Importantly, patient-reported outcome measures including the DLQI should be used to assess the efficacy of treatments.
