Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a vector borne disease of significant public health importance for over one third of the earthâ€™s population. While JE was first reported in Japan, the most significant outbreaks today are occurring in China and India. Since 2015, Japanese encephalitis vaccine became mandatory for United States military personnel assigned to Japan or South Korea. In an effort to evaluate the risk of JE infection to service members stationed on Okinawa, mosquito surveillance was conducted at four military installations between 2016 and 2021. Over ten thousand mosquitoes were collected, identified to species, and subjected to PCR testing. None of these samples were positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, but further research is still necessary.
