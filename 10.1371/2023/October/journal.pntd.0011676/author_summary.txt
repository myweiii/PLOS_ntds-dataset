Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen that can lead to severe complications for infected humans, including hemorrhagic fever or death. Approximately 390 million people are infected with DENV yearly, and reported cases are rising. Currently, we do not have any effective treatments for DENV infection in humans and primarily rely on mosquito control programs to limit transmission. Insecticide-resistant populations, however, are emerging, and there is an urgent need to develop novel methods to control case numbers. We have reported previously on two populations of Ae. aegypti, the primary vector for DENV, in Cali, Colombia, which are either permissive (Cali-S) or refractory (Cali-MIB) to viral replication. Here we report the use of highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to observe changes in the lipidome of the midguts of these strains after challenge with DENV. Using comparative statistics, we identified lipid features significantly altered in the refractory (Cali-MIB) strain after DENV bloodmeal. The compounds identified in this screen could represent molecular targets for future research into developing stable DENV-resistant Ae. aegypti populations.
