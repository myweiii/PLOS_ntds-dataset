Trachoma is the world’s most frequent cause of blindness from an infectious agent. Trachoma is controlled through the Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement (SAFE) strategy, which delivers azithromycin (AZM) mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic areas. The putative vector Musca sorbens principally reproduce in human faecal matter left in the environment due to open defecation. Ivermectin (IVM) is on the WHO’s essential medicines list, administered against two neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)–onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Ivermectin has an inhibitive effect on insects reproducing in dung.
To assess if IVM could be a viable vector control tool against M. sorbens, this study evaluates existing data from trachoma, onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis mass drug administration (MDA) operations in Ethiopia. Persistent and recrudescent trachoma in evaluation units (EUs) were examined for whether AZM MDA in EUs was accompanied by IVM MDA, and whether co-administration could have controlled the putative vector, unintentionally enhancing trachoma control.
Results suggest that EUs receiving both IVM and AZM MDA had improved control of trachoma, when compared to EUs that have only received AZM MDA.
This initial investigation supports conducting further work into ivermectin’s impact on M. sorbens reproduction through controlled lab and field-based studies.
