Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a neglected parasitic zoonosis of global health significance, poses a persistent threat to humans and imposes substantial economic burdens. Dogs are the main source for human CE infections, although the implementation of praziquantel-based deworming programs targeting dogs, certain regions continue to experience high human CE incidence, highlighting the need for alternative preventive strategies such as dog vaccines. Various recombinant vaccines have exhibited promising efficacy; however, no commercially licensed vaccines are currently available for field use due to two key challenges. Firstly, the existing dog vaccine immunization regimen necessitates three injections to achieve adequate protection. Secondly, the vaccineâ€™s protective efficacy displays considerable variability among the dogs in vaccinated groups. To address these limitations, we employed the Escherichia coli expression system to produce six potential vaccine candidates. Additionally, we introduced a novel immune protocol involving a two-protein combined vaccine administered via a two-time injection in dogs. Employing this immunization protocol, the rEgTIM&rEgANXB3 co-administrated vaccine demonstrated exceptional stability, exhibiting minimal standard deviation and resulting in a notable 71% reduction in worm burden. Implementation of this two-protein combined vaccine with only two injections not only mitigates the CE infection risk to human and livestock but also represents the more cost-effective and practical solution ever for dog owners.
