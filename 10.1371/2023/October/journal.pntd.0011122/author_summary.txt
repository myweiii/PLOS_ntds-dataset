We provide a unique profile of Neotricula aperta habitat in the Mekong River in Laos and Thailand during the transmission of Schistosoma mekongi prior to the construction of any dams on the river. A Place-Based Conceptual Model (PBCM) is described to help identify potential new areas, with suitable habitats for snails and disease transmission. The natural flow regime of the Mekong River prior to any impoundments is described with current updates on the potential impacts of climate change and flow-related snail habitat characteristics, including sediment drift and water quality. Environmental management strategies are outlined, emphasizing environmental flow (e-flow) and habitat models, with the potential to mitigate N. aperta distribution and S. mekongi disease transmission. The PBCM can serve as a template to aggregate and compare historical baseline information (Before dams) with current data (After dams) to create predictive models describing suitable habitats for N. aperta and other snail intermediate hosts and vectors along shoreline areas of the Mekong River continuum. The PBCM model could be a powerful management tool when combined with habitat suitability and e-flow models. Adding schistosome biomarkers currently under development in a One Health context to select possible areas of a river likely to support disease transmission could extend the value of the model.
