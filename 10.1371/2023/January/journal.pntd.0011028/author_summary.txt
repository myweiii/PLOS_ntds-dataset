Alphaviruses such as CHIKV and ONNV, cause severely painful human illnesses and are capable of producing large outbreaks with endemic persistence. Half of the alphavirus lifecycle is in mosquitoes, making it important to understand the molecular interactions between the virus and the vector that influence the capacity of these viruses to spread. This work identifies 24 vector proteins that may be responsible for restricting CHIKV from infecting the subfamily of mosquitoes that ONNV, CHIKVâ€™s closest relative, uses for transmission. This is the first study to identify Anopheles host proteins that interact with alphavirus nonstructural protein 3. Understanding these virus/vector interactions is important for identifying risk factors for viral transmission and potential mechanisms for controlling vector infections by human pathogens.
