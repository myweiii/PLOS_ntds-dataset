    "Background": "There have been significant improvements in Chagas disease therapy and it is now widely accepted that most patients with chronic disease might benefit from therapy. However, there are challenges to monitor drug efficacy and cure for these patients, which are important impediments for current and future therapies. Trypanosoma cruzi-PCR is highly variable while IgG seroconversion takes decades yielding variable results depending on the antigen(s) used for the assay.",
    "Methods and results": "We used the genomic phage display (gPhage) platform to perform a pairwise comparison of antigens and epitopes recognized by twenty individual patients with chronic Chagas disease before and after treatment with benznidazole. In total, we mapped 54,473 T. cruzi epitopes recognized by IgG from individual patients (N = 20) before benznidazole treatment. After treatment, the number of epitopes recognized by all patients was significantly smaller (21,254), a reduction consistent with a decrease in anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Most of these epitopes represent distinct fragments from the same protein and could, therefore, be grouped into 80 clusters of antigens. After three years of treatment with benznidazole, we observed a 64% reduction in the number of clusters of antigens recognized by patients (59 clusters before versus 21 clusters after treatment). The most abundant antigenic clusters recognized by patients correspond to the surface antigen CA-2 (B13) followed by the microtubule associated antigen, which highlights the value of these epitopes in Chagas disease diagnosis. Most importantly, quantitative pairwise comparison of gPhage data allowed for the prediction of patient response to treatment based on PCR status.",
    "Principal finding": "Here, we compiled a list of antigens and epitopes preferentially recognized by Chagas disease patients before and after benznidazole treatment. Next, we observed that gPhage data correlated with patient PCR-status and could, therefore, predict patient response to treatment. Moreover, gPhage results suggest that overall, independent of PCR status, treatment led to a reduction in the presence of T. cruzi-specific antibody levels and the number of antigens and epitopes recognized by these patients.",
    "Conclusion": "The gPhage platform use of unbiased library of antigens, which is different from conventional serological assays that rely on predetermined antigens, is a contribution for the development of novel diagnostic tools for Chagas disease."
