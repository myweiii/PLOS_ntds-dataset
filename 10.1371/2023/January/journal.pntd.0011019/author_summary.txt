Chagas disease, caused by the single-celled parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, can be a life-treating and debilitating illness. Because there is no vaccine and currently the only two available drugs are most effective if used during the early acute stage of the disease, treatment options for infected individuals are limited. Most individuals will only find out they have Chagas disease during a routine medical examination or in blood bank while donating blood, in which cases, they are already chronically infected. At this stage, treatment will not undo clinical manifestations (i.e., cardiomyopathy) but may eliminate the parasite and prevent disease progression. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological assays are the only diagnostic tools available, both with limitations in sensitivity and accuracy. The lack of effective molecular markers thus prevents physicians to determine whether a patient is parasite free and cured from the disease. It also has important implications for the development of new drugs to treat Chagas disease. Here, we studied the reactivity of anti-T. cruzi antibodies in sera from a cohort of 20 patients that underwent treatment for Chagas disease using a new method developed by our group named gPhage. Using gPhage, we scanned all T. cruzi proteins to identify those that were reactive with the antibodies from each individual patient before and after treatment. In sum, gPhage data correlated with patient PCR-status and could, therefore, predict patient response to treatment. It also revealed a new set of T. cruzi proteins that could be useful for the development of future diagnostic methods.
