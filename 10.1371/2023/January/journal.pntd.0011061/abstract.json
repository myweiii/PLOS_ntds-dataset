    "Background": "Few data exist on the distinct cytokine profiles of individuals with malaria coinfections and other diseases. This study focuses on data collation of distinct cytokine profiles between individuals with malaria coinfections and monoinfections to provide evidence for further diagnostic or prognostic studies.",
    "Methods": "We searched five medical databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid, and Scopus, for articles on cytokines in malaria coinfections published from January 1, 1983 to May 3, 2022, after which the distinct cytokine patterns between malaria coinfection and monoinfection were illustrated in heat maps.",
    "Results": "Preliminary searches identified 2127 articles, of which 34 were included in the systematic review. Distinct cytokine profiles in malaria coinfections with bacteremia; HIV; HBV; dengue; filariasis; intestinal parasites; and schistosomiasis were tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), IL-4, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17; TNF, IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, CCL2; IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, G-CSF; IL-1Ra, IL-10, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10; TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10; and TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, CXCL8, respectively.",
    "Conclusion": "This systematic review provides information on distinct cytokine profiles of malaria coinfections and malaria monoinfections. Further studies should investigate whether specific cytokines for each coinfection type could serve as essential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for malaria coinfections."
