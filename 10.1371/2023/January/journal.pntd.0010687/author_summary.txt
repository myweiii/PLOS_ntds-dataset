Despite the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) supported mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, schistosomiasis remains a major global-health concern, especially in resource-constrained countries with inadequate access to safe-water and sanitation, such as Uganda. However, uptake of control interventions including praziquantel MDA is far below the WHO recommended coverage of at-least 75%. We explored community perceptions of schistosomiasis and how these affected control measures in three endemic communities of Mayuge District, Uganda using rapid ethnographic appraisal methods.
The findings indicate that people mainly think schistosomiasis is caused by drinking unboiled lake-water, which resulted in doing nothing to reduce skin contact with lake-water. The schistosomiasis symptom of a swollen stomach was interpreted as ‘ekidada’, a local disease caused by witchcraft, which resulted in not taking praziquantel, and using local herbs instead. Others did not like praziquantel because of its side effects including diarrhoea, and abdominal-pain and ideas that it reduces fertility and life-span. Open defecation was a common practice across all communities. Generally, schistosomiasis was considered hard to prevent since the lake is the major source of water, and social-economic livelihood. All these perceptions negatively affected schistosomiasis control measures. We, therefore, advocate for a contextualized health-education programme, alongside improved access to safe-water and latrines.
