We produced a simple, deterministic model to highlight important principles in the neglected matter of the probability that any trapped tsetse will have originated from various sizes of area around the trapping site. The modelling was kept simple by envisaging the use of just one trap, or a group of only five traps, evenly spaced inside a circular area within a large block of homogeneous habitat and operated for no more than 30 days. In deriving formulae for the sampled area, we found it appropriate to consider only the fliesâ€™ mean daily step length, and the number of days of trapping. The type of trap employed was unimportant. The daily mortality of the adult tsetse population had little effect unless the death rates imposed by control measures were several times greater than the natural rates.
