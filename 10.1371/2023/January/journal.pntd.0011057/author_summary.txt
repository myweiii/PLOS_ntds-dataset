The Brazilian Tityus serrulatus scorpion envenoming is well recognized to be responsible for its painful sting. The pain reported by victims of T. serrulatus has shown variations, varying from mild to severe. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms involving the venom-derived toxins and their relationship a role in causing nociception. This research pioneer shows how each T. serrulatus classes of neurotoxins (Ts1: β-NaTx; Ts5: α-NaTx; Ts6: α-KTx; Ts8 and Ts19: β-KTx) are involved in the spontaneous nociception. The new knowledge may contribute to a better overall understanding of the mechanisms underlying T. serrulatus painful envenomings.
