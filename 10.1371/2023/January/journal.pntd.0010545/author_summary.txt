Chagas’ disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is prevalent in low-income African, Asian, and American countries and spread through the rest of the world through migrations infecting about 8 million people and causing 10 000 deaths per year. Currently, the only drugs approved for treating Chagas’ disease have various side effects. Identifying proteins of the parasite that can limit its activity can help the development of new and more effective drugs. In this context, the cytochrome bc1 of Trypanosoma cruzi has been identified as a promising drug target. However, it is unclear how certain drugs affect cytochrome bc1 biological activity. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to analyze the impact of specific small molecules on protein conformational changes that may be related to cytochrome bc1’s biological function. This manuscript presents a computational approach that could identify small-molecule lead compounds and distinguish between true and false cytochrome b inhibitors.
