Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne disease caused by a parasite called Leishmania that affects more than 1 million people worldwide each year and mostly causes chronic skin ulcers. The first line treatment continues to be systemic antimonials, despite drawbacks such as numerous daily injections and toxic side effects. Some groups, including children and older adults, are usually not included in clinical trials and, therefore, specific treatment guidance for them is uncertain due to the scarcity of robust evidence. RedeLEISH, a Latin American network of leishmaniasis researchers, conducted a retrospective study of the medical records of children ≤ 10 years of age and adults ≥ 60 years of age, treated between 2014 and 2018 in ten CL referral centers in the region, with the aim of learning about and documenting the effectiveness and tolerability of routine antileishmanial treatments, and ultimately contributing to improving the management of these patient groups. Our findings, based on 1,325 eligible patients’ records (589 adults ≥ 60 years of age and 736 children ≤ 10 years of age), showed that in both age groups the disease presents predominantly in a mild form, but that the most commonly used treatment, systemic antimonials, has limited effectiveness. This supports and encourages greater use of local therapies, and other treatment alternatives in these special populations. The results of this study also highlight the need to develop strategies for better follow-up of routine CL treatment and determination of effectiveness, as lack of such information was the principal criterion for exclusion of patients screened for eligibility, and less than 50% of eligible patients had information on two or more follow-up visits.
